Notably, D3 and D4 exhibit substantial enhancements in Macro-F1 scores when the percentage transitions from 0 to 0.4, suggesting a greater dependence on document-level knowledge due to their unbalanced label distributions. \n\nFurther analysis [8] involves ablation tests to understand the effects of transferring different layers (embedding, LSTM, output) from the document-level model to the aspect-level model.\n\n![This table shows the performance of different model settings with different layers transferred from document-level to aspect-level models.](image4)\n\nThe results indicate that transferring the LSTM and embedding layers proves more beneficial than transferring the output layer, which is typically task-specific. Transferring the embedding layer shows particular effectiveness for datasets D3 and D4.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating document-level knowledge through pretraining and multi-task learning significantly enhances aspect-level sentiment classification performance. The impact is particularly noticeable in datasets with unbalanced class distributions. The transfer of embedding and LSTM layers from document-level to aspect-level models proves most beneficial. \n"}

[10] indicates that \"GEM outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting.\" This means that GEM is better at retaining information from previously learned domains while adapting to the new domain. [12] explains that GEM achieves this by \"keep[ing] a small number of samples from the source domains\" and applying \"a constraint...on the gradient to prevent the loss on the stored samples from increasing.\" Conversely, EWC uses a different approach.

[2] provides an example: \"knowledge about  people, area, price range , and  day  slots are successfully transferred from the other four domains.\" This successful transfer is attributed to these slots being present in both the source and target domains.\n\nHowever, when dealing with slots unique to a specific domain, the model struggles to maintain high accuracy. As highlighted in [2], \"For unseen slots that only appear in one domain, it is very hard for our model to track correctly.\"  The provided example showcases this challenge with slots like 'parking,' 'stars,' and 'internet' exclusive to the hotel domain and 'food' to the restaurant domain. \n\n![Zero-shot performance of TRADE on different domains](image2)\n\nIn essence, fine-tuning strategies like GEM prove more effective than EWC and naive fine-tuning in mitigating catastrophic forgetting during domain adaptation.

Conversely, Downstream earnings remained relatively stable, suggesting less susceptibility to commodity price swings. \n\n**Conclusion**: Chevron's Upstream segment is significantly more profitable but also more volatile than its Downstream segment, primarily due to its reliance on fluctuating crude oil prices.

In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face increasing cash outflows to reduce an underfunding of our pension plans in these countries. Regular asset liability studies are performed for major pension plans to implement an investment strategy to mitigate liability risks and reduce funded status volatility. \n\n[7] In the United States, defined benefit plans are sponsored by Siemens Healthineers, which have been frozen to new entrants and future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. \n\n![The table shows the discount rates for Germany and the United States for 2021 and 2020](image1)\n![The table shows the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of defined benefit obligations for Germany and the United States](image3)\n\nSiemens Healthineers uses different actuarial assumptions and faces different financial situations in Germany and the United States.

Although we have constantly striven to nurture  a corporate culture where all employees including  women can demonstrate their full potential across  our operation around the world, we recognize that  gender diversity has been an issue, particularly at  Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. [3]\n\nToyota is committed to creating a more inclusive workplace with equal opportunities for women across all levels, as stated in [11]. We are continuing initiatives that promote women’s participation and  advancement in the workplace so that the percentage of positions held by  women, from initial hiring to executive positions, will consistently increase  across our operation. [11]\n\nThe company implements various initiatives globally, with a particular emphasis on regions like Belgium and South Africa. \n\n![Summary of the initiatives to support female employee in different regions](image7)\n\nFor example, Toyota Motor Europe in Belgium has implemented several initiatives, including company-wide events for International Women's Day, support for working couples (home-working, part-time, finding employment for spouses), and female career development programs. In South Africa, Toyota focuses on leadership workshops to promote women in the workplace and sets specific employment targets.  \n\n![Percentage of women in different positions at Toyota global](image1)\n\nDespite these efforts that Toyota takes, the percentage of women in leadership roles, especially at the director level, remains relatively low, as shown in this chart.\n\nToyota recognizes diversity and inclusion as crucial aspects of its business infrastructure, aiming to create an attractive workplace for employees of all backgrounds [6]. Toyota’s strength lies in our capacity to respect our  employees’ abilities to think and promote transfor­ mation involving every member. Toward the  transformation from an automotive company into  a mobility company to leverage recent technical  innovations centered on CASE, this capacity is  growing increasingly important as we continue to  create innovations steadily in existing areas while  taking on challenges in new areas. Amid such an  environment, Toyota considers diversity and  inclusion to be one of the key elements of our  business infrastructure, and we are working to  create an attractive workplace where employees  with wide-ranging skills and values, irrespective of  gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity, creed,  religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability,  marital status or the presence of children, can  demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and achieve  self-realization. In order to become a company  that is needed and chosen by society, we are  promoting collaboration with a wide variety of  partners both inside and outside the company  while putting into practice the values Toyota has  embraced since our founding, such as the attitude  of humbly learning and taking on challenges from  the customer’s viewpoint. [6]\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota actively promotes female employee participation and diversity through global and region-specific initiatives, including workshops, career development programs, and inclusive hiring practices, aiming to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace. \n"}

As a result of the Closing Agreement, we received in 2018, we determined at that time that our remaining California research and development credit carry forwards (“CA R&D Credit”) no longer met the threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, consistent with our position at December 31, 2018, we have established a full valuation allowance against our CA R&D Credit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the valuation allowance related to our CA R&D Credit is  $\\S71$   million. We will reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance. \n![Balance Sheet as of Dec 31, 2019 and 2018](image1)\nThe R&D to asset ratio is not provided in the context. The text mentions a valuation allowance of $71 million for R&D credits and the balance sheet doesn't provide a breakdown of R&D expenses.

The ﬁrst thing to note is that the model makes better use of  DOC-BASED  connections than  MATCH  or COREF  connections.

[6] For example, MMMU requires applying concepts such as \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to arrive at the solution, underscoring its focus on expert-level reasoning.  [2]  This is evident in the diverse range of subjects and subfields covered by the MMMU dataset, as illustrated in this visual representation: ![MMMU Dataset Subject Coverage](image1)\n\nThe implication of MMMU's expansive breadth and depth is that it offers a more rigorous and challenging evaluation framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

[12] This highlights the importance of MMMU as a benchmark for driving further progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning in LMMs. [12]\n\nIn conclusion, MMMU's broader and deeper scope, incorporating expert-level knowledge and diverse visual formats, provides a more demanding evaluation for LMMs, pushing the development of models with greater multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities. \n"}

This identifies entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement [2, 12].\n\n![Logic-LM uses symbolic language to represent the problem and offloads reasoning to external symbolic solvers.](image5)\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**: A symbolic solver, like a logic programming engine, performs inference on the symbolic representation created in the previous step [2].  The choice of solver depends on the type of logic required for the problem [6].  Examples include Pyke for deductive reasoning, Prover9 for First-Order Logic, and Z3 for analytical reasoning [6].\n![An example of how LOGIC-LM translates natural language sentences into symbolic formulations for different problem types and solves them using specific solvers.](image6)\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**:  An LLM or rule-based interpreter translates the symbolic answer from the previous stage back into natural language [2]. \n\nThis framework leverages the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic solvers [12].  LLMs excel at understanding and manipulating natural language, enabling them to formulate complex logical problems into symbolic representations [9, 12]. Deterministic symbolic solvers then execute the reasoning process, ensuring logical faithfulness and transparency [2, 12]. \n\nThe LOGIC-LM model also employs a self-refinement process to improve accuracy [12]. The system uses error messages from the symbolic solver to revise the initial symbolic formulation, iteratively refining it until a solution is reached [12]. \n\nLOGIC-LM significantly outperforms stand-alone LLMs and chain-of-thought prompting methods in logical reasoning tasks, as demonstrated by its performance on five datasets: ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, FOLIO, LogicalDeduction, and AR-LSAT [10].  On average, LOGIC-LM achieves a 39.2% improvement over standard prompting and an 18.4% increase compared to chain-of-thought prompting when using an LLM [10].\n\n![Performance comparison between CoT and Logic-LM using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the FOLIO dataset over different reasoning depths.](image2)\n\n![Logic-LM consistently outperforms standard and CoT prompting methods across various LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) on multiple logical reasoning datasets.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, LOGIC-LM effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and symbolic solvers to achieve robust logical reasoning capabilities.

We have identified 22 categories that adequately represent a cross-section of entities one might encounter in daily life. These categories include  landmark, painting, sculpture, food, fruit, vegetable, mammal, amphibian, insect, fish, bird, reptile, celebrity, instrument, plant, electronics, tool, transportation, sport, book, household, and car .

Then the entity list underwent filtering by cross-referencing each entry with its corresponding Wikipedia page. Entities lacking valid Wikipedia pages were sub- sequently removed from the list. For each corre- sponding entity, images were sourced from Cre- ative Commons (CC). Further filtering was con- ducted by removing entities that didn’t have a suffi- cient number of images obtained via Google Image Search engine. The collected metadata was stored in a CSV file containing essential information such as image URLs, source page URLs, renamed im- age names, and the corresponding Wikipedia page URLs. After filtering, the final number of entities in the SnapNTell dataset is 7,568.

This is because offspring inherit one allele from each parent, and there is an equal chance of inheriting either allele. \nThe genotypic ratio of this cross is 1 (PP): 2 (Pp): 1 (pp).

It provides a historical perspective through descriptive data, often presented in the form of reports, dashboards, or alerts [4, image4].  \n\n**Analysis:**\n\nBuilding upon the foundation laid by reporting, analysis delves deeper into *why* something occurred [image4].  It seeks to extract meaningful insights from the data, enabling forward-looking decisions. Analysis transitions from simply presenting information to uncovering actionable insights [image4].\n\n**Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics:**\n\nThis progression is aptly illustrated in the following image:\n\n![{The image depicts a hierarchical model of business intelligence and analytics, illustrating the evolution from basic reporting to advanced optimization.}](image7)\n\n- **Business intelligence** heavily relies on reporting to answer fundamental questions about past performance. This provides a retrospective view essential for understanding trends and patterns.  \n- **Business analytics** leverages the insights derived from analysis to make informed decisions, driving action, and ultimately, creating value [7]. This signifies a shift from understanding the past to predicting the future and optimizing outcomes [7].  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nReporting lays the groundwork by providing a clear picture of the past. Analysis then leverages this foundation to extract insights that drive informed decision-making, propelling businesses from understanding “what” to deciding “why” and ultimately achieving desired outcomes. \n"}
