These studies delve into areas classified based on how residential development capacity was altered through rezoning [3]. For instance, some areas saw their capacity increase (upzoned), while others saw decreases (downzoned) or only contextual changes [3].\n\nUnderstanding these changes sometimes involves looking at the physical environment of these neighborhoods, which can feature a mix of architectural styles and urban elements. A street view might show the blend of buildings and street life in a residential area. For example, a street view might depict two vehicles parked, alongside buildings of varying styles, trees, and other greenery, reflecting the character of a neighborhood [image6 depicts a street view with two vehicles parked]. The rate of new construction in such community districts is also a factor in assessing the impact of zoning [2].\n\nFurthermore, researchers examine the demographic makeup of the census tracts containing rezoned lots to see how it compares to the city median [1], [9]. This data can be presented visually to highlight potential correlations between zoning actions and neighborhood composition. A bar chart might illustrate the median racial and ethnic percentages of residents in areas with different types of rezoning compared to the city as a whole [image1 is a bar chart showing median racial/ethnic demographics for different rezoning types]. This chart categorizes census tracts based on the type of rezoning – upzoned, downzoned, or contextual-only rezoned lots – and displays the percentages for five demographic groups for each category, alongside the city-wide median [image1 is a bar chart showing median racial/ethnic demographics for different rezoning types].

For instance, 52% of Latinos aged 65 and older believe their children will be better off, while 75% of those aged 18 to 29 and 76% of those aged 30 to 49 hold this view [8, image3].\n![The bar chart indicates that 52% of Hispanic adults aged 65 and older expect their children to be better off financially, significantly lower than the 75% to 76% seen in younger age groups.](image3)\nWhile having a positive view of one's current financial situation is linked to being significantly more likely to expect *their own* family's finances to improve over the next year [4, 5], and expectations for personal financial improvement vary based on current financial condition [image8], the provided text and images do not directly show how a Hispanic adult's *current* financial situation impacts their specific expectations for *their children's* financial future.\n\nEducational attainment influences Hispanic adults' financial expectations for their children, with high school graduates being the most optimistic, while the provided information does not explicitly detail the direct impact of current financial situation on these specific expectations for children."}

For Republicans and Republican leaners, the view is considerably different, with 62% believing a voter should only be allowed to vote early or absentee if they have a documented reason, compared to just 38% who support open early or absentee voting [image1]. This perspective within the Republican party is particularly strong among conservatives, where 70% feel documented reasons are necessary, while moderate and liberal Republicans are about evenly split [10], with 49% saying documented reasons should be required and 51% saying they should not be [image1], [10].\n\nExperience with different voting methods in the 2020 election also appears to correlate with views on no-excuse early and absentee voting, especially among Republicans [1], [5]. Roughly a third (34%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters said they voted absentee or by mail in 2020, compared with 58% of Democrats and Democratic leaners [7]. Republicans who voted early or absentee in November are more likely than those who voted in person to favor no-excuse absentee or early voting [2]. Specifically, while about half (52%) of Republicans who voted absentee or by mail favor no-excuse absentee or early voting, only about a third (35%) of early, in-person GOP voters and just 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day say the same [11], [12]. Among Democrats, differences based on 2020 voting method are only slight [11].\n\nRegarding proposals for congressional redistricting, more adults overall approve than disapprove of requiring commissions with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans to draw maps instead of state legislatures [1], [8], [9]. Nearly half (49%) approve of this proposal, compared to 13% who disapprove and 38% who are unsure [1], [9]. There are differences along party lines, however. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to favor replacing state legislatures with independent commissions [1]. While 59% of Democrats and Democratic leaners approve of the proposal for independent, bipartisan commissions, only 38% of Republicans and Republican leaners approve [image3]. Republicans and Republican leaners are somewhat more likely to disapprove (19%) than Democrats (8%) and are also more likely to be unsure (42% vs. 32%) [4], [image3]. The proposal entails that committees composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans would be responsible for determining the state’s congressional maps [6], [9].\n\nIn summary, Democrats overwhelmingly favor open early and absentee voting and are more likely to approve of bipartisan independent redistricting commissions, while Republicans are more likely to favor requiring documented reasons for absentee voting, with views influenced by their 2020 voting experience and ideology, and are less likely to approve of independent redistricting commissions, showing higher levels of disapproval and uncertainty."}

A significant shift in importance leading up to the 2022 midterms was seen with abortion, which rose substantially from 42% in March to 57% in August, following the Supreme Court's decision [2], [3]. Supreme Court appointments are also a very important issue for their voting decision [5].

Women are much more likely than men to report experiencing gender discrimination at work and consider it a major barrier [3]. Issues include pay gaps and unequal treatment stemming from gender stereotypes [3]. While men value promotion opportunities more, women disproportionately report discrimination as hindering their advancement, which could be seen as a significant barrier regardless of how much they value promotion compared to other factors. Furthermore, a lack of encouragement for girls from an early age is considered a major reason for the limited diversity in STEM by many Americans [5], with suggestions that K-8 teaching needs to be designed to be more interesting and accessible to girls, explicitly discussing the need for more women in STEM [7] [10].

The scarcity of VC money in Europe, partly due to a smaller investor base compared to the US [4] and lower fund commitments in recent years [10], has led to low entry valuations but also driven up capital efficiency and allowed investors to be more selective [11]. This environment has led to more checks being written to Limited Partners (LPs) in Europe than ever before [12].\n\nOver the last 24 months, European venture-backed liquidity events have totaled $15 billion, representing a substantial volume of exits, occurring in a market characterized by lower investment levels but higher capital efficiency and exit multiples compared to the USA."}

This system makes inferences based on the logic programming language [10]. Different symbolic formulations, such as LP (Logical Programming) for deductive reasoning, are used and mapped to specific solvers [8], as summarized in a table detailing problem types and their corresponding solvers [image5].\n\nIn this paper, the symbolic solver used to implement the logic programming module shown in Figure 1 is Pyke."}

These methods offer unique ways to retrieve relevant information, each with specific advantages and trade-offs [4].\n\nThe tree traversal method operates layer-by-layer, beginning by selecting the top-*k* root nodes based on their similarity to the query embedding [10]. It then proceeds to the next layer, considering the children of the selected nodes and again choosing the top-*k* most relevant ones, repeating this process until the leaf nodes are reached [10]. The text from all selected nodes is then concatenated to form the retrieved context [10].\n\n![The pseudocode for the Tree Traversal Algorithm outlines steps for selecting top-k nodes layer by layer based on query similarity.](image6)\n\nThis algorithm involves steps for initializing the current layer, looping through layers, calculating scores for nodes, selecting the top-k nodes in each layer, updating the current set of nodes, and finally returning the union of selected nodes. Based on the provided pseudocode description, it comprises approximately 12 lines.\n\nIn contrast, the collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones [6].\n\n![The pseudocode for the Collapsed Tree Algorithm flattens the tree, calculates relevance scores for all nodes, sorts them, and then selects nodes based on relevance until a maximum token limit is reached.](image8)\n\nThis approach first flattens the entire tree, calculates a score for each node based on the query, and then sorts the nodes [8]. It then iterates through the sorted nodes, adding them to the result list until a specified maximum token limit is reached [8]. Looking at its pseudocode, this algorithm contains roughly 15 lines, including flattening the tree, scoring and sorting nodes, and selecting them based on token limits.\n\nComparing the described pseudocode listings, the collapsed tree algorithm has more lines."}

This issue is depicted across various datasets, including PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where random selection performs comparably or better than several active learning strategies at lower image budgets ![{The image consists of four plots demonstrating the performance of various active learning query strategies in terms of AUC against the number of images used for training, across different datasets.}](image1). The caption explains that this is often due to selection bias, where active learning strategies may not adequately sample all classes [image1].\n\nOne of the primary causes attributed to this cold start problem is a biased query, where active learning tends to select data skewed towards specific classes, particularly problematic in unbalanced datasets common in medical imaging [12]. In contrast, random sampling is generally considered a baseline because it is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) to the entire data distribution, which is beneficial when using limited training data [4]. The lack of label diversity is hypothesized to be an important criterion [12]. As shown on the PathMNIST dataset, while random selection results in a relatively uniform distribution across classes, active strategies like VAAL show a clear bias, heavily favoring certain classes while ignoring others, a problem alleviated by our strategy which selects more minority classes while retaining major class distribution ![{This image is a bar graph depicting the label diversity of different querying strategies on the PathMNIST dataset.}](image7).\n\nThe presence of label diversity is crucial [1, 10]. Experiments across three MedMNIST datasets and CIFAR-10-LT show that most existing active querying strategies become more performant and robust when label diversity is enforced [1, 5]. Adding diversity is a significant enhancement to most querying strategies, improving AUC scores in both low and high budget regimes for both random and active querying strategies [7]. Visual evidence further confirms this, illustrating how incorporating label diversity into strategies like BALD, Consistency, Margin, VAAL, and Entropy leads to improved AUC scores across different MedMNIST datasets ![{The image shows a series of graphs demonstrating the impact of label diversity on the performance of different active querying strategies across three datasets within MedMNIST: PathMNIST, OrganMNIST, and BloodMNIST.}](image5).\n\nThe biased nature of initial active learning queries, leading to a lack of diversity, is a key factor in the cold start problem shown in image1. Figures showing the impact of diversity (image5) and the biased class distribution of active strategies compared to random (image7) directly relate to and explain the phenomenon observed in image1.\n\nTwo figures convey similar messages as the first figure."}

The best performance, achieving an AP of 40.6, is obtained when combining class, L1, and GIoU losses. ![Table showing AP results for different combinations of class, ℓ₁, and GIoU loss components](image7)\n\nDifferent configurations of positional encodings and the inclusion of GIoU loss significantly affect the Average Precision in the DETR model."}

One significant advantage of ProgramFC is its ability to decompose complex claims into simpler steps using a program, which enhances reasoning accuracy [10]. This decomposition strategy is particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks, showing a substantial improvement for 4-hop claims [10].\n\n![The table presents a comparison of few-shot learning models across different datasets and settings.](image1)\n\nWhen comparing ProgramFC to the FLAN-T5 model, which is an improved version of T5 fine-tuned on various tasks [7], we see that ProgramFC, even when using the same FLAN-T5 model for sub-task functions, outperforms the baseline of directly verifying claims with FLAN-T5 [10]. This performance gap widens as the complexity of the required reasoning increases [10, 11]. For example, on the HOVER dataset, ProgramFC shows increasingly better performance compared to baselines, including FLAN-T5, as the hops increase from two to four [11]. While Chain-of-thought prompting with models like InstructGPT (often compared in similar contexts) performs well on HOVER 2-hop and FEVEROUS, ProgramFC outperforms it on HOVER 3-hop and 4-hop [4].\n\n![The image consists of three line graphs comparing the F1 scores of two fact-checking approaches, FLAN-T5 (blue line) and PROGRAM FC (green line), across different model sizes: FLAN-T5-small (80M), FLAN-T5-base (250M), FLAN-large (780M), FLAN-T5-XL (3B), and FLAN-T5-XXL (11B).](image5)\n\nFurther analysis comparing ProgramFC with FLAN-T5 using different model sizes (small to XXL) reveals that program-guided reasoning is especially effective with smaller models [6]. As model size decreases, the performance of end-to-end FLAN-T5 drops significantly, whereas this trend is less pronounced for ProgramFC [6]. ProgramFC using a small FLAN-T5-small (80M parameters) as sub-task solvers can achieve performance comparable to the much larger (137x) FLAN-T5-XXL (11B) model performing end-to-end reasoning for 4-hop claims [6]. This suggests that reasoning programs alleviate the demands on the underlying language model [6].\n\nIn terms of retrieving relevant evidence, ProgramFC, which uses an iterative step-by-step BM25 retriever, significantly enhances retrieval performance compared to the one-step BM25 retriever used in baselines [3].

The use of reasoning programs facilitates more accurate reasoning, particularly for complex claims, showing improvements of 14.9% in the gold evidence setting and 6.7% in the open-book setting for 4-hop claims [5].\n\nProgramFC demonstrates promising performance on HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets using a few-shot in-context learning approach with no additional training [8].

ProgramFC using a small FLAN-T5 model (80M parameters) can achieve comparable performance to a much larger 11B parameter FLAN-T5 model for 4-hop claims [7].\n![The graph shows ProgramFC consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 across different model sizes and increasing hops (2-hop, 3-hop, 4-hop) on the HOVER dataset, indicating its effectiveness in handling complex reasoning even with smaller sub-task solvers.](image3)\nComparing ProgramFC to other state-of-the-art models like InstructGPT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, CoT sometimes scores higher on less complex tasks like HOVER 2-hop and FEVEROUS, but ProgramFC performs better on more complex HOVER 3-hop and 4-hop tasks [10].\n![The table compares the performance of various models including InstructGPT variants, Codex, FLAN-T5, and ProgramFC on HOVER (2, 3, 4-hop) and FEVEROUS datasets, showing InstructGPT CoT performing best on several tasks while ProgramFC excels on the more complex 3-hop and 4-hop HOVER tasks.](image6)\nIn open-domain settings, reasoning programs can enhance evidence retrieval. ProgramFC's iterative step-by-step retrieval based on the program outperforms a one-step BM25 retriever across all datasets, with the largest improvement seen on HOVER 4-hop claims (37.1%) [3, 12]. This is because iterative retrieval can reveal new information during the reasoning process that is not present in the initial claim [12].\n![The bar chart shows that ProgramFC achieves higher retrieval recall compared to one-step retrieval across all tested HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets.](image1)\n\nRegarding error trends, an analysis was conducted on samples where ProgramFC made incorrect predictions [6]. Importantly, no syntax errors were found in the generated programs, indicating that the generator effectively produces executable programs [1]. The errors are primarily classified as semantic errors or incorrect execution [6]. Semantic errors include issues like incorrect arguments, program structure, or sub-task calls [6]. As the complexity of claims increases (from 2-hop to 4-hop), the proportion of semantic errors significantly increases, particularly structural errors, which highlights the challenge of generating correct step-by-step reasoning strategies for long-chain reasoning [11].\n![The table displays the distribution of error types (Syntax, Semantic, Incorrect execution) and their subcategories across 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims, showing that semantic errors, especially structural ones, become more prevalent as claim complexity increases.](image7)\nIncorrect execution errors also occur, where the program itself is correct, but the prediction is wrong due to issues during execution [6]. While ProgramFC shows strong performance, generating programs for implicit complex claims requiring world or commonsense knowledge remains a challenge and is an area for future work [2, 9].\n\nIn summary, ProgramFC generally outperforms end-to-end models like FLAN-T5 by decomposing complex claims and shows competitive performance compared to Chain-of-Thought prompting, especially on more complex tasks, while its main error types are semantic errors and incorrect execution, with semantic errors increasing with claim complexity."}

For instance, models fine-tuned on single-hop data generally see a decline in performance as the required reasoning depth increases from 2-hop to 4-hop tasks on HOVER, as shown by models like BERT-FC, ListT5, RoBERTa-NLI, DeBERTav3-NLI, and MULTIVERS [image3].\n\n![The table presents experimental results for different models on two datasets: HOVER and FEVEROUS.

PROGRAM FC achieves the highest score of 68.18 at 11B, compared to FLAN-T5's 63.39. Overall, PROGRAM FC consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 across all tested scenarios and model sizes.](image2)\n\nAn analysis of errors in PROGRAM FC's predictions on HOVER datasets (2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop) reveals a significant shift in error types as complexity increases [8].

Semantic errors account for 29% of errors at 2-hop but jump to 77% at 4-hop, with structural errors rising from 19% to 57% across the same hop range, highlighting the difficulty in generating appropriate long-chain reasoning strategies for more complex claims [11], [image4].\n\nAs reasoning depth increases from 2-hop to 4-hop, model performance generally decreases for many models, while error types shift from predominantly incorrect execution to semantic errors, especially structural ones, in program-based approaches."}

This discrepancy reveals models' difficulty handling the NEI class [10].\n\nExamining specific models like InstructGPT and GPT-4 in the zero-shot 3-class setting shows they struggle with accurately predicting the NEI class [7] ![Confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 zero-shot 3-class performance](image7). InstructGPT tends to be less confident, often classifying supported and refuted claims as NEI, while GPT-4 is overconfident, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as supported or refuted [7] ![Confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 zero-shot 3-class performance](image7). The challenging nature of determining if a claim is verifiable is a key issue [7]. Complex cases requiring extensive reasoning or deep understanding of research findings often lead models to default to the ‘uncertain’ NEI label when they incorrectly predict supported or refuted claims as NEI [8]. The inclusion of the NEI class tends to diminish models' confidence, causing a shift in predictions towards NEI [10]. Overall, even advanced models like InstructGPT and GPT-4 struggle significantly on SciTAB compared to human performance, particularly in the 3-class setting [12] ![The table compares the performance of various large language models (LLMs) across different categories on a classification task, also including human performance.](image1).\n\nThe primary reasons for refuted claims are incorrect calculations and approximation words, while for NEI claims, it's insufficient evidence and lack of domain knowledge, and these difficulties, particularly with the NEI class, significantly degrade model performance in zero-shot 3-class classification."}

The development of Advanced RAG and Modular RAG directly responds to these specific shortcomings [4].\n\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG, primarily focusing on enhancing retrieval quality through pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies [1]. This includes refining indexing techniques using approaches like a sliding window, fine-grained segmentation, and incorporating metadata [1].

It offers remarkable adaptability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration, moving beyond the fixed structures of its predecessors [3]. This flexibility is expanded by integrating new modules or adjusting the interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its applicability across different tasks [3, 11].

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like LLaVA excel at classifying fine-grained categories due to their knowledge, their performance can decline as the number of categories increases or when distinguishing subtle differences [7], [8], [11]. RAR addresses this by using a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to manage categories beyond the MLLM's context window and then uses the MLLM for ranking [11].\n\nIn fine-grained visual recognition tasks, RAR, specifically the RAR (LLaVA1.5) configuration, demonstrates significant improvements over baselines like CLIP+KNN and LLaVA1.5 fine-tuning [3], [12].\n![The table compares the performance of different methods on image recognition tasks across various datasets, divided into Common and Fine-Grained categories, showing RAR (LLaVA1.5) performance for 1 to 16 shots with positive deltas over LLaVA1.5 Finetuning.](image2)\nAcross 11 datasets, including fine-grained ones, RAR (LLaVA1.5) shows notable increases in classification accuracy.

To address these limitations and enhance zero-shot recognition for datasets with extensive and fine-grained vocabularies, the Retrieving And Ranking augmented method (RAR) for MLLMs is introduced [8]. RAR integrates a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to store explicit memory and uses MLLMs during inference to rank retrieved candidates and make final predictions [8, 10].\n\nThe method has been tested across various benchmarks, including zero-shot object recognition on two datasets with vast vocabularies, LVIS and V3Det [1, 6]. Our findings show that RAR notably enhances performance. RAR achieves a 6.4% improvement on the LVIS dataset and a 1.5% gain on the V3Det dataset in zero-shot object recognition performance [1]. Specifically on V3Det, which contains 13,204 distinct classes, RAR (InternLM-XC2) shows a commendable 1.5 percentage point improvement in overall average precision (AP_all) over the CLIP baseline [4].

To direct the model's focus, non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest are blurred [5]. This pre-processing is essential for handling objects that may be small and varied in position within the image [5].\n\n![The diagram shows pre-processing by cropping and resizing object regions from bounding boxes in an image for detection datasets.](image7)\n\nAfter pre-processing and extracting image embeddings from these cropped regions [Image7], instead of image-to-image retrieval, the system employs image-to-text retrieval, leveraging CLIP's inherent image-text interaction capabilities [12]. The image embedding from the input image or processed region is used to query a constructed memory index, identifying the top-$k$ category names most similar to the image content [10, 12, Image7]. This preliminary retrieval step narrows down the potential categories from a vast possibility space to a more relevant set [10]. The multimodal retriever creates and stores embeddings for efficient querying of a large external memory [11, Image6].\n\n![The diagram illustrates a pipeline with a Multimodal Retriever component that encodes and indexes features into memory and a Retrieving & Ranking component that uses MLLMs to rank retrieved categories for final prediction.](image6)\n\nFollowing the retrieval of the top-$k$ category labels, these candidates, along with the image embedding, are passed to the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through a ranking prompt [7]. The MLLMs then take on the critical role of ranking these retrieved class names [1, 4, 7, 9]. By combining their extensive internal knowledge base with the retrieved information [7], and employing advanced linguistic and semantic analysis [4], the MLLMs assess the contextual appropriateness of each candidate name with the input image to make the final prediction [1, 7, 9]. While the initial retrieval provides relevant candidates, the MLLM's ranking refines this list for greater accuracy [4, 7], which can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the MLLMs to improve their ranking ability and adherence to prompt formats [3]. This reranking process is visually demonstrated for objects detected in an image, where initially retrieved names are refined to yield the correct label [Image2].\n\n![The table shows how initial retrieved names for objects are reranked to find the correct class names in a zero-shot object recognition task.](image2)\n\nThe system processes objects for recognition in detection datasets by first pre-processing image regions based on bounding boxes, performing image-to-text retrieval to get top-k candidate categories, and then using MLLMs to rank these candidates for the final prediction."}

The core idea is to ground reasoning on higher-level concepts to reduce errors in intermediate steps [12].\n\nOn Knowledge QA tasks like TimeQA and SituatedQA, Step-Back Prompting demonstrates strong performance [8, 11]. For TimeQA, the baseline models struggled, with GPT-4 achieving 45.6% and PaLM-2L 41.5% [3]. Standard prompting techniques like CoT and TDB showed little improvement [3, 10]. Retrieval augmentation (RAG) significantly improved accuracy to 57.4%, highlighting the factual nature of the task [3]. Crucially, augmenting the baseline model with S TEP -B ACK + RAG resulted in a remarkable accuracy of 68.7% on TimeQA [3].

When combined with RAG, Step-Back + RAG fixes 21.6% of RAG errors and introduces a low 6.3% of new errors to RAG [6]. This suggests that abstraction is effective before attempting to answer the original question [6]. Error analysis on TimeQA [2] shows that Reasoning and RAG are the dominating error sources for Step-Back [7].

On Multi-Hop Reasoning tasks like MuSiQue, PaLM-2L's baseline performance is relatively low (35.5%) compared to GPT-4 (38.5%), indicating the task's difficulty [1]. However, with the addition of S TEP -B ACK P ROMPTING, the performance significantly improves.\n\n![The table compares different methods and their performance on two datasets, MuSiQue and StrategyQA.](image5)\nSpecifically, PaLM-2L + S TEP -B ACK achieves 42.8% on MuSiQue, surpassing GPT-4 [1, image5]. The combination of S TEP -B ACK and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) further boosts performance on MuSiQue, reaching 42.8% [1, image5]. For StrategyQA, a binary classification task with higher baselines (PaLM-2L 82.8%, GPT-4 78.3%), S TEP -B ACK also leads to the best performance at 86.4%, again outperforming GPT-4 [1, image5].\n\nOn Knowledge QA tasks like TimeQA and SituatedQA, which are factually intensive [10], using retrieval augmentation (RAG) is particularly helpful [10, 11]. While baseline models and standard prompting like CoT and TDB show limited improvement on TimeQA [10], RAG alone boosts PaLM-2L accuracy to 57.4% [10]. The S TEP -B ACK + RAG approach leverages the step-back question to enable more reliable retrieval, achieving a remarkable 68.7% accuracy on TimeQA [10, 11].\n\n![The table shows the performance of different methods on four benchmarks: TimeQA, TQA Easy, TQA Hard, and SituatedQA.](image4)\nCompared to GPT-4's 45.6% on TimeQA, PaLM-2L + S TEP -B ACK + RAG demonstrates a significant lead [10, image4].

Analysis on TimeQA shows that more than half of the errors are due to reasoning issues, and 45% are due to failure in retrieving the right information despite the step-back abstraction making retrieval easier [5]. Errors are classified into types such as Reasoning Error, RAG (retrieval failure), Scoring Error, and StepBack (failure in generating a helpful step-back question) [9]. On TimeQA, Reasoning Error and RAG failures are prominent [image1 right].\n\n![The image contains two main parts related to error analysis in high-school physics using Step-Back Prompting on the MMLU dataset.](image8)\nFor tasks requiring complex reasoning like MMLU Physics, the reasoning step remains a bottleneck [6]. Error analysis on MMLU Physics reveals that more than 90% of errors occur during the reasoning phase [6]. Among the error types during reasoning, Reasoning Error itself is the dominant class (0.55), followed by Math Error (0.25) [6, image8 right]. Principle Error, which indicates a failure in the abstraction step (StepBack error type), comprises only a small fraction of errors [6]. This indicates that while S TEP -B ACK is effective at teaching abstraction, the subsequent reasoning and math steps are where most errors occur [6].\n\nStep-Back Prompting, often combined with RAG for knowledge-intensive tasks, significantly boosts performance on various QA tasks, frequently surpassing GPT-4, though Reasoning and RAG retrieval failures are common error types, while abstraction failures are rare."}

Evaluating the performance of DST models often uses the joint accuracy metric, which is 1.0 only if all domain, slot, and value triplets are predicted correctly at a given turn [1].\n\nTwo prominent models in this area are DS-DST and DS-Picklist. DS-DST employs a dual strategy model that handles both non-categorical (like time or numbers) and categorical slots [4], while DS-Picklist assumes a full ontology is available and treats all slots as categorical, predicting values from a predefined list [5].\n\nWhen comparing overall performance using joint accuracy, both models show strong results, significantly outperforming previous methods like BERT-DST [8], [9].\n![This table compares the joint accuracy of various models on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, showing DS-Picklist achieving 53.30% and DS-DST achieving 51.21%, both higher than BERT-DST (43.40%).](image6)\nAs seen in the table above, DS-Picklist generally achieves a slightly higher joint accuracy than DS-DST on datasets like MultiWOZ 2.1 [image6], [image7]. This suggests that having access to a full ontology and treating all slots as categorical (as in DS-Picklist) can lead to better overall performance on this metric [6].\n\nLooking at performance on a slot-by-slot basis, the differences become clearer.\n![This table shows the accuracy for individual slots across DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist on MultiWOZ 2.1, indicating DS-Picklist and DS-DST often outperform DS-Span, with DS-Picklist having a slightly higher average accuracy.](image2)\nTable 4 [image2] details the slot-level accuracy, showing that both DS-DST and DS-Picklist significantly improve accuracy over DS-Span (a span-based baseline) for certain slots, including hotel-type, attraction-type, attraction-name, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking [3]. These are slots where values often have varied expressions and are difficult to extract directly from the dialog context, making span-based methods less effective [3], [7]. For these types of categorical slots, predicting values from a candidate list is more effective [3].\n\nError analysis confirms that for ground-truth slot values that cannot be found through span matching, both DS-DST and DS-Picklist dramatically reduce errors compared to DS-Span for slots like attraction-type, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking [7], [image5].\n![This table presents error analysis data, showing the number of unfound slot values for DS-Span and the success rates of DS-DST and DS-Picklist in correctly predicting these values for various slots.](image5)\nHowever, even among these slots, DS-Picklist, with its reliance on the full ontology, often achieves slightly higher accuracy than DS-DST [image2]. This is particularly noticeable for slots like attraction-name and hotel-internet, where the percentage improvement over DS-Span is higher for DS-Picklist [image2]. For time-related slots that DS-DST treats as non-categorical (span-based), like taxi-leave at and train-arrive by, neither DS-Span nor DS-DST performs well when the value is not explicitly in the context, and only DS-Picklist shows significant improvement when the value is available in its candidate list [7].\n\nIn summary, DS-Picklist, leveraging a full ontology and treating all slots as categorical, generally achieves slightly higher joint accuracy and demonstrates superior performance on specific categorical slots, especially those whose values are not easily extracted via span matching. While DS-DST also benefits significantly from handling categorical slots via candidates, its dual strategy results in a slightly lower overall joint accuracy compared to DS-Picklist which treats all slots like categorical ones with a picklist."}

Across various models, DS-Picklist+ (likely a version of DS-Picklist) and DS-DST show competitive performance on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset [9, 8].\n\nA more detailed comparison at the slot level provides insights into where improvements come from [7]. Table 4 shows the slot-level accuracy for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set [12].\n\n![This table displays accuracy percentages for various slots across three different models: DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist.](image2)\nDS-DST and DS-Picklist show significant accuracy improvements over the DS-Span baseline for several slots, including `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` [7]. The reason for this improvement is that values for these slots often have varied expressions and cannot be easily extracted from the dialog context, making span-based methods less effective [7]. In such cases, predicting values directly from candidate lists, as done by the categorical approach in DS-DST and DS-Picklist, is more successful [7].\n\nError analysis reveals that for certain slots where ground-truth values are not found through span matching, DS-DST and DS-Picklist dramatically reduce errors [2]. Slots like `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` benefit significantly, suggesting they are better treated as categorical slots [2].

While DS-Picklist generally performs better than DS-DST when the full ontology is available, having access to a full ontology may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios [6].\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs better than DS-DST on MultiWOZ 2.1, particularly excelling on slots where values are difficult to extract as spans but are present in a candidate ontology."}

On the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, DS-Picklist+ (which corresponds to DS-Picklist) achieves 53.30% joint accuracy, which is the highest among the three main models discussed, compared to DS-DST at 51.21% and DS-Span at 40.00% [2, image8]. The dual-strategy approach, jointly handling categorical and non-categorical slots, is helpful, and DS-Picklist, with access to the full ontology, further improves performance [1, 4].\n\nLooking at slot-level accuracy, DS-Picklist maintains the highest average accuracy at 97.40%, slightly above DS-DST (97.35%) and notably better than DS-Span (96.38%) on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set [5].\n![Table showing slot-level accuracy comparison across DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist models](image6)\nSignificant accuracy improvements for DS-DST and DS-Picklist over DS-Span are observed for certain slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` [12]. This is because the values for these slots often have varied expressions and cannot be reliably extracted using span-based methods like DS-Span [12]. For these slots, treating them as categorical and selecting values from candidate lists, as DS-Picklist can do with a full ontology, dramatically reduces errors [3, 12]. For instance, in examples where the user doesn't explicitly use extractable spans for concepts like internet or parking, DS-Span fails, while DS-DST and DS-Picklist are better able to infer the state [10].\n![Table displaying example dialogue turns and how Ground Truths, DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist capture the information](image3)\nEven for time-related slots like `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by`, which are typically span-based but where span matching might not occur in dialogue context, DS-Picklist can further reduce errors when the ontology is accessible [3]. This highlights the benefit of the picklist approach when precise span extraction is difficult or when the desired value is present in a predefined list but not directly extractable from the conversation text [10, 12]. The DS-Picklist model, leveraging candidate-value lists for categorical slots, achieves the best performance [11].\n\nThe DS-Picklist model generally outperforms DS-DST and DS-Span in both joint and slot accuracy, particularly benefiting slots where values are better selected from an ontology than extracted as spans."}

The contribution of the attention mechanism and source embeddings to the performance is evident when comparing DeClarE (Plain) to its variants and the Full model [8]. While Distant Supervision shows strong performance on Snopes, DeClarE offers the advantage of not relying on handcrafted features [11]. The model effectively separates credible from non-credible articles and sources in these datasets [10], [5].\n\nFor the NewsTrust dataset, the task is credibility regression, predicting a credibility score on a scale of 1 to 5 [7]. The evaluation measure used is Mean Squared Error (MSE), where a lower value indicates better performance [4], [6].

The inclusion of attention and source embeddings in the full DeClarE model is crucial for this superior performance, as the Plain version performs substantially worse [2]. The architecture for such a regression task involves processing claim and article word embeddings, source embeddings, and using attention before outputting a credibility score [image4].\n\nThe SemEval dataset involves credibility classification of a tweet, along with generating a confidence score [12].

CHAI, on the other hand, is set in a 3D house environment and includes both navigation and complex manipulation tasks like moving objects and opening containers [2, 7, !['CHAI' scenario and written instructions detailing tasks like opening cupboards, putting items in, closing cupboards, placing meats in the sink, opening the dishwasher, gathering dirty dishes, and putting them in the dishwasher.](image8)], assessed using SD and Manipulation Accuracy (MA) [11].\n\nAnalysis of the datasets reveals key differences in instruction structure and complexity. CHAI instructions, while having fewer tokens per instruction, average more instructions per paragraph and significantly more actions per instruction compared to LANI [image4]. This aligns with the description that LANI mostly involves single goals, whereas CHAI instructions often require multiple intermediate goals and types of actions [2]. Linguistic analysis shows that categories like temporal coordination and co-reference have statistically significant differences when present or absent, suggesting their importance in task understanding [image1]. CHAI has more instances of temporal coordination but fewer trajectory constraints than LANI [image5].\n\nWhen evaluating various methods, including the authors' approach, performance varies considerably between the two datasets. While task decomposition significantly improves performance on the LANI navigation task, results are overall weaker on the CHAI instructions, highlighting the inherent complexity of that task [4]. Evaluation tables show that simple baselines like STOP, RANDOM WALK, and MOST FREQUENT perform poorly on both, demonstrating task robustness [6, image7]. Our approach shows improved performance on LANI compared to baselines and prior methods like CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17, achieving competitive SD and TC metrics [12, image3, image7]. However, all models, including our approach, perform poorly on CHAI, especially concerning manipulation (MA) [12, image7]. Even with access to oracle goals, the model struggles or \"completely fails\" to learn manipulation behavior for CHAI, further illustrating its planning complexity [3].\n\nHuman performance provides a benchmark, also revealing task complexity and ambiguity [4, 10].

In contrast, on CHAI, human manipulation accuracy is 100%, with an SD of 1.34 [10]. This stark difference in manipulation accuracy between humans and models (which perform very poorly on CHAI MA) indicates that the gap to human-level performance is significantly larger for the manipulation-heavy CHAI task than for the navigation-focused LANI task [4, 10, 12].\n\nIn summary, the CHAI dataset presents a more complex task due to its inclusion of manipulation and multi-step instructions, leading to significantly lower model performance, especially in manipulation accuracy, compared to the navigation-focused LANI dataset."}

The complexity of the CHAI domain and its planning challenges contribute to these weaker results [2], [8].\n\nFactors influencing performance include the task complexity, inherent ambiguity in instructions, and potential limitations of the model design [8]. The decomposition into goal prediction and action generation can lead to cascading errors, as action generation relies solely on the predicted goal without direct access to the language instruction [4]. This also makes it unlikely for the model to successfully reason about instructions that include constraints on the execution trajectory, even if it reaches the final goal [4]. Such constraints are common in the data, particularly in LANI [![A table comparing the frequency of different linguistic categories in LANI and CHAI datasets with examples.](image1)]. Access to oracle goals significantly improves navigation performance on both tasks but fails to improve manipulation behavior on CHAI, further illustrating the planning complexity of that domain [2].

Pre-trained embeddings help more when the size of the training data is small [2]. There appears to be a \"sweet-spot\" where pre-trained embeddings are most effective: when there is very little training data, but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all [12]. The gain in BLEU score from pre-training is typically highest when the baseline system is poor but not extremely poor (e.g., baseline BLEU in the 3-4 range) [4].

One hypothesis is that gains might be larger when the source and target languages are more linguistically similar because semantic neighborhoods might be more similar [3], [12]. However, experimental results translating into Portuguese from languages of varying similarity show that less similar languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) sometimes see larger accuracy gains compared to more similar languages like French (FR) and Italian (IT). This is partly attributed to the less similar languages having very low baseline BLEU scores, offering more \"headroom\" for improvement [1], ![BLEU score improvements from pre-training vary across language pairs translating to Portuguese, with larger gains for less similar languages like Hebrew and Russian.](image1).

The graph structure connects mentions (nodes) using different edge types representing relations like co-occurrence in the same document, exact string match, and coreference [image8]. Investigating the impact of removing specific components reveals how the model leverages this structured information [6].\n\nRemoving the R-GCN component entirely, effectively relying only on the ELMo embeddings processed through feed-forward layers and LSTM for the query, leads to a significant drop in performance. For instance, comparing GloVe with R-GCN (59.2 unmasked) to GloVe without R-GCN (51.2 unmasked) shows an 8.0 point loss in accuracy [4, image4]. This demonstrates that the R-GCN is crucial for updating mention representations based on their relations to others, contributing significantly even without accessing direct context in this configuration [4, 11]. Comparing the best model to a configuration where edges between mentions in supporting documents are removed (\"No R-GCN\" in Table 3) shows a drop from 65.1 to 62.4 in the unmasked setting, highlighting the importance of multi-hop inference captured by the graph [12, image4].\n\nA simpler ablation involves removing the distinction between relation types, treating all edges uniformly (\"No relation types\").

Removing connections for mentions that co-occur in the same document (\"No DOC–BASED\") results in a performance drop (62.9 unmasked, 65.8 masked compared to 65.1 unmasked, 70.4 masked for the single model full configuration) [7, image4]. This is because the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections, likely due to their frequency and the importance of capturing mention proximity within documents [7]. Ablating exact matching connections (\"No MATCH\") also reduces performance (64.3 unmasked, 67.4 masked) [7, image4]. Coreference links (\"No COREF\") and complement edges (\"No COMPLEMENT\") seem to play a more marginal role, partly because the MATCH heuristic captures simpler coreference cases and the external coreference system might be unreliable [7]. Removing coreference connections shows a smaller drop (64.8 unmasked) than DOC-BASED or MATCH [7, image4]. However, modeling all relation types together provides a clear advantage [7]. It's notable that while coreference improved development set performance, it surprisingly degraded performance on the test set, possibly due to the test documents being harder for the coreference system [7].\n\nThe removal of components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types generally reduces model performance in both unmasked and masked conditions, demonstrating the importance of the graph structure and typed relations for effective multi-hop reasoning."}

In the masked version of the dataset, mentions referring to the same entity are labeled with the same identifier, simplifying the task of identifying coreferring mentions compared to the unmasked setting where mention surface forms can differ (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\") [5]. The model primarily relies on exact matching when constructing the graph for the masked case, making it more effective in recovering coreference links there [3]. Due to the nature of the masked version, a coreference resolution system is not explicitly applied [5].\n\nInvestigating the effect of different relations, coreference links (`COREF`) are found to play a more marginal role compared to document-based connections (`DOC-BASED`). This is partly because the `MATCH` heuristic already captures the easiest coreference cases [8]. Ablating the coreference edges (No COREF in `![A table comparing model performance in unmasked and masked settings across different configurations, including ablations of GloVe, R-GCN, relation types, and specific edge types like MATCH, COREF, and DOC-BASED.](image6)`) shows performance similar to or slightly below the full model (single) in both unmasked (64.8 vs 65.1) and masked settings (70.3 vs 70.4) `![A table comparing the performance of different models, including prior work and Entity-GCN configurations (with and without coreference, single and ensemble), on Unmasked Test/Dev and Masked Dev accuracy.](image8)`.\n\nDirect comparison of the single Entity-GCN model with and without coreference information reveals differing performance impacts across datasets.

In contrast, the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model performs significantly worse, with an accuracy of 59.2 in the unmasked setting and a remarkably low 11.1 in the masked setting [image3].\n\nThis substantial difference highlights the importance of the embedding strategy used by the 'full' model, which employs ELMo embeddings. Quote [9] explains that the model heavily relies on ELMo embeddings, as it lacks other context encoders. Replacing ELMo with context-insensitive GloVe vectors, as done in the 'GloVe with R-GCN' configuration, is expected to cause a performance drop, particularly since the model doesn't process document context otherwise [9]. The masked case performance for 'GloVe with R-GCN' is especially poor, bordering on random chance, because in the masked setting, all mentions become 'unknown' tokens with GloVe, making it impossible to utilize their surface form or context [9].\n\nThe superior performance of the 'full (ensemble)' model is also seen in relation-based metrics. Image6 details the performance of the ensemble and single models across different relation types.\n\n![The table presents overall and relation-specific accuracy and precision metrics for the ensemble and single models, highlighting best and worst performing relation types.](image6)\n\nThe 'full (ensemble)' model demonstrates strong performance on relations like 'member_of_political_party' (85.5% accuracy), 'record_label' (83.0% accuracy), and 'publisher' (81.5% accuracy), which often have a smaller average number of candidates [image6]. However, it performs less well on relations such as 'place_of_birth' (51.0% accuracy) and 'place_of_death' (50.0% accuracy), which tend to have a larger number of candidate answers [image6]. Quote [3] confirms that questions regarding places like birth and death are considered harder for the model. The distribution of candidate numbers peaks at 5 but averages around 20, and performance shows a negative correlation with the number of candidates [1].\n\nWhile image6 doesn't provide a per-relation breakdown for the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model, the massive overall accuracy difference seen in image3 suggests that the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model struggles across most, if not all, relation types compared to the 'full (ensemble)' model, particularly failing in scenarios where contextual understanding is critical, such as the masked setting [9]. The 'full (ensemble)' model, by leveraging better embeddings, can better handle the varying difficulty of relations and candidate set sizes [1, 3].\n\nThe 'full (ensemble)' model significantly outperforms the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model in both unmasked (68.5 vs 59.2) and masked (71.6 vs 11.1) conditions, indicating the critical role of ELMo embeddings and the overall model architecture in achieving high accuracy across different relation types."}

As shown in the evaluation results, TRADE surpasses other models like MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr in joint accuracy on the complete MultiWOZ dataset as well as on the single restaurant domain [4, 11].\n![The table shows the performance of different dialogue state tracking models on the full MultiWOZ dataset and a restaurant-only subset, indicating TRADE has the highest joint accuracy on both.](image3)\nThe MultiWOZ dataset includes a varying number of dialogues for training, validation, and testing across these five domains [5].\n![The table details the slots and data distribution (train, validation, test instances) for the five domains used in the MultiWOZ dataset evaluation.](image6)\nTRADE's architecture, composed of an utterance encoder, a slot gate, and a state generator, is shared across domains, enabling knowledge transfer [2, 9].\n![The diagram illustrates the architecture of a dialogue system, showing components like an utterance encoder, slot gate, and state generator that are shared across domains in the TRADE model.](image1)\nThis architecture facilitates zero-shot dialogue state tracking for unseen domains [2, 9]. Performance in a zero-shot setting, where the model is evaluated on a domain not seen during initial training, shows varied results across domains. For example, the Taxi domain achieves a joint goal accuracy of $60.58\\%$ in the zero-shot setting, while other domains like Hotel, Train, Attraction, and Restaurant have lower zero-shot joint accuracies compared to their 'Trained Single' performance [image7].\n![The table compares the joint and slot accuracy of a model trained specifically on a single domain versus its performance in a zero-shot setting across five different domains, highlighting varying zero-shot results per domain.](image7)\nThe ability to transfer knowledge allows TRADE to track slots even for domains not explicitly trained, as indicated by successful tracking of certain slots in Hotel and Restaurant domains in a zero-shot analysis [image2].\n![The bar charts analyze zero-shot dialogue state tracking errors for various slots in the Hotel and Restaurant domains, showing successful tracking for some slots like 'people' and 'area' transferred from other domains.](image2)\nTRADE generally performs best when trained directly on a domain ('Trained Single') compared to the zero-shot setting, but its zero-shot performance demonstrates its transferability [image7].\n\nThe TRADE model achieves state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy on the full MultiWOZ dataset and also demonstrates transferable knowledge enabling zero-shot tracking with varying performance across different domains."}

This performance surpasses other models like MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr [10, 11]. When considering only the restaurant subset of MultiWOZ, TRADE also demonstrates superior performance, achieving a joint accuracy of 65.35% and a slot accuracy of 93.28% [1, 10]. This comparison is visually represented in the evaluation table comparing models on both the full and restaurant-only MultiWOZ datasets, where TRADE consistently leads in joint accuracy `![The table shows model performance on MultiWOZ and its restaurant subset, indicating TRADE has the highest joint accuracy.](image7)` [1, 10].\n\nThe TRADE model is also evaluated in domain expansion settings, where it is pre-trained on four domains and then fine-tuned on a held-out new domain using a small amount of data, typically 1% [2, 5]. This approach of fine-tuning from the base model generally achieves better results on the new domain compared to training from scratch on the same limited data [2, 5]. For example, when expanding to the Train domain, fine-tuning TRADE with just 1% of the new domain data results in a 59.83% joint accuracy, significantly higher than the 44.24% achieved by training the Train domain from scratch with the same data amount [3]. The evaluation table further illustrates this, showing that fine-tuning approaches outperform training from scratch on the new domain `![The table shows evaluation results for domain expansion, comparing training from scratch on a new domain versus fine-tuning a base model with different strategies.](image5)`.\n\nFurthermore, different fine-tuning strategies are employed and evaluated based on their ability to adapt to the new domain while minimizing catastrophic forgetting on the original four domains [2, 5]. Strategies include Naive, EWC, and GEM fine-tuning [2, 5]. The results indicate that GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory) fine-tuning is particularly effective at overcoming catastrophic forgetting, maintaining higher performance on the four original domains compared to Naive or EWC fine-tuning [2, 5]. For instance, fine-tuning with GEM causes a much smaller drop in joint accuracy on the original domains than naive fine-tuning does [9].\n\nThe TRADE model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ and effectively adapts to new domains through fine-tuning, particularly with strategies like GEM that mitigate forgetting on previously learned domains."}

Existing approaches often struggle with domain adaptation and retaining tracking ability for unseen slot values [3]. The TRADE model addresses this by generating dialogue states using a copy mechanism and sharing components like the utterance encoder, slot gate, and state generator across domains, facilitating knowledge transfer [3]. This architecture, which processes user input to generate states using shared elements, is key to its transfer capabilities. ![A diagram illustrating a dialogue system architecture with shared components like Utterance Encoder, Slot Gate, and State Generator across different domains.](image1)\n\nTo handle domain expansion, where a model is pre-trained on some domains and then fine-tuned on a new one, various strategies are employed [10]. Simple naive fine-tuning adjusts all parameters based on the new data. More advanced techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) are used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of the original domains while learning the new one [12]. EWC uses a regularizer based on the Fisher information matrix to protect important parameters for old tasks [8]. GEM, on the other hand, stores samples from the source domains and applies a constraint during training to prevent the loss on these stored samples from increasing [11].\n\nComparing these strategies, GEM demonstrates superior performance in maintaining high accuracy on the original four domains after fine-tuning on a new one, experiencing a much smaller drop in joint accuracy compared to naive fine-tuning [1]. Specifically, fine-tuning with GEM resulted in only a minor performance drop on the original domains, whereas naive fine-tuning showed a significant deterioration in tracking ability [1]. Evaluation on the four original domains shows GEM better overcomes catastrophic forgetting compared to both Naive and EWC fine-tuning [5], [10].\n\n| Model / Strategy          | Joint (4 Domains) | Slot (4 Domains) |\n| :------------------------ | :---------------- | :--------------- |\n| Base Model (4 Domains)    | **57.31**         | **95.88**        |\n| Naive Fine-tuning (1% New)| 36.08             | 92.62            |\n| EWC Fine-tuning (1% New)  | 52.95             | 95.41            |\n| GEM Fine-tuning (1% New)  | **53.54**         | **95.71**        |\n\n*Table excerpt showing GEM's better retention of performance on original domains compared to Naive and EWC when fine-tuning on 1% new domain data.* ![A table comparing the performance of a Base Model trained on four domains and its fine-tuning on a new domain using Naive, EWC, and GEM strategies, evaluated on both the original four domains and the new domain.](image3)\n\nFurthermore, when considering performance on the new domain itself, fine-tuning from a pre-trained base model generally achieves better results than training the new domain data from scratch [5], [6], [10]. In some cases, fine-tuning with GEM also outperforms naive fine-tuning on the new domain, suggesting that the ability to retain learned parameters from old domains can positively impact performance on the new domain [4]. For example, when considering 'attraction' as a new domain, GEM achieved higher joint accuracy than naive fine-tuning [4].\n\nThe success of transfer learning and adaptation, especially in zero-shot scenarios where the model encounters unseen domain-slot combinations, relies on the ability to leverage knowledge learned from other domains [3], [9]. This knowledge transfer is more effective for slots that appear across multiple domains [2]. Slots like `people`, `area`, `price range`, and `day` are successfully transferred from domains seen during training to new domains like `hotel` and `restaurant` in zero-shot analysis [2]. This is visualized in error analysis, where slots common to multiple domains show better tracking performance in zero-shot settings than slots unique to a single domain [2]. ![Bar charts showing zero-shot error analysis for Hotel and Restaurant domains, indicating better tracking for cross-domain slots like people, area, price range, and day.](image4) Slots that are unique to a single domain, such as `parking`, `stars`, and `internet` in the `hotel` domain or `food` in the `restaurant` domain, are much harder to track correctly in a zero-shot setting because there's no corresponding knowledge from other domains to transfer [2].\n\nThe model learns embeddings for different slots, and the similarity between these embeddings can indicate shared knowledge or semantic relationships captured during training on multiple domains. A heatmap of cosine similarity between slot embeddings shows clusters of related slots like 'destination' and 'departure' or 'price range' and 'stars' with high similarity. ![A heatmap visualizing the cosine similarity between learned embeddings for different slots across the MultiWOZ dataset, showing higher similarity for related or cross-domain slots.](image8) While not explicitly stated how these specific similarities directly affect performance in the provided text, the architecture's design with shared parameters [3], [9] suggests that slots with higher learned embedding similarity, often those common across domains, would benefit more from the inherent knowledge sharing, leading to better transfer performance, particularly in low-resource or zero-shot conditions.\n\nIn summary, fine-tuning strategies like GEM are more effective than naive fine-tuning and EWC for domain expansion as they better retain performance on original domains while enabling competitive or superior performance on the new domain. Slot similarities, reflected in learned embeddings and occurrences across multiple domains, strongly influence transfer performance, with knowledge for common slots transferring more successfully than for domain-specific ones in zero-shot settings."}

This was assessed using a challenge set approach combining Winogender and WinoBias datasets [2, 6], designed to evaluate MT systems on sentences involving non-stereotypical gender roles [6].\n\nThe evaluation measures included overall gender accuracy (Acc), the difference in performance between masculine and feminine scores (ΔG), and crucially, the difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments (ΔS), where higher ΔG and ΔS indicate stronger biases [1].\n\nAnalysis of performance across commercial systems like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN on languages including Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German [1], shows varying levels of overall accuracy. For instance, Microsoft Translator achieved its highest accuracy with German (74.1%), while Google Translate performed well on French (63.6%) and Hebrew (53.7%), and Amazon Translate on Spanish (59.4%) and Arabic (49.8%) ![Table showing accuracy and error metrics for different translation services](image4) [1]. Most systems across the eight languages performed quite poorly on preserving the gender from the original English sentence, with German being an exception where three out of four systems achieved their best performance [7].\n\nThe bias metric ΔS consistently showed that all tested systems performed significantly better when translating pro-stereotypical assignments (like a female nurse) compared to anti-stereotypical roles (like a male receptionist) [11]. ![Bar chart showing Google Translate accuracy on stereotypical vs. non-stereotypical translations across languages](image1) illustrates this for Google Translate, where accuracy for stereotypical translations is notably higher than for non-stereotypical translations across all tested languages [11]. For example, in Spanish, the accuracy was 67% for stereotypical but only 46% for non-stereotypical translations, and in French, it was 80% vs. 54% [image1].\n\nAcademic models also showed this pattern of bias [2, 4, 6]; for example, one model evaluated on French showed Acc of 49.4, ΔG of 2.6, and ΔS of 16.1, while another on German had Acc of 52.5, ΔG of 7.3, and ΔS of 8.4 ![Table showing accuracy and error metrics for two academic models](image5).\n\nAn example demonstrates the bias, where translating \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen\" into Spanish results in a male translation for \"baker\" (\"el panadero\") despite the female pronoun \"she\" ![Table demonstrating translation bias examples](image2).

Experiments comparing performance on the original WinoMT corpus versus a modified version with stereotypical adjectives showed improved gender prediction accuracy in some languages [5, 10], significantly reducing bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [5], as seen in the change in accuracy from 53.1% to 63.5% in Spanish and 37.7% to 48.9% in Russian for Google Translate ![Table showing Google Translate accuracy change with added adjectives](image6) [10].\n\nEvaluation shows significant gender bias is prevalent across multiple commercial and academic machine translation systems and various languages, primarily manifesting as lower accuracy when translating non-stereotypical gender roles."}

This trend is evident across various languages, as illustrated for Google Translate, where accuracy is consistently higher for stereotypical translations than non-stereotypical ones [2].\n![{The bar chart shows Google Translate's higher translation accuracy for stereotypical gender roles compared to non-stereotypical roles across various languages.}](image4)\nThis bias can lead to incorrect translations of roles, such as translating a doctor identified by context as female as male in the target language, as shown in an English-to-Spanish example [7, 8].\n![{The diagram illustrates the gender bias in machine translation from English to Spanish, showing how \"the doctor\" with a female pronoun \"her\" is translated as \"El doctor\" (male) in Spanish.}](image6)\nTo investigate the effect of stereotype-based adjustments, experiments were conducted by adding stereotypical gender adjectives (e.g., \"pretty\" for female entities) to the source sentences [9].

While a single-hop BERT-based model can achieve competitive F1 scores around 67 on a dataset like HOTPOT QA, where it is shown single-hop reasoning can solve more questions than previously thought [6, 11], performance varies depending on question type. For example, single-hop questions show a higher F1 of 70.54 compared to multi-hop questions at 54.46 and context-dependent questions at 56.16 ![The table contains four columns with the following headers: \"Type,\" \"Question,\" \"%,\" and \"F1.\"](image1).\n\nHowever, performance changes significantly depending on the evaluation setting. In open-domain settings, a single-hop model struggles, largely attributed to insufficient retrieval methods for multi-hop questions [8]. As shown by the single-paragraph BERT* model, the F1 score drops from 67.08 in a controlled distractor setting to 38.40 in an open setting [8, 11, image2, image7]. Providing additional gold paragraphs in the open-domain setting significantly improves the F1 score from 39.12 with 500 retrieved paragraphs to 53.12, highlighting the impact of retrieval failure [8, 12, image7].\n\nThe choice of training and evaluation data also critically affects F1 scores. When evaluated on adversarial distractors instead of the original ones, a model trained on original data sees its F1 drop from 67.08 to 46.84 [4, image8]. However, training the model on adversarially selected distractors helps it recover most of the accuracy, increasing the F1 on adversarial distractors to 60.10 [4, image8]. Furthermore, filtering adversarial distractors by entity type causes a significant degradation for the original model (F1 drops to 40.73), but the model trained on adversarial distractors maintains much higher accuracy (F1 increases to 58.42) [1, image8].\n\nDifferent training and evaluation strategies significantly impact F1 scores, with adversarial training improving robustness against challenging evaluation settings and open-domain performance being heavily reliant on effective paragraph retrieval."}

However, analysis revealed that this performance was not due to genuine argument comprehension but rather the exploitation of spurious statistical cues present in the dataset [1], especially cue words found in the warrant, such as \"not\" [2].\n\nTo address this issue and provide a more robust evaluation, an adversarial dataset was constructed. This was possible due to the design of the original dataset structure (Reason $\\wedge$ Argument $\\rightarrow$ $\\neg$ Claim). The adversarial transformation involves taking each data point, negating the claim, and inverting the associated label [8], [9]. This process essentially mirrors the distribution of statistical cues across both possible labels, thereby eliminating the misleading signal that models were exploiting [8], [9]. `![An example shows how original data is transformed into adversarial data by negating the claim and swapping the warrant and alternative.](image6)` illustrates this transformation. The adversarial dataset combines these transformed examples with the original data to ensure cues are balanced [9].\n\nWhen models trained on the original data were evaluated on this new adversarial set, they performed worse than random, demonstrating they had overfitted to the cues in the original training data [6]. More importantly, when BERT and other models were trained from scratch and evaluated on the adversarial dataset, their performance dropped dramatically [6]. BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set reduced to just 53%, with the mean and median accuracy around 50% [6], [8]. This near-random performance is evident in the results table `![Table 4 shows BERT's performance metrics (Mean, Median, Max) on the adversarial test set after training on adversarial data are around 0.50-0.53.](image3)`, referenced in [11].\n\nThe conclusion drawn from this drastic drop in performance is that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminated the spurious statistical cues [6], [8]. The fact that BERT's accuracy fell to random levels on this cue-free dataset indicates that its high performance on the original ARCT dataset was entirely attributable to exploiting these cues and that it had learned nothing meaningful about argument comprehension itself [1], [10]. This highlights the necessity of such robust evaluation methods like the adversarial dataset for accurately assessing model capabilities in complex NLP tasks [4], [8], [12] and it should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT [3], [8].\n\nThe adversarial data setup reduces BERT's performance on ARCT to random chance by eliminating spurious statistical cues, leading to the conclusion that BERT's high accuracy on the original dataset was due to exploiting these cues rather than understanding argument comprehension."}

Human evaluations, such as those conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, are used to assess whether generated commonsense inferences plausibly complete a tuple, providing a benchmark for model performance [12].

An important factor contributing to its performance is pre-training on a large language corpus, which enhances its ability to generalize [6, 9].

Two LSTM-based extractive QA models, BiDAF and FastQA, adapted for a multi-document setting by concatenating documents, were evaluated [8]. The standard performance of these models on the datasets is presented. ![The table presents the performance results of different models on two datasets, WIKIHOP and MEDHOP.](image1) As shown, BiDAF generally outperforms FastQA on both datasets under standard test conditions [9, 12]. For instance, on WIKIHOP, BiDAF achieved 54.5% accuracy compared to FastQA's 35.8% on the standard test set [image1]. Similarly, on MEDHOP, BiDAF scored 33.7% versus FastQA's 31.3% [image1]. BiDAF is noted as being overall strongest, possibly due to its iterative latent interactions being more important for integrating information distributed across documents [12].\n\nFurther experiments investigated performance when models were presented with only the relevant documents leading to the correct answer, known as the \"gold chain\" setup [1, 5]. ![The table presents the performance of different models on two datasets: WikiHop and MedHop under standard and gold chain conditions.](image3) In this setup, models improve greatly [1]. On WIKIHOP, standard BiDAF accuracy increased to 57.9% (test*) and masked BiDAF reached 81.2% (test) / 85.7% (test*) in the gold chain [image3, 1]. On MEDHOP, standard BiDAF rose to 86.4% (test) and masked BiDAF achieved nearly perfect scores (99.3%/100.0%) in the gold chain [image3, 1]. FastQA also saw significant improvements in the gold chain setup on both datasets [image3]. These results demonstrate that RC models are capable of identifying the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned [1].\n\nHowever, the significant performance drop from the gold chain setup back to the standard setup shows that the models’ answer selection process is not robust to the introduction of unrelated documents [1, 9]. This indicates that while they can integrate information across documents [9], they do not excel at selecting relevant information from a larger set [9]. An experiment explicitly testing the ability to leverage cross-document information by discarding non-candidate documents showed a significant performance drop for BiDAF, confirming it leverages this information, whereas FastQA's results were less conclusive, suggesting it has problems integrating information across documents compared to BiDAF [6]. Masking answer expressions is also used to assess robustness and circumvent spurious correlations [4], where neural models like BiDAF and FastQA largely retain or improve performance by leveraging textual context, especially on WIKIHOP [10, image3].\n\nBiDAF generally outperforms FastQA across WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets in standard conditions, and while both improve dramatically in the \"gold chain\" setup (with only relevant documents), neither excels at selecting relevant information from a full document set, although BiDAF appears better at integrating cross-document information."}

Seq2Seq models are known to produce shorter sentences with more common words compared to human utterances [8]. Our Retrieve and Refine models aim to combine the strengths of both retrieval and generation to overcome these limitations [5]. Word statistics show clear differences across methods, as seen in a comparison of metrics such as word count, character count, and the percentage of rare words used [8].\n![This table compares the word and character counts and the percentage of rare words used by Seq2Seq, different RetNRef models, Memory Network, and humans.](image4)\nAs depicted in the table, the Seq2Seq model has the lowest average word and character counts and the lowest percentage of rare words (0.4% for <100 frequency, 5.8% for <1k frequency). The original RetNRef model shows some improvement, doubling the use of words with frequency less than 100, while the RetNRef++ model makes these statistics much closer to human ones, with word counts of 12.7 and rare word percentages of 2.3% and 10.9% respectively, compared to human counts of 13.0 and percentages of 3.0% and 11.5% [8].\n\nAutomated metrics like perplexity are often flawed for dialogue evaluation because multiple valid responses can exist with little word overlap with the true response [7, 12].\n![This table shows the perplexity scores for vanilla Seq2Seq and RetNRef models using different retrieval methods.](image5)\nWhile perplexity results can vary, with RetNRef models sometimes showing poor perplexity [7], human judgments provide a more reliable measure of conversational performance [12]. Human evaluations, summarized in tables comparing different methods across metrics like Engagingness, Fluency, Consistency, and Persona, reveal key performance differences.\n![This table compares Seq2Seq, Memory Network, and different RetrieveNRef models based on human evaluation scores for Engagingness, Fluency, Consistency, and Persona.](image3)\nThe RetNRef variants generally show superior engagingness scores compared to Seq2Seq [4]. Notably, RetNRef++ achieves the highest engagingness score (3.80) and consistency score (3.80) among the compared models, indicating it produces more engaging and coherent conversations [1, 3]. However, models like RetNRef++ are weaker at maintaining persona compared to Seq2Seq [4].\n\nPaired evaluations, where human annotators compare responses from two models side-by-side, further highlight these differences in conversational ability [11].\n![This table presents win rates and statistical significance (p-values) from paired comparisons between different dialogue models, including RetNRef variants against Seq2Seq, Memory Network, and humans.](image6)\nRetNRef models, including RetNRef++, obtain statistically significant wins over both the Memory Network retriever and the Seq2Seq generator models [6]. RetNRef++ maintains its performance while still being able to generate text, unlike a purely retrieval model [4]. Example dialogues illustrate how well-performing responses from RetNRef++ often involve longer sentences with nuanced information derived from attending to the retriever, while it can also generate shorter contextually appropriate replies [3].\n![This table provides examples of conversation turns between Person 1 and Person 2 and shows the responses generated by Seq2Seq, MemNet, and RetNRef⁺ in different conversational contexts.](image1)\nThe ability of RetNRef++ to utilize the retrieved text is evident in its high word overlap with the retriever output [9].\n![This table shows the percentage of generated responses with high (>80%) word overlap with the retrieved text for Seq2Seq and different RetNRef variants.](image2)\nRetNRef++ shows over 80% word overlap with the retriever output around half (53%) of the time, indicating it effectively incorporates retrieved information, whereas Seq2Seq and RetNRef rarely show such high overlap [9]. This strategic use of retrieval, combined with the ability to refine or generate novel content, helps RetNRef++ avoid issues like generating short, unengaging sentences [1] or making awkward modifications seen in earlier variants [2].\n\nThe RetNRef++ model demonstrates improved word statistics closer to human utterances and achieves higher human-judged engagingness and consistency scores compared to Seq2Seq and Memory Networks, indicating more human-like conversational abilities despite some limitations with persona consistency."}

The company's overall objective in managing this risk is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby enhancing the predictability of financial results [4]. Sales are primarily denominated in currencies like USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP, with the most significant foreign exchange risk stemming from USD, CNY, and JPY exposure [3].\n\nTo mitigate this risk, Novo Nordisk utilizes financial instruments, specifically forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options, to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities [5], [11].

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 compared to 2019 is also primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition and relates to both manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers [3]. This suggests an increase in underlying leased assets supporting the operations, leading to higher lease liabilities. Additionally, the weighted average discount rate for operating leases decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020 [image8], which would result in a higher present value for future lease payments, thus increasing the reported liability.

While many of these businesses saw strong customer demand in 2021, they also faced higher input costs and supply chain disruptions [7]. The railroad business saw earnings rise 16.1% in 2021 after a 5.8% decrease in 2020, reflecting higher freight volumes and productivity improvements, partly offset by higher fuel prices [10]. The utilities and energy business demonstrated consistent growth, with earnings increasing 13.1% in 2021 and 8.8% in 2020, driven by higher earnings from utilities, natural gas pipelines, and real estate brokerage [10].\n\nInsurance underwriting earnings increased steadily from $325 million in 2019 to $657 million in 2020 and $728 million in 2021 [9, image4]. This segment was impacted by significant catastrophe events each year, and the effects of the pandemic in 2020 led to reduced claims frequencies for private passenger auto insurance, partly offset by increased loss estimates in other areas [9]. Insurance investment income, however, saw a decline over the period, decreasing 4.6% in 2021 and 8.9% in 2020, negatively affected by lower interest rates on cash and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings [6, image4].

This rise was primarily attributed to a higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 compared to the prior year [3, 4, 5]. The net discrete tax provisions were benefits of $(122) million in 2020, a decrease from benefits of $(475) million in 2019 [image5]. These net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [3, 4, 5]. For comparison, the larger net discrete tax benefits in 2019 were associated with remeasurement of reserves from tax examinations, as well as benefits from the conversion of employee share-based awards [8, 10, 12].\n\nTotal recognized compensation expense for the Firm was $2,119 million in 2020, up from $1,878 million in 2019 [image7]. This 11% increase in compensation and benefits expenses in 2020 was mainly driven by increases in discretionary incentive compensation and a formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives due to higher revenues [1]. Higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance also contributed to the increase, as did incremental compensation from the E*TRADE acquisition [1]. Compensation expense recognized included $1,263 million from deferred cash-based awards and $856 million related to the return on referenced investments in 2020, compared to $1,233 million and $645 million respectively in 2019 [image7]. The Firm hedges certain obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans by investing in financial instruments, and changes in the value of these investments affect compensation expense recognition [7, 9].\n\nWhile the discrete tax benefits influencing the effective tax rate are related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [3, 4, 5], which are a form of compensation, the overall change in the effective tax rate and discrete tax provisions is primarily linked to the *level* of discrete benefits (which were lower in 2020) and the higher earnings level in 2020 [3, 4, 5]. The increase in total recognized compensation expense in 2020 is driven by factors including incentives, revenue-based payouts, investment performance-linked compensation, and acquisitions [1, image7]. Therefore, the change in tax metrics relates to the nature and conversion of specific compensation (share-based awards generating discrete tax benefits), while the change in total compensation expense is influenced by broader performance and structural factors.\n\nThe effective tax rate increased from 2019 to 2020 due to lower net discrete tax benefits, primarily related to share-based award conversions, while total compensation expense increased due to various performance and acquisition-related factors."}

The Upstream segment is primarily involved in the exploration, development, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including LNG activities [4]. The Downstream segment focuses on refining crude oil into various petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, and lubricants, as well as marketing these products, manufacturing renewable fuels, and transportation [4]. Segment performance is evaluated on an after-tax basis, excluding debt financing interest expense and investment interest income [8].\n\nThe company's earnings are largely dependent on the profitability of its Upstream business, which is significantly affected by the price of crude oil, a factor determined by global markets outside the company's control [3]. Downstream earnings, conversely, are closely tied to refining, manufacturing, and marketing margins, which can be volatile and influenced by supply-and-demand balances, crude oil prices, and other operational factors [5]. Lower commodity prices can impact both segments, potentially leading to asset impairments in the Upstream segment [3], such as the $768 million in net properties, plant and equipment associated with Upstream operations classified as \"Assets held for sale\" at the end of 2021 [7].\n\nExamining the segment earnings reveals a significant difference in performance between the two segments and substantial shifts from 2020 to 2021.\n![The table shows the earnings for the Upstream and Downstream segments, broken down by United States and International operations, for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image6)\nIn 2021, the Upstream segment reported total earnings of $15,818 million, a dramatic improvement from a loss of $(2,433) million in 2020 [image6]. This change aligns with the text indicating that earnings depend mostly on the Upstream business and are sensitive to crude oil prices [3]. The Downstream segment also saw improved performance, with total earnings of $2,914 million in 2021 compared to a gain of $47 million in 2020 [image6]. While both segments rebounded from 2020, the Upstream segment's earnings were overwhelmingly larger than the Downstream segment's in 2021, reflecting a substantial turnaround from losses in 2020 for both, particularly the Upstream.\n\nLooking at segment assets, the Upstream segment holds a significantly larger portion of the company's total assets compared to the Downstream segment.\n![The table shows segment assets for Upstream, Downstream, and All Other categories, broken down by United States and International regions, for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020.](image8)\nAt December 31, 2021, total Upstream assets were $184,412 million, slightly down from $191,309 million at the end of 2020 [image8]. In contrast, total Downstream assets were $45,224 million in 2021, up from $39,586 million in 2020 [image8]. This illustrates that while the Downstream segment has substantial assets, the Upstream segment represents the vast majority of the company's total segment assets ($229,636 million in 2021) [image8].\n\nIn summary, Chevron's Upstream segment experienced a significant rebound in earnings from a loss in 2020 to a large profit in 2021, consistent with its dependence on commodity prices, while the Downstream segment also improved from a small gain in 2020 to a larger profit in 2021, though its earnings remained significantly smaller than the Upstream segment's in 2021. The Upstream segment consistently holds a substantially higher value of assets compared to the Downstream segment.\n\nThe major differences in their financial performance for 2021 and 2020 are the Upstream segment's dramatic swing from a significant loss to a large profit, its dominant contribution to overall earnings in 2021, and its consistently higher asset base compared to the Downstream segment."}

While the weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted increased over this period, from $15.60 in 2020 to $21.55 in 2022, contributing to potential future expense, the decrease in total expense reflects the amortization of awards granted in prior periods [Image4, 8].

Property, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss, with depreciation typically calculated using the straight-line method [8]. Depreciation commences when the asset is available for use [4]. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable [1]. Intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment [12].\n\nWhile the total reduction from these factors increased slightly, the specific impairment losses decreased significantly from DKK 982 million in 2019 to DKK 350 million in 2020 ![Total impairment losses decreased in 2020](image4). Substantially all of the impairment loss in both years related to patents and licences [10], which are often intangible assets not yet available for use related to research and development projects [6, 12]. Impairment tests for these assets are based on management's projections of future cash flows [6]. The impairment loss in 2020 was entirely recognised within research and development costs, whereas in 2019, it was split between cost of goods sold and research and development costs [10]. Research and development costs include amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses related to assets used in R&D activities, as well as impairment losses on intangible assets not yet available for use related to R&D projects [2]. If the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based on impairment indicators, any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows [9].\n\nThe combined effect of additions, disposals, transfers, exchange rate adjustments, and amortisation/depreciation and impairment losses led to an increase in the net carrying amount of both asset categories. The carrying amount of intangible assets increased from DKK 10,057 million at the end of 2019 to DKK 14,237 million at the end of 2020 ![Movements in intangible assets including amortisation, depreciation, and impairment](image5). Similarly, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment rose from DKK 19,103 million in 2019 to DKK 20,491 million in 2020 ![Movements in property, plant and equipment including amortisation, depreciation, and impairment](image5).\n\nDepreciation and impairment losses increased overall from 2019 to 2020, primarily affecting property, plant and equipment, while specific impairment losses related mainly to intangible assets decreased significantly, contributing to an increase in the net carrying amounts of both asset categories."}

Revenue declines were particularly severe in markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, often due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations [3].

In 2019, income before income taxes from foreign regions was $439 million, which surged to $1,493 million by 2021 [image1]. Correspondingly, the tax provision related to foreign operations shifted dramatically from a net benefit to a significant expense. The total foreign tax provision (combining current and deferred components) was a benefit of ($524) million in 2019, comprising a current benefit of ($407) million and a deferred benefit of ($117) million [image4]. By 2021, this had transformed into a total foreign tax provision of $530 million, consisting of a current provision of $518 million and a deferred provision of $12 million [image4].\n\nThis marked change reflects several factors. In fiscal 2019, significant restructuring, such as foreign subsidiaries electing to be treated as U.S. branches, impacted deferred tax assets and resulted in a large charge to income tax expense, while other actions led to benefits [8]. Also in fiscal 2019, the company applied for partial refund claims for taxes previously withheld in Korea, which resulted in recording a large noncurrent income taxes receivable alongside a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefits [7]. These events likely contributed to the foreign tax benefit recorded in 2019. More recently, final U.S. Treasury regulations on the foreign tax credit, effective from fiscal 2021, increased the effective tax rate by approximately 1% [5]. The increase in foreign income [image1] and the shift to a foreign tax provision [image4] suggest that despite past restructuring aimed at centralizing income taxation in the U.S. with FDII benefits [1], foreign operations are generating increasing taxable profits.\n\nThe shift from a foreign tax benefit to a significant foreign tax provision, coupled with rising foreign income, has notable implications for the company's financial strategy. As foreign earnings grow, managing the associated tax liability becomes more critical. The company needs to consider potential future tax law changes, such as increases in U.S. rates or changes to the FDII deduction [1]. Furthermore, maintaining indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings avoids immediate U.S. tax, but foreign withholding taxes could apply upon repatriation [4]. Ongoing uncertainties, such as potential Korean withholding tax refunds [7], meeting criteria for tax incentives in places like Singapore that expire soon [10], and managing numerous foreign tax audits [12], add complexity and risk.\n\nForeign income before taxes significantly increased from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, while the foreign tax provision shifted from a benefit of ($524) million to a provision of $530 million, indicating growing foreign tax costs that necessitate strategic tax planning regarding international operations, earnings, and future tax rate changes."}

Agreements to sell WFAM were announced in February 2021, leading to the business being moved internally to the Corporate segment [7, 12].

The improved FICC performance, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, was supported by higher volatility levels and increased client activity, together with wider spreads [7]. Rates also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds [7]. While other segments experienced revenue decreases, such as Global Banking which decreased by 2% [3], and Global Liquidity and Cash Management which decreased by 26% [image3], the strong performance in Global Markets helped offset these declines, contributing significantly to the overall rise in Net Operating Income. The allocation of revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses starting in 2020 also affected the presentation and composition of the global business revenues and the overall Net Operating Income compared to previous periods [4], [11], adding $340 million in revenue within the global business view in 2020 [image3].\n\nHSBC's Net Operating Income increased by 3% from 2019 to 2020, driven significantly by a 27% rise in Global Markets adjusted revenue due to volatility, client activity, and spread widening in FICC, partially offset by declines in other segments and influenced by accounting reallocations."}

Total NBCUniversal revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, with total Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 6.0% to $5.7 billion [10].\n\nThe Media segment's revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion, including the contribution from the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, although Adjusted EBITDA decreased [6]. Excluding the Olympics, the Media segment revenue grew by 11.0%, largely due to increases in distribution, advertising, and other revenue, benefiting from comparisons to the prior year which was significantly impacted by COVID-19 [6]. Within Media, Peacock generated $778 million in revenue in 2021, a substantial increase from $118 million in 2020, as the company continued to invest in content and grow its customer base, incurring $2.5 billion in operating costs and expenses for Peacock in 2021 [6]. However, the Media segment faces challenges as the number of subscribers and audience ratings at networks are expected to continue declining due to the competitive landscape and shifting video consumption patterns [4].\n\nThe Studios segment saw a revenue increase of 16.2% to $9.4 billion, reflecting increases in content licensing, theatrical, and home entertainment revenue as production operations returned to full capacity [6]. Meanwhile, the Theme Parks segment experienced a dramatic recovery, with revenue surging 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA improving from a loss of $0.5 billion to a gain of $1.3 billion, directly reflecting the operation of parks in 2021 compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions in 2020 due to COVID-19, alongside the opening of the Beijing theme park [6].\n\nWhile overall customer relationships across Comcast Corporation showed a net loss of 198 thousand in 2021 and 56 thousand in 2020, following a net addition of 394 thousand in 2019 ![Total customer relationships showed a net loss in 2021 and 2020 after a gain in 2019](image5), the text specifically notes the expectation of continued subscriber and audience rating declines for NBCUniversal's networks [4]. This potential impact of customer relationship trends on revenue is a key factor in the Media segment's future performance [4].\n\nExpenses also saw shifts, influenced by cost savings initiatives from 2020, particularly severance at NBCUniversal presented in Corporate and Other [3]. Payments related to this severance were substantially complete by the end of 2021, realizing cost savings [3]. Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses decreased significantly in 2021 after a large increase in 2020 ![Corporate and Other expenses decreased significantly in 2021 after a large increase in 2020](image1). However, new costs related to initiatives like Sky Glass and XClass TV were incurred in 2021 and are expected to increase [3]. Revenue was also influenced by sales of Sky Glass televisions [1] and by changes in sports programming licensing agreements in certain regions [2].\n\nRevenue trends across NBCUniversal segments were largely positive in 2021, significantly recovering from COVID-19 impacts and driven by strong performance in Theme Parks and Studios, while the Media segment managed growth despite subscriber pressures, influenced by the Olympics and investment in Peacock, and expenses were impacted by prior cost savings and new initiatives."}

Factors contributing to the decrease in average loans included lower loan demand, reduced line utilization, and higher paydowns, reflecting robust client liquidity and strong capital markets [12]. Net interest income was lower, reflecting lower loan balances driven by weak demand and the lower interest rate environment [7].\n\n![Average total loans decreased in Commercial Banking](image3)\n\nIn Corporate and Investment Banking, average commercial and industrial loans decreased by $1,779 million or 1%, while average commercial real estate loans increased by $3,491 million or 4% [image5].

The increase in commercial loans, particularly period-end commercial and industrial loans, was predominantly due to higher loan demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [5].\n\n![Average total deposits decreased in Corporate and Investment Banking](image5)\n\nWithin Consumer Banking and Lending, average total loans decreased [image6]. Consumer loans decreased predominantly driven by a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment and the transfer of loans to held for sale [5]. Home Lending loan balances were also impacted by strategic actions taken in 2020, and Small Business period-end loan balances were impacted by a decline in PPP loans [9]. Average Home Lending loans decreased by $1,241 million or 3%, average Credit Card loans decreased by $1,291 million or 6%, average Small Business loans decreased by $457 million or 26%, and average Personal Lending loans decreased by $509 million or 21%, while average Auto loans increased by $1,348 million or 3% [image6].\n\n![Average total loans decreased in Consumer Banking and Lending](image6)\n\nTotal deposits increased from 2020 to 2021 [8], [11]. Average total deposits in Commercial Banking increased by $109,233 million or 23% [image3], and average total deposits in Consumer Banking and Lending increased by $41,277 million or 16% [image6]. This increase was driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [8], [11]. Higher deposit balances partially offset lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances [7]. In contrast, average total deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking decreased by $45,156 million or 19% [image5].\n\nOverall, total loans decreased primarily due to lower demand and increased paydowns, while total deposits increased significantly in Consumer and Commercial Banking segments due to government stimulus and economic uncertainty."}

This significant decline was primarily driven by lower interest rates, although it was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs [5]. Looking at the components, interest income saw a substantial decrease of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, while interest expense decreased by a smaller amount, $5,627 million, over the same period ![The table shows a detailed breakdown of changes in interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 and 2018 to 2019, indicating a large net decrease in income from 2019 to 2020 and a net increase from 2018 to 2019](image2). This imbalance, where the reduction in interest income significantly outpaced the reduction in interest expense, led to the overall decline in net interest income in 2020. Average yields on earning assets like debt securities and loans decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the lower rate environment ![The table provides detailed financial data on average balances, interest income/expense, and yield/rate for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over three years, showing lower yields on assets in 2020](image6).\n\nIn contrast, the period from 2018 to 2019 saw an increase in net interest income [5]. Interest income increased by $4,452 million from 2018 to 2019, while interest expense increased by a smaller $714 million ![The table shows a detailed breakdown of changes in interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 and 2018 to 2019, indicating a large net decrease in income from 2019 to 2020 and a net increase from 2018 to 2019](image2). This dynamic, where interest income grew faster than interest expense, resulted in a positive change in net interest income during the earlier period.\n\nThese significant shifts in net interest income and expense reflect the impact of the economic environment, particularly interest rate changes, on the bank's core operations. Bank of America reports its results through four main business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking, and Global Markets, along with \"All Other\" operations [4], ![The image displays the organizational chart of Bank of America Corporation, outlining its five main divisions: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other](image1). The changes in net interest income directly affect the performance of these segments, especially those with significant interest-sensitive assets and liabilities like Consumer Banking and Global Banking [9]. The decline in net income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to factors including lower net interest income [3]. Segment performance is evaluated and reported using key financial indicators that include net interest income [6], [11], such as the reported decrease in net interest income for Consumer Banking in 2020 [9], ![The table presents detailed financial data for Consumer Banking, showing a decline in net interest income from $28,158M in 2019 to $24,698M in 2020](image5). Similarly, the Global Wealth & Investment Management segment also experienced a decrease in net interest income from 2019 to 2020 ![The table provides financial data for the Global Wealth & Investment Management segment, showing a decrease in net interest income from $6,504M in 2019 to $5,468M in 2020](image8). Capital is allocated to these business segments taking into account factors including internal risk models [1], and their financial results, including net interest income, are detailed in reporting [7]. The changes in net interest income flow through the segment results, influencing their overall profitability and the bank's consolidated performance.\n\nThe major differences in the change of net interest income from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 were a significant decrease versus an increase, respectively, primarily driven by the relative changes in interest income and expense influenced by the interest rate environment, impacting the financial performance of the bank's organized business segments."}

Pre-tax net investment income declined from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021, a decrease of 5.0%, while net investment income fell from $5,039 million to $4,807 million [image7 shows decrease in net investment income from 2020 to 2021]. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 [1]. This decline in investment income was primarily due to a significant decrease in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly attributable to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities as low short-term interest rates persisted through 2021 [4]. Dividend income, however, increased by 3.5% in 2021 compared to 2020 [image7 shows increase in dividend income from 2020 to 2021].\n\nConcurrently, the composition of invested assets changed. Total invested assets increased significantly from $363,117 million at December 31, 2020, to $446,277 million at December 31, 2021 [image3 compares asset categories between Dec 31, 2020 and Dec 31, 2021]. This growth in assets was supported by an increase in float, which grew from approximately $138 billion at December 31, 2020, to $147 billion at December 31, 2021 [8]. Looking at the specific asset categories, cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased substantially from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, while equity securities also saw a considerable rise from $269,498 million to $334,907 million [image3 compares asset categories between Dec 31, 2020 and Dec 31, 2021]. In contrast, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 [image3 compares asset categories between Dec 31, 2020 and Dec 31, 2021].\n\nThe implications of these changes include the negative impact on investment income from the persistent low-interest-rate environment, which reduced returns on substantial holdings of cash and fixed income securities [1], [4], despite the growth in overall assets. The increase in cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills reflects a strategy of maintaining ample liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield [4]. The significant increase in equity securities holdings suggests a larger exposure to market fluctuations, which can introduce volatility to reported earnings due to the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses [7].\n\nNet investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to lower interest rates on increased cash and decreased fixed maturity security holdings, while overall invested assets grew, driven by increases in float and a shift towards equity securities."}

Overall, the company moved from a net income of \\$2,924 million in 2019 to a loss of \\$5,543 million in 2020, before achieving a substantial net income of \\$15,625 million in 2021 ![The table shows Chevron's Net Income and other financial data for 2019, 2020, and 2021, indicating a loss in 2020 and a large profit in 2021](image4). This shift was heavily influenced by the performance of its upstream operations [9].\n\nThe upstream segment, which primarily focuses on exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas [2], is the main driver of the company's earnings [9]. Prices for commodities like WTI and Brent crude oil saw a significant dip in early 2020, before rising steadily through 2021, while natural gas prices remained lower but also saw a slight increase by the end of 2021 ![The line graph shows the quarterly average spot prices for WTI Crude Oil, Brent Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021, illustrating price volatility, especially the dip in 2020 and recovery in 2021 for crude oils](image1). The total upstream operations reported earnings of \\$2,576 million in 2019, which then fell sharply to a loss of \\$2,433 million in 2020, before dramatically recovering to earnings of \\$15,818 million in 2021 ![The table details Chevron's Upstream and Downstream earnings by region for 2019, 2020, and 2021, showing significant volatility and a strong recovery in Upstream in 2021](image3). The increase in U.S. upstream earnings from a \\$1.6 billion loss in 2020 to \\$7.3 billion in 2021 was due to higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, higher sales volumes, and higher asset sales gains [3]. Similarly, international upstream earnings went from an \\$825 million loss in 2020 to \\$8.5 billion in 2021, largely due to higher realizations and the absence of significant impairments, write-offs, and severance charges from the prior year [10].\n\nThe downstream segment, which involves refining and marketing [9], also saw changes, though less volatile than upstream. Total downstream operations earned \\$2,481 million in 2019, experienced a significant drop to \\$47 million in 2020, but rebounded to earnings of \\$2,914 million in 2021 ![The table details Chevron's Upstream and Downstream earnings by region for 2019, 2020, and 2021, showing significant volatility and a strong recovery in Upstream in 2021](image3). U.S. downstream operations reported earnings of \\$2.4 billion in 2021, a significant improvement from a \\$571 million loss in 2020, primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales and improved earnings from affiliates [7]. International downstream earnings, however, decreased slightly from \\$618 million in 2020 to \\$525 million in 2021, mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales [8].\n\nThe pronounced downturn in upstream profitability in 2020, coupled with reduced downstream earnings, resulted in the overall net loss for that year. The subsequent surge in upstream earnings in 2021, driven by recovering commodity prices and other factors, was the primary force behind the substantial increase in Chevron's overall net income in 2021.\n\nOver the years 2019 to 2021, Chevron's upstream operations swung from moderate earnings to a significant loss and then to substantial earnings, heavily influencing the overall net income which followed a similar pattern of decline into a loss in 2020 followed by a strong rebound into profit in 2021, while downstream operations also saw a dip in 2020 but a recovery in 2021."}

Excluding the volume impact from the RBH deconsolidation, the total shipment volume in the region decreased by 10.3% [10].\n\nSpecific country impacts contributed to this trend [10, 12]. For instance, cigarette volume was lower primarily in Argentina, where there was a lower market share due to adult smokers down-trading to ultra-low-price brands, and Mexico, affected by a lower total market and market share decline following price increases and pandemic impacts [12]. Colombia also saw a decrease reflecting a lower total market [12]. Canada's volume was down significantly due to the unfavorable impact of the deconsolidation of RBH [12]. Partially offsetting these declines was Brazil, which saw volumes increase, mainly reflecting a lower estimated prevalence of illicit trade due to reduced price gaps and pandemic border restrictions [5].\n\nIn light of declining cigarette volumes globally, PMI continued to optimize its manufacturing infrastructure, recording asset impairment and exit costs related to plant closures in countries including Argentina and Colombia during 2019 [1]. These costs are part of the broader financial picture. Net cash provided by operating activities overall decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [3], partly due to higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs in 2020 [3], linking back to activities like those mentioned in the region. Higher working capital requirements also contributed to the change in operating cash flow, primarily due to COVID-19 related inventory build-up in the supply chain and the timing of excise tax-paid inventory movements [8].

The cash flow statement shows that net income for the year 2020 was $5,185,313 [image1].

While this expense is recorded on the income statement (contributing to net income), it does not represent a cash outflow in the period the service is rendered. Therefore, this non-cash expense is typically added back to net income in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement [image4] to reflect the actual cash generated from operations.\n\nThus, share-based compensation expense increases shareholders' equity and is added back as a non-cash item in the calculation of cash flow from operating activities, which, along with other operational adjustments, determines the cash generated from the company's core business and contributes to the change in the overall cash position [image4] [image2].\n\nShare-based compensation increases shareholders' equity and is a non-cash adjustment that increases cash flow from operating activities, thereby contributing to the cash position."}

The federal deferred provision was a large $2,037 million charge in 2019, which corresponds to the derecognition event, shifting to benefits of $(192) million and $(251) million in 2020 and 2021 respectively [image7]. Foreign current tax provisions were $518 million in 2021, $526 million in 2020, and a benefit of $(407) million in 2019 [image7].\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits have also shown a trend of increasing, with the ending balance rising from $1,705 million in 2019 to $1,901 million in 2020 and $2,136 million in 2021 [image5]. The increase in 2021 was primarily attributed to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes where licensees withheld taxes at a higher rate than believed owed [10]. Related to this, the company recorded $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion as a noncurrent income taxes receivable in 2021 and 2020 respectively, corresponding with a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefits [4]. Other tax-related matters include remaining future payments for a one-time repatriation tax and managing tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions like Singapore [5, 6].\n\nSignificant changes in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits from 2019 to 2021 include a spike in the effective tax rate in 2019 due to a large deferred tax asset derecognition, followed by significantly lower rates in 2020 and 2021 driven by ongoing tax benefits and the absence of the 2019 charge, alongside an increasing balance of unrecognized tax benefits."}

While interest expense also decreased, the reduction was less substantial at $5,627 million over the same period.

Concurrently, the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 1.68% in 2019 to 0.82% in 2020 [image8]. While lower rates reduced funding costs, the larger impact was on asset yields, resulting in a decrease in the net interest spread from 2.83% in 2019 to 2.50% in 2020 [image8]. The deployment of excess deposits into securities also partially offset the rate impact [6], as did higher deposit and loan balances in some areas [4].\n\nThe changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a decrease in the net interest spread, primarily driven by the larger decline in asset yields compared to the decrease in funding costs due to lower interest rates."}

This actuarial valuation relies on key assumptions, including discount rates, expected compensation increases, pension progression, and mortality rates [3]. Due to changing conditions, these assumptions may differ from actual developments, impacting the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and potentially plan assets [3, 8].\n\n![The table presents percentage rates for discount rates for different currencies as of September 30 for 2021 and 2020, showing an increase in rates across currencies.](image2)\nBetween September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2021, key financial assumptions such as discount rates increased across various currencies, including Euro (0.9% to 1.0%), U.S. dollar (2.4% to 2.7%), British pound (1.7% to 1.9%), and Swiss franc (0.2% to 0.4%) [image2]. Compensation increase rates and pension progression rates also changed for some countries, for example, compensation increase in the UK rose from 2.6% to 3.0%, and pension progression in the UK increased from 2.6% to 3.0% [image3]. Demographic assumptions, such as mortality tables, were also utilized for different regions, with updates occurring in some cases like Switzerland [image5].\n\nChanges in these actuarial assumptions, alongside experience gains and losses, are recognized as remeasurements in comprehensive income [image1].\n![The table shows actuarial gains and losses in millions of euros for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, broken down by changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, and experience.](image4)\nIn fiscal year 2021, changes in financial assumptions resulted in actuarial losses of €26 million, while changes in demographic assumptions led to losses of €8 million, contributing to total actuarial losses of €22 million [image4]. This contrasts with fiscal year 2020, which saw actuarial gains from financial assumptions (€72 million) and losses from demographic assumptions (€3 million), resulting in total gains of €67 million [image4].\n\nThe sensitivity analysis highlights the potential impact of changes in key assumptions on the DBO; for instance, a decrease of half a percentage point in the discount rate would have increased the DBO by €271 million as of September 30, 2021, while an increase in compensation increase or pension progression by half a percentage point would also increase the DBO [image7]. While plan assets are also affected by market movements, the direct impact of assumption changes on assets is generally less pronounced than on the DBO [8, 12].\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions between 2020 and 2021 resulted in actuarial losses impacting the defined benefit obligation."}

Market risk RWA also increased, adding $14,547 million (Standardized) and $14,443 million (Advanced) to the total, mainly due to increased Regulatory VaR resulting from higher market volatility [image3, 8].

However, marketing support provided through incentives to franchisees, including free Thank You Meals, more than offset the positive sales performance in terms of overall revenue impact [8]. Franchised margins in the U.S. were also affected by support for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth [5].\n\nIn contrast, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a significant total revenue decrease of 17% in 2020 [image4]. This large decline reflected sales decreases as a result of COVID-19 [2, 6], leading to a 19% decrease in Company-operated sales and a 14% decrease in Franchised revenues within the segment [image4]. Comparable sales in the International Operated segment decreased by 15.0%, primarily driven by negative comparable sales in most markets like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [10, 12]. Revenue declines were more significant in the IOM due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations [12]. The operating income decrease in this segment also reflected over $100 million of support for marketing and incremental COVID-19 Company-operated expenses for employee-related costs [6]. The Company's heavily franchised business model means that most revenues are based on a percent of sales, and government regulations from COVID-19 resurgences continued to negatively impact revenue [7].\n\n![Comparable sales percentage change by segment for 2018-2020](image6)\n\nAs a result of these differing impacts, the U.S. segment's contribution to total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues slightly increased from approximately 37% in 2019 to approximately 41% in 2020, while the International Operated Markets segment's contribution decreased from approximately 54% to 50% [image4].

This was partly offset by income from balance sheet growth, notably in short-term funds, loans and advances to banks, and financial investments [4, image8]. Separately, interest expense for 2020 also saw a decrease compared to 2019, largely due to lower market interest rates [11, image6]. The overall decrease in Interest Income was greater than the decrease in Interest Expense.\n\n![The table shows Interest Income decreased from $54,085m in 2019 to $41,756m in 2020, and Interest Expense decreased from $(17,167)m in 2019 to $(14,178)m in 2020, resulting in a decrease in Net Interest Income.](image1)\n\nConsequently, net interest income (NII) for 2020 was $\\S27.6$bn, a decrease of $\\S2.9$bn or 9.5% compared to 2019 [9]. This decrease reflected lower average market interest rates across major currencies, partially offset by increased interest income from growth in AIEA [9]. Excluding specific items and currency effects, NII decreased by $\\S2.7$bn or 9% [7]. This reduction in NII contributed to the decline in Total Operating Income and Net Operating Income Before Credit Provisions, which fell from $40,820m in 2019 to $28,834m in 2020 [image5]. Beyond NII, other income sources were also affected; for instance, net income from insurance businesses decreased, mainly reflecting less favorable equity market performance [6, 10]. Other operating income also saw a substantial decrease [6].\n\n![The table shows financial metrics including Net Interest Income for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.](image1)\n\nThe reported fall in profit was also significantly impacted by an increase in expected credit losses (ECL) and other credit impairment charges [1]. The table shows that the \"Change in Expected Credit Losses and Other Credit Impairment Charges\" went from a credit provision of $7,785m in 2019 to a charge of $14,086m in 2020 [image5]. This substantial increase in credit losses further reduced the Net Operating Income (after provisions) from $33,035m in 2019 to $14,748m in 2020 [image5].\n\nThe changes in net interest income, combined with decreases in other operating income components and a significant increase in expected credit losses, directly impacted the net operating income and led to a substantial decrease in the overall profitability as measured by profit before tax in 2020 compared to 2019."}

The decrease in income tax payments also played a role, largely resulting from tax deductions related to a senior notes exchange [4]. Conversely, the decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included impacts from broadcasting the Tokyo Olympics [9].\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities increased by over $4.4 billion from 2020 to 2021, driven by factors like increased investment proceeds and lower tax payments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities."}

A significant number of both female (21,746) and male (98,347) employees are entitled to parental leave. `![The table shows that significantly more male employees are entitled to parental leave than female employees, but usage and return rates differ.](image5)`. However, the number of employees who actually availed this leave is much lower, with 1,025 females and 2,023 males taking parental leave [image5]. This indicates that while more males are entitled, a higher proportion of entitled females (approx 4.7%) avail the leave compared to entitled males (approx 2.1%) based on the numbers provided. Of those who availed leave, 967 females (94%) and 1,941 males (96%) returned to work [image5]. After 12 months, 66 females (6%) and 75 males (4%) were still employed after returning, though the basis for these percentages might require further clarification against the total returned or total availed [image5].\n\nThe bank is committed to fostering a culture of inclusion, diversity, growth and progression, and well-being [7]. They state they strive to create an inclusive work environment for all employees irrespective of gender and provide equal and fair remuneration opportunities [5]. Understanding the importance of a supportive ecosystem for women to build successful careers [4], they have set a gender diversity target to increase the representation of women in their workforce to 25% by FY25 [5]. This involves focusing on both talent acquisition and retention [5]. Initiatives include a unique endeavour called Careers 2.0 to provide a platform for skilled women professionals to transition back to work after a break [5], and efforts to prioritise female hiring, such as offering additional referral bonuses for women candidates [11]. To enable women employees to manage professional and personal commitments, policies like flexi work time and part-time work arrangements have been introduced with the objective of arresting attrition [11]. They also work towards increasing sensitisation of managers and leaders to understand the challenges women often face due to unconscious bias through audio-visual campaigns [4]. These efforts suggest an acknowledgement of specific challenges faced by women, which could include those related to family responsibilities like childcare, and policies are being put in place to support them.\n\nWhile parental leave is available to both genders, the data suggests a disparity in usage, with a higher proportion of entitled females availing it compared to males. The bank's broader gender diversity initiatives, including flexible work options and programmes aimed at retaining and re-integrating women professionals, reflect an effort to address potential barriers to women's career progression, which are often linked to managing personal and family commitments.\n\nThere is a difference in the proportion of entitled male and female employees who avail parental leave, with females utilizing the entitlement at a higher rate, and the bank implements policies aimed at supporting women's careers and addressing gender-related challenges in the workplace."}

Similarly, comprehensive income attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders saw a substantial jump from $10,469 million in 2018 to $14,421 million in 2019, reaching $15,167 million in 2020 [Image 2, Image 5]. These figures are part of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and operations [7, Image 11], prepared according to U.S. GAAP [12].\n\nThe growth in net earnings was primarily driven by increases in total revenues, which rose from $226,247 million in 2018 to $257,141 million in 2020 [Image 6]. A major component of this revenue growth was premiums, which increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020 [Image 6]. Premium revenues are mainly derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements where the company assumes the cost risk [5]. These revenues are recognized based on estimated earned premiums, net of projected rebates [6]. Factors influencing these revenues include the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, which adjusts payments based on health severity and data submission [9]. Additionally, premium revenues are affected by required rebates under the ACA and state regulations based on medical loss ratios, and CMS quality bonuses for Medicare Advantage plans [10]. Growth at the OptumHealth segment, fueled by organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery, also contributed to increased revenues and earnings [4]. However, reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements due to COVID-19 partially offset these increases [4].\n\nComprehensive income includes net earnings but also incorporates other components, such as unrealized gains or losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, and other items, net of tax [Image 2, Image 5]. While net earnings showed consistent growth, the \"Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\" component fluctuated significantly, contributing ($1,517) million in 2018, $582 million in 2019, and ($236) million in 2020 [Image 2]. These fluctuations were largely influenced by changes in unrealized investment gains/losses and substantial foreign currency translation losses, which were particularly large in 2018 and 2020 [Image 2, Image 5]. The company's financial results also involve significant estimates and judgments, particularly for medical costs payable, which can impact earnings when estimates are adjusted in subsequent periods [1].\n\nUnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily driven by revenue growth, especially in premiums from risk-based plans and OptumHealth expansion, while comprehensive income also reflected changes in investment values and foreign currency translation."}

This decrease in Global Financing debt was primarily due to lower funding requirements resulting from the decline in financing assets, consistent with the company's portfolio management strategy [9]. The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9 to 1 at December 31, 2020 [2]. The company's strategy includes designating a large portion of foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity [6]. Debt designated as hedging instruments increased significantly in 2020 [6].\n\nThe changes reflect IBM's financial strategy focused on deleveraging and enhancing balance sheet strength and liquidity [5], [10].

The strategy for Global Financing includes refocusing on IBM's hybrid cloud and AI offerings, winding down the OEM Commercial Financing business, and selling commercial financing receivables [10]. This shift reduces the need for funding, hence the decrease in Global Financing debt [9]. IBM Credit will no longer require direct access to public capital markets as part of this strategy and the overall 2021 debt pay down strategy [10].\n\nThe company is actively managing its debt portfolio, reducing overall debt since the Red Hat acquisition peak and strategically adjusting debt levels within its segments while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity."}

The decrease in gross margin percentage was influenced by several factors. Across all segments, the gross margin percentage, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices, decreased, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories [3]. This decrease in core merchandise categories, specifically in fresh foods and foods and sundries, accounted for a 33 basis-point decrease when excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation [5]. Additionally, a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs negatively impacted gross margin by 19 basis points [5]. Increased 2% rewards also had a negative impact, contributing one basis point decrease [5].\n\nWarehouse ancillary and other businesses had a positive impact on the total gross margin percentage, primarily driven by gasoline, contributing 29 basis points [5]. However, despite this positive contribution from ancillary businesses including gasoline, the higher penetration of gasoline sales, which generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to non-gasoline business, tends to lower the overall gross margin percentage [12]. The increase in net sales during 2022 was significantly impacted by higher gasoline prices, which positively impacted net sales by $9,230, and an approximate 22% increase in the volume of gasoline sold [11]. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth but negatively impact the gross margin percentage [12].\n\nThe cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19 positively impacted gross margin, partially offset by the expense of granting employees an additional day of paid time off, resulting in a net positive impact of five basis points [5]. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176 [5]. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than in recent years, and pricing and merchandising strategies in response to these cost increases, such as holding prices steady or reducing prices to drive sales, also negatively impacted gross margin [10].\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased by 72 basis points from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022 due to factors including decreases in core merchandise margins, a LIFO charge, increased rewards, inflationary impacts on costs and pricing strategies, and the effects of higher gasoline sales penetration and rising gasoline prices, partially offset by positive contributions from ancillary businesses and a net benefit from changes in labor costs."}

The years 2019 and 2020 saw significant net mark-to-market losses of $468 million and $383 million, respectively [image8]. The 2019 loss was primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018, partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets [10]. Similarly, the 2020 loss was mainly due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019, partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets [9]. In contrast, 2021 recorded a substantial net mark-to-market gain of $833 million [image8], which significantly contributed to the overall net benefit for the year. This gain was primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020, partially offset by various assumption changes and a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return [5]. These mark-to-market adjustments, driven by factors like changes in discount rates and actual versus expected returns on plan assets, have a considerable impact on the reported net periodic benefit cost or benefit.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) shifted from a cost of $638 million to a benefit of ($1,122) million, primarily influenced by changes in mark-to-market losses or gains, and is expected to be a benefit of ($121) million in 2022."}

In contrast, self-identified non-Hispanics are overwhelmingly of the third or higher generation (96%) ![Bar chart showing the generational makeup of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics](image6). This generational difference is strongly correlated with the likelihood of identifying as Hispanic.\n\nThose closer to their immigrant roots are more likely to identify as Hispanic [3]. Nearly all immigrant adults (97%) and second-generation adults (92%) with Hispanic ancestry identify as Hispanic, but this rate falls among third or higher generation individuals [3]. Among self-identified non-Hispanics, only 15% say they often identify as Hispanic, compared to 57% of foreign-born self-identified Hispanics and 33% of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics ![Horizontal bar chart showing the frequency of self-identification as Hispanic by generation](image1).\n\nAs immigrant connections fall away, Hispanic identity fades across generations [8].

Cultural practices like attending Hispanic cultural celebrations also decrease, reported by 49% of second-generation self-identified Hispanics about their childhoods compared to 35% of the third generation or higher [12].

Similarly, the percentage of self-identified Latinos who say all or most of their friends are Latinos falls from 77% among immigrants to 37% among the third generation or higher [5]. Intermarriage rates increase in higher generations; 93% of married immigrant Hispanics have a Hispanic spouse, but this drops to 35% among married third-generation Hispanics [6]. Reasons for not identifying as Hispanic among those with ancestry in higher generations include a mixed background, lack of contact with relatives, not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link, or identifying primarily as American [image7], [image2]. Non-Hispanic heritage becomes more common among higher generations of those with Hispanic ancestry [11].\n\nThe generational breakdown reveals that identification with Hispanic heritage is strongly tied to generational proximity to immigration, with cultural and social connections weakening and non-Hispanic identification becoming more common in later generations."}

The population started at a mere 130 residents in 1870 [1], but saw a dramatic increase over the next two decades, surging to 8,267 by 1880 and reaching its peak at 14,096 in 1890 [1].\n![Census data for Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000, showing initial growth peaking in 1890 followed by a gradual decline and slight recovery by 2000.](image2)\nThis rapid growth in the late 1800s was heavily influenced by national policies aimed at encouraging western settlement. The Homestead Act of 1862, which offered 160 acres of land to pioneers who would build a permanent structure and live on the land for five years, spurred a \"great tide of emigration for the west and especially Nebraska\" [5]. By 1900, Nebraska had the largest number of people acquiring land under this act compared to any other state [5]. Alongside the Homestead Act, the Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862 also played a crucial role, transforming Nebraska from a \"thinly populated corridor of westward expansion into a booming agricultural state\" [5]. The availability of land and improved transportation facilitated the influx of settlers during this period.\n\nFollowing the peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population began a slow decline [1]. This trend continued for many decades, reaching 9,982 in 1940 and dropping to 8,714 by 1960 [image2]. A major factor contributing to this decline was the changing nature of agriculture. Mechanization significantly altered farming methods and increased operational costs, making smaller farms less viable [6]. This led to a trend of farm consolidation, where the number of individual farms decreased while the average size of farms increased [6]. In 1900, Hamilton County had over 2,000 farms, but by 1997, this number had fallen to 697, with the average size increasing from around 180 acres in 1920 to 507 acres [6]. This consolidation had \"significant impacts on rural life\" [6], as fewer people were needed to work the land. The map shows the communities within the county, illustrating the dispersed nature of settlement tied to agriculture.\n![Map of Hamilton County, Nebraska, highlighting its location within the state and showing the routes and key communities such as Aurora, Hampton, and Giltner.](image3)\nThe county's ethnic settlements, such as the Danes in the northeast, Swedes in the northwest, and Germans and Irish in the southwest [2], established strong religious congregations which often served as focal points for communities [12]. For instance, the Zion Lutheran Church was central to the German settlement in northeastern Hamilton County [4], and St. John's congregation was vital to the Danish immigrants around Kronborg [12]. While these communities were part of the county's fabric, economic shifts, particularly in agriculture, were the dominant force behind the overall population trend. Agricultural infrastructure like grain elevators and rail lines underscore the county's reliance on farming.\n![A tall grain elevator labeled \"Farmers\" with cylindrical silos, situated in a rural area with utility poles and a road.](image1)\n![Large silos with the word \"UNITED\" visible, and a train or rail cars in front, indicating a transportation link for bulk materials like grain.](image4)\nAlthough the overall county population declined after 1890, it showed some signs of stabilization and slight recovery towards the end of the 20th century, increasing from 8,862 in 1990 to 9,403 in 2000 [image2]. This coincided with some towns showing population gains [8].\n\nFrom 1870 to 2000, Hamilton County's population initially grew rapidly due to westward expansion policies like the Homestead Act and railroad development, peaked in 1890, and then declined significantly due to changes in agriculture, including mechanization and farm consolidation, before stabilizing slightly by 2000."}

The degree of improvement can vary significantly depending on the language pair, the amount of training data available, and the system type (bilingual vs. multilingual).

These results indicate gains ranging from small (+0.5 for AZ) to very large (+11.0 for GL). The gains for higher-resource languages like PT, TR, and RU are consistently around 3 BLEU points when translating to English [2]. However, for extremely low-resource languages like AZ and BE, the gains are quite small, whereas GL, which may be on the threshold of producing reasonable translations, shows a substantial increase [2].\n\n![Table displays standard and pre-trained BLEU scores and improvements for ES, FR, IT, RU, HE translating into Portuguese.](image2)\n\nWhen considering translations into Portuguese (PT), languages more similar to PT, such as Spanish (ES), French (FR), and Italian (IT), tend to see gains from pre-training, though these gains can be smaller compared to languages less similar or with lower baseline scores [9]. Languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), which are less similar to Portuguese, show larger accuracy gains (6.2 and 8.9 respectively) [9], partly attributed to having lower baseline BLEU scores and thus more potential for improvement [9], [11]. The gain is often highest when the baseline system's BLEU score is poor but not extremely low, typically in the 3-4 range [11].\n\nIn multilingual systems, where an encoder or decoder is shared between languages [5], applying pre-trained embeddings also yields gains.\n\n![Table shows bilingual and multilingual BLEU scores with standard, pre-trained, and aligned settings for evaluation on low-resource languages.](image5)\n\nFor example, when training on GL+PT and evaluating on GL, the multilingual standard system scores 17.5, while the multilingual pre-trained system scores 20.8, and a pre-trained and aligned system achieves 22.4. Similarly, for AZ+TR evaluated on AZ, the multilingual pre-trained score (5.9) is higher than the standard (5.4), and alignment further increases it to 7.5. The similarity between the language pairs used in multilingual training can also influence the gains; the pair with highest similarity, GL/PT, shows the largest gains, while the pair with lowest similarity, BE/RU, shows a small decrease with basic pre-training, although alignment helps increase the scores [10]. Aligning the embedding spaces, especially in shared-encoder multilingual systems, helps improve BLEU scores [10].\n\n![Graph shows BLEU scores vs. training data size for standard and pre-trained models, and the BLEU gain from pre-training vs. data size for PT, TR, RU to EN.](image7)\n\nFurthermore, the impact of pre-training is more significant when the size of the training data is small, as indicated by the gain in BLEU score decreasing as the proportion of the training dataset used increases for PT→EN, TR→EN, and RU→EN [3].\n\nPre-training word embeddings helps increase BLEU scores for different language pairs."}

This retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions [9, 11]. It includes an Image Encoder to extract image features and a Feature Index to store and index these embeddings for efficient retrieval, often utilizing methods like k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) [image1, image3]. To optimize retrieval speed from large datasets, the retriever employs an index system, such as the HNSW algorithm, which helps in dimensionality reduction [7, 9].

Upon receiving an input image, the retriever retrieves the top-k class names or results most similar to the image from the memory [6, 11, 12, image1].

It poses the question: \"Does getting vaccinated increase the likelihood of death?\" The ground-truth answer is \"No.\" The image outlines the steps to reach this conclusion: 1. Parse the causal graph: Identify confounding relationships. Subskill: Causal Relation Extraction; 2. Classify the query type: Identify it as an Average Treatment Effect. Subskill: Causal Question Classification; 3. Formulate the query in symbolic form: E[Y | do(X=1)] - E[Y|do(X=0)]. Subskill: Formalization; 4.

A core hypothesis is that LLMs are more proficient at handling hard samples, which often require external knowledge or complex reasoning, whereas SLMs may struggle with them [6, 12]. Experiments group samples by confidence scores to test this hypothesis, comparing SLM-only methods against those where SLM predictions are reranked by an LLM [9]. The findings indicate that LLM-based reranking enhances performance specifically on hard samples (those with lower confidence scores) [2].\n\n![The FewNERD graph shows performance with and without LLM reranking across different confidence scores.](image6)\n\nConversely, this reranking approach can sometimes impede performance on easy samples (those with higher confidence scores), leading to significant degradation, particularly for very easy samples [2]. This selective reranking of a minor fraction of samples deemed hard (e.g., 0.5%-10%) by LLMs can result in a substantial performance boost on those specific samples (10%-25% absolute F1 gains), which in turn enhances overall performance [8]. For the FewNERD dataset specifically, the performance curve demonstrates that LLM reranking leads to higher micro-F1 scores at lower confidence levels compared to using SLMs alone, while the benefit diminishes or performance potentially slightly decreases at higher confidence levels, aligning with the observation that LLMs excel on hard (low confidence) samples but may underperform on easy (high confidence) ones.\n\nFor the FewNERD dataset, LLM reranking primarily improves micro-F1 performance for samples with lower confidence scores."}

On tasks requiring a high level of lexical semantic understanding, such as a supersense variant of the SemEval Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) dataset (SemEval-SS) [3, 8], SenseBERT BASE significantly outperforms BERT BASE. For example, in the SemEval-SS Frozen setting, where a linear classifier is trained over pretrained embeddings without changing network weights, SenseBERT BASE achieves a score of 75.6 compared to BERT BASE's 65.1, showing a dramatic improvement [8]. ![The table compares the performance of various BERT and SenseBERT models on SemEval-SS (Frozen and Fine-tuned) and WiC tasks, showing scores for BERT_BASE, BERT_LARGE, SenseBERT_BASE, and SenseBERT_LARGE.](image8) In the fine-tuning setting for SemEval-SS, SenseBERT BASE also surpasses BERT BASE with scores of 83.0 versus 79.2, respectively [8].

Evaluation was performed across different entity types, categorized as Head, Torso, and Tail based on their popularity [11].\n\n![The table shows changes in accuracy and hallucination rates for different categories (Head, Torso, Tail) with and without RA.](image4)\n\nThe results clearly demonstrate that retrieval augmentation significantly enhances performance across these categories [11]. Specifically, comparing results with and without RA shows an increase in accuracy for Head entities by 11.1%, for Torso entities by 18.8%, and a notable 85.3% increase for Tail entities. Correspondingly, hallucination rates decreased by 3.6% for Head, 4.4% for Torso, and 6.2% for Tail entities. This indicates that the performance improvement is most pronounced for torso-to-tail entities, effectively addressing the challenge of hallucinations in long-tailed entities through retrieval augmentation [11].\n\nRetrieval augmentation significantly improves accuracy and reduces hallucination rates, with a more substantial positive impact on torso-to-tail entities compared to head entities."}

The encoder converts the raw input text into a numerical format (usually vectors). 2. **Pooling Layer:** After the encoding process, the output vectors go through a pooling layer. This layer is responsible for aggregating the encoded features to produce a fixed-size vector representation for the entire sentence, regardless of its length. 3. **Sentence Embeddings:** The result after pooling are sentence embeddings. These are dense vector representations of the original text input, capturing semantic meaning in a form that's suitable for comparison or downstream tasks. 4. **Triplet Margin Loss:** This is a loss function used during training to ensure that the sentence embeddings map closely related sentences (such as variations of the same sentence) near each other in the embedding space while pushing unrelated sentences farther apart.

This is typically an iterative process involving generating output, receiving feedback, and refining the output [6]. Unlike self-correction where a single LLM acts as both generator and critic [4], the post-hoc correction with external feedback strategy leverages sources outside the LLM itself [9].\n\n![The image depicts a conceptual framework where external tools and knowledge serve as feedback sources for a critic model, which analyzes the language model's output and guides refinement.](image6)\n\nThese external feedback sources can include readily available external tools like trained models, program executors (e.g., for code), or search engines [1, image3, image6]. External knowledge sources such as Wikipedia or the internet are also utilized [1, image6]. Using external knowledge, for example, helps ensure factual accuracy of the output; methods like REFEED and LLM-Augmenter prompt the LLM to question its output, and an external retriever finds relevant evidence to refine it [2]. FACTOOL extends this use of external knowledge to tasks like code generation and mathematical reasoning [2]. This strategy is flexible as it doesn't require training the LLM or accessing its parameters [6].\n\n![The table lists various post-hoc correction methods, showing that \"Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback\" uses external tools, knowledge, and metrics as feedback sources for iterative refinement in applications like QA, code, and math.](image4)\n\nThe feedback from these external sources can take various formats, including natural language [6, 9]. This allows for more diverse and detailed feedback, ranging from specific diagnostic reports to broader suggestions [9]. This iterative process, guided by objective feedback from external sources, enables the refinement of outputs across a myriad of tasks, including question answering, reasoning, code generation, dialogue, and summarization [1, 5, image4]. The refined outputs are typically generated until an acceptable quality or a pre-set number of iterations is reached [4, 6].\n\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances output refinement by using objective feedback from external tools and knowledge sources to iteratively correct and improve generated outputs."}

It begins by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on cosine similarity to the query embedding. This process is repeated for the children of the selected nodes at each subsequent layer, descending through the tree until the leaf nodes are reached [8]. This method offers control over specificity and breadth by adjusting the depth and the number of nodes selected at each layer [9]. However, the ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details remains constant regardless of the question when using the same depth and node selection parameters [3].\n\nIn contrast, the collapsed tree approach offers a simpler way to search by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously [10], [3]. This method essentially flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes to the same level for comparison [10]. It evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones [11].\n![The image illustrates the two querying mechanisms: Tree Traversal Retrieval, which traverses the tree layer-by-layer selecting nodes, and Collapsed Tree Retrieval, which considers all nodes simultaneously after collapsing the tree.](image3)\nThis approach provides greater flexibility, searching through all nodes simultaneously to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, and consistently performs better in tests compared to tree traversal [3].\n![The graph compares the F1 score of Collapsed tree and Tree Traversal methods across different context lengths, showing the collapsed tree generally achieves higher F1 scores and peaks around 2000 tokens.](image4)\n\nTree Traversal Retrieval processes the hierarchical tree layer-by-layer, selecting nodes based on relevance at each level, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes across all layers simultaneously to find the most relevant information."}

The system architecture involves several key modules, including a claim verifier, question generator, question-answering module, QA validator, and a reasoner [9]. A central component, the claim verifier, determines if the current context is sufficient to verify the claim, preventing redundant reasoning [8]. The claim verifier interacts with relevant context to assess sufficiency ![{The architecture of the QAC HECK system showing the flow from a claim through verification, question generation, QA, validation, and reasoning to a final label, utilizing a Wikipedia Corpus.](image1). This module considers the current context and asks if enough information is known to verify the claim ![{Text asking if a claim can be known as true or false given the current context.](image2).

Prior methods often relied on synonyms from resources like WordNet, but this approach is constrained because words with identical or near meanings are few, limiting the generated patterns [1, 9]. Instead, proposed methods like contextual augmentation leverage language models to predict substitute words based on surrounding context [7, 9, 12]. This method allows for a wider range of substitute words that have paradigmatic relations with the original words [12], as illustrated by replacing \"actors\" with words like \"performances,\" \"films,\" or \"movies\" while maintaining the original positive sentiment in a sentence like \"the actors are fantastic.\" ![Illustration of contextual augmentation replacing 'actors' with contextual words like 'performances' while maintaining sentiment](image3)\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the augmented sentences remain compatible with their original labels, a label-conditional architecture is introduced into the language model [7, 12]. This architecture enables the model to predict different words based on the sentiment label. For instance, with a positive label, the model might replace \"fantastic\" with words like \"funny\" or \"good,\" while with a negative label, it might replace it with \"tired\" or \"bad\" [6]. ![Diagram showing conditional language model predicting different words based on positive or negative sentiment label](image2) This contextual augmentation, especially when combined with the label-conditional architecture, has been shown to improve model performances for various text classification tasks [10, 11, 12], tested on architectures including RNNs and CNNs [10].\n\nThe evaluation results comparing different augmentation methods on various datasets confirm that contextual augmentation, particularly with the label-conditional architecture, improves model performance more significantly than synonym-based augmentation [10].

This phenomenon occurs because the repetition control feature, which discourages bigrams that have appeared previously, prevents the model from using common bigrams found in many questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\" [10].\n\n![A line graph shows that enabling repetition control alongside question control significantly reduces the percentage of questions asked at various question-asking control levels compared to question control alone.](image4)\n\nTo counteract this effect and allow the model to achieve higher question-asking rates while still benefiting from some aspects of repetition control, adjustments can be made to the decoding process [10].

Iterative retrieval is characterized by alternating between retrieval and generation steps, allowing the system to refine the context and generate responses through repeated cycles [3], [8], [10]. This process typically involves a loop like Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge, which can be repeated or lead to a final response [image2]. The goal is to provide richer and more targeted context with each step [image2].\n\nRecursive retrieval focuses on refining the user query itself or breaking down complex problems into smaller sub-problems [image2]. It often involves iteratively refining search queries based on previous results [11], using techniques like query transformation or decomposition [image2]. This can include structured indexing for hierarchical data or multi-hop logic for interconnected information [4]. The process often involves a feedback loop where query transformations occur based on generation and judgment steps before repeating the retrieval and generation [image2]. This is particularly beneficial for complex or ambiguous information needs [11].\n\nAdaptive retrieval introduces flexibility by enabling the RAG system to decide *when* external knowledge retrieval is necessary [12]. Instead of retrieving for every query, the system can determine the optimal moments for retrieval and even when to stop the process, often using special tokens or internal judgment [image2]. This approach transcends fixed retrieval processes by evaluating the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios [8]. The process starts with a Judge step to decide if retrieval is needed before potentially proceeding to retrieval and generation steps, which can then involve further transformations and judging [image2]. Examples like FLARE and Self-RAG showcase this dynamic decision-making capability [8], [12].\n\nIn essence, Iterative retrieval refines context through cycles of retrieval and generation, Recursive retrieval refines the query or breaks down problems, and Adaptive retrieval allows the system to decide dynamically whether and when retrieval is needed."}

In the standard distractor setting of datasets like HotpotQA, where two gold paragraphs and eight TF-IDF selected distractors are provided [4], a single-paragraph BERT model achieves a competitive F1 score of 67.08 [7], image4, image7. This high score suggests that many questions in this setting can be answered with a single hop, partly because the distractors may be weak or easily distinguishable [7], [9]. Some questions, intended to be multi-hop, become solvable with a single hop due to weak distractors, like when only one entity of a certain type exists in the provided paragraphs [12], image1.\n\nHowever, performance drops considerably in open-domain settings where the model must first retrieve relevant paragraphs from a large collection. When using retrieved paragraphs without a guarantee of including the necessary gold paragraphs, the single-hop model's F1 score falls dramatically to around 38-39 [5], [10], image4, image7. The failure to retrieve the crucial gold paragraphs is a major reason for this performance drop [5].\n\nCrucially, the F1 score improves significantly when the two gold paragraphs are explicitly included alongside retrieved paragraphs, even in the open-domain context. For instance, adding gold paragraphs to 500 retrieved ones increases the F1 from 39.12 to 53.12 [5], [11], image4. This highlights the critical importance of having access to the necessary evidence for answering the question.\n\nBeyond the presence of gold paragraphs, the nature of the distractors also matters. When evaluated on adversarially selected distractors, models trained on standard distractors see a significant accuracy decline (e.g., from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1) [2], image2. Similarly, using distractors filtered by entity type reduces performance (e.g., to 40.73 F1) [8], image2. This demonstrates that the model's performance is sensitive to changes in the distractor distribution [3]. Nevertheless, models can recover much of their original accuracy by being re-trained on these new types of distractors [2], [3], [8], image2.\n\nThe challenge lies in creating distractors that genuinely require multi-hop reasoning and cannot be solved via single-hop shortcuts [6], [11]. Even using a large number of distractors like 500 is insufficient if they do not effectively challenge the model [11]. This suggests that the quality and selection method of distractors are key to inducing true multi-hop reasoning capabilities and accurately evaluating models [6], [11].\n\nThe inclusion of necessary gold paragraphs is vital for performance, especially in open-domain settings, while the type and quality of distractors critically influence whether a question necessitates multi-hop reasoning and how well models generalize.\n\nAdding the required gold paragraphs significantly boosts performance in open-domain settings, and the nature of distractors impacts model accuracy and the true multi-hop nature of questions."}

DSGAN utilizes a generator and a discriminator in an adversarial setting [1, 2, 12]. The generator learns to identify true positive samples from the noisy distant supervision dataset [2, 4, 12]. As adversarial training progresses, the generator improves its ability to generate true positives, which gradually decreases the discriminator's classification ability [1, 10]. This process results in a robust true-positive generator [9, 10]. The flow diagram shows how samples from the DS Positive Dataset are processed by the Generator, categorized, and used to challenge the Discriminator ![{The flowchart illustrates the DSGAN process involving a generator assessing confidence in samples from a positive dataset and a discriminator being challenged by categorized samples.}](image7).\n\nThis generator is then used to filter the noisy distant supervision dataset, redistributing false positive instances into the negative set to create a cleaned dataset for relation classification [2, 4, 11]. The method is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to various distant supervision models [1]. Experiments apply this filtering strategy to recent state-of-the-art models to observe performance improvements [4]. CNN-based models were used for the generator and discriminator, employing common settings like word and position embeddings [5, 6], with specific hyperparameters shown in Table 1 ![{The table lists hyperparameters for CNN models used in the study, including window size, kernel size, embedding dimensions, and learning rates.}](image1) [6].\n\nThe impact of adding DSGAN to different models is evaluated. Figure 4 shows the Precision-Recall curves for CNN-based models with and without DSGAN, indicating improved performance when DSGAN is included ![{The Precision-Recall curve graph shows that CNN+ONE and CNN+ATT models generally achieve higher precision at various recall levels when DSGAN is added.}](image4) [4, 11, 12].

The p-values accompanying these improvements are consistently less than 5e-02, confirming the statistical significance of the observed gains [8, 11]. The comparison of generator performance also shows that the positive set generated by the DSGAN generator yields the best performance in downstream tasks compared to randomly selected or pre-trained generator sets, demonstrating its effectiveness [9].\n\nThe addition of DSGAN significantly improves the performance of various models on distant supervision relation extraction tasks."}

The input for each token is formed by concatenating character representations, GLoVe word embeddings, and ELMo embeddings, with the final token representations being the stacked forward and backward LSTM hidden states [4].

The COMET framework [9] proposes different models, including the Estimator, trained to regress on quality scores like HTER or MQM, and the Translation Ranking model (COMET-RANK), trained to minimize the distance between a better hypothesis and its source and reference [2, 10]. These models leverage cross-lingual encoders [2, 9].\n\n![The table presents the results of a translation performance metric called COMET-RANK for various language pairs.](image1)\nMetrics like BLEU and chrF are characterized as n-gram matching metrics, which often fail to capture semantic similarity beyond the lexical level [4].

However, human judgments encompass more than just semantic similarity, which can limit the correlation of such metrics [6].

The first stage is the Problem Formulation stage, where an LLM translates the problem description into a task-specific symbolic language [2, 12]. This is achieved by leveraging the strong in-context learning ability of LLMs to formulate the problem using symbolic representations [9, 12]. The framework utilizes different symbolic formulations, such as deductive reasoning (Logic Programming), first-order logic, constraint satisfaction, and analytical reasoning (Satisfiability Testing), depending on the problem type [5, image6]. An example shows a natural language problem about Netflix shows translated into symbolic predicates and premises [image3].\n\n![Diagram showing the three modules of LOGIC-LM: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter, with examples of problem translation and reasoning methods.](image5)\n\nNext, the Symbolic Reasoning stage takes the formulated symbolic problem and uses a deterministic symbolic solver to perform inference [2, 12]. This offloads the burden of executing complex, precise reasoning from the LLMs to more reliable external symbolic solvers [9, 11]. The specific solver used, such as Pyke for Logic Programming or Prover9 for First-Order Logic, depends on the chosen symbolic formulation [image6]. This deterministic process guarantees faithful reasoning, provided the initial formulation is correct [2].\n\nFinally, the Result Interpreter stage is responsible for translating the symbolic answer obtained from the solver back into natural language to provide the final solution to the original question [2, 12]. To improve the accuracy of the symbolic parsing, the framework can also incorporate a self-refinement module that uses error messages from the symbolic solver as feedback to iteratively revise the generated logical form [8, 10, 12]. This self-refinement process can improve executable rates and accuracy over multiple rounds [image7, image1].\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by formulating it symbolically using an LLM, reasoning over the symbolic form using a deterministic solver, and interpreting the symbolic result back into natural language."}

This approach is designed to be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning, and it has been shown to outperform various competitive baselines on a new benchmark called SCIDOCS [1]. Previous evaluations of scientific document representations often focused on small datasets and limited tasks, necessitating larger and more diverse benchmarks like SCIDOCS, which includes tasks ranging from citation prediction to document classification and recommendation [8]. Unlike some other methods, SPECTER can embed new papers that are not yet cited [11].\n\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of scientific paper embeddings, SPECTER is compared against several strong textual models and graph-convolutional approaches, including SciBERT, a state-of-the-art pretrained Transformer LM for scientific text [7]. Although SPECTER does not require fine-tuning, the best performance from pretrained Transformers is often obtained when they are fine-tuned directly on each end task [12]. Experiments were conducted comparing SPECTER with SciBERT fine-tuned directly on task-specific signals instead of citations, such as co-views, co-reads, and co-citations [12].\n\n![This table presents a comparison of different training signals and their performance across several metrics for document or text classification tasks, showing SPECTER outperforming SciBERT fine-tuned models on average.](image5)\nAs seen in the table, different SciBERT fine-tuned models achieved varying average scores across the evaluation categories [image5]. The SciBERT model fine-tuned on multitask data achieved an average score of 78.0 [image5].

In contrast, the SPECTER model, without any additional fine-tuning, achieved an average performance of 80.0 across all metrics on all tasks [6, image5]. Despite SPECTER's superior average performance without fine-tuning, the question asks which SciBERT fine-tuned variant performed best on average.

This improvement is observed across both citation and text evaluation metrics for models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT.

In both general and specific settings, GPT-4 shows higher scores for Alignment, Correctness, Precision, and F1 Score [1].\n\n![The table compares GPT-4 and ChatGPT performance on citation and text evaluation metrics in General and Specific settings, showing metric values for Alignment, Correctness, Precision, Recall, F1, Coherence, Conciseness, Fluency, and Relevance.](image6)\n\nFor instance, in the general setting, GPT-4 has a Citation F1 of 35.6 compared to ChatGPT's 32.9, and in the specific setting, GPT-4's F1 rises to 39.4 while ChatGPT's increases to 37.2 [image6]. Correctness for GPT-4 remains exceptionally high (97.6) in both settings, while ChatGPT's correctness is slightly lower (94.5 general, 94.8 specific) [image6]. GPT-4 also maintains a higher Precision score in both settings [image6]. However, ChatGPT tends to achieve higher Recall scores than GPT-4 in both the general and specific contexts [1, image6]. This aligns with the observation that while GPT-4 generates shorter answers with fewer citations leading to higher precision, models like LLaMA and, in this comparison, ChatGPT, are better at Recall by generating longer answers with potentially more citations [1]. The shift from general to specific questions generally boosts Alignment, Correctness, Precision, and F1 for both models [image6].\n\nIn terms of text quality evaluation, OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and ChatGPT, are generally found to have better text quality metrics compared to other models like those in the LLaMA family [4].

However, it is important to note that text quality evaluation using ChatGPT itself could introduce a bias, potentially favoring text generated by ChatGPT [6]. Both models generally see improvements in text quality metrics when evaluated in the specific setting compared to the general setting [image6].\n\nThe differences in performance between general and specific settings, particularly the improvement seen in specific settings, highlight the importance of question formulation for retrieval-augmented LLMs that rely on knowledge graphs [3]. For citation, GPT-4 demonstrates stronger overall performance, precision, and alignment, while ChatGPT excels in recall [1, image6].

The Problem Formulator uses the LLM to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic representation [6, image3].

In Afghanistan, NAMRU-3 partners with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) to enhance medical capacity within Ministry of Health laboratories, directly supporting U.S. government biodefense and disease surveillance efforts [3].\n\n![A group of people in lab coats gather around a table in what appears to be a laboratory setting, possibly engaged in training or discussion.](image7)\n\nNAMRU-3's work includes assessing laboratory capacity and capability, as initially done with the Ministry of Public Health in Afghanistan, starting with the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) in Kabul and expanding to other facilities [7]. They have conducted numerous workshops to train local laboratory and administrative staff on essential procedures, quality control, biosafety, and supply management [5]. In 2011 alone, NAMRU-3 provided training to 160 Afghan scientists and technicians on laboratory operations, diagnostics, and research ethics [8, 9]. Based on needs identified through assessments, a comprehensive training plan was developed, including modules on diverse topics such as parasitology, bacteriology, clinical epidemiology, molecular biology, and biomedical equipment repair [10]. Furthermore, NAMRU-3 has addressed gaps in information and sample flow to and from laboratories by providing necessary supplies and training [11]. Their efforts have led to the establishment of hospital laboratories and specialized labs within the CPHL, and they have provided training for diagnostic procedures, including through studies on acute febrile illness and diarrhea [12]. This capacity building directly supports regional health security, which is vital for military operational environments.\n\nThe Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) is primarily an operational medicine laboratory focused on the submarine force and related human factors. An agreement with the Commander, Submarine Forces (CSF) designates NSMRL as CSF's main human technology laboratory, responsible for all physical and mental aspects of submariner health and performance [6]. NSMRL conducts medical, psychological, and human performance research, reviews human systems projects for CSF, and develops innovative concepts that utilize human technology, aligning directly with the strategic direction of the submarine force [6]. NSMRL is also involved in diving medicine research. A notable addition to their Genesis hyperbaric chamber allows for high-altitude pressure studies and simulations of mission profiles transitioning between depth and altitude, directly relevant to submarine operations and Special Operations Forces missions [6].\n\nNAMRU-3 contributes to medical and scientific research through capacity building and disease surveillance in strategic regions, while NSMRL focuses on operational medicine and human factors critical to the submarine force and diving operations; both units directly align their missions with supporting U.S. military health, readiness, and operational capabilities."}

The Analytics Value Chain outlines the sequential steps required to derive impact from data.

It is emphasized that achieving impact is the critical outcome, and merely performing analysis without driving change yields no credit or value [2].

This is where the concept of Levels of Analytics comes into play. These levels range from basic reporting, which answers questions like \"What happened?\", to more advanced techniques like statistical analysis (\"Why is this happening?\"), forecasting (\"What if these trends continue?\"), predictive modeling (\"What will happen next?\"), and optimization (\"What's the best that can happen?\") [image7]. As one moves up these levels, the degree of intelligence applied increases, leading to higher potential business value [image7].\n\nMoving from simple reporting to deeper analysis is key to unlocking insights needed for action. Reporting is often descriptive and backward-looking, focusing on \"What?\" and raising questions, while analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking, focusing on \"Why?\" and answering questions [image5]. Analysis transforms data and information into actionable insights and recommendations [image5].\n\nManagers are expected to rely on these data insights to make informed decisions, embedding data and analytics deeply into organizational processes and decisions [12]. By leveraging higher levels of analytics (as described in image7) within the analysis and decision phases of the Analytics Value Chain (as shown in image2 and described in [1]), organizations can gain deeper insights, make better decisions, take more effective actions, and ultimately maximize their impact and achieve the desired value [1, 2, 12].\n\nThe Analytics Value Chain provides the necessary steps from data to impact, while the Levels of Analytics describe the increasing sophistication of analysis applied within the chain to maximize insight and value generation."}

Volcanoes of the world are largely concentrated along tectonic plate boundaries, forming distinct lines and clusters, particularly prominent in the Pacific Ring of Fire. Airports around the equator, however, show a more scattered distribution across the landmasses intersected by the equatorial line, reflecting the distribution of populations and transportation needs rather than geological activity. [7] highlights that geographic coordinates like longitude and latitude are key to mapping such features.\n\nIn summary, public libraries in the Netherlands appear more evenly distributed than national heritage sites which may be more clustered, while volcanoes are concentrated along geological features like the Pacific Ring of Fire, contrasting with airports near the equator which are more broadly scattered across relevant landmasses."}

He showed that parents pass heritable factors, now called genes, to offspring [4]. Offspring inherit unique sets of these genes from two parents [2], with fertilization involving the union of sperm and egg, resulting in a zygote with a diploid chromosome number, receiving one set from each parent [8].\n\nGenes exist at specific loci on chromosomes [3, 5], and different forms of a gene are called alleles. Some alleles are dominant (image3), while others are recessive [7]. For instance, the trait for earlobe shape is controlled by alleles where the allele for free earlobes is dominant (FF or Ff genotype), and the allele for attached earlobes is recessive (ff genotype) ![Shows genotypes and phenotypes for free (FF, Ff) and attached (ff) earlobes](image2). Other examples of traits showing dominant and recessive patterns include freckles versus no freckles or a widow's peak versus a straight hairline ![Compares pairs of traits like freckles, hairline, and earlobes](image5). Genotypes describe the combination of alleles, such as homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (aa), or heterozygous (Bb) ![Shows examples of homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (aa), and heterozygous (Bb) genotypes](image8).\n\nConsider Mendel's example of a monohybrid cross involving flower color in pea plants [11]. When a pure-breeding parent with purple flowers (homozygous dominant, PP) is crossed with a pure-breeding parent with white flowers (homozygous recessive, pp) in the parental (P) generation, the F₁ generation consists entirely of plants with purple flowers [11]. This occurs because the allele for purple is dominant over the allele for white ![Illustrates a genetic cross showing purple (dominant) and white (recessive) flower inheritance through P, F1, and F2 generations](image4). The F₁ plants are all heterozygous (Pp) ![Illustrates the step-by-step monohybrid cross including P, F1, F2 generations, gametes, and resulting genotypes and phenotypes](image1).\n\nMendel needed to explain why the white trait seemed to disappear in the F₁ generation [11]. When these heterozygous F₁ plants (Pp) self-pollinate, they produce gametes carrying either the 'P' or 'p' allele in equal proportions [image1]. The random combination of these gametes during fertilization in the F₂ generation results in offspring with genotypes PP, Pp, and pp [image1].\n\nThe resulting genotypic ratio in the F₂ generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp ![Illustrates the step-by-step monohybrid cross including P, F1, F2 generations, gametes, and resulting genotypes and phenotypes](image1). Because the 'P' allele is dominant, both PP and Pp genotypes express the purple phenotype, while only the pp genotype expresses the white phenotype [image1, image4]. This leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant in the F₂ generation [11, image1, image4], explaining why the white trait reappeared in one quarter of the F₂ offspring [11].\n\nMendelian inheritance, through the concepts of dominant and recessive alleles and the segregation and independent assortment of genes during gamete formation and fertilization, explains the observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross."}

In this generation, the trait that disappeared in F₁ reappeared [3]. The DNA genotype is expressed as proteins, which form the molecular basis for phenotypic traits [12]. As illustrated in the F₂ generation of the plant cross, the different combinations of alleles (different versions of a gene that may be found at the same locus on chromosomes [6]) from the F₁ parents result in a specific distribution of genotypes and phenotypes. For example, homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (pp), and heterozygous (Pp) genotypes [image8] contribute to the observable traits.\n\nIn the F₂ generation of the plant cross, the phenotypic ratio observed is 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower, and the genotypic ratio is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp."}

This has contributed to a system where patient information is often fragmented, leading to redundant and inefficient processes [1]. However, there is a clear push for improvement driven by significant business issues [6] and IT priorities [8].\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, there were shifts in what the industry considered its top business priorities. While cost pressures remained significant, concerns around patient satisfaction and reducing medical errors saw notable increases in focus. `![A bar chart showing healthcare business issues comparing 2005 and 2006 results, highlighting increases in patient satisfaction and reducing medical errors as priorities.](image3)` Specifically, reducing medical errors, which tragically account for more deaths than several other causes combined [9], increased significantly as a priority, moving from 44% in 2005 to 57% in 2006 [image3]. Improving quality of care also became a higher priority [image3].\n\nOne of the most important applications [2] and a key IT priority is the implementation of Electronic Medical Records (EMR), also known as EHR or CPR [10, 8]. While the chart showing specific clinical systems adoption indicates only a slight increase in EMR adoption from 61% in 2005 to 62% in 2006, it remained the most implemented system among those listed [image7]. CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry), another critical clinical system [10], saw a slight decrease in adoption percentage in the same period [image7].\n\nDespite the clear priorities for implementing IT systems like EMRs and reducing errors, significant barriers remain [3]. Financial support continued to be a challenge, with the percentage citing lack of financial support as a barrier increasing slightly from 18% in 2005 to 20% in 2006. Vendor's inability to effectively deliver product also saw a notable increase as a barrier [image4]. While some challenges like staffing resources and achieving end-user acceptance saw decreases [image4], the financial aspect remained a persistent hurdle. Other challenges included security concerns such as internal and external breaches, although HIPAA compliance concerns decreased between the two years. `![A bar chart showing changes in healthcare IT security and data security concerns between 2005 and 2006, including internal/external breaches and HIPAA compliance.](image2)` The adoption of certain technologies like Single Sign On and Bar Code technology did see increases, suggesting progress in some areas [image1].\n\nIn summary, between 2005 and 2006, priorities shifted further towards improving patient satisfaction and reducing medical errors, EMR adoption saw a slight increase while remaining a top system, and financial support continued to be a significant, and slightly increasing, barrier to implementation."}

It is structured in three main parts or modules, titled \"Map making workshop - from Wikidata to interactive off-Wiki maps in three steps\" [3]. The workshop covers making flat, clustered, layered, embedded, interactive, on-Wiki, and off-Wiki maps [2].\n\n![The image highlights learning objectives for map making using Wikidata across three modules: basic (flat/layered), intermediate (embedding), and advanced (off-Wiki).](image4)\n\nThe first module, \"Basic flat & layered maps,\" teaches participants to understand the steps for making basic flat and layered maps directly within Wikidata, utilizing geo-referenced items (P625) and SPARQL queries [10, 11]. Layered maps allow groups of items to be toggled on or off [11].\n![The image describes Module 1, basic, focusing on understanding steps to make basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata using geo-referenced items and SPARQL queries, overlaid on a map showing parts of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany.](image5)\n![The image shows a composite of maps, primarily of the Netherlands, with markers and a yellow box highlighting \"MODULE 1 Basic flat & layered maps\".](image8)\n\nModule 2, the intermediate step, covers embedding Wikidata-driven maps into other Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons [10, 11]. In addition to using SPARQL, this module explores OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the Mediawiki Kartographer extension [11].\n![The image shows a collage highlighting learning objectives for three modules, including Module 2 which discusses embedding maps in Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikidata.](image6)\n\nFinally, Module 3, the advanced step, focuses on creating interactive, layered Wikidata-driven maps that can be used off-Wiki, meaning in regular HTML pages [10, 11]. This involves using some basic Python and Jupyter notebooks alongside the previously mentioned tools and techniques [11]. GeoJSON data can be stored on Wikimedia Commons in the Data namespace with a `.map` suffix for use on other wikis, similar to images [5, 12].\n![The image is a promotional graphic for the \"Map making workshop from Wikidata to interactive off-Wiki maps in three steps\".](image7)\n\nTo help participants achieve these objectives, resources include access to map making resources, SPARQL examples, and Python code snippets to build upon [11]. Jupyter notebooks are provided step-by-step guides, particularly for creating off-Wiki layered maps [4, 9]. These resources, including the Jupyter notebooks, are accessible via links to Paws-public and a GitHub repository named \"WikidataMapMakingWorkshop\" [7, 8].\n![The image is a screenshot of the GitHub repository page for the \"WikidataMapMakingWorkshop\".](image3)\n\nThe workshop is designed to be approachable for beginners, providing examples and code snippets that can be easily adapted with basic SPARQL, Wikidata, and Python skills [1].\n\nThe learning objectives for map making using Wikidata involve progressing through basic flat/layered maps, embedding maps in Wikimedia projects, and creating interactive off-Wiki maps, supported by tools and resources including SPARQL, Python, Jupyter notebooks, GeoJSON, Wikimedia Commons, Kartographer, OpenStreetMap, and code examples hosted on GitHub and Paws-public."}

This module teaches how to embed the Wikidata-driven maps created in other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons [7]. It explores the use of SPARQL alongside other tools like OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the Mediawiki Kartographer extension for embedding maps [7].\n\nFinally, Module 3 is considered the advanced stage [7]. Here, the focus shifts to creating interactive, layered maps that can be used off-Wiki, specifically in regular HTML pages [7], [9]. This module builds upon the techniques from previous steps and introduces basic Python and Jupyter for creating these external maps [7].\n![This image summarizes the learning objectives for Module 1 (basic flat/layered maps in Wikidata), Module 2 (embedding maps in Wikimedia), and Module 3 (advanced off-Wiki maps).](image2)\nThe learning objectives for each module differ primarily in their complexity, the environment where the maps are utilized (on-Wiki in Wikidata and Wikimedia vs. off-Wiki in HTML), and the tools introduced, progressing from basic SPARQL queries to incorporating GeoJSON, Kartographer, Python, and Jupyter [7].\n\nThe key learning objectives progress from creating basic maps within Wikidata using SPARQL (Module 1), to embedding those maps in Wikimedia projects (Module 2), and finally to creating interactive, layered maps for use outside Wikimedia using additional tools (Module 3)."}

In many systems, such as multi-point injection (also called port injection), injectors are located in the intake manifold port going to each cylinder [5], spraying fuel into the intake port [10] and towards the intake valve [4]. In this arrangement, the injector is typically located below the throttle valve [2], as illustrated in a multi-point fuel injection diagram showing air flowing through the throttle valve first, then through the manifold to the injectors near the engine [image3].\n\nHowever, in a different configuration known as Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) [3], the injector is located differently. The injector sits on top of the inlet manifold and is located inside the throttle body [7]. This means the injector sprays fuel from above the throttle valve [8]. This system is clearly depicted in a diagram showing the injector positioned above the throttle valve within the throttle body, spraying fuel down into the intake manifold [image6]. Air enters and passes the throttle valve before the fuel is introduced by the injector located directly above it [image2]. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) controls the quantity of fuel injected based on parameters like throttle pedal position and air intake [1], by controlling the opening of the injector [6, 11].\n\nThe throttle valve is placed beneath the fuel injector in a Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) system."}

Enterprise-Wide Clinical Information Sharing and Clinical Data Repository systems also showed minor decreases [6]. Interestingly, Digital Picture Archiving (PACS) saw a significant increase in adoption, jumping from 26% to 42% [6]. Ambulatory Systems adoption decreased from 22% to 17% [6]. These systems are among the types of computerized medical information [2] being implemented, including patient registration/demographics, billing, CPOE, EMR/EHR/CPR, and pharmacy systems [12], as well as lab systems, imaging systems, telemedicine, and decision support [4].\n\nHowever, significant barriers continued to impede broader IT implementation [11].\n![The bar chart compares the percentage of various challenges faced in IT implementation between 2005 and 2006.](image2)\nThe lack of financial support remained a top barrier, increasing slightly from 18% to 20% [2]. Vendor's inability to effectively deliver product also became a more significant concern, rising from 12% to 18% [2]. While the lack of staffing resources decreased as a barrier from 17% to 13%, difficulty achieving end-user acceptance also saw a decrease from 11% to 8% [2]. Lack of clinical leadership increased from 8% to 10%, and laws prohibiting technology sharing appeared as a new concern in 2006 at 4% [2]. These barriers exist within a context where healthcare is noted as being significantly behind other industries in IT adoption [8].\n\nSecurity concerns represented another category of barrier [1].\n![The bar chart compares percentages of top IT and data security concerns between 2005 and 2006.](image4)\nInternal Breach of Security remained the top concern, though it decreased from 56% to 51% [4].

Concerns regarding external breaches, unauthorized use of data by third parties, and connecting IT at hospital and remote facilities all decreased as well [4]. Patients' lack of confidence in security increased from 8% to 10%, and physician's lack of confidence was reported at 7% in 2006 [4]. Organizations were actively implementing security measures like firewalls, user access controls, and audit logs, with intentions to continue strengthening capabilities like disaster recovery [7].\n\nThe business issues facing healthcare [3], such as reducing medical errors [5], improving quality of care, and patient satisfaction, were significant drivers for IT adoption [8].\n![The bar chart compares percentages of top business issues facing healthcare between 2005 and 2006.](image8)\nReducing medical errors was the most important business issue in 2006 at 57%, and patient satisfaction also increased to 51% [8].

This is clearly illustrated with hot dog consumption. Consuming the first hot dog might provide significant positive utility, but subsequent hot dogs provide less and less satisfaction [image8 shows diminishing returns from +10 down to -10 utility]. Eventually, consuming more can even result in negative utility [image8 shows negative utility; image1 shows utility dropping to -50 for the 66th hot dog]. This decline in enjoyment or utility suggests that focusing excessively on consuming more of the same item can be detrimental in standard contexts [6].\n\n![A table showing diminishing marginal utility and a dramatic increase in utility at a high number of hot dogs tied to a championship](image1)\n\nHowever, the dynamic shifts in a competitive context. While diminishing marginal utility still applies to the physical act of consumption, the *outcome* and the *cumulative experience* can dramatically alter the perceived utility. In competition, focusing or practicing (which involves repeated 'consumption' of the activity or item) may not lead to the expected drop in utility, but potentially the opposite [9]. Focused practice can increase utility through improved activity experience due to accumulated skill (consumption capital) and improved activity outcome due to cumulative experience (human production capital) [11]. For instance, tying a competitor for a championship after consuming a large number of hot dogs, as depicted in the example, can suddenly transform a situation of extreme physical discomfort and negative utility into one with immense positive utility (+5000 utility jump at 64 hot dogs consumed), overriding the standard diminishing returns [image1]. This suggests that in competition, the utility derived is not solely from the consumption itself but is heavily influenced by the potential for competitive mastery and favorable outcomes [12].\n\nDiminishing marginal utility in standard consumption means utility drops with more consumption, whereas in competition, outcomes and accumulated skill can override this, potentially increasing utility even during extreme consumption."}

It consists of two main stages [5]. The first stage is Interphase, which is the period for duplication of cell contents [2, image1].\n\n![The cell cycle is diagrammed with Interphase and Mitotic Phase as main stages, showing sub-phases G1, S, G2, Mitosis, and Cytokinesis](image1)\n\nInterphase is further divided into sub-phases: G₁, S, and G₂ [2, image1]. During the G₁ phase, the cell experiences growth and an increase in cytoplasm [2, image1]. The S phase is when the duplication of chromosomes occurs, involving DNA synthesis [1, 2, 7, 8, image1]. Following the S phase is the G₂ phase, where the cell continues to grow and prepares for division [2, image1]. To prepare for division, the chromatin becomes highly compact, and chromosomes become visible [8].\n\n![The image shows a diagram of a chromosome and its splitting for distribution to daughter cells](image2)\n\nThe second main stage is the Mitotic phase [image1]. This phase is dedicated to cell division [4, image1]. The Mitotic phase consists of two sub-phases: Mitosis and Cytokinesis [4, image1]. Mitosis is specifically the division of the nucleus, where the duplicated chromosomes are segregated [4, image1, image6]. Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm, which typically follows mitosis and results in the formation of two daughter cells [4, image1].\n\n![The image shows a microscopic view of a cell, likely during interphase or a mitotic stage, highlighting the nucleus and cytoskeleton](image3)\n\nThe main stages of the cell cycle are Interphase and the Mitotic phase, with Interphase having sub-phases G1, S, and G2, and the Mitotic phase including Mitosis and Cytokinesis."}
