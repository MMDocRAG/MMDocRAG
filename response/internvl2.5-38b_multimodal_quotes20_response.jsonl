Currently, 46% say the Islamic religion is more likely than others to encourage violence among its believers; about as many (45%) say the Islamic religion does not encourage violence more than other religions. The share of the public saying that Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence has dropped four percentage points since a historical high of 50% in September 2014. For much of the past decade, public views on this measure have been closely divided. The partisan divide over whether Islam encourages violence is now as wide as it has ever been. Fully 68% of Republicans say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, a historical high but little changed since last fall. By contrast, just 30% of Democrats say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, down from 42% in September 2014, but on par with Democratic opinion at other points in recent years. The share of liberals saying Islam is more likely to encourage violence is down 14 points since the fall of 2014. About two-thirds (68%) of Republicans say Islam is more likely to encourage violence, little changed from September 2014 (67%), but the highest share saying this on a question that dates to 2002. In contrast, the share of Democrats associating Islam with violence has declined 12 percentage points since last year, from 42% to 30%. Ideological divides are even starker, and growing: About three-quarters (77%) of conservative Republicans say that Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions (just 16% say it does not).

Most prominently, they are roughly twice as likely to express worry (72%) than enthusiasm (33%) about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans. They are also around three times as likely to express worry (67%) than enthusiasm (22%) about algorithms that can make hiring decisions without any human involvement. By comparison, public views towards driverless vehicles and robot caregivers exhibit more balance between worry and enthusiasm. A majority of Americans are broadly familiar with the notion that automation may impact a wide range of human employment, and most consider the concept to be generally realistic. Fully 85% of the public has heard or read about this concept before, with 24% indicating they have heard or read “a lot” about it. A roughly comparable share (77%) thinks this idea is at least somewhat realistic, and one-in-five indicate that the concept seems extremely realistic to them. One-in-five Americans find the concept of machines doing most human jobs in the future to be extremely realistic. For the most part, Americans consider this scenario to be plausible; express more worry than enthusiasm about the prospect of machines performing many human jobs; and anticipate more negative than positive outcomes from this development. They strongly favor the notion that machines might be limited to jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans, and they offer somewhat more measured support for other types of interventions to limit the impact of widespread automation, such as the enactment of a universal basic income or national service program for displaced workers. And although they view certain jobs as being more at risk than others, a significant majority of today’s workers express little concern that their own jobs or careers might be performed by machines in their lifetimes. Beyond the examples noted above, Americans anticipate significant changes to the nature of jobs and work in the coming decades as a result of automation. Overall, roughly three-quarters of Americans (77%) think it’s realistic that robots and computers might one day be able to do many of the jobs currently done by humans, with 20% describing this prospect as extremely realistic. And substantial shares of Americans anticipate that automation will impact a number of specific career fields over the course of their lifetimes. Sizable majorities expect that jobs such as fast food workers and insurance claims processors will be impacted by automation.

Additionally, 60% of Americans support providing all Americans with a guaranteed income to meet their basic needs, and 58% support a national service program that would pay humans to perform jobs even if machines could do them faster or cheaper.

Among partisans, majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their party as having high ethical standards, but there are sizable educational differences in early midterm vote preferences. The survey also shows that 34% of independents say neither party has high ethical standards, compared to 19% of Republicans and 18% of Democrats. The data suggests that education level and political affiliation play a significant role in shaping perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences. ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image1) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image2) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image3) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image4) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image5) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image6) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image7) ![Perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary among different education levels and political affiliations](image8) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ["}

According to the data, a majority of the public expresses at least some confidence in Trump's ability to make good decisions about economic policy, with 53% expressing confidence and 46% expressing little or no confidence. However, there are deep partisan divisions on these measures, with 75% of Republicans giving the administration high marks on ethical standards, while 86% of Democrats rate its ethical standards negatively. This indicates that while there is some level of confidence in Trump's economic policy decisions, there is a stark contrast in the perception of his ethical standards between Republicans and Democrats. The data also shows that conservative Republicans are more likely to express positive views of the ethical standards of Trump administration officials, with only 15% expressing negative views, compared to 36% of moderate and liberal Republicans. This further highlights the partisan divide in perceptions of Trump's ethical standards. In summary, while there is some level of confidence in Trump's economic policy decisions, there is a significant partisan divide in the perception of his ethical standards, with Republicans generally expressing more positive views and Democrats expressing more negative views.

In November 2008, nearly six-in-ten (59%) Republicans and Republican leaners were more favorably disposed to their party's leaders working with Obama, while 36% wanted them to \"stand up\" to the new president. In contrast, in 2016, Democratic support for cooperation with the president-elect was substantially less than GOP support for working with Obama eight years ago. About half of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (49%) say Democratic leaders in Washington should move in a more liberal direction, while nearly as many (47%) favor a more moderate approach. Following Obama’s victories, majorities favored the party’s leaders moving in a more moderate direction (57% in both 2012 and 2008). In 2008, as Barack Obama was first preparing to enter office, nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of Obama’s voters said that Democratic leaders in Washington should work with Republicans even at the risk of disappointing their supporters, and a similar proportion of McCain’s voters (76%) said the same. In 2016, however, few Trump voters have a positive view of Trump reaching across partisan lines for appointments to his administration. In November 2016, 55% of all voters said that Democratic leaders should stand up to Donald Trump on issues that are important to Democratic supporters, even if it means less gets done in Washington, while 33% wanted the party’s leaders to work with Trump if it means disappointing Democrats.

The 2016 presidential campaign was viewed as extraordinarily negative, with 92% of voters saying there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning than in past elections, which is 20 percentage points higher than the previous high after the 2004 election. This negative perception extended to the way the winning candidate, the parties, the press, and the pollsters conducted themselves during the campaign, with post-election evaluations being far more negative than after any election dating back to 1988. Both political parties received their lowest grades ever for their conduct during the campaign, with only about a quarter giving an A or B to the Republican Party (22%) and the Democratic Party (26%). Similarly, voters gave abysmal grades to the press and pollsters, with just 22% giving the press a grade of an A or B, while 38% gave it a failing grade. Pollsters received even lower grades, with fewer voters awarding grades of A or B (21%) than a grade of F (30%). This widespread dissatisfaction with the conduct of the campaign and the political entities involved reflects the highly negative nature of the 2016 election. ![92% of voters say there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning than in past elections](image1) ![Voters give low grades to the Republican and Democratic parties](image4) ![Voters give low grades to the press and pollsters](image4) ![Voters feel uneasy, hopeful, scared, sad, proud, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump's election](image5) ![Voters feel hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared, and angry about Trump"}

The data suggests that while there is significant concern about issues related to China, confidence in Biden’s ability to address these issues is relatively low. ![Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China than on other foreign policy issues](image1) ![The loss of U.S. jobs to China](image2) ![Cyberattacks from China](image2) ![China's growing military power](image2) ![China's policies on human rights](image2) ![Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China than on other foreign policy issues](image6) ![Cyberattacks from China](image7) ![China's growing military power](image7) ![China's policies on human rights](image7) ![Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China than on other foreign policy issues](image8) ![Cyberattacks from China](image7) ![China's growing military power](image7) ![China's policies on human rights](image7) ![Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China than on other foreign policy issues](image8) ![Cyberattacks from China](image7) ![China's growing military power](image7) ![China's policies on human rights](image7) ![Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China than on other foreign policy issues](image8) ![Cyberattacks from China](image7) ![China's growing military power](image7) ![China's policies on human rights](image7) ![Americans have less faith in Biden to deal with China than on other foreign policy issues](image8) ![Cyberattacks from China](image7)"}

In 2000, only 31% of Latinos expected their family's finances to improve, which increased to 43% by 2015. This trend is reflected in the image1, which shows a steady increase in the percentage of Latinos expecting financial improvement over the years. Additionally, the unemployment rate for Latinos has decreased from a high of 12.8% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2015, as depicted in image7. This decline in unemployment aligns with the growing confidence in financial well-being, indicating a positive shift in economic conditions for the Latino community during this period. The data from image8 further supports this trend, showing a significant increase in the percentage of Latinos expecting their family's finances to improve from 23% in 2008 to 40% in 2015. This comprehensive analysis highlights the positive economic outlook and improved financial perceptions among Latinos from 2000 to 2015."}

According to the data, the Hispanic unemployment rate has improved since the Great Recession, falling from a high of 12.8% in 2010 to 6.4% in 2015, but it remains above its low of 5% in 2006 and higher than that for non-Hispanic workers. This indicates a slower recovery in employment for Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics. \n\nEconomic perceptions among Hispanics have become more positive over time, with 72% expecting their children to be better off financially than they themselves are now, compared to 31% in 2004. This optimism contrasts with the general public's view, which has become less positive since 2004. Despite this optimism, the median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, and the Hispanic poverty rate is 23.6%, higher than pre-recession levels. \n\nThe data also shows that Hispanic households experienced the largest percentage decline in their net worth through 2009 of any major racial or ethnic group, and unlike white households, their net worth continued to fall after the recession. This suggests that Hispanics have faced greater economic challenges and have not fully recovered from the recession, leading to persistent income and wealth disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. \n\nIn summary, while the Hispanic unemployment rate has improved, it remains higher than that of non-Hispanics, and economic perceptions are more positive among Hispanics. However, income and wealth disparities persist, with Hispanics experiencing a larger decline in net worth and higher poverty rates compared to non-Hispanics. \n\n![Hispanic unemployment rate has improved but remains higher than non-Hispanic workers](image8)\n![Hispanics have more positive economic perceptions but face income and wealth disparities](image7)"}

In 2008, only 23% of Latinos rated their personal finances as excellent or good, but by 2015, this figure had risen to 40%. This represents a 17 percentage point increase. In contrast, the share of all Americans with a similarly positive view of their finances remained essentially flat during the same period, with only a slight increase from 41% in 2008 to 43% in 2015. \n\nRegarding family income relative to the cost of living, in 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos said their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, while 37% said their income was staying about even with the cost of living, and 10% said it was going up faster than the cost of living. This is similar to the views of blacks and whites on this issue. However, between 2014 and 2015, Hispanic views of family income in relation to the cost of living were unchanged, with about half of all Hispanic adults in both years saying they were falling behind financially, as was true for the U.S. public as a whole. \n\nOverall, the data suggests that while there have been improvements in perceptions of personal financial situations among Latino groups, concerns about family income relative to the cost of living remain significant. The improvements in personal financial perceptions are more pronounced among younger Latinos, with about half (48%) of Latinos ages 18 to 29 reporting that they were in excellent or good financial shape in 2015, a 27 percentage point increase from 2008. This is more than double the share who had a similarly positive view of their finances in 2008. \n\nIn summary, while there have been notable improvements in perceptions of personal financial situations among Latino groups from 2008 to 2015, concerns about family income relative to the cost of living remain a significant issue. The improvements are more pronounced among younger Latinos, but the overall picture suggests that there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving financial stability and security for all Latino groups. \n\n![Hispanic views of family income in relation to the cost of living were unchanged between 2014 and 2015](image1)\n!["}

Workers express more positive than negative views on the overall impact of technology on their careers, but they also express mixed opinions on how today's technologies have impacted their own jobs and careers. The survey finds that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment, and that workforce automation has already impacted a minority of today's workers in the form of lost jobs or wages. The current generation of workforce technologies has had widely disparate impacts on today's workers, with those who have not attended college being much less likely to view today's workforce technologies in a positive light. The survey also finds that the current generation of workforce automation technologies often focus on their impact on manufacturing employment and productivity, but the coming wave of advances in automation offers the potential for even greater disruption of traditional modes of work. Developments in sensors and robotics may potentially reduce the need for humans in a variety of physical applications, from taxi and truck drivers to retail store employees, and multipurpose artificial intelligence and machine learning technology may dramatically alter or make redundant a wide range of white-collar jobs. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have the potential to automate a wide range of human activities and to dramatically reshape the way that Americans live and work in the coming decades. A Pew Research Center survey of 4,135 U.S. adults conducted May 1-15, 2017, finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes, from the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers. Although they expect certain positive outcomes from these developments, their attitudes more frequently reflect worry and concern over the implications of these technologies for society as a whole.

This indicates a significant partisan divide in views on Wall Street's impact on the economy.\n\nIn terms of satisfaction levels regarding national conditions over the years, the data shows that public satisfaction with the way things are going in the country has been consistently low, with no more than about a third of Americans expressing satisfaction at any point during the past decade. As of the latest survey, only 26% of Americans are satisfied with the state of the nation, while 70% are dissatisfied. This dissatisfaction is higher than at any point in the past year and has increased by 9 percentage points since September.

The image quotes, particularly image1 and image5, show a general trend of decreasing satisfaction over time, with a significant drop in 2019. This decline is more pronounced among Democrats, as seen in image1 and image6, where their satisfaction levels are consistently lower than those of Republicans.\n\nPolitical affiliations have also become more polarized, especially in terms of views on Wall Street's impact on the economy. The text quotes [6], [7], and [8] highlight this polarization, with Republicans more likely to believe Wall Street helps the economy and Democrats more divided. This is visually represented in image8, which shows that 55% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, compared to 41% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.\n\nThe impact of these trends is a deepening divide between the two major political parties in the United States, with Republicans and Democrats holding increasingly divergent views on economic issues and the role of Wall Street in the economy. This polarization is likely to influence policy debates and political discourse, as each party seeks to appeal to its base and advance its economic agenda. The data suggests that this divide is not only a reflection of differing economic philosophies but also a symptom of broader political and social cleavages in American society. \n\nIn summary, public satisfaction levels have declined, and political affiliations have become more polarized, particularly in terms of views on Wall Street's impact on the economy.

Democrats are more unified in their concern that restrictions have been lifted too quickly, with 90% of liberal Democrats and 88% of conservative and moderate Democrats expressing this view.\n\n- **General Public**: Overall, 69% of Americans are more concerned that state governments have been lifting restrictions too quickly. This concern is higher among Black adults (84%) and Hispanic adults (72%) compared to white adults (65%).\n\n- **Testing and Infections**: The general public is divided on whether the increase in confirmed cases is due to more testing or more new infections, with 60% attributing it to more testing and 39% to more new infections. However, this view is more prevalent among Republicans (62%) than Democrats (19%).\n\n- **Economic Recovery**: There is a significant partisan divide on the best way to help the U.S. economy recover. Republicans are more likely to believe that significantly reducing coronavirus infections to a level where more people feel comfortable going to stores, schools, and other workplaces is the more effective way (53% among those living in counties where deaths resulting from COVID-19 have been higher). Democrats are more likely to believe that the primary reason confirmed coronavirus cases have increased is more new infections, not just more tests (77%).\n\n- **Trust in Leaders**: Trust in leaders and institutions also varies by political affiliation. For instance, 87% of Democrats and 90% of Republicans trust hospitals and medical centers in their area, but only 37% of the public trusts Donald Trump to handle the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely to attribute the rise"}

Democrats overwhelmingly attribute the rise in cases to more infections, not just more testing, and are more concerned that state restrictions have been lifted too quickly. In contrast, Republicans are more divided, with a majority saying the increase in cases is primarily due to more people being tested. This division is reflected in their concerns about lifting restrictions, with Democrats more likely to express concern about restrictions being lifted too quickly, while Republicans are more evenly split, with a slight majority expressing concern about restrictions not being lifted quickly enough. The partisan gap is particularly wide on the issue of whether lifting restrictions too quickly is a major reason for the continuation of the outbreak, with 82% of Democrats and only 31% of Republicans holding this view.

Women comprise 47% of all employed adults today, up modestly from 45% in 1990, and they make up half of all employed adults in STEM jobs in the U.S. The share of women in STEM overall is driven in large part by women's overrepresentation in health-related jobs, the largest STEM occupational cluster. Three-quarters of healthcare practitioners and technicians are women. Racial and ethnic diversity in STEM is also varied. Black and Hispanic workers remain underrepresented overall; these groups are also underrepresented among those in STEM jobs with professional or doctoral degrees. Asians are overrepresented across all STEM occupational clusters and have an especially large presence in the college-educated STEM workforce, particularly in computer occupations, relative to their share among employed college graduates overall. Although women have made gains in representation in the STEM workforce over the past roughly 25 years, particularly in life and physical science jobs, they remain strongly underrepresented in some STEM job clusters, notably computer jobs and engineering.

Similarly, the share of Hispanics who feel connected to their country of origin decreases from 82% among immigrants to 69% among the second generation and 44% among the third generation. This decline in Spanish use and connection to ancestral origins is consistent with the broader trend of assimilation and integration into American society across generations. The data also shows that while there is widespread support for the continued use of Spanish among future generations of Hispanics, the actual proficiency in Spanish declines sharply with each successive generation. This suggests that while the desire to maintain cultural ties remains strong, the practical ability to do so through language use diminishes over time.

According to the text and image evidence provided:\n\n1. **Positional Encodings**:\n   - **Spatial Positional Encodings**: The model's AP is notably affected by the use of spatial positional encodings. As shown in [3] and [6], removing spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, indicating their importance. The detailed description in [5] and the visualization in image1 highlight the role of positional encodings in the transformer architecture.\n   - **Output Positional Encodings**: These are crucial for the model's performance, as indicated in [6]. The model still achieves a high AP even when output positional encodings are passed only at the decoder input, but the best performance is observed when they are added to queries at every decoder attention layer.\n\n2. **Loss Components**:\n   - The combination of class and bounding box loss components, as described in [7], is critical for the model's performance. The text mentions that the model achieves a high AP with a set-based loss, which does not require Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) by design.\n   - The impact of different loss components is further illustrated in image4, where the AP and AP50 values increase with each additional decoder layer, demonstrating the importance of these components in improving detection accuracy.\n\n3. **Decoder Layers**:\n   - The number of decoder layers also plays a significant role in the model's performance. As shown in [11] and image4, each additional decoder layer improves the AP and AP50, with a total improvement of +8.2/9.5 AP between the first and last layer. This indicates that deeper models can capture more complex relationships between object features.\n\n4. **Generalization and Specialization**:\n   - The model's ability to generalize to unseen numbers of instances, as discussed in [2] and illustrated in image2, shows that the model can handle varying numbers of objects in an image without significant performance drops.

Specifically, ProgramFC achieves higher F1 scores than FLAN-T5 for both 2-hop and 3-hop claims, and it performs comparably to FLAN-T5 for 4-hop claims. Additionally, ProgramFC demonstrates better retrieval recall compared to one-step retrieval, with the largest improvement observed on the HOVER 4-hop dataset. This suggests that ProgramFC's iterative retrieval guided by reasoning programs yields better results than one-step retrieval. The observed retrieval recall differences between ProgramFC and one-step retrieval are significant, with ProgramFC outperforming one-step retrieval on all datasets, particularly on the HOVER 4-hop dataset. This indicates that iterative retrieval guided by reasoning programs is more effective than one-step retrieval for complex fact-checking tasks. The ProgramFC model's ability to decompose complex claims into simpler steps with a program facilitates more accurate reasoning, leading to higher F1 scores and better retrieval recall compared to FLAN-T5 and one-step retrieval. The ProgramFC model's performance is particularly notable for 4-hop claims, where it achieves a 14.9% improvement in the gold evidence setting and a 6.7% improvement in the open-book setting compared to FLAN-T5.

This highlights the difficulty of generating the appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for claims that require long-chain reasoning. An example structural error is shown in Figure 6, where the model fails to parse the second sentence of the claim into correct program instructions. Additional error examples can be found in Appendix C.\n\n- **Model Performance**: On the HOVER dataset, ProgramFC outperforms the baselines on average by 10.38%, 11.37%, and 14.77% on two-hop, three-hop, and four-hop claims, respectively. This suggests that ProgramFC becomes increasingly effective as the required reasoning depth increases. Among the baselines, DeBERTaV3-NLI performs comparably to ProgramFC on two-hop claims, indicating that large-scale pre-training on simpler claims can help the model generalize to more complex claims. The results indicate that ProgramFC effectively balances model capability, learning efficiency, and interpretability. \n\n- **ProgramFC**: ProgramFC is a few-shot neuro-symbolic model for fact-checking that learns to map input claims to a reasoning program consisting of a sequence of sub-task function calls for answering a question, for fact-checking a simple claim, and for computing a logical expression. Then fact-checking is performed by executing that program. ProgramFC combines the advantages of symbolic programs, such as explainability, with the flexibility of end-to-end neural models. Using Codex as the program generator, ProgramFC demonstrates promising performance on HOVER and FEVEROUS with only a small number of in-context demonstrations and no additional training. The results indicated that ProgramFC effectively balances model capability, learning efficiency, and interpretability. \n\n- **InstructGPT**: InstructGPT uses four different prompts: direct prompting with the claim, CoT (chain-of-thought prompting with demonstrations), ZS-CoT (zero-shot chain-of-thought with the prompt “let’s think step by step”), and Self-Ask (a variant of CoT that guides the model reasoning by asking a series of questions). The detailed prompting templates are given in Appendix E. \n\n- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained models use pretrained Transformers such as BERT and T5 for fact-checking."}

Here's a detailed interleaved response:\n\n1. **Instruction Formats and Demonstration Selections**:\n   - **Image7** shows the performance of ChatGPT and Codex on the FewNERD dataset with different instruction formats and demonstration selections. The box plots indicate that the F1 score varies with different instruction formats and demonstration numbers. For instance, the F1 score for ChatGPT and Codex is higher with certain instruction formats and demonstration numbers, suggesting that these factors significantly impact performance.\n\n2. **Comparison with Other Models**:\n   - **Image1** provides a comparative analysis of various models, including ChatGPT and Codex, on the FewNERD dataset. The graph shows that the performance of these models varies with the number of shots (1-shot, 5-shot, 10-shot, 20-shot). For example, the F1 score for ChatGPT and Codex is generally lower compared to other models like Fine-tuning, FSL, and UIE, especially as the number of shots increases.\n\n3. **Inference Speed and Costs**:\n   - **Text Quote [4]** mentions that LLMs, including ChatGPT and Codex, incur greater inference latency and costs than fine-tuned SLMs. This is an important consideration when comparing the performance of these models, as it affects their practical applicability.\n\n4. **Performance Dynamics with Sample Size**:\n   - **Text Quote [5]** discusses the performance dynamics of SLMs and LLMs with variations in sample size. It indicates that LLMs sometimes present superior performance than SLMs under extremely low-resource settings (1-shot or 5-shot), but tend to reach a performance plateau with only modest increases in sample size. In contrast, SLMs demonstrate marked performance enhancement as sample sizes grow.\n\n5. **Utilization of Annotations**:\n   - **Text Quote [6]** highlights that LLMs appear to benefit less from additional annotations (more training samples and label types) than SLMs. This suggests that LLMs are constrained by in-context learning (ICL) in two ways: the number of effective samples for LLMs is limited by maximum input length, and LLMs struggle with fine-grained datasets.\n\n6. **Prompt Variations**"}

This indicates that GPT-4 performs better than InstructGPT in the zero-shot 3-class classification task.\n\nThe confusion matrices in Figure 4 provide insights into the types of errors that contribute to the performance differences between InstructGPT and GPT-4. InstructGPT tends to classify supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information), while GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted.

InstructGPT tends to be less confident, frequently classifying supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information) [1]. This pattern suggests that InstructGPT struggles with distinguishing between verifiable claims and those that lack sufficient information. In contrast, GPT-4 shows overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [1]. This indicates that GPT-4 may have difficulty in accurately identifying claims that cannot be verified with the given information.\n\nThe confusion matrices for both models highlight these differences. InstructGPT's matrix shows a higher percentage of NEI predictions, reflecting its tendency to err on the side of caution. GPT-4's matrix, on the other hand, shows a higher percentage of incorrect classifications between supported and refuted claims, indicating its overconfidence in making definitive judgments [3].\n\nThe error types further elucidate these tendencies. InstructGPT's errors are primarily due to grounding errors, where it incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, and ambiguity errors, where it fails to represent ambiguous expressions in the claims [12]. GPT-4's errors, while not explicitly detailed, can be inferred to be more related to overconfidence and misclassification, as it tends to incorrectly categorize NEI claims.\n\nThese differences suggest that InstructGPT's cautious approach may lead to higher accuracy in identifying NEI claims but at the cost of potentially missing supported or refuted claims. GPT-4's overconfidence, while potentially leading to more definitive classifications, may result in a higher rate of incorrect categorizations, particularly for NEI claims. This analysis underscores the importance of balancing confidence and accuracy in zero-shot classification tasks, especially when dealing with complex and ambiguous scientific claims. \n\nIn summary, InstructGPT's performance is characterized by caution and a higher rate of NEI predictions, while GPT-4's performance is marked by overconfidence and a higher rate of incorrect categorizations between supported and refuted claims.

This embedding is then navigated through a previously constructed memory index to identify the top-k similar images, which serve as a preliminary filter to narrow down the possibilities to those most likely relevant based on historical data and the semantic closeness of stored labels to the image content. The retrieved top-k categories are then sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt, where the MLLMs, combining their internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category. This process ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction, enhancing the system's ability to handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision and flexibility. Additionally, the system employs a blurring technique on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks.

CHAI instructions often require multiple intermediate goals, as seen in the household instruction example in Figure 1, which can be decomposed into eight goals. In contrast, LANI instructions typically include a single goal. This complexity is reflected in the mean number of instructions per paragraph, which is 7.7 for CHAI compared to 4.7 for LANI (image4).\n\n2. **Performance Metrics**: The performance metrics used for evaluation are different for the two datasets. For LANI, the metrics are stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC). For CHAI, the metrics are stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA). This difference in metrics reflects the different nature of the tasks: LANI focuses on navigation, while CHAI includes both navigation and manipulation tasks.\n\n3. **Model Performance**: The performance of the models on the two datasets varies. For instance, the 'Our Approach' model has a lower stop distance (SD) on LANI (8.43) compared to CHAI (3.34), indicating better navigation performance on LANI. However, the manipulation accuracy (MA) on CHAI is higher for 'Our Approach' (39.97) compared to the stop distance (SD) on LANI (36.9), suggesting that the model performs better on manipulation tasks in CHAI than on navigation tasks in LANI.\n\n4. **Human Performance**: Human performance also differs between the two datasets.

The manipulation accuracy (MA) on CHAI is 100%, showing that humans can perfectly perform the manipulation tasks in CHAI.\n\n5. **Ambiguity and Challenges**: The inherent ambiguity in instruction following makes exact goal identification difficult, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance. The gap to human-level performance still remains large across both tasks, indicating that both tasks are largely open problems.\n\nIn summary, the key differences in task completion and performance metrics between the LANI and CHAI datasets are due to the different nature of the tasks, with CHAI being more complex and involving"}

The model achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements over previous models. For instance, on ACE04, DyGIE achieves an entity F1 score of 87.4 and a relation F1 score of 59.7, outperforming Bekoulis et al. (2018) and Miwa and Bansal (2016). On ACE05, DyGIE's entity F1 score is 88.4, and its relation F1 score is 63.2, surpassing Zhang et al. (2017) and Sanh et al. (2019). In the GENIA dataset, DyGIE's entity F1 score is 76.2, and its relation F1 score is 64.1, outperforming Kulkarni et al. (2018). The CorefProp and RelProp components play a crucial role in these variations. CorefProp significantly improves entity extraction performance, especially in datasets with overlapping entities, such as ACE04 and ACE05. RelProp enhances both entity and relation extraction, particularly in sentences with multiple relation instances across different entities. The model's performance is further improved by the dynamic span graph approach, which allows for richer span representations and better interaction across tasks. The addition of co-reference and relation propagation across sentences adds only a small computation cost to inference, making the model efficient and scalable. Overall, the DyGIE model's performance on entity and relation extraction is highly competitive and demonstrates the value of coupling related tasks to learn richer span representations.

Similarly, for RelProp, the F1 score for relation extraction also improves with the number of iterations, peaking at the second iteration (M=2) as shown in Figure 3b.

The company's foreign exchange risk is the most important financial risk, and it can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Novo Nordisk uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on financial results, and the majority of its sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP. The foreign exchange risk is most significant in USD, CNY, and JPY, while the EUR exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy towards EUR. The company's overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results. Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward. Hedge accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. Management has chosen to classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items. The financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses. Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities. The overall policy is to hedge the majority of total currency exposure. At year-end, an immediate 5% increase/decrease in the following currencies versus EUR and DKK would impact Novo Nordisk's operating profit estimated by Management as outlined in the table below.

The stock repurchase program, as detailed in [4] and [12], allowed Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares when the repurchase price was below Berkshire's intrinsic value, conservatively determined. In 2021, Berkshire paid $27.1 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock, indicating a significant investment in the program.\n\nRegarding net earnings, the data from [1] and [8] provide insights into the performance across different segments. In 2021, net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders were $89,795 million, a substantial increase from $42,521 million in 2020 and $81,417 million in 2019. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including the recovery of many businesses from the COVID-19 pandemic effects, as mentioned in [2], and the performance of specific segments like insurance, railroad, utilities, and energy.\n\nThe insurance segment, as shown in [9] and [10], experienced fluctuations in earnings. In 2021, after-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased by 4.6% compared to 2020, but the insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million, a significant increase from $657 million in 2020 and $325 million in 2019. The railroad business saw a 16.1% increase in after-tax earnings in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher freight volumes and improved productivity.\n\nThe utilities and energy segment, as detailed in [10], also showed positive growth, with after-tax earnings increasing by 13.1% in 2021 compared to 2020. This segment benefited from higher earnings from utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business.\n\nIn summary, Berkshire Hathaway's stock repurchase program was active in 2021, with significant investments made.

The increase in total current and noncurrent liabilities is also consistent with the increase in total debt, as the majority of the increase in liabilities is due to the increase in long-term debt. Therefore, the increase in total current and noncurrent liabilities is directly related to the increase in total debt during the same period. ![Total current and noncurrent liabilities increased from $3,205 million in 2019 to $5,342 million in 2020](image3) ![Total debt increased from $21,729 million in 2019 to $21,204 million in 2020](image4) ![Long-term debt increased from $21,517 million in 2019 to $21,193 million in 2020](image2) ![Issuance of new debt securities and refinancing of existing debt](image4) ![Increase in total current and noncurrent liabilities is directly related to the increase in total debt during the same period](image3) ![Increase in total debt is likely due to the issuance of new debt securities and the refinancing of existing debt](image4) ![Increase in total current and noncurrent liabilities is consistent with the increase in long-term debt](image2) ![Increase in total debt is consistent with the increase in long-term debt](image4) ![Increase in total current and noncurrent liabilities is directly related to the increase in total debt during the same period](image3) ![Increase in total debt is likely due to the issuance of"}

The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter- company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. During 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $208 and purchased the equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner for $842, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate. The remaining noncontrolling interest represents the portion of equity interests in a consolidated joint venture that is not 100% owned by the Company. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can see the following changes in Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022:\n\n- Total stockholders' equity increased from $18,078 million in 2021 to $20,647 million in 2022.\n- Noncontrolling interests decreased from $514 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022.\n\nThese changes reflect in the comprehensive income statements as follows:\n\n- The net income attributable to Costco increased from $11,666 million in 2021 to $15,585 million in 2022.\n- The comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $514 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022.\n\nTherefore, the increase in total stockholders' equity and the decrease in noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 are consistent with the increase in net income attributable to Costco and the decrease in comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests. This suggests that Costco's financial performance improved during this period, resulting in higher stockholders' equity and lower noncontrolling interests. \n\nIn conclusion, the changes in Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncont"}

The company's financial performance and market conditions were reflected in the stock price, which showed a decline from April 2002 to March 2003, as seen in the image2. However, the directors' compensation remained relatively stable during this period. ![List of directors and their remuneration](image5) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at average of monthly high and low](image2) ![GPI vs BSE Sensex at"}

The net earnings increased by $47,274 million, which directly contributed to the growth in shareholders' equity. Additionally, the comprehensive income, which includes other comprehensive income items like unrealized gains on investments, also saw a significant increase of $46,490 million. This comprehensive income growth further bolstered the shareholders' equity. The increase in total liabilities, while smaller in comparison, may be due to various factors such as new borrowings or changes in insurance liabilities. Overall, the financial performance of the company, as reflected in the net earnings and comprehensive income, played a crucial role in the observed changes in total liabilities and shareholders' equity."}

This suggests that the company's business is growing and that it is able to generate more revenue from its existing contracts. The increase in unearned revenue also indicates that the company is able to collect more revenue in advance of recognizing it, which could be a sign of strong customer demand and confidence in the company's products and services. However, the increase in unearned revenue also means that the company has more revenue that has not yet been recognized, which could be a risk if the company is unable to deliver the products and services as promised. The company should monitor its unearned revenue closely to ensure that it is able to meet its obligations to its customers. The increase in total revenue and unearned revenue could also have implications for the company's financial position and performance. The company may need to invest more in its operations to meet the increased demand, which could impact its profitability. The company should also consider the potential risks associated with the increase in unearned revenue, such as the risk of customer cancellations or non-payment.

This reduction could be attributed to a decrease in the number of stock options granted, from 1,365 thousand in 2020 to 1,365 thousand in 2022, and a decrease in the number of RSUs and PSUs granted, from 3,237 thousand in 2020 to 2,832 thousand in 2022, as seen in image6. This suggests a more conservative approach to stock-based compensation, possibly in response to market conditions or changes in company strategy.\n\nThe net earnings per share (EPS) also show a trend of improvement. The basic EPS increased from $5.13 in 2020 to $6.00 in 2022, and the diluted EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022, as indicated in image7. This improvement in EPS could be due to a combination of factors, including increased net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding, and the impact of the prior year's loss on early debt extinguishment, as mentioned in [9].\n\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation expenses and the increase in net earnings per share suggest that Procter & Gamble has been able to maintain profitability while adjusting its compensation practices. This could be seen as a positive financial trend, indicating effective management of compensation costs and a focus on shareholder value. However, the specific reasons for these changes would require further analysis of the company's financial statements and strategic decisions. \n\nIn conclusion, the changes in stock-based compensation expenses and net earnings per share at Procter & Gamble from 2020 to 2022 reflect a mix of financial stability and strategic adjustments in compensation practices, with a trend of improving profitability and a more conservative approach to stock-based compensation. \n\n![The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted increased from $15.60 in 2020 to $21.55 in 2022](image1"}

This increase in comprehensive income can be attributed to the changes in shareholders' equity, which include the issuance of preferred shares, repurchase of common shares, and other changes such as employee plans. The issuance of preferred shares in 2021 resulted in a net increase of $1,584 million in shareholders' equity, while the repurchase of common shares resulted in a net decrease of $7,598 million. The other changes, primarily employee plans, resulted in a net increase of $227 million in shareholders' equity. These changes in shareholders' equity had a direct impact on the comprehensive income of the company, as they affected the net income and other comprehensive income (loss) of the company.

This increase in operating cash flow contributed to a higher free cash flow of $6.428 billion in 2020, up from $5.587 billion in 2019, representing a 15% increase.

This improvement was largely driven by a $1.562 billion increase in adjusted revenue from Global Markets, which rose by 27% from 2019 to 2020, as indicated in image3. The increase in adjusted revenue was attributed to higher volatility levels and increased client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, as well as strong performance in Rates due to increased trading activity in government bonds, as mentioned in [7]. Additionally, the company's cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay helped offset growth in regulatory program costs and investments in technology, contributing to the overall improvement in net operating income, as stated in [1].

The decrease in total loans was primarily due to lower loan demand, higher paydowns, and actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations. The increase in total deposits was driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Credit Risk RWA increased by $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach, primarily due to an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. This increase in Credit Risk RWA led to a higher requirement for capital buffers, as seen in the increase in the Capital Conservation Buffer and the G-SIB Capital Surcharge. Additionally, the increase in External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 indicates that the financial institution has maintained a strong capital position despite the increase in Credit Risk RWA.

This was a significant increase from 2019, where there were no impairment charges recognized.\n\n2. **Tax Expenses**:\n   - The total income tax expense for 2020 was $9,641,000, compared to $15,575,000 in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the current tax expense from $17,264,000 in 2019 to $8,775,000 in 2020.\n   - The effective tax rate (ETR) for global operations increased from 29.6% in 2019 to 46.2% in 2020, while the ETR for Australian operations increased from 27.8% in 2019 to 31.4% in 2020.\n\nThese changes reflect the company's strategic decisions and financial performance over the two-year period. The significant impairment charges in 2020 were a result of the company's decision to exit the Spanish market and write down fixed assets, key money, and lease right-of-use assets within the store network. The reduction in tax expenses was likely due to lower taxable profits and changes in the tax environment. The increase in the effective tax rate indicates a higher proportion of taxable income subject to higher tax rates. \n\nIn summary, the major changes in tax expenses and impairment charges for Lovisa Holdings between 2019 and 2020 were driven by strategic decisions, financial performance, and changes in the tax environment. The company incurred significant impairment charges in 2020, which were not present in 2019, and experienced a reduction in tax expenses and an increase in the effective tax rate. \n\n![Impairment charges and tax expenses for Lovisa Holdings between 2019 and 2020](image2)"}

This decrease was primarily due to lower interest and other investment income, which declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline in interest income was mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, and low rates prevailed through 2021. The asset composition of the insurance business also changed, with cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increasing from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, and fixed maturity securities decreasing from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and the decrease in fixed maturity securities suggest that the company is maintaining ample liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. The implications of these changes are that the company may be facing lower investment returns due to the low interest rate environment, and may need to adjust its investment strategy to maintain profitability. Additionally, the increase in cash and cash equivalents may indicate that the company is preparing for potential future investments or acquisitions. ![Net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021](image7) ![Asset composition of the insurance business changed from 2020 to 2021](image3) ![Interest and other investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021](image7) ![Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from 2020 to 2021](image3) ![Fixed maturity securities decreased from 2020 to 2021](image3) ![The company is maintaining ample liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield with respect to short-term investments](image4) ![The company may be facing lower investment returns due to the low interest rate environment](image4) ![The company may need to adjust its investment strategy to maintain profitability](image4) ![The increase in cash and cash equivalents may"}

The shipment volume of cigarettes decreased by 11.8% from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020, while the shipment volume of heated tobacco units increased by 50.8% from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020. This shift in product mix likely contributed to the overall decrease in shipment volume. Additionally, the net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs. The net cash used in investing activities also decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to the reduction of cash resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures. These changes in financial activities likely had a negative impact on the overall financial performance in Latin America & Canada. However, the increase in shipment volume of heated tobacco units may have helped to offset some of the negative impact.

The net debt (including pensions) increased from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021.

Additionally, the remaining current liabilities increased from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021, reflecting higher current provisions, current income tax liabilities, and other current liabilities.\n\nThe key components driving these changes include the acquisition of Varian, which necessitated significant financing, and the overall growth in the company's operations, leading to increased liabilities and equity.

In 2019, the net cash provided by operating activities was $10,090 million, which decreased to $9,812 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, partially offset by higher net earnings. The net cash used in investing activities decreased from $1,811 million in 2019 to $1,154 million in 2020, mainly due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures. However, this was partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets. The net cash used in financing activities increased from $8,061 million in 2019 to $8,496 million in 2020, primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity. Overall, the cash balance at the end of 2020 was $7,285 million, which was a decrease from the cash balance at the end of 2019 of $6,865 million. This decrease was primarily due to the net cash used in financing activities, which was higher than the net cash provided by operating activities and the net cash used in investing activities. The decrease in cash balance was also impacted by the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, which was $258 million in 2020 compared to $27 million in 2019.

According to the text, the Annual Total Remuneration for each director is set based on consolidated operating income and the volatility of the share price of Toyota, and then adjusted based on individual performance evaluation [1, 11]. This indicates that the remuneration is directly linked to the company's financial performance and market valuation.\n\nThe image5 further elaborates on the indicators used for evaluating Toyota's efforts. It lists \"Consolidated operating income\" as an indicator for evaluating Toyota's efforts based on business performance, and \"Volatility of Toyota's share price\" as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota's efforts [image5]. This shows that both financial performance and market perception are critical factors in the remuneration evaluation process.\n\nAdditionally, the image7 provides specific details on how these indicators are evaluated. It states that the consolidated operating income is evaluated with a 50% weight, using the required income set in 2011 as a reference value, and the volatility of Toyota's share price is also evaluated with a 50% weight, comparing the share price and the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year [image7]. This balanced approach ensures that both the company's financial health and its market valuation are considered in the remuneration evaluation.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation is a comprehensive process that integrates both financial performance and shareholder value indicators, ensuring that the remuneration reflects the company's overall success and market perception. This approach aligns with the company's goal of promoting sustainable growth and maintaining shareholder value. ![Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators](image5) ![Evaluation of consolidated operating income and volatility of Toyota's share price](image7) ![Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators](image5) ![Evaluation of consolidated operating income and volatility of Toyota's share price](image7) ![Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators](image5) ![Evaluation of consolidated operating income and volatility of Toyota's share price](image7) ![Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators](image5) ![Evaluation of consolidated operating income and volatility of Toyota's share price](image7) ![Toyota's executive remun"}

The total actuarial gains (or losses) were -22 million euros in 2021, compared to 67 million euros in 2020. This indicates a decrease in the actuarial gains, which could be due to various factors such as changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, or experience gains and losses. The decrease in actuarial gains could potentially lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligation, as the company may need to set aside more funds to meet its future pension obligations. Additionally, the changes in actuarial assumptions could also impact the plan assets, as the company may need to adjust its investment strategy to ensure that the plan assets are sufficient to meet the increased defined benefit obligation. Overall, the changes in actuarial assumptions from 2020 to 2021 had a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation and plan assets, and the company may need to take steps to address these changes and ensure that it is able to meet its future pension obligations. ![The total actuarial gains (or losses) were -22 million euros in 2021, compared to 67 million euros in 2020.](image4) ![The total plan assets were 3,259 million euros in 2021, compared to 2,813 million euros in 2020.](image6) ![The total other liabilities were 435 million euros in 2021, compared to 345 million euros in 2020.](image8) ![The total defined benefit obligation was 4,081 million euros in 2021, compared to 3,798 million euros in 2020.](image1) ![The total plan assets were 3,259 million euros in 2021, compared to 2,813 million euros in 2020.](image6) ![The total other liabilities were 435 million euros in 2021, compared to 345 million euros in 2020.](image8) ![The total defined benefit obligation was 4,081 million euros in 2021, compared to 3,"}

The RWA increased from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020 under the Standardized Approach, and from $382,496 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020 under the Advanced Approach. This increase in RWA led to a decrease in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. The increase in RWA was primarily driven by an increase in Derivatives exposures, Investment securities, and Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments. The increase in RWA also led to an increase in the External TLAC as a percentage of leverage exposure from 17.0% in 2019 to 18.1% in 2020. The increase in RWA and the decrease in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA highlight the importance of managing RWA and maintaining sufficient TLAC to meet regulatory requirements. The changes in RWA and TLAC also have implications for the firm's capital adequacy and risk management. The firm must ensure that it maintains sufficient TLAC to absorb potential losses and meet regulatory requirements, while also managing its RWA to optimize its capital structure and risk profile. The firm's ability to manage its RWA and TLAC will be critical in maintaining its financial stability and meeting the expectations of its stakeholders. The firm's management of RWA and TLAC will also be closely monitored by regulators and investors, who will be looking for evidence of the firm's ability to manage its risk and maintain its financial stability.

The net interest income decreased by $2.9 billion or 9.5% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies. This decrease was partly offset by interest income associated with the increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) of $170.1 billion or 8.8%. The interest expense also decreased by $2.9 billion year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts, which increased by $142.9 billion. These changes in net interest income and interest expense contributed to a decrease in net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges/loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions, which was $12.645 billion in 2020 compared to $14.926 billion in 2019. The overall profitability of the organization was also impacted, with the return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 being 3.1%, significantly lower than the original target of between 10% and 12% in 2022. The decrease in net operating income and the lower RoTE indicate that the organization faced challenges in maintaining profitability amidst the changes in interest rates and the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. ![Net interest income and interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image1) ![Net operating income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image5) ![Return on average tangible equity decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image7) ![Net interest income and interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image6) ![Net interest income and interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image8) ![Net interest income and interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image2) ![Net interest income and interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019](image3) ![Net interest income and interest expense decreased in 2"}

This decline was attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as well as low interest rates prevailing through 2021. The increase in railroad operating earnings was driven by higher volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit, and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume-related costs. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected volumes in 2020, and the revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain.

This distribution shows a significant increase in expenses across all segments, with Wealth Management having the highest expenses. The increase in total recognized compensation expenses can be attributed to higher revenues, higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, and incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest. The distribution of expenses across different business segments indicates that Wealth Management has the highest expenses, followed by Institutional Securities and Investment Management. This trend suggests that the company is investing more in its Wealth Management segment, which may be due to the E*TRADE acquisition and the need to integrate and compensate the acquired employees. The increase in expenses across all segments also reflects the company's growth and expansion in the financial services industry. The distribution of expenses across different business segments provides insight into the company's strategic priorities and resource allocation. The significant increase in expenses in the Wealth Management segment may indicate a focus on expanding the company's wealth management services and attracting and retaining top talent in this area.

The inventories, as shown in image6, also saw an increase from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020.

This is further supported by the increase in long-term debt of $1,361 million, which suggests that IBM has been able to secure additional financing to support its growth initiatives. The decrease in total equity of $258 million, however, indicates that IBM has been using its cash flows to pay dividends and invest in new acquisitions, which may have a short-term impact on its financial standing. Overall, the changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt suggest that IBM is positioning itself for long-term growth and stability, but may need to manage its cash flows more effectively to maintain its financial health in the short term. ![The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million was driven by deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets](image7) ![The increase in long-term debt of $1,361 million was driven by early retirements and debt maturities](image8) ![The decrease in total equity of $258 million was driven by dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income](image2) ![The increase in deferred taxes of $4,060 million was driven by the intra-entity sale of IP in the first quarter](image9) ![The increase in prepaid pension assets of $745 million was driven by higher returns on plan assets and plan remeasurements](image9) ![The decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,626 million was driven by sales of receivables and product cycle dynamics](image9) ![The decrease in net intangible assets and goodwill of $44 million was driven by intangibles amortization, partially offset by an increase from new acquisitions](image9) ![The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million was driven by deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets](image7) ![The increase in long-term debt of $1,361 million was driven by early retirements and debt maturities](image8) ![The decrease in total equity of $258 million was driven by dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income](image2) ![The increase in deferred taxes of $4,"}

The number of new accounts also decreased from 4,320 thousand to 2,505 thousand. For home equity, the outstanding balances decreased from $11.131 billion to $8.160 billion. These changes might indicate that consumers were more cautious with their spending and borrowing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a decrease in credit card usage and home equity borrowing.

For coal, the report highlights that a decline in the average iron ore price by $1 per tonne would affect the profit after taxation by $163 million, and a decline in the average oil price by $1 per barrel would impact it by $24 million. The key drivers behind these impacts include fluctuations in commodity prices, which are influenced by global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, supply and demand, technological change, product substitution, tariffs, and exchange rate fluctuations. For nickel, the report mentions that the nickel price benefitted from positive investor sentiment and strong end-use demand, leading to a rebound in prices. The key drivers for nickel include investor sentiment, end-use demand, and supply disruptions. The report also notes that the company's usual policy is to sell products at prevailing market prices, which means fluctuations in commodity prices directly affect financial performance. Additionally, the report states that the company remains focused on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, but ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China makes it challenging to provide medium-term volume and unit cost guidance. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of minerals, petroleum, or metals is also a factor that affects the company's financial results.

Shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases, also saw a decrease from $8.503 billion in 2018 to $4.627 billion in 2020. This reduction in shareholder returns is attributed to lower capital expenditures and fewer treasury stock purchases compared to the prior year, as well as proceeds received from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock. The company's focus on returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases remained consistent, with dividends paid increasing from $3,256 million in 2018 to $3,753 million in 2020. However, the total returned to shareholders decreased from $8,503 million in 2018 to $4,627 million in 2020, primarily due to the reduction in share repurchases. The company's capital expenditures were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. The decrease in capital expenditures and shareholder returns reflects the company's efforts to manage its capital structure and return value to shareholders in a challenging economic environment. ![Capital expenditures and shareholder returns decreased from 2018 to 2020](image8) ![Shareholder returns decreased from 2018 to 2020](image7) ![Capital expenditures decreased from 2018 to 2020](image5) ![Shareholder returns decreased from 2018 to 2020](image7) ![Capital expenditures decreased from 2018 to 2020](image5) ![Shareholder returns decreased from 2018 to 2020](image7) ![Capital expenditures decreased from 2018 to 2020](image5) ![Shareholder returns decreased from 2018 to 2020](image7) ![Capital expenditures decreased from 2018 to 2020](image5) ![Shareholder returns decreased from 2018 to 2020](image7) ![Capital expenditures decreased from 2018 to"}

This difference in remuneration structure reflects the different roles and responsibilities of the two executives, with Shane Fallscheer's position as Managing Director likely requiring a greater degree of accountability and alignment with the company's performance. The Board's decision to maintain the same remuneration package for Shane Fallscheer, despite shareholder concerns, suggests that they believe his fixed remuneration is appropriate given his role and responsibilities.

The Board's decision to maintain the same remuneration package for Shane Fallscheer, despite shareholder concerns, suggests that they believe his fixed remuneration is appropriate given his role and responsibilities.

This represents a significant increase of $15,698 million over the three-year period. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses and gains, the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities, and the repayment of convertible senior notes. Additionally, the company received government grants in connection with making certain manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory Shanghai. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by capital expenditures related to the expansion of production facilities and the construction of new factories. The company also experienced fluctuations in net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency. The company's cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds. The company's cash flows from operating activities during 2020 were $5,940 million, compared to $2,410 million during 2019.

The Performance Options granted to the Managing Director were approved at the 2018 AGM. 18,315 options were forfeited during the year.

According to the data, 21,746 female employees were entitled to parental leave, while 98,347 male employees were entitled. Out of those entitled, 1025 female employees and 2023 male employees availed parental leave. The return rates after availing parental leave were 967 (94%) for females and 1,941 (96%) for males. After the leave ended, 66 (6%) female employees and 75 (4%) male employees returned to work and were still employed after 12 months. This data reflects a disparity in parental leave usage between genders, with male employees availing parental leave at a higher rate than female employees. However, the return rates after availing parental leave are relatively similar, indicating that both genders are equally likely to return to work after taking parental leave. The gender diversity policies in the workplace, such as the Career Accelerator Programme and the Shrishti programme, aim to improve representation of women in leadership positions and create a level-playing field for women employees. These policies may help to address the disparity in parental leave usage and promote gender equality in the workplace. ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) ![Employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds](image1) !["}

This approach ensures that the batteries are affordable, high-quality, and have high performance, which is essential for the reliable operation of BEVs. Additionally, the development of new structures, such as integrated structures of battery cells and packs to match the vehicle, further enhances the performance and reliability of the batteries. Overall, the evolution of battery control models is a key factor in the development of Toyota's next-generation BEVs, as it enables the creation of safe, reliable, and high-performance batteries that meet the needs of customers and contribute to a sustainable future. ![Greater than 30% reduction in cost of a single battery](image1) ![Aiming to create safe batteries that can be used with peace of mind always and for their entire lifetime, have high resale value, and contribute to the building of a resource-recycling society](image2) ![Taking on the challenge of developing a wide range of batteries for the second half of the 2020s Providing BEVs equipped with batteries with improved characteristics that enable driving with peace of mind](image4) ![A unique Toyota BEV that utilizes technology cultivated through years of HEV development](image6) ![Global HEV sales in cumulative total (July 2021) 18.1 million](image7) ![Core electrification technologies](image8) ![Future direction based on local conditions Strengthenen collaboration with partners and consider new cooperative structures Rapid start-up of production within the Toyota Group](image5) ![First considering vehicles that utilize all-solid-state battery characteristics Overcoming challenges and envisioning rollout from HEVs to BEVs](image3) ![Development of process for bonding solid materials](image3) ![R&D for future use in BEVs Key issues: Securing the service life of high-capacity batteries](image3) ![Longer service life Greater energy density More compact size Lower cost](image4) ![Evolution in liquid-based battery materials Innovation in liquid battery structure All-solid-state batteries](image4) ![Prismatic New Structure Laminated](image4"}

Noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million, primarily driven by the acquisition of Red Hat and the growth in the company's hybrid cloud and AI offerings. This increase in assets suggests a focus on expanding the company's product and service offerings, which could lead to higher revenue and profitability in the long term.\n\nLong-term debt decreased by $1,361 million, indicating a reduction in the company's reliance on external financing. This decrease in debt could be a result of the company's efforts to deleverage and improve its credit rating, as well as the use of cash flows from operations to pay down debt. The reduction in debt also suggests a more conservative financial strategy, which could reduce the company's exposure to interest rate risk and improve its financial flexibility.\n\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased by $1,621 million, primarily driven by the increase in the company's foreign currency denominated debt portfolio. This increase in liabilities could be a result of the company's risk management strategy, which involves hedging its net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders' equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in liabilities also suggests a more aggressive financial strategy, which could increase the company's exposure to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\n\nOverall, the changes in noncurrent assets, long-term debt, and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) between 2019 and 2020 reflect the company's efforts to balance its financial strategy between growth and risk management. The company's focus on expanding its product and service offerings, reducing its reliance on external financing, and hedging its foreign currency exposure suggests a more conservative financial strategy, which could improve its financial flexibility and reduce its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. However, the company's aggressive financial strategy, which involves increasing its foreign currency denominated debt portfolio, could also increase its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Therefore, the company's financial strategy should be carefully monitored to ensure that it is aligned with its long-term goals and risk tolerance. ![Noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million from December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the acquisition of Red Hat and the growth in the company's hybrid cloud and AI offerings.](image"}

ENBREL experienced a decrease in sales for 2020, driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory. This decline was compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market due to COVID-19. For 2021, ENBREL is expected to follow a historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverification, and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. Additionally, ENBREL faces increased competition from biosimilars and generics, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales. In contrast, Prolia saw an increase in sales for 2020, driven by higher unit demand and net selling price. However, disruptions in patient visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand during 2020 by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients. This deceleration of demand has softened the historical growth rates and altered demand patterns of Prolia experienced in years prior to the pandemic.

This represents a difference of $2,298. The increase in net value can be attributed to the purchase of the East and West Towers of the corporate headquarters in August 2014, which added $144.1 million to the property and equipment value. Additionally, the sale of land and an unoccupied building in San Jose, California, in September 2015, resulted in a gain of $57.8 million, which also contributed to the increase in net value. The depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment for fiscal 2015 was $146.3 million, which is slightly higher than the $144.2 million expense in 2014. This suggests that the company is investing in new property and equipment to support its growth and operations.

In 2021, the fair value was $408 million, and in 2022, it was $561 million. This represents an increase of $153 million. The increase in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, which was approximately $6,033 million at the end of 2022, compared to $7,692 million at the end of 2021. Additionally, the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,049 million and $12,175 million at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fair value is also attributed to the higher gasoline prices, which positively impacted net sales by $9,230 million, 481 basis points, compared to 2021. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 22%, positively impacting net sales by $3,847 million, 200 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,762 million, 92 basis points, compared to 2021, attributable primarily to the Company's Other International operations.

The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. This is further explained in text quote [9], which states that foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars.

The retained earnings decreased from $13,837 million in 2020 to $13,474 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in the company's accumulated profits. This decrease could be attributed to various factors such as increased dividend payments, share repurchases, or higher expenses. Additionally, the other comprehensive income (loss) also decreased from a loss of $2,895 million in 2020 to a loss of $2,945 million in 2021. This further reduction in other comprehensive income could be due to foreign currency translation adjustments, net unrealized debt securities gains, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits.

Instead, they preferred to invest in later-stage companies that had a proven track record and were less risky. This shift in investment strategy is reflected in the distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund. ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image2) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image5) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image8) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image6) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image7) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image3) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image4) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image1) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image2) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image5) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image8) ![Distribution of investment stages from the 1998 fund to the 2007 fund](image6)"}

This indicates a more significant shift in preference towards the private sector in the GCC region compared to the Non-GCC region over the three-year period. The data suggests that while the government sector was once the preferred choice for employment in the GCC, there has been a notable decline in this preference, possibly reflecting changing economic conditions or perceptions of job security and career opportunities in the private sector. In the Non-GCC region, the preference for the government sector has remained more consistent, indicating a potentially stronger reliance on or satisfaction with government employment opportunities.

The text states that about half of Hispanic registered voters with a high school education or less approve of Biden, while a greater share of Latino voters born in the U.S. and Latino immigrant voters say they approve of Biden. The image quotes show that among Hispanic registered voters, 52% of those who say being Hispanic is very or extremely important approve of Biden, compared with 37% of those who say being Hispanic is less important. This suggests that Hispanic registered voters who place a higher importance on their Hispanic identity are more likely to approve of Biden.

The number of VC funds decreased from 1,600 in 1999 to 711 in 2011, a reduction of 63%. This decline is attributed to the post-bubble struggle for existence, which led to the emergence of stronger venture capital firms in Europe. The scarcity of VC money also drove up capital efficiency and yield, as the few remaining investors became more selective. The chart highlights the dramatic changes in the European venture ecosystem, particularly in Germany, which has produced the highest number of venture-backed exits in Europe over the past 18 months. The scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to low entry valuations and higher capital efficiency, resulting in a more competitive market for venture capital funds. The chart also shows that the supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004, leading to a negative bias in official statistics and a long non-contributing tail of European VC funds listed in the Thomson database.

For instance, nearly all immigrant adults from Latin America or Spain (97%) say they are Hispanic, and second-generation adults with Hispanic ancestry have a high self-identification rate (92%). However, this rate drops significantly among third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics, indicating a fading of Hispanic identity across generations as immigrant connections fall away. This trend is supported by the data showing that the share of self-identified Hispanics who feel very or somewhat connected to their country of origin decreases from 82% among immigrants to 44% among the third generation. Additionally, the intermarriage rate among Hispanics also varies by generation, with 39% of married U.S.-born adults having a non-Latino spouse, compared to just 15% of married immigrant Latinos. This suggests that as generations progress, there is a greater likelihood of intermarriage with non-Hispanic individuals, further contributing to the decline in Hispanic identity. The data also highlights that the composition of networks of friends varies widely across immigrant generations, with most immigrant Latinos having all or most of their friends as Latinos, while this share drops significantly among third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics. This indicates a shift in social networks and cultural ties as generations progress.

This shows that while 'Trap Queen' was also successful, it did not achieve the same level of performance as 'Uptown Funk!' across all platforms. ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD](image6) ![Top On-Demand Songs YTD"}

Initially, there was a higher concern about the government's anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country, with 58% expressing this view in early 2010, shortly after the failed Christmas Day terrorist attack on an airliner en route to Detroit. However, by 2015, the share of Americans who said the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism had fallen by 26 percentage points, from 72% to 46%, marking the lowest point in the post-9/11 era. This decline in confidence was accompanied by a rise in the share of people expressing concern that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, which increased by seven percentage points since the start of the year. The Pew Research Center survey conducted in December 2015 found that 56% of Americans were more concerned that the government's anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, compared to 28% who were more concerned that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person's civil liberties. This shift in opinion was more pronounced among Republicans, with 71% now saying their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up from 57% in January and 38% in July 2013. The balance of opinion has also shifted since early 2014, before ISIS registered as a major threat for the public. In March 2014, more people said relying too much on force creates hatred (57%) compared to those who said overwhelming military force was the best way to defeat terrorism (37%). Views were similar to those in 2014 when the question was previously asked in 2011 and 2004. Overall, the public's concern about the government's anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country has increased, while concern about these policies going too far in restricting civil liberties has fallen to its lowest level in five years. ![Public opinion regarding anti-terror policies changed from 2004 to 2015](image1) ![Public opinion regarding anti-terror policies changed from 2004 to 2015](image2) ![Public opinion regarding anti-terror policies changed from 2004 to 2"}

Around two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree say the U.S. has done a poor job, as do around six-in-ten college graduates. In comparison, about four-in-ten of those with a high school degree or less say the same. This indicates that higher education levels are associated with more negative evaluations of the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic. Additionally, the belief that the U.S. can learn from other countries about COVID-19 is more widespread among Americans with higher levels of education than among those with lower education levels.

This suggests that partisan views on Obama's foreign policy are deeply divided, with Republicans generally being more critical and supportive of tougher measures."}

This expansion is crucial for accommodating the projected increase in ridership and reducing congestion on highways, as highlighted by the need to double Caltrain's daily trips from 60,000 to 120,000 by the next decade [3]. The infrastructure changes, such as longer platforms and electrification, are essential to support these higher capacities and ensure efficient service delivery. The financial aspect of these improvements is also significant, with a funding gap of $930 million identified for the CalMod Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects [6].

This trend is consistent across different age groups within the senior population, with ownership rates decreasing as age increases. The data also shows that seniors who have graduated from college are more likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet compared to those who have not attended college. Additionally, those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more per year are more likely to own each device compared to those with a household income of less than $30,000 per year. The overall adoption rate of smartphones among seniors is relatively low, with only 18% of seniors being smartphone adopters, which is well below the national adoption rate of 55%.

Additionally, there is a concern that these scores might not reflect a person's creditworthiness and that there is no way to change the score. These concerns are highlighted by the fact that 68% of Americans find the use of personal finance scores unacceptable, with 26% citing privacy violations as their main concern, 20% stating that the scores do not accurately represent individuals, and 15% expressing concerns about fairness and discrimination. Furthermore, 9% believe that these scores do not reflect creditworthiness, and 5% are concerned about the lack of a way to change the score. These findings are supported by the survey data which shows that a majority of Americans are skeptical of the fairness and accuracy of these scores, and that they worry about the privacy implications of the data being collected and shared. The concerns are also contextual, with the public's reaction to each concept being highly dependent on the circumstances or the tasks these algorithms are assigned to do. The survey indicates that otherwise similar technologies can be viewed with support or suspicion depending on the context in which they are used. This suggests that the public's perception of algorithmic decision-making is nuanced and context-dependent, with concerns about privacy, fairness, and overall effectiveness being prominent. The data also shows that the public is concerned about the potential for these scores to be biased or discriminatory, and that they worry about the lack of transparency and accountability in the algorithms used to generate these scores.

The data suggests that there has been a significant rise in the percentage of people who are worried about obesity, which could be due to various factors such as increased public health campaigns, rising obesity rates, or greater media coverage of the issue. The increase in concern about obesity is a positive sign, as it may lead to more efforts to address and prevent obesity-related health problems. However, it is important to note that the data only reflects the level of concern and does not necessarily indicate any changes in actual obesity rates or health outcomes.

For instance, only 37% of those aged 80 and older use the internet, and just 21% have a broadband connection at home. This indicates that older seniors are less likely to be online and have broadband access compared to their younger counterparts. The data also highlights that affluent and well-educated seniors adopt the internet and broadband at substantially higher rates than those with lower levels of income and educational attainment.

In 1992, 46% of voters felt this way, while in 2016, that number rose to 57%. This trend is evident in the data from the Pew Research Center, which shows a steady increase in the percentage of voters who believe the press had too much influence on the election outcome. The highest percentage was recorded in 2016, indicating a growing concern about the media's role in elections. This shift in perception could be attributed to various factors, including changes in media practices, increased political polarization, and the rise of social media as a news source. The data suggests that the public's trust in the media has been declining, and this perception of excessive influence may be a contributing factor. The trend is particularly pronounced among Trump voters, with 62% feeling that the press had too much influence in 2016, compared to 50% of Clinton voters. This disparity highlights the partisan divide in perceptions of the media's role in elections. Overall, the data indicates a significant change in how voters view the media's influence on presidential elections over the past few decades. ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had"}

This shift in importance is reflective of the broader trend among all U.S. registered voters, where abortion has become a more significant issue leading up to the 2022 midterm elections. The data suggests that the Supreme Court's decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion in the United States has significantly influenced the issue's prominence among Latino voters. \n\n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for Latino registered voters](image8)  \n![Abortion rises in importance for 2022 midterms, while economy remains top issue](image8)  \n![Abortion rises as an election issue for"}

Among immigrant self-identified Hispanics, 59% report that their parents took them often to Hispanic cultural celebrations, reflecting that the majority of this group grew up outside the U.S. In contrast, among second-generation self-identified Hispanics, 49% report that their immigrant parents took them often to Hispanic cultural celebrations, while only 35% of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics report the same. This trend indicates that the number of Hispanic cultural activities experienced by Americans with Hispanic ancestry declines across generations, mirroring the finding that Hispanic self-identity also fades across generations. The conversations parents have with their children and the cultural cues they provide while their children are growing up can have a large impact on their children’s identity in adulthood. However, the number of Hispanic cultural activities experienced by Americans with Hispanic ancestry declines across the generations, reflecting the different experiences of each group of Hispanics. The use of these terms varies widely across immigrant generations and reflects the different experiences of each group of Hispanics. Another important way that parents can encourage their children’s Hispanic self-identity is through their use of language. However, the two surveys reveal that the childhood experiences with Spanish fade quickly across the generations, even though there is wide support for the language among Hispanics. Childhood experiences at Latino cultural celebrations decline across generations. The contemporary experiences linked to the Hispanic background of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry vary across generations in much the way their childhood and cultural experiences do. These trends may have implications for the shape of Hispanic identity today. With so many U.S.-born Hispanics of Hispanic and non-Hispanic heritages, their views and experiences with Hispanic culture and identity vary depending on how close they are to their family’s immigrant experiences. Declining immigration, high intermarriage rates, and the Hispanic experience today are factors that contribute to the changing landscape of Hispanic identity. The Hispanic experience today is shaped by a variety of factors, including declining immigration, high intermarriage rates, and the use of Spanish. The Hispanic experience today is also influenced by the different experiences of each group of Hispanics.

Women are a majority in health-related occupations, but are underrepresented in several other STEM occupational clusters, particularly in computer jobs and engineering. The share of women in STEM overall is driven in large part by women’s over representation in health-related jobs, the largest STEM occupational cluster. Among all STEM workers holding a professional or doctoral degree, about four-in-ten are women, compared with about six-in-ten STEM workers holding an advanced degree. Women’s representation in STEM occupations varies substantially by occupational subgroup. Engineering occupations have the lowest share of women at 14%, while computer occupations follow, with women comprising a quarter of workers in these fields. Women are underrepresented among physical scientists, but their representation among life scientists and math workers roughly equals women’s overall share in the workforce. The share of women working in such jobs varies widely both within and across job types. Women account for a majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented in other jobs, particularly computer and engineering positions. While there has been significant progress for women in the life and physical sciences since 1990, the share of women has been roughly stable in other STEM occupational clusters and has gone down 7%. Gains in women’s representation in STEM jobs have been concentrated among women holding advanced degrees, although women still tend to be underrepresented among such workers. Women’s representation among the college-educated STEM workforce depends, in part, on women completing college training in STEM fields. Among college-educated workers, the share of women earning a STEM degree varies widely and generally corresponds with the share of women in these occupational clusters. Among all college-educated workers who majored in a health professions field, 81% are female. But just 16% of college-educated workers who majored in engineering are women. Women’s representation in STEM jobs varies widely. In computer occupations, a job cluster which includes computer scientists, systems analysts, software developers, information systems managers and programmers – the STEM job cluster that has seen the most growth in recent decades – women’s representation has actually decreased from 32% in 1990 to 25% today. Women comprise 47% of all employed adults today, up modestly from 45% in 1990, and they make up half of all employed adults in STEM jobs in the U.S. The share of women in STEM overall is driven in large part by women’s over representation in health"}

This group saw a 20 percentage point increase in their optimism, as compared to those with a high school diploma or less education, who saw a 9 or 11 percentage point increase, respectively. This trend is reflected in the changes in Latinos' expectations for their family finances, as well as the overall increase in economic optimism among most major Latino demographic subgroups. The share of Latinos who expect their family's finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" in the coming year rose by 14 percentage points, from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015. This is in contrast to the general public, where the share of all Americans with a similarly favorable view of their family's future finances rose by only 3 percentage points from 2011 to 2015. The data also shows that the increase in financial optimism was not uniform across all demographic groups, with some groups, such as those with less than a high school education, seeing a smaller increase in their optimism. However, the overall trend is clear: Latinos are becoming more optimistic about their financial future, and this optimism is growing faster among Latinos than in the population as a whole. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including the improving economic conditions in the United States, the increasing number of Latinos who are completing college, and the growing number of Latinos who are entering the workforce. The data also shows that the increase in financial optimism is not limited to any one demographic group, but is instead a trend that is being seen across all major Latino demographic subgroups. This is a positive development, as it suggests that Latinos are becoming more confident in their ability to achieve financial stability and success.

For instance, the GL to EN translation shows a substantial increase in BLEU scores, indicating the effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings in enhancing translation quality for less frequent concepts. This is supported by the data in Table 6 and the results in image3, which demonstrate that pre-training can lead to gains of up to 11 BLEU points for certain language pairs. Additionally, the alignment of embedding spaces between source and target languages further enhances the BLEU scores, as seen in image4. The improvement is particularly notable for language pairs with larger headroom to improve, such as RU and HE, which have very low baseline BLEU scores. This suggests that pre-training is highly effective once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language. The results in image2 also show that pre-training can lead to significant improvements in BLEU scores for different language families, with the largest gains observed for language pairs with the highest similarity.

As shown in Figure 2, the performance of the models improves with an increase in the number of demonstration samples. However, the improvement is more pronounced when logical constraints are incorporated into the model instructions. For instance, the performance of the models with logical constraints (MAVEN-ERE w. Ic and CTB w. Ic) shows a more significant increase in Micro-F1 scores compared to the models without logical constraints (MAVEN-ERE w/o. Ic and CTB w/o. Ic) as the number of demonstration samples increases. This indicates that logical constraints play a crucial role in enhancing the model's performance, especially when combined with a larger number of demonstration samples. The results also suggest that the models can achieve better performance with fewer demonstrations when logical constraints are incorporated, as observed in Figure 6. This further emphasizes the importance of logical constraints in improving the model's performance on reasoning tasks. Therefore, the number of demonstration samples and the incorporation of logical constraints are both critical factors in determining the Micro-F1 performance of the models on the MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets.

The multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context.

The inference pipeline involves retrieving the top-k class names most similar to the input image and using MLLMs to rank these retrieved candidate results as the final prediction results. This process enhances the fine-grained few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs by integrating the retrieved category labels alongside image embeddings and sending them to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining internal knowledge and retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.

These instances demonstrate the efficacy of LLMs in harnessing external knowledge and complex reasoning to rectify erroneous predictions initially made by SLMs (red lines). (2) Conversely, LLM-based reranking impedes performance on easy samples (right areas), resulting in a significant degradation, particularly for very easy samples (rightmost areas). In conclusion, LLMs exhibit greater proficiency in handling hard samples compared to SLMs, yet they under perform relative to SLMs on easy samples.\n- [6] Our filter-then-rerank paradigm, unfortunately, presents unsatisfactory performance (and even suffers longer latency since LLMs rerank candidates per sample). Given LLMs’ abilities in memorization and reasoning, however, we still believe that LLMs are potential to solve some, if not most, IE samples effectively. We hypothesize that LLMs are more proficient than SLMs on hard samples. These samples are characterized by their requisite for external knowledge acquisition or sophisticated reasoning strategies, areas where LLMs can leverage their extensive parametric knowledge bases and inherent reasoning mechanisms. In contrast, SLMs often falter with such samples, constrained by their restricted modeling capacities.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we have the following relevant information:\n- ![Micro-F1 performance across different confidence levels for FewNERD, TACREv, and ACE05 datasets](image6) shows that LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance on hard samples (lower confidence scores) and degrades performance on easy samples (higher confidence scores) for the FewNERD dataset.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, we can conclude that LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance on hard samples (lower confidence scores) and degrades performance on easy samples (higher confidence scores) for the FewNERD dataset. This is consistent with the findings in the text quotes, which suggest that LLMs are more proficient in handling hard samples compared to SLMs, but underperform"}

The RetrieveNRefine++ model is mentioned to have superior Engagingness scores compared to the Seq2Seq model.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, specifically image2, we can see the Engagingness scores for different models. The Engagingness score for Seq2Seq (PPL) is 2.70, and for RetrieveNRefine++ it is 3.80.\n\nTo calculate the improvement, we subtract the Engagingness score of Seq2Seq (PPL) from that of RetrieveNRefine++:\n\nImprovement = RetrieveNRefine++ Engagingness score - Seq2Seq (PPL) Engagingness score\nImprovement = 3.80 - 2.70\nImprovement = 1.10\n\nTherefore, the Engagingness score improved by 1.10 when comparing Seq2Seq (PPL) to RetrieveNRefine++.\n\nIn conclusion, the Engagingness score improved by 1.10 when comparing Seq2Seq (PPL) to RetrieveNRefine++. This improvement indicates that the RetrieveNRefine++ model is more engaging in conversations compared to the Seq2Seq model. The higher Engagingness score suggests that the RetrieveNRefine++ model is better at generating responses that are more interesting and captivating to the user. This improvement can be attributed to the use of the Memory Network retriever, which helps the model to generate more diverse and engaging responses. The RetrieveNRefine++ model also uses a retrieval-based approach, which allows it to generate responses that are more relevant and contextually appropriate.

Tree Traversal Retrieval involves a layer-by-layer approach, where the algorithm starts by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. It then considers the children of these selected nodes at the next layer and repeats the selection process until reaching the leaf nodes. The text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. This method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved by adjusting the depth and the number of nodes selected at each layer.\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree approach simplifies the retrieval process by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously. Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. This allows for a more flexible and comprehensive retrieval of information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question. The collapsed tree approach is applied for retrieval in both models, as shown in the ablation study utilizing SBERT embeddings and UnifiedQA to maintain consistency in retrieval.\n\nThe differences between these two methods are illustrated in Figure 3 of the paper, which shows the performance of tree traversal with different top- sizes and collapsed tree with different maximum token numbers. The collapsed tree approach consistently performs better, offering greater flexibility than tree traversal. This is because it retrieves information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question, whereas tree traversal with the same values of d and k results in a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details, regardless of the question. \n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information by layer-by-layer selection versus simultaneous consideration of all nodes, respectively. The collapsed tree approach is more flexible and performs better in retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question. ![Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information](image3) ![Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information](image4) ![Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information](image6) ![Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information](image7) ![Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information]("}

The dataset includes various categories such as Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Generation, and Safety, each with a specific number of samples, tokens, and images. This balanced and diverse dataset is crucial for the Chameleon model's inference strategy, which is designed to handle mixed-modal inputs and generate outputs that can contain arbitrary sequences of images and text.\n\nThe Chameleon model's inference strategy, as depicted in image1, involves a Mixed-Modal Auto-Regressive LM that can process both text and image inputs. The model uses an Image Tokenizer to convert images into tokens and an Image De-Tokenizer to convert tokens back into images. This allows the model to generate mixed-modal outputs that are relevant and coherent with the input prompts.\n\nThe balanced dataset ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of modalities and tasks, enabling it to learn the relationships between different types of data and generate high-quality mixed-modal outputs. The inclusion of safety data in the SFT dataset also helps the model to avoid generating unsafe or inappropriate content, which is an important consideration for real-world applications.\n\nIn summary, the supervised fine-tuning dataset statistics are closely related to the Chameleon model's inference strategy, as they provide the necessary data for the model to learn and generate mixed-modal outputs that are relevant, coherent, and safe.

As shown in Figure 2, increasing the control variable z from 0 to 10 results in a range of question-asking rates from 1.40% to 97.72%. However, when repetition control is introduced, the question-asking rate is reduced, particularly in the z=10 setting, which should produce 100% questions but only produces 79.67% questions. This is because the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, preventing the model from producing bigrams that commonly occur in many questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\". To fix this, an extra setting z=10 (boost) is introduced, in which the feature extrep bigram is not used for weighted decoding during beam search, but is used to rerank the candidates after beam search. This setting allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, yielding a 99.54% question-asking rate, at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition. ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate]("}

The first method, LSTUR-ini, uses the long-term user representation to initialize the hidden state of the GRU network in the short-term user representation model. The second method, LSTUR-con, concatenates the long-term user representation with the short-term user representation as the final user representation. This is shown in the figure where LSTUR-ini initializes the GRU network with the long-term representation, while LSTUR-con combines both representations by concatenation. The effectiveness of these methods is validated by the experimental results, which show that both methods can effectively improve the performance of news recommendation. The performance of LSTUR-con is more stable than LSTUR-ini, indicating that using the concatenation of both short-term and long-term user representations is capable of retaining all the information. This is further supported by the results in Figure 8, which show that a moderate choice of the probability p (e.g., 0.5) is most appropriate for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con methods, properly balancing the learning of LTUR and STUR. The LSTUR approach outperforms all baseline methods compared here, including deep learning models such as CNN, GRU, and DKN, by capturing both the long-term preferences and short-term interests to capture the complex and diverse user interests in news reading. The LSTUR approach also uses an attention mechanism in the news encoder to select important words, which helps learn more informative news representations. The results in Figure 5 show that the GRU is effective in encoding news, and replacing it with other encoders such as Average, Attention, and LSTM does not significantly improve the performance. The user encoder is used to learn representations of users from the history of their browsed news, containing two modules: a short-term user representation model (STUR) to capture user's temporal interests, and a long-term user representation model (LTUR) to capture user's consistent preferences. The experimental results in Figure 3 show that both LTUR and STUR are useful for news recommendation, and the STUR model can outperform the LTUR model. The combination of STUR and LTUR using the two long- and short-term user representation methods, LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, can effectively improve the performance. This result validates that incorporating both long-term and short-term user representations is useful to capture the diverse user interests more"}

Table 1 gives concrete examples: for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), most tokens are backgrounds with tagging class O. Specifically, the number of tokens with tagging class O is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Data-imbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Ko cisk y et al., 2018; Dasigi et al., 2019) with the value of negative-positive ratio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the starting and ending indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background.\n\nFrom this quote, we can see that the negative-positive ratio for MRC tasks, including Quoref, is between 50 and 200.

Comparing the sec- ond and third columns, we can see the increase is much more signiﬁcant with pre-trained source lan- guage embeddings. This indicates that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sen- tence. \nThe gains from pre-training in the higher- resource languages are consistent:  ${\\approx}3$   BLEU points for all three language pairs. In contrast, for the extremely low-resource languages, the gains are either quite small (A Z  and B E ) or very large, as in G L  which achieves a gain of up to 11 BLEU points. This ﬁnding is interesting in that it indi- cates that word embeddings may be particularly useful to bootstrap models that are on the thresh- old of being able to produce reasonable transla- tions, as is the case for G L  in our experiments. \nFrom Table  3 , we can see that the BLEU scores of E S , F R , and I T  do generally follow this hy- pothesis. As we move to very different languages, R U  and H E  see larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts F R  and I T . This can be largely attributed to the observation from the pre- vious section that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; R U  and H E have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger. \nthat for all three languages the gain in BLEU score demonstrates a similar trend to that found in G L  in the previous section: the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes ef- fect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective. \nFinally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the translations from   ${\\mathrm{GL}}\\to{\\mathrm{EN}}$  , which showed one of the largest increases in quantitative numbers.

This uneven distribution can make it challenging for DST models to accurately track all slots, as some slots may have more data to learn from than others.

This design choice leverages the powerful capabilities of LLMs to enhance the system's performance and transparency in fact-checking. \n\n![The system architecture shows five modules, including the Claim Verifier, Question Generator, QA Model, Validator, and Reasoner.](image3) \n![The system uses InstructGPT for the Claim Verifier and Question Generator modules.](image2) \n![The QA Model can be implemented using different models, including InstructGPT, FLAN-T5, and GPT3-based reciter-reader models.](image2) \n![The system architecture shows five modules, including the Claim Verifier, Question Generator, QA Model, Validator, and Reasoner.](image3) \n![The system uses InstructGPT for the Claim Verifier and Question Generator modules.](image2) \n![The QA Model can be implemented using different models, including InstructGPT, FLAN-T5, and GPT3-based reciter-reader models.](image2) \n![The system architecture shows five modules, including"}

Both methods improve when p increases from 0. However, when p is too small, the model will tend to overfit on the LTUR, since LTUR has many parameters. Thus, the performance is not optimal. However, when p is too large, the performance of both methods starts to decline. This may be because the useful information in LTUR cannot be effectively incorporated. Thus, the performance is also not optimal. A moderate choice on p (e.g., 0.5) is most appropriate for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con methods, which can properly balance the learning of LTUR and STUR. ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases](image8) ![The performance of LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini measured by AUC is similar as the mask probability p increases"}

This is a significant breadth compared to other benchmarks, which are heavily focused on daily knowledge and common sense. The covered image format is also limited in other benchmarks, while MMMU aims to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. In terms of depth, the previous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, MMMU requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, calling for an advanced approach that integrates advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge. The implications for its use in evaluating large multimodal models are that it provides a more comprehensive and challenging test of the models' capabilities, requiring them to not only perceive and understand information across different modalities but also apply reasoning with subject-specific knowledge to derive the solution. This makes MMMU a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of large multimodal models in a more realistic and demanding context. ![MMMU covers a wide range of subjects and image formats](image1) ![MMMU requires expert-level reasoning with college-level subject knowledge](image2) ![MMMU is designed to measure three essential skills in LMMs: perception, knowledge, and reasoning](image3) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image4) ![MMMU provides a more realistic and demanding context for evaluating large multimodal models](image5) ![MMMU is designed to measure three essential skills in LMMs: perception, knowledge, and reasoning](image6) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image7) ![MMMU provides a more realistic and demanding context for evaluating large multimodal models](image8) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image9) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image10) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image11) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image12) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks](image13) ![MMMU is more comprehensive and challenging than"}

The table in image3 also shows the F1 scores for other models, including BERT-Large and Multilingual-BERT, which can be used for comparison. Overall, the F1 score of 74.9 for XLM in English is a useful metric for evaluating the model's performance and can be used to inform decisions about its use in different language contexts. ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for XLM when both the context language and question language are English is 74.9](image3) ![F1 score for X"}

The model then uses cosine similarity to calculate the relevance score between the aggregated representation and a reference candidate. This process is detailed in the text quote [1] and visually represented in the image quote `![DS-DST model architecture](image8)`. The model's architecture shows the use of BERT to encode the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs, followed by cosine similarity matching to find the most relevant candidate values. This method allows the model to effectively handle both categorical and non-categorical slots, as described in the text quote [6]. The effectiveness of this approach is further supported by the results shown in the image quotes `![DS-DST performance on MultiWOZ datasets](image5)` and `![DS-DST performance on various slot types](image6)`, which demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to other methods. The model's ability to adapt to different slot types and its strong interactions between the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs are key factors in its success, as highlighted in the text quotes [3], [4], and [8]. The comprehensive analysis of the MultiWOZ datasets and the error analysis conducted in the study provide additional insights into the model's performance and the importance of the dual strategy for each slot, as mentioned in the text quotes [5] and [11]. Overall, the DS-DST model's approach to determining the matching between candidate values and the dialogue context is a significant contribution to the field of dialog state tracking, as it addresses the limitations of traditional methods and leverages the strengths of pre-trained models like BERT."}

It involves recognition of the damaged base of a nucleotide by a glycosylase enzyme and its removal by detaching it from the deoxyribose sugar via hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond. Breakage of the hydrogen bond between the damaged base and the opposing base on the complementary strand occurs, probably, via ATP-induced changes of the energy dynamics of the bond. Removal of the damaged or mutated base results in creation of abasic site or apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP) of the DNA which are targeted by endonuclease and lyase activity to remove the damaged base(s) followed by addition of new normal base(s) by a specific polymerase enzyme and, finally, regaining the phosphodiester bonds and, hence, the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand by the action of DNA ligase.\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This repair system is highly conserved among species, though it is much more complicated in higher eukaryotes than prokaryotes. The most prominent feature of this repair system is its broad substrate specificity because it can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA.\n\n3. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This repair mechanism can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyltransferase proteins, respectively. Direct reversal repair mechanisms are not followed by incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA since the changed or mutated bases are directly reverted to their original states either by light-dependent photo reactivation process, for pyrimidine dimers repair, or by use of alkyltransferase. Placental mammals do not have photolyase-dependent repair mechanisms and depend on nucleotide excision repair to correct and repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation.\n\n4. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: The mismatch repair (MMR) system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins and signal discrimination factors, probably in collaboration with the proofreading system, to recognize the mutated strand first and then to locate the site of"}

In this case, the NP ratio is calculated as 9,224,537 (number of negative samples) divided by 492,185 (number of positive samples), which equals 18.74. This ratio is important for understanding the balance of positive and negative samples in the dataset, which can impact the performance of the model.

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement. The symbolic formulation is crucial as it provides a precise and unambiguous representation of the problem, which is essential for accurate reasoning.\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**: Once the problem is formulated symbolically, a deterministic symbolic solver is employed to perform inference on the symbolic formulation. This solver uses logical algorithms, such as forward or backward chaining, to derive the answer. The use of a symbolic solver ensures that the reasoning process is faithful and transparent, as it relies on deterministic algorithms rather than probabilistic methods.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**: After the symbolic solver has generated the answer, a result interpreter is responsible for translating the symbolic answer back into natural language. This step is crucial for making the results understandable to humans. The interpreter maps the symbolic output to the correct answer, ensuring that the final result is presented in a clear and comprehensible manner.\n\nBy integrating LLMs with symbolic solvers, LOGIC-LM leverages the robust natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to precisely represent the problem using symbolic representations, while also taking advantage of the logical faithfulness and transparency offered by symbolic solvers. This combination allows LOGIC-LM to handle complex logical reasoning problems more effectively than pure LLMs or chain-of-thought prompting techniques. \n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM's approach to problem-solving is a blend of natural language processing and symbolic reasoning, which enhances its ability to tackle logical reasoning tasks with greater accuracy and reliability. This method significantly improves performance over pure LLMs and chain-of-thought prompting techniques, as demonstrated by its results on various logical reasoning datasets. \n\n![LOGIC-LM's problem-solving process](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM's performance on logical reasoning datasets](image8) \n\n![LOGIC-LM's performance on different datasets](image1) \n\n![LOGIC-LM's performance on different datasets](image7) \n\n![LOGIC-LM's performance on different datasets](image6) \n\n![LOGIC-LM's performance on different datasets](image2) \n\n![LOGIC-LM's performance on different datasets](image"}

This is done to ensure that the context paragraphs are highly parallel, allowing for the annotation of questions in the source language with a high probability of being answerable in the target languages. The extracted paragraphs are then used to crowd-source questions on the English paragraphs, making sure the answer is in the aligned sentence. This step is crucial for the construction of the MLQA dataset, as it enables the creation of a multi-way parallel extractive QA evaluation benchmark in seven languages. The generated questions are then translated to all target languages by professional translators, and answer spans are annotated in the aligned contexts for the target languages. This process is described in detail in the text quotes [1], [2], and [12], and is visually represented in image6. The first step is also mentioned in text quote [10], where it is stated that the annotation pipeline consists of three main steps, with the first step being the automatic extraction of paragraphs. The importance of this step is further emphasized in text quote [7], where it is discussed that the quality of context paragraphs in MLQA is crucial for the success of the annotation pipeline. The use of machine translation is strongly discouraged by the Wikipedia community, but from examining edit histories of articles in MLQA, machine translation is occasionally used as an article seed, before being edited and added to by human authors. Despite this, the annotation method restricts answers to come from specified sentences, ensuring that the questions are answerable in all languages.

The relative strength of this and other baselines proves to be an important issue when designing multi-hop datasets, which we addressed through the measures described in Section 3.2. In Table 4 we compare the two relevant baselines on WIKI HOP before and after applying filtering measures. The absolute strength of these baselines before filtering shows how vital addressing this issue is: 74.6% accuracy could be reached through exploiting the cooccurrence (d,c) statistic alone. This underlines the paramount importance of investigating and addressing dataset biases that otherwise would confound seemingly strong RC model performance. The relative drop demonstrates that.

(2018), in terms of accuracy on (unmasked) validation set. The second important observation is that if we then remove R-GCN (GloVe w/o R-GCN in Table 3), we lose 8.0 points. That is, the R-GCN component pushes the model to perform above Coref-GRU still without accessing context, but rather by updating mention representations based on their relation to other ones. These results highlight the impact of our R-GCN component.\n- [4] In Table 6, we report three samples from WIKI-HOP development set where our Entity-GCN fails. In particular, we show two instances where our model presents high confidence on the answer, and one where it is not. We commented these samples explaining why our model might fail in these cases.\n- [5] In Figure 3, we show how the model performance goes when the input graph is large.

For WIKIHOP, the masked setting improves BiDAF's performance from 54.5% to 59.8% and FastQA's from 25.7% to 35.8%. For MEDHOP, the improvement is less significant, with BiDAF increasing from 33.7% to 42.9% and FastQA from 23.1% to 31.3% (image1).\n\n5. **Iterative Conditioning**:\n   - The iterative conditioning across multiple layers in BiDAF's architecture is hypothesized to contribute to its superior performance, especially in tasks requiring information integration across documents (quote [6]).\n\n6. **Document-Cue Baseline**:\n   - The document-cue baseline, which predicts answers based"}

This is particularly useful in object detection datasets where an image may contain multiple objects of varying sizes, and the objects of interest are typically smaller and more varied in position compared to image classification tasks.

This is further supported by the dendrogram in Figure 5, which visualizes the hierarchical clustering of the supersense vectors learned by SenseBERT, showing a clear separation between Noun senses and Verb senses.

In 2012, Mihalcea and Nastase used this dataset to detect differences in word usage and meaning across 50-year time spans. Gulordava and Baroni also compared word meanings in the 1960s and 1990s, achieving good correlation with human judgments. In 2013, Kim et al. employed prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts, using incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS). Hamilton et al. showed the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models in semantic shifts analysis in 2016. The timeline of events that have been influential in the development of research in this area is shown in Figure 1. \n\n![Timeline of events that have been influential in the development of research in this area](image1) \n\nIn summary, the key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of the Google Books Ngrams corpus, the use of prediction-based word embedding models, and the development of research in this area. \n\n[1] In fact, distributional models were being used in diachronic research long before the paper of Kulkarni et al. (2015), although there was no rigorous comparison to the frequentist methods. Already in 2009, it was proposed that one can use distributional methods to detect semantic shifts in a quantitative way. The pioneering work by Jurgens and Stevens (2009) described an insightful conceptualization of a sequence of distributional model updates through time: it is effectively a Word:Semantic Vector:Time tensor, in the sense that each word in a distributional model possesses a set of semantic vectors for each time span we are interested in. It paved the way for quantitatively comparing not only words with regard to their meaning, but also different stages in the development of word meaning over time. \n[2] automatic detection of semantic shifts: in the choice of diachronic data, evaluation strategies, methodology of extracting semantic shifts from data, and the methods to compare word vectors across time spans.

The SGD optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.1, and the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.001. The learning rate is scheduled to reduce on plateau, with a factor of 0.5 and patience of 8. The early stopping patience is set to 50, and the maximum number of epochs is 10,000. The batch size is 128. The augmentation includes flip, rotation, reverse color, and fade color. The details of the augmentation are shown in Table 4. The contrastive pre-training settings on MedMNIST and CIFAR-10-LT are summarized in Table 3a. The MoCo v2 pre-training is performed on 2 NVIDIA RTX3090 GPUs with 24GB memory each. The total number of model parameters is 55.93 million, among which 27.97 million require gradient back propagation. The MoCo v2 pre-training is so fast in computation that data loading becomes a new bottleneck that dominates running time in our setup. We perform repeated augmentation on MedMNIST datasets at the level of dataset, also to enlarge augmentation space and improve generalization. The details are shown in Table 5. The benchmark experiments are performed on NVIDIA RTX 1080 GPUs, with the following settings in Table 6. The initial query is consequential regardless of model initialization. A pre-trained model can improve the performance of each active learning cycle for both random and active selection, but the cold start problem remains. This suggests that the model instability and data scarcity are two independent issues to be addressed for the cold start problem. Our \"hard-to-contrast\" data selection criterion only exploits contrastive learning (an improved model), but also determines the typical data to be annotated first (a better query). As a result, when fine-tuning from MoCo v2, the Pearson correlation coefficient between AUC20 and AUC50 remains high (r=0.92, 0.81, 0.70, 0.82, 0.85 for random selection, Entropy, Margin, BALD, and Coreset, respectively) and statistically significant (p<0.05).

Further filtering is conducted by removing entities that didn’t have a sufficient number of images obtained via Google Image Search engine.\n\n4. **Metadata Storage**: The collected metadata is stored in a CSV file containing essential information such as image URLs, source page URLs, renamed image names, and the corresponding Wikipedia page URLs.\n\n5. **Final Entity Count**: After filtering, the final number of entities in the SnapNTell dataset is 7,568.\n\nThese steps ensure that the dataset is comprehensive, diverse, and of high quality, suitable for training and testing multimodal models.

The experimental results in the text quotes [4] and [9] show that the proposed objectives, such as DSC, can help improve the performance on imbalanced datasets. The image quotes provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of these objectives on different datasets, as shown in image1, image2, image3, image6, image7, and image8.

According to the text, removing the abstract from the input to SPECTER results in a substantial decrease in performance, as shown in Table 2 [1]. This indicates that the abstract is a crucial feature for the model's performance. Additionally, adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and the suboptimal tokenization using Wordpieces for author names [1]. Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, where it makes sense as venues are expected to have high correlation with document content [1].\n\nThe image1 provides a visual representation of the impact of different features on the model's performance. The table shows that the SPECTER model performs best when the abstract is included, with an average score of 80.0. Removing the abstract decreases the average score to 68.1. Adding venues slightly improves the performance to 79.9, while adding authors decreases it to 67.3. The table also shows that using hard negatives and starting with BERT-Large instead of SciBERT reduces performance, further emphasizing the importance of the abstract and the choice of the initial model.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of the abstract is critical for the performance of the SPECTER model, while adding authors and venues has a negative impact.

This is shown in Table 5, where the model's performance is compared across different settings. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy, taking into account both precision and recall. In this case, the model's performance is lower than in the distractor setting, where it achieves an F1 score of 67.08. This suggests that the model struggles in the open-domain setting, where it must retrieve relevant paragraphs from a larger pool of candidates. The authors attribute this to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions. They suggest that future work can explore better retrieval methods for multi-hop questions. The F1 score of 39.12 is also lower than the model's performance when additional two gold paragraphs are given, where it achieves an F1 score of 53.12. This demonstrates the significant effect of failure to retrieve gold paragraphs. The authors suggest that future multi-hop RC datasets can develop improved methods for distractor collection. The F1 score of 39.12 is also lower than the model's performance when the same procedure is done on the training set and the model is re-trained, where it achieves an F1 score of 60.10 on the adversarial distractors. This shows that the open-domain setting is challenging for the single-hop model and is worthy of future study.

This is similar to the approach used by Clark and Gardner in 2018. The model receives a question and a single paragraph as input, and the question and paragraph are merged into a single sequence. The model then outputs a scalar value and a text of either a span, yes, no, or no answer, based on which of the four outputs has the highest score. The final answer is selected from the paragraph with the smallest y_empty score. This process is repeated for each paragraph in parallel, and the answer with the highest score is selected as the final answer. This approach allows the model to handle questions that require multi-hop reasoning, as it can consider multiple paragraphs and select the answer that best fits the question. The model's performance in the open-domain setting is challenging, but it is still able to achieve a high F1 score, indicating that it is effective at selecting the correct answer from a large set of distractors. The model's ability to handle multi-hop reasoning is further demonstrated by its performance on the HOTPOT QA dataset, where it is able to achieve a high F1 score even when the distractors are carefully chosen to induce multi-hop reasoning.

In terms of dataset size, MMMU encompasses 11.5K questions, which is significantly larger than many other benchmarks, as shown in Figure 6. This extensive dataset size allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of models' capabilities.\n\nRegarding image types, MMMU covers a diverse range of 30 different image formats, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, and more. This is a broader coverage compared to other benchmarks, which often focus on a limited set of image types, as depicted in Figure 4. The inclusion of such a wide variety of image types ensures that models are tested on a diverse array of visual inputs, enhancing the benchmark's robustness.\n\nIn terms of reasoning depth, MMMU requires models to perform deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge, as highlighted in Figure 1. This is a more advanced requirement compared to other benchmarks, which typically demand commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. The tasks in MMMU often necessitate the integration of domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images, making it a more challenging benchmark for evaluating multimodal understanding and reasoning.\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark stands out due to its larger dataset size, broader coverage of image types, and deeper reasoning requirements, making it a more comprehensive and challenging benchmark for evaluating multimodal models. ![MMMU benchmark covers a diverse range of image types](image1) ![MMMU benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge](image4) ![MMMU benchmark has a larger dataset size](image6) ![MMMU benchmark has a broader coverage of image types](image4) ![MMMU benchmark has deeper reasoning requirements](image1) ![MMMU benchmark has a larger dataset size](image6) ![MMMU benchmark has a broader coverage of image types](image4) ![MMMU benchmark has deeper reasoning requirements](image1) ![MMMU benchmark has a larger dataset size](image6) ![MMMU benchmark has a broader coverage of image types](image4) ![MMMU benchmark has deeper reasoning requirements](image1) ![MMMU benchmark has a larger dataset size](image6) ![MMMU benchmark has a broader coverage of image types](image4) ![MMMU benchmark has deeper reasoning requirements](image1) ![MMMU benchmark has a larger dataset size](image6) ![MMMU"}

The primary distinction between the two environments is the interconnect technology: RSC employs NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand, whereas the research cluster utilizes Elastic Fabric. The GPU usage for pre-training is reported in Table 2.\n\nLooking at the image quote `![Chameleon GPU usage for different parameters](image1)`, we can see the GPU usage for Chameleon models with different parameters. The table shows that the 7B model uses 1024 concurrent GPUs and 856481 GPU hours, while the 34B model uses 3072 concurrent GPUs and 4282407 GPU hours.\n\nTherefore, the difference in GPU usage for Chameleon models with different parameters is that the 34B model uses more concurrent GPUs (3072 vs 1024) and more GPU hours (4282407 vs 856481) compared to the 7B model.

The text quotes [10] and [11] mention that the exam is based on the entire recruiting life cycle, including understanding how to effectively search the network and display jobs to potential candidates. This suggests that candidates need to focus on mastering the use of LinkedIn Recruiter's search functionalities and job posting capabilities.\n\nThe image quotes provide additional insights into the exam topics. Image 3 shows a LinkedIn Certification page with a \"How to Prepare\" section, indicating that candidates should prepare for the exam by understanding the certification curriculum. Image 4 illustrates the different areas covered by the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification, including building a talent pipeline, engaging talent, posting jobs, and maximizing efficiency. These areas align with the text quotes and emphasize the importance of understanding the full recruiting process.\n\nNow, let's address how understanding Boolean search results through a Venn diagram relates to these topic areas. The text quote [2] provides an example of a Boolean search string: \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager.\" This search string is designed to find candidates who are engineers with Java skills but are not managers. The Venn diagram in image 7 visually represents the results of this search string. The diagram shows three overlapping circles labeled \"Engineering,\" \"Java,\" and \"Manager.\" The area where the \"Engineering\" and \"Java\" circles overlap, but not the \"Manager\" circle, represents the candidates who meet the search criteria.\n\nUnderstanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings is a fundamental skill for all talent acquisition professionals, as mentioned in text quote [4]. By using a Venn diagram to visualize the search results, candidates can better understand how different search terms interact and how to refine their search queries to find the most relevant candidates. This skill is directly related to the \"Identifying talent: Search\" area covered by the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification, as shown in image 4.\n\nIn conclusion, candidates need to focus on mastering the use of LinkedIn Recruiter's search functionalities, job posting capabilities, and understanding the full recruiting process for the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification exam. Understanding Boolean search results through a Venn diagram is a crucial skill that relates to the \"Identifying talent: Search\" area and helps candidates refine their search queries to find the most relevant candidates"}

All utensils should be stacked securely to prevent tipping over and should be positioned in a way that allows the spray arms to rotate freely during washing. [3]\n\n2. **Hollow Items**: Load hollow items such as cups, glasses, pans, etc., with the opening facing downwards to prevent water from collecting inside. [3]\n\n3. **Dishes and Cutlery**: Dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other. To avoid damage, glasses should not touch one another. The upper basket is designed for more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups. Long-bladed knives should be stored in an upright position, but long and/or sharp items of cutlery like carving knives must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket. [3]\n\n4. **Avoid Overloading**: Do not overload the dishwasher, as this is important for good results and reasonable energy consumption. [3]\n\n5. **Loading Order**: It is recommended to load the lower basket first, then the upper one. [4]\n\n6. **Positioning of Large Items**: Place large items and the most difficult to clean items, such as pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls, into the lower basket. Serving dishes and lids should be placed on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm. The maximum diameter advised for plates in front of the detergent dispenser is 19 cm to ensure the opening of the dispenser is not hampered. [12]\n\n7. **Leveling the Dishwasher**: Ensure the dishwasher is level for proper dish rack operation and wash performance. Use a spirit level to check and adjust the three leveling legs individually. [6]\n\n8. **Securing the Dishwasher**: Secure the dishwasher in place using the installation hook and wood screws for normal work surfaces or fix the side with screws for marble or granite worktops. [10]\n\n9. **Non-Compliance Warning**: Non-compliance with the loading instructions can result in poor washing quality.

The 8051AH has a thermal resistance of 45°C/W, while the 8751BH has a thermal resistance of 36°C/W. This means that the 8751BH can dissipate heat more efficiently than the 8051AH. The difference in thermal resistance is due to the different manufacturing processes used for the two parts. The 8051AH is manufactured on P 414.1, an HMOS II process, while the 8751BH is manufactured on P 422, an HMOS-E process. The HMOS-E process is more advanced and allows for better heat dissipation.

This alignment is crucial for the proper separation of chromosomes during the next phase, Anaphase I.\n\n2. **Spindle Fiber Attachment**: Microtubules from the spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. The kinetochore is a protein structure on the centromere of each chromosome that serves as the attachment point for the spindle fibers.\n\n3. **Chromosome Condensation**: Chromosomes are highly condensed and visible under a microscope. This condensation is necessary for the chromosomes to be properly aligned and separated.\n\n4. **Centromere Positioning**: The centromeres of the chromosomes are positioned at the metaphase plate, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n\n5. **Crossing Over**: Although crossing over occurs during Prophase I, its effects are visible during Metaphase I as the chromosomes are now aligned and the genetic material has been exchanged between homologous chromosomes.\n\n6. **Tetrad Formation**: The tetrad, which is a group of four chromatids formed by the pairing of homologous chromosomes, is visible during Metaphase I. This structure is a result of synapsis and crossing over.\n\n7. **Chromatid Separation**: Sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere, but homologous chromosomes are separated, ready to be pulled to opposite poles of the cell during Anaphase I.\n\nThese processes ensure that the genetic material is accurately distributed to the daughter cells, maintaining the correct number of chromosomes in each cell. The alignment and separation of chromosomes during Metaphase I are critical for the proper functioning of meiosis and the production of genetically diverse gametes. \n\n![Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Homologous chromosomes separate during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Sister chromatids remain attached during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Tetrad formation during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Crossing over effects visible during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Centromere positioning during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Spindle fiber attachment during Metaphase I](image6)  \n![Chromosome cond"}

The nuclear envelope starts to re-form around each set of chromosomes, creating two distinct nuclei. This is evident in the image where the chromosomes are shown to be moving towards the poles and the nuclear envelope is beginning to form around them.\n\n2. **Nuclear Envelope**: The nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of chromosomes, enclosing them within two separate nuclei. This is illustrated in the image where the nuclear envelope is shown to be forming around the chromosomes.\n\n3. **Cytokinesis**: The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cell into two daughter cells. This is depicted in the image where the plasma membrane is shown to be pinching inward, forming a cleavage furrow.\n\n4. **Cell Plate Formation**: In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle from vesicles containing cell wall material.

According to Mendel's laws, each parent contributes one allele for each trait to the offspring, resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio and a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation. This is because the dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele, leading to the observed ratios. The image1 shows the genetic makeup of the F2 generation, with the phenotypic ratio of 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower and the genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. The image4 illustrates the cross between true-breeding parents with purple and white flowers, resulting in the F2 generation with the observed ratios. The image7 demonstrates the Punnett square for a monohybrid cross, showing the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring. The image8 explains the concept of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, which are essential for understanding the inheritance patterns observed in the F2 generation. The image2 and image5 provide examples of dominant and recessive traits in humans, further illustrating the principles of Mendelian inheritance.

The genotypic ratio is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp. This is consistent with Mendel's laws of inheritance, where the dominant trait (purple) is expressed in the presence of at least one dominant allele (P), and the recessive trait (white) is expressed only when both alleles are recessive (pp). The heterozygous individuals (Pp) express the dominant phenotype but carry the recessive allele, which can be passed on to the next generation. The phenotypic ratio of 3:1 and the genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 are characteristic of a monohybrid cross in which one trait is being studied. The phenotypic ratio is derived from the genotypic ratio, as the dominant phenotype (purple) is expressed in both the homozygous dominant (PP) and heterozygous (Pp) genotypes, while the recessive phenotype (white) is expressed only in the homozygous recessive genotype (pp). The genotypic ratio is determined by the possible combinations of alleles from the parents, with each parent contributing one allele to the offspring. In this case, the parents are both heterozygous (Pp), so the possible genotypes of the offspring are PP, Pp, and pp, with the ratios of 1:2:1, respectively.

This act, which replaced the Libel and Defamation Act of 2020, introduced several key provisions aimed at addressing the publication of defamatory content. Specifically, Section 18 of the Defamation Act states that unless a publication is made with malice, it is subject to the provisions of the act and is privileged. This means that publications in news media or other reports are generally protected from defamation claims unless malice can be proven. Additionally, the act clarifies that it is not intended to protect the publication of illegal or obscene material, nor to limit any existing privileges. The act also includes provisions for qualified privilege, which can be a defense in defamation cases if the defendant has been requested to publish the information and has done so in a reasonable manner.

As shown in the provided figures, structured markup errors can lead to a decrease in the number of items indexed by search engines, as seen in the table where the number of items with errors is highlighted in red. This can result in a lower visibility of the website in search engine results pages (SERPs). Similarly, meta description issues, such as duplicate or missing meta descriptions, can also negatively impact SEO performance. The table shows that there are 2,215 duplicate meta descriptions, 21 long meta descriptions, and 1,450 short meta descriptions, which can lead to a lower click-through rate (CTR) and a lower ranking in SERPs.

For instance, the adoption of Post Policies and Procedures is expected to rise from 70% to 87%, Staff Communication from 70% to 82%, and Training from 75% to 76%. This trend aligns with the broader adoption of technologies such as Bar Code Technology, Speech Recognition, and Handheld PDAs, as seen in image5, which are expected to increase from 59% to 69%, 59% to 65%, and 59% to 62%, respectively. These increases suggest a growing emphasis on integrating technology to enhance communication, training, and operational efficiency within healthcare organizations. The adoption of these technologies is likely driven by the need to improve patient care, streamline processes, and reduce medical errors, as highlighted in the text quotes [1], [6], and [12]. The future system's consolidation of information and unification of efforts, as mentioned in [4], will further support these trends by providing a more cohesive and efficient platform for healthcare professionals to access and share information. This integration is crucial for addressing the fragmented patient information and redundant efforts currently observed in the healthcare system, as noted in [6]. Overall, the projected changes in intranet functions and the adoption of new technologies reflect a strategic shift towards leveraging technology to improve healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency. ![Intranet functions are expected to increase significantly over the next two years](image4) ![Bar Code Technology, Speech Recognition, and Handheld PDAs are expected to increase in adoption](image5) ![The future system will consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts](image6) ![Medical errors account for more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motorcycle accidents](image7) ![The adoption of technologies is driven by the need to improve patient care and streamline processes](image8) ![The current system fragments patient information and creates redundant, inefficient efforts](image9) ![The future system will consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts](image10) ![The future system will consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts](image11) ![The future system will consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts](image12) ![The future system will consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts](image13) ![The future system"}

By 2010, the time spent with family and friends decreased to 21%, while the time spent on social media increased to 22%. This suggests a trend towards more solitary activities, possibly due to the rise of digital media and social networking.\n\nIn contrast, the trends in banana exports during the same period show a different pattern. The 3D bar chart in image3 indicates that the volume of banana exports from various countries has fluctuated over the years. For instance, the exports from Ecuador and the Philippines have remained relatively stable, while those from other countries like Guatemala and Honduras have shown more variability. This suggests that the banana export industry is subject to various factors such as market demand, production capacity, and international trade policies.\n\nThe changes in the distribution of activities and the trends in banana exports are not directly related, as they pertain to different sectors of society. However, they both reflect broader societal changes over the past decade, such as the increasing influence of technology on daily life and the global nature of trade. The shift towards more solitary activities may be a response to the increasing availability of digital media and social networking, while the fluctuations in banana exports may be a result of changes in global trade patterns and market demand.

The table in image4 further illustrates this concept, showing that the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, eventually becoming negative, indicating that consuming more hot dogs beyond a certain point is no longer desirable. This behavior is consistent with the law of diminishing marginal utility, which states that as a person consumes more of a good, the additional satisfaction gained from consuming each successive unit will eventually decrease. The image of the stopwatch in image5 may also suggest that the time spent consuming additional hot dogs may not be worth the diminishing utility gained, further emphasizing the importance of considering the marginal utility of consumption. The image of the girl eating a hot dog in image7 may also suggest that the initial consumption of a hot dog may provide a high level of satisfaction, but as more hot dogs are consumed, the satisfaction gained from each additional hot dog may decrease, leading to a decrease in overall utility. The image of the girl stretching in image8 may also suggest that the time spent consuming additional hot dogs may be better spent on other activities, such as exercise, which may provide a higher level of satisfaction and overall utility. The image of the two men in image1 may also suggest that the consumption of hot dogs may be influenced by social factors, such as the desire to fit in with a group or to impress others, which may lead to overconsumption and a decrease in overall utility. The image of the two men in image6 may also suggest that the consumption of hot dogs may be influenced by cognitive factors, such as the desire to achieve mastery in some area, which may lead to overconsumption and a decrease in overall utility. The image of the two men in image3 may also suggest that the consumption of hot dogs may be influenced by economic factors, such as the desire to maximize utility and minimize cost, which may lead to a decrease in overall utility if the cost of consuming additional hot dogs outweighs the satisfaction gained. The image of the two men in image9 may also suggest that the consumption of hot dogs may be influenced by psychological factors, such as the desire to avoid negative addictions and pursue positive addictions, which may lead to a decrease in"}

Ensure serving dishes and lids are positioned on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm. The maximum diameter advised for plates in front of the detergent dispenser is 19 cm to prevent hampering the opening of it.\n\n2. **Load the Upper Basket**: The upper basket is designed to hold more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups. Long-bladed knives should be stored in an upright position, but this is a potential hazard, so it's recommended to position them horizontally. Sharp items like carving knives must also be placed horizontally in the upper basket. All utensils should be stacked securely and not tip over, and they should be loaded in a way that allows the spray arms to rotate freely during washing.\n\n3. **Load Hollow Items**: Load hollow items such as cups, glasses, pans, etc., with the opening facing downwards so that water cannot collect in the container or a deep base. Dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other. To avoid damage, glasses should not touch one another.\n\n4. **Avoid Overloading**: Do not overload the dishwasher, as this is important for good results and reasonable consumption of energy.\n\n5. **Check for Proper Loading**: Ensure that the dishwasher is level for proper dish rack operation and wash performance. Use a spirit level on the door and rack track inside the tub to check that the dishwasher is level. Adjust the three leveling legs individually if necessary.\n\n6. **Follow Loading Guidelines**: Scrape off any large amounts of leftover food, but it is not necessary to rinse the dishes under running water. Follow the loading guidelines for best performance of the dishwasher.\n\n7. **Use Recommended Detergent**: Use only detergent and rinse agents recommended for use in an automatic dishwasher. Never use soap, laundry detergent, or hand washing detergent in your dishwasher.\n\n8. **Check for Proper Connection**: The appliance needs to be connected to the main water valve using new hose sets. Old sets should not be reused.\n\n9. **Avoid Washing Plastic Items**: Do not wash plastic items unless they are marked \"dishwasher safe\" or the equivalent. For unmarked plastic items, check the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\n10"}

When your heart rate reaches a certain zone, the watch will display a corresponding color. For example, during an outdoor run, the heart rate zone is shown in different colors on the watch screen, as illustrated in the figure [1]. The colors represent different heart rate zones such as Extreme, Anaerobic, Aerobic, Fat-burning, and Warm-up, which are calculated based on your maximum heart rate or heart rate reserve [2]. This allows you to monitor your heart rate in real-time and adjust your workout intensity accordingly. After completing your workout, you can check your average heart rate, maximum heart rate, and heart rate zone on the workout results screen [3]. The heart rate zone calculation methods while you are running are not affected by the settings in the Huawei Health app, and for most running courses, HRR percentage is selected by default [2]. The watch can also detect your workout status automatically and remind you to start recording your workout when it detects an increase in activity [7]. During a workout, the Huawei Health app displays workout time and other data, including heart rate, step count, speed, and time [6]. The watch will vibrate to alert you if your heart rate value has exceeded the upper limit for more than 10 seconds [9]. You can view graphs that show the changes in heart rate, maximum heart rate, and average heart rate for each workout under Exercise records in the Huawei Health app [10]. The heart rate measurement will be performed once a second for high-intensity activities, and it takes 6 to 10 seconds to display the first heart rate value [8]. The measurement will be interrupted if you swipe right on the watch screen, start a workout with the Huawei Health app, or receive a notification for an incoming call or alarm [12]. To ensure the accuracy of the heart rate measurement, wear the watch correctly and ensure that the strap is fastened [12]. The heart rate zone color display helps you to monitor your heart rate and adjust your workout intensity accordingly, ensuring a safe and effective workout. ![Heart rate zone color display during an outdoor run](image2) ![Heart rate zone color display during an outdoor run](image2) ![Heart rate zone color display during an outdoor run](image2) ![Heart rate zone color display during an outdoor run](image2) ![Heart rate zone color display during an outdoor run](image"}

During this period, the U.S. was heavily investing in space exploration and technology, which likely contributed to advancements in medical technology and healthcare infrastructure. The Space Race timeline highlights key milestones such as the launch of Sputnik, the first human spaceflight, and the moon landing, all of which required significant investment in research and development. This investment in technology and innovation likely had a positive impact on healthcare, leading to increased spending as a percentage of GDP. Additionally, the Space Race timeline also highlights the Cold War era, which was marked by increased military spending and a focus on national security. This focus on national security may have also contributed to increased healthcare spending, as the U.S. government prioritized the health and well-being of its citizens in order to maintain a strong military and national defense.

It receives input from multiple sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, and others, to monitor the engine's operating conditions. Based on this information, the ECU adjusts the fuel injection and ignition timing to optimize engine performance and efficiency. It also controls the idle speed by monitoring the engine RPM and adjusting the throttle stop or idle air bypass control stepper motor accordingly. The ECU's role is to ensure that the engine runs smoothly and efficiently by making real-time adjustments to the fuel and air mixture and ignition timing. This is evident from the block diagram in image1, which shows the ECU as the central component receiving input from various sensors and controlling the injectors and other engine components. The ECU's function is further supported by the text quotes, which describe its role in determining the amount of fuel, ignition timing, and other parameters needed for the engine to run efficiently. The ECU's control over the fuel injection system is also illustrated in image4, which shows the fuel system using an anti-surge tank and the ECU's role in regulating the fuel pressure and flow. Overall, the ECU is a critical component of the engine management system, responsible for ensuring that the engine operates at its optimal performance and efficiency levels."}

In 2005, the largest portion of time was spent with family and friends, accounting for 35% of the total weekend time. By 2010, this figure had decreased to 21%, indicating a reduction in social activities. Conversely, the time spent on watching films increased from 10% in 2005 to 22% in 2010, suggesting a growing preference for solitary or family-oriented entertainment.\n\nThis change in leisure activity distribution can be linked to global educational participation trends as reflected in the training program statistics. The training program, which aims to train the next generation of CTBT experts, saw a significant increase in registered participants from 105 countries, with a total of 425 participants. This surge in educational participation could be attributed to the growing awareness and importance of global issues, such as nuclear disarmament, which the CTBT addresses. The increased focus on education and training may have led to a shift in leisure activities, with more people opting for activities that can be done individually or with family, such as watching films, rather than engaging in social activities.\n\nThe changes in leisure activity distribution and the increase in educational participation can be seen as part of a broader trend towards a more informed and engaged global citizenry. As people become more aware of global issues and the importance of education, they may be more likely to prioritize activities that contribute to their personal and professional development, even during their leisure time. This trend is reflected in the increased participation in educational programs and the shift towards more solitary or family-oriented leisure activities. \n\nIn conclusion, the changes in weekend activity distribution between 2005 and 2010, as well as the increase in educational participation, suggest a growing awareness of global issues and a shift towards more informed and engaged global citizenship. This trend is reflected in the increased participation in educational programs and the shift towards more solitary or family-oriented leisure activities. \n\n![Time spent on weekends](image6) \n![Training program statistics](image2) \n\nPlease note that the images referenced in the answer are placeholders and do not contain the actual data.

Needs Exploration involves identifying and prioritizing the requirements of stakeholders, ensuring that the project aligns with their expectations and business goals. Elicitation Methods, on the other hand, are techniques used to gather these requirements effectively. These methods can include active stakeholder participation, high-level requirements specification, and detailed requirements specification, as shown in image6. By employing these methods, agile teams can ensure that the solution being developed meets the needs of stakeholders, leading to a more successful project outcome. The combination of Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods helps in creating a clear understanding of stakeholder needs, which is essential for the iterative and adaptive nature of agile project management. This approach allows for continuous improvement and ensures that the final product is consumable and meets the desired quality standards. ![Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) framework](image7) illustrates the importance of these processes in the overall project lifecycle, emphasizing their role in producing a potentially consumable solution and addressing changing stakeholder needs. ![How Does Agile Analysis Work?](image8) further highlights the significance of understanding and addressing stakeholder needs in agile analysis.

{"q_id": 1995, "model": "InternVL2_5-38B", "in_tok": 8087, "out_tok": 512, "total_tok": 8599, "response": "The different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode significantly enhance photography by allowing photographers to adapt to various scenarios and achieve the desired results. \n\nFor metering modes, as shown in image5, there are three primary options: Matrix, Center, and Spot. The Matrix mode measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for shooting natural landscapes where a balanced exposure is crucial. The Center mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is perfect for portraits where the subject's face is the main focus. The Spot mode concentrates on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes, ensuring that the critical area is properly exposed.\n\nRegarding focus modes, image4 outlines three main options: AF-S (single), AF-C (continuous), and MF (manual). AF-S is suitable for stationary subjects, ensuring a sharp focus on unmoving objects. AF-C is designed for moving subjects, maintaining focus as the subject moves within the frame. MF allows for manual focus adjustment, giving photographers precise control over the focus point, especially useful in low-light conditions or when the camera's autofocus struggles to lock onto the subject.\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, photographers can optimize their shots for different conditions and subjects, resulting in more professional and visually appealing images. For instance, using Matrix metering for landscapes and AF-C for moving subjects can help capture dynamic scenes with balanced exposure and sharp focus. Similarly, Center metering and AF-S can be used for portraits to ensure the subject's face is well-lit and in focus. \n\nIn conclusion, the versatility of metering and focus modes in Pro Mode allows photographers to tailor their settings to specific scenarios, enhancing the overall quality and impact of their photographs. ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image5) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image4) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image3) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image1) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image2) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image6) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image7) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image8) ![Different metering modes"}

In image4, the conversion rate is 1.50%, while in image7, it ranges from 45% to 75%. These differences can be attributed to various factors such as the quality of leads, the effectiveness of the sales team, and the alignment between marketing and sales strategies.\n\nA higher conversion rate, as seen in image7, suggests that the marketing efforts are generating high-quality leads that are more likely to be accepted by the sales team. This could indicate a well-defined target audience, effective lead nurturing, and a strong alignment between marketing and sales goals. On the other hand, a lower conversion rate, as seen in image4, may indicate issues with lead quality, misalignment between marketing and sales, or a lack of effective lead nurturing.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for businesses. A higher conversion rate can lead to increased sales efficiency, reduced costs, and improved customer satisfaction. Conversely, a lower conversion rate may result in wasted resources, decreased sales performance, and potential customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, businesses should focus on improving lead quality, aligning marketing and sales strategies, and implementing effective lead nurturing processes to increase the conversion rate from MQL to SAL."}

These problems include: 1) The dishes are not clean, 2) Cloudiness on glassware, 3) White spots appear on dishes and glasses, 4) Black or grey marks on dishes, 5) Detergent left in dispenser, 6) The dishes aren't drying, 7) Dishwasher doesn't start, 8) Water not pumped from dishwasher, 9) Suds in the tub, 10) Stained tub interior, 11) White film on inside surface, and 12) There are rust stains on cutlery. Each problem has a possible cause and a recommended solution. For example, if the dishes are not clean, the possible causes could be not enough detergent, items blocking the movement of the spray arms, or the filter combination not being clean or correctly fitted. The recommended solution is to use more detergent, rearrange the items, or clean and/or fit the filter correctly. If the dishwasher doesn't start, the possible causes could be a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker, power supply not turned on, or low water pressure. The recommended solution is to replace the fuse or reset the circuit breaker, make sure the dishwasher is turned on and the door is closed securely, and check that the water supply is connected properly and the water is turned on. If the water is not pumped from the dishwasher, the possible causes could be a twisted or trapped drain hose, a clogged filter, or a clogged kitchen sink. The recommended solution is to check the drain hose, check and coarse the filter, and check the kitchen sink to make sure it is draining well. If there are suds in the tub, the possible cause is using the wrong detergent. The recommended solution is to use only the special dishwasher detergent and let the suds evaporate. If the tub interior is stained, the possible cause is spilled rinse-aid. The recommended solution is to always wipe up rinse-aid spills immediately. If there is a white film on the inside surface, the possible cause is hard water minerals. The recommended solution is to clean the interior with a damp sponge and dishwasher detergent. If there are rust stains on cutlery, the possible cause is that the affected items are not corrosion resistant. The recommended solution is to avoid washing items that are not corrosion resistant in the dishwasher. If there is a knocking noise in the dishwasher, the possible cause is that a spray arm is knocking against an"}
