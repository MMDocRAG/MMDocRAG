The survey found that 1,051 interviews were conducted via cellphone, while 449 interviews were conducted via landline. The total number of interviews conducted was 1,500. The report also notes that the sample was corrected for a potential bias associated with re-contacting previously interviewed respondents in low-incidence strata. The sample was also corrected for within-household selection in landline interviews, which depended upon the number of Latino adults living in the household. The sample was corrected for the oversampling of telephone number exchanges known to have higher densities of Latinos and the corresponding under sampling of exchanges known to have lower densities of Latinos. Finally, the data were put through a post-stratification sample balancing routine. The post-stratification weighting utilized estimates of the U.S. adult Hispanic population based on the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, on gender, age, education, Census region, heritage and years in the U.S. Phone status of the U.S. adult Hispanic population (i.e., cellphone only, dual/landline only) is based on estimates from the January-June 2015 National Health Interview Survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the density of the Latino population is from the 2010 Census. The weights are then trimmed to avoid any particular case having too much influence on the results. The report also notes that the sample was compared with InfoUSA and Experian landline household databases, and phone numbers associated with households that included persons with known Latino surnames were subdivided into a surname stratum. The remaining, unmatched and unlisted landline sample was used to generate a stratum with a high incidence of Latinos, based upon the share of Latinos in the sample telephone exchange. The sample was divided into high and medium strata, based upon the share of Latinos in the sample telephone area code. The study employed a dual-frame landline/cellular telephone design to ensure the highest possible coverage of the eligible population. The study employed six strata. The sample consisted of a landline sampling frame (yielding 449 completed interviews) and a cellphone sampling frame (1,051 interviews). Both the landline and cellphone sampling frames used a stratified sampling design, oversampling areas with higher densities of Latino residents.

Confidence is expressed qualitatively and ranges from low confidence (inconclusive evidence or disagreement among experts) to very high confidence (strong evidence and high consensus). Likelihood, or the probability of an impact, is a term that allows a quantitative estimate of uncertainty to be associated with projections, ranging from very unlikely (less than or equal to a 1 in 10 chance of the outcome occurring) to very likely (greater than or equal to a 9 in 10 chance). The evaluation process involves assessing the available literature, determining the quality and quantity of available evidence, and evaluating the level of agreement across different studies. The appropriate level of confidence or likelihood is determined by the chapter author teams based on their expert assessment and consensus. The process is documented in the Traceable Accounts section for each chapter, and more information is available in Appendix 1: Technical Support Document and Appendix 4: Documenting Uncertainty. The document also includes a table that defines the likelihood levels, ranging from very unlikely to very likely, with specific probability ranges associated with each level. The confidence levels are also defined, ranging from low to very high, based on the strength of the evidence and expert agreement.

Older and less educated Americans are more likely to give the government low marks for reducing the threat of terrorism, while younger and more educated Americans are more positive in their assessments. Democrats are the only partisan group where a majority say the government is doing at least fairly well, with Independents and Republicans showing more negative ratings. Since early 2015, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum. Concerns over U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria also differ by age, with younger adults expressing more concern about the U.S. going too far in getting involved, while older age groups are more concerned about the U.S. not doing enough to stop Islamic militants. Views on government restrictions on civil liberties have fallen dramatically since 2013, with majorities in every age group now more concerned about security than civil liberties. The age gap in views on Islam encouraging violence is narrower than it was last fall, with 51% of Americans 65 and older saying Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence, compared to 64% in September. Evaluations of the government's job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups. The R-D difference in views on various issues, such as Iran's nuclear program and the Islamic militant group ISIS, shows that Republicans and Democrats have different perspectives, with Republicans generally more concerned about these issues. The approval ratings for the government's handling of these issues have fluctuated over time, with some issues showing a decrease in approval and others showing an increase. The change in approval ratings from August 2014 to December 2015 for various issues, such as ISIS and Iran's nuclear program, indicates a shift in public opinion over time. Overall, age and political ideology play a significant role in shaping perceptions of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat, and these perceptions have evolved over time."}

Adults under 30 are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%). The share expressing greater concern that policies do not go far enough to protect the country is now roughly the same as the historical high seen in early 2010, shortly after the failed Christmas-Day terrorist attack on an airliner en route to Detroit (when 58% said policies did not go far enough). By two-to-one, Americans now say that they are more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (28%). Since the start of the year, there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough.

The adoption of smartphones among older adults has also been growing at a relatively modest pace, with 18% of seniors being smartphone adopters, well below the national adoption rate of 55%. The adoption levels among seniors who have not attended college and those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 per year are similar, with slightly more than one third of those 80 years of age or older using the internet and just one in five members of this age group having a broadband connection at home."}

Similarly, seniors who have graduated from college are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as those who have not attended college. However, smartphone ownership remains low among seniors, with just 18% of seniors being smartphone adopters, which is well below the national adoption rate of 55%. Despite these low overall levels of usage as a group, certain portions of the senior population have internet and broadband adoption rates that are equal to—or in some cases greater than—rates among the general public. For instance, seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more are more than double the rate among seniors as a whole, but roughly half the smartphone ownership rate among high-income adults within the general population.

Additionally, men are more likely to see people being deceptive, with 24% of men and 13% of women reporting this behavior. These differences suggest that social media platforms may need to tailor their recommendations and advertisements differently for men and women to address these varying perceptions. For instance, platforms might focus on promoting positive interactions and community-building content for women, while also addressing the prevalence of bullying and deceptive behavior for men. The data also indicates that older users are less accepting of data use for certain purposes, which could influence how platforms approach user data privacy and consent.

For instance, the personal finance score algorithm is viewed as effective by 54% of Americans but only 32% find it fair, indicating a notable gap in public trust. In contrast, the automated criminal risk score is seen as fair by 50% and effective by 49%, suggesting a more balanced perception. These differences imply that while some systems are trusted for their effectiveness, they may not be equally trusted for fairness, potentially leading to public skepticism and concerns about the potential for bias and discrimination. The context in which these systems are used also plays a role, with some technologies being viewed more favorably in certain scenarios. Overall, the public's skepticism spans several dimensions, including concerns about fairness, the removal of the human element, and the inability of these systems to capture the nuance of complex situations. This skepticism is context-dependent, with otherwise similar technologies being viewed with support or suspicion depending on the circumstances or tasks they are assigned to do. Demographic differences are relatively modest on the question of fairness, although there is some notable variation related to race and ethnicity. For example, Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to find the consumer finance score concept fair to consumers. However, Blacks express much more concern about a parole scoring algorithm than do either whites or Hispanics. The public is relatively split on whether these programs would be effective at doing the job they are designed to do, with some 54% thinking the personal finance score program would be effective at identifying good customers, while around half think the parole rating (49%) and resume screening (47%) algorithms would be effective. Meanwhile, 39% think the video job interview concept would be a good way to identify successful hires. The context dependence is especially notable in the public’s contrasting attitudes toward the criminal risk score and personal finance score concepts. Similar shares of the population think these programs would be effective at doing the job they are supposed to do, with 54% thinking the personal finance score algorithm would do a good job at identifying people who would be good customers and 49% thinking the criminal risk score would be effective at identifying people who are deserving of parole.

The lack of encouragement for girls and minorities to pursue STEM from an early age is also a major barrier, with 39% of Americans considering this a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM jobs.

According to the data, European VC funds have a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2) compared to US funds (4.5), indicating better returns on investment. Additionally, European funds have a higher percentage of exits with a multiple of cash invested of 5 or more (57.26%) compared to US funds (47.27%). Despite having smaller average exit values, European funds compensate with lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency, resulting in higher exit multiples. This suggests that European VC is driving the best exit multiples globally, as evidenced by recent exits across top-tier funds. The scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to low entry valuations and high capital efficiency, allowing investors to be more selective and achieve higher yields.

The results in image1 further support this, showing a clear downward trend in precision, recall, and F1-Score as retrieval accuracy decreases, which aligns with the findings in text quote [1]. This suggests that improving retrieval accuracy is crucial for enhancing the models' ability to manage absent knowledge effectively."}

According to the results shown in Figure 3, incorporating logical constraints into the prompts with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass the performance of prompts with a larger number of demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE achieves a performance of 25.7%, which surpasses the 24.5% performance of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints. This indicates that it is crucial to provide both demonstrations and logical constraints to LLMs for optimal performance. Additionally, the performance of models like LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B improves greatly when trained on the LLM-LR dataset, which involves multiple hops of logical reasoning, as shown in Table 3. The results also highlight that directly using CoT to infer logic does not help much for ERE tasks, and the inherent issues in LLMs can lead to inaccurate logical constraints, as illustrated in Figure 2. Therefore, providing relevant logic to LLMs improves performance, but injecting irrelevant logic introduces fluctuations in results. The challenge lies in obtaining relevant logic and utilizing it effectively for LLMs. Overall, the use of logical constraints and demonstration samples enhances the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks, but further exploration is needed to address the challenges of logical inconsistency and overthinking in multi-turn conversations."}

For example, Llama2-13B with logical constraints achieves a Micro-F1 of 18.1% compared to 12.5% without constraints.\n   - **Causal-TimeBank**: Logical constraints also enhance performance, with Llama2-13B achieving a Micro-F1 of 33.1% with constraints compared to 18.1% without.\n\n2. **Post-Processing**:\n   - **MAVEN-ERE**: Post-processing generally reduces logical inconsistency but may not always improve performance. For instance, Llama2-13B with post-processing shows a Micro-F1 of 18.1% compared to 12.5% without, but the improvement is not as significant as with logical constraints.\n   - **Causal-TimeBank**: Post-processing results in a Micro-F1 of 18.1% for Llama2-13B, which is lower than the 33.1% achieved with logical constraints.\n\nIn summary, logical constraints are more effective in reducing logical inconsistency and improving performance across both datasets compared to post-processing. This is evident from the higher Micro-F1 scores and lower logical inconsistency percentages in the tables provided. \n\n![Logical Constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency and improving performance in LLM models across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets.](image1)"}

The table in image4 further supports this by showing that the inclusion of the LSTM layer and embeddings significantly improves the model's performance, while the output layer has a lesser impact. Overall, the trends observed indicate that incorporating document-level knowledge through pretraining and multi-task learning enhances the model's ability to capture sentiment patterns and improves its performance on aspect-level sentiment classification tasks."}

According to the data in Table 4, adding stereotypical adjectives like \"pretty\" to female entities and \"handsome\" to male entities significantly improved accuracy in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian. However, the improvement was less pronounced in other languages. This suggests that the effectiveness of such adjustments depends on the specific language and its grammatical structure. For instance, languages with grammatical gender markers, such as Spanish, may benefit more from these adjustments due to the explicit gender identification in the language. In contrast, languages without grammatical gender markers might not see as significant an improvement.

However, when models are trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets, their performance on the adversarial test set is much lower, with BERT's peak performance reduced to 53%, mean and median at 50%. This indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminates the cues, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension. The results suggest that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension and that controlling for spurious statistics is crucial for evaluating model performance.

The maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties was DKK 15,089 million, and the maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables, and other financial assets was DKK 29,522 million. The financial instruments were used to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on financial results. The foreign exchange risk was the most important financial risk for Novo Nordisk and could have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The financial risks were managed by hedging existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward. Hedge accounting was applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. The result of hedging activities was classified as part of financial items. Novo Nordisk only entered into derivative financial"}

The key factors contributing to these changes include:\n\n1. **Net Earnings**: The net earnings of $89.8 billion in 2021 were a major contributor to the increase in shareholders' equity.

This reduction in liabilities also contributed to the increase in equity.\n\n4. **Dividend Income**: Dividend income increased by $365 million compared to 2019, primarily due to dividends from Occidental Petroleum Corporation, which positively impacted the net earnings.\n\n5. **Capital Strength**: Berkshire's insurance companies maintained exceptionally high capital strength, with a combined statutory surplus of approximately $301 billion at December 31, 2021, differentiating them from competitors.\n\n6. **Debt Management**: The parent company debt decreased by $1.3 billion, primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt.

The repurchases also offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. The company's financial position was positively impacted by these repurchases, as they reduced the number of outstanding shares and increased the earnings per share. The repurchases were made through open market purchases and other types of transactions, subject to certain Board restrictions. The company had 71 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the Plan as of December 31, 2020, and 4 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. The company's Board of Directors approved 48 million additional shares under the Plan in June 2020. The company's undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. The company's outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. The company's Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.

The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company’s global financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2020.

Additionally, the evaluation considers the company's efforts to enhance corporate value and achieve sustainable growth, as well as the impact of their strategies on shareholder value.

The system also includes a focus on ESG assessment indicators and dialogue with stakeholders, including institutional investors, to ensure stable fund procurement and lasting corporate value enhancement. The remuneration is effectively linked to corporate performance while reflecting individual job responsibilities and performance, and remuneration standards in each member's home country are also taken into account. The Board of Directors decides by resolution the policy for determining remuneration for and other payments to each member of the Board of Directors, and the Executive Compensation Meeting reviews the executive remuneration system and determines the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors, taking into account factors such as corporate performance as well as individual job responsibilities and performance. The remuneration for Outside Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists only of fixed payments, ensuring independence from management. The remuneration system is an important means to promote various initiatives and is determined based on the following policy: it should be a system that encourages Members of the Board of Directors to work to improve the medium- to long-term corporate value of Toyota and it should be a system that can maintain compensation levels that will allow Toyota to secure and retain talented personnel.

This decrease was primarily due to the increase in RWA from 342,684 million in 2019 to 445,151 million in 2020, as shown in image3. The increase in RWA was driven by higher market volatility and changes in the business segments, as mentioned in text quotes [8] and [12].

In 2020, the U.S. segment saw a 4% increase in revenue, while the International Operated Markets segment experienced a 14% decrease. The U.S. segment's growth was driven by positive sales performance, whereas the International segment faced declines due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations. The company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, including the free Thank You Meals for first responders and health care workers, positively impacted comparable sales in the second half of 2020. The International segment's decline was more pronounced in markets like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain, partly offset by positive results in Australia. The company's heavily franchised business model, which generates stable and predictable revenue based on franchisee sales, was also affected by government regulations due to COVID-19 resurgences. The revenue declines were driven by the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, with over $100 million spent on marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth. The company's operating model, with franchised margin expenses being mainly fixed and company-operated restaurant expenses having more variable components, also influenced these changes.

This growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels. Global T&E spend grew 59% versus the prior year, reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year, which resulted in fourth quarter T&E volumes reaching 82% of 2019 levels.

The increase in cash outflows from investing activities was also partly due to additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, which were mainly investments for capacity expansions. The cash inflows from financing activities were strongly influenced by the financing of the acquisition of Varian, changing by €12,087 million to €11,839 million. This includes inflows from borrowings in the amount of €9.2 billion and an additional financing in the amount of €850 million, provided by the Siemens Group in fiscal year 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian. This was partly offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans described above in the amount of €730 million (nominal value: €859 million) and €300 million. The cash generated by financing activities consisted mainly of loans raised to finance the acquisition of Varian in an amount of €9.2 billion and the net inflows of €2.3 billion from the capital increase, less the year-on-year increase of €58 million in the dividend paid, the repayment of a loan of €0.8 billion, a significant rise in payments to buy back treasury shares, and a sharp rise in interest paid.

The increase in lending commitments also contributed to the overall increase in exposure. The sectors that were most sensitive to the economic environment and received heightened focus included retail, air travel, upstream energy, lodging and leisure, and healthcare services and systems. The increase in exposure was primarily due to growth in securities-based loans and residential real estate loans within the Wealth Management business segment and an increase in relationship lending commitments within the Institutional Securities business segment.

The provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19.

The increase in net earnings was more than offset by a decrease in operating margin. The company's net earnings per share increased by $0.4 billion or 3% to $14.7 billion.

The Bronx's increase was driven by a 290,000 square foot increase in capacity, which is the highest among all boroughs. This change is significant as it represents a 1.2% increase in the borough's total residential capacity, making it the borough with the highest percentage change in residential capacity due to rezonings during this period. The Bronx's increase in capacity is also notable because it was achieved despite a relatively low percentage of land area being rezoned, at 18.4%.

This shift was more pronounced among Republicans, with a 14-point increase since January and a 33-point increase since July 2013. The concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has fallen dramatically since July 2013, following Edward Snowden’s leaked details about NSA surveillance programs. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Dec. 8-13 among 1,500 adults, finds that since the start of this year, the share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points – from 72% to 46% – and now stands at its lowest point in the post-9/11 era. Today, similar proportions of conservative Republicans (71%), moderate and liberal Republicans (74%), and conservative and moderate Democrats (67%) say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough. By contrast, equal shares of liberal Democrats say their greater concern is that policies have gone too far in restricting average people’s civil liberties as say they worry more that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (41% each). These attitudes are little changed from earlier this year, but the balance of opinion has shifted since early 2014, before ISIS registered as a major threat for the public. In March 2014, more said relying too much on force creates hatred (57%) compared with 37% who say overwhelming military force was the best way to defeat terrorism. Views were similar to those in 2014 when the question was previously asked in 2011 and 2004.

Initially, the population grew rapidly from 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890, driven by the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad Act, which attracted settlers and transformed the area into a booming agricultural state. However, the population declined after 1890, likely due to economic challenges and the consolidation of farms, as seen in the decrease from 13,459 in 1910 to 8,862 in 2000. The population trends were influenced by these historical factors, as well as the decline of small towns and the consolidation of rural school districts. The population of Aurora, however, has shown recent gains, indicating a possible resurgence in some areas. The presence of ethnic enclaves and religious communities, such as the Danish and Swedish settlers, also played a role in shaping the county's demographic landscape. The map of Hamilton County highlights the geographical distribution of these communities, while the images of the church and the cemetery provide visual representations of the cultural and religious heritage that has persisted over time. The population data table further supports the trend of population decline, with a peak in 1890 and a gradual decrease thereafter. The images of the grain elevators and the church suggest the economic and religious factors that influenced the population changes. The tombstone image may represent the impact of mortality and migration on the population.

Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to support government responsibility for displaced workers, with 65% believing the government should take care of them, even if it means higher taxes. In contrast, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to believe individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-being, with 68% holding this view. This partisan divide is evident in the support for policies such as a universal basic income and a national service program, with Democrats showing higher support for these measures. The public is evenly divided on whether government or individuals should be responsible for providing for displaced workers, but is more supportive of limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines. The educational differences also play a role, with those with lower levels of educational attainment being more supportive of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can automate.

This shift is almost entirely among Republicans, as Democrats' views have remained largely unchanged. The decline in positive assessments among Republicans is evident, with a 31-point drop from 84% in late March to 53% in the current period. Democrats also have more positive views of their state and local government officials' response to the outbreak compared to Republicans. Positive assessments of hospitals' response to COVID-19 are consistent across party lines, but there are wider differences in views of public health officials, such as those at the CDC. Currently, 72% of Democrats and those who lean to the party say public health officials are doing well in responding to the outbreak, compared to 53% of Republicans and those who lean to the party. The decline in approval of state and local officials has been steeper among Republicans than among Democrats. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to give positive ratings to their state and local government officials for how they have responded to the coronavirus outbreak. Democrats also overwhelmingly hold the view that increased case counts are mainly the result of increased infections, with 8% saying this, while Republicans are more likely to say this. Democrats are more concerned that state restrictions on public activity have been lifted too quickly, with 90% of liberal Democrats and 73% of conservative and moderate Democrats saying this.

According to the survey, 6% of this age group have lost a job entirely due to automation, while 11% have had their pay or hours reduced for that reason. In total, 13% of Americans in this age group have been impacted by automation in one or both of these ways. This is significantly higher than the overall impact on the general population, where 6% of Americans report that they have already been impacted by automation in the form of lost jobs and/or wages. The survey also finds that Americans are being impacted by technology in more tangible ways when it comes to their career prospects, with 2% of Americans reporting that they have at some point personally lost a job because their employers replaced their positions with a machine or computer program, and another 5% have ever had their pay or hours reduced for the same reason. Taken together, that works out to 6% of Americans who report having been impacted by workforce automation in one (or both) of these ways. More broadly, nearly one-in-five Americans (18%) indicate that they personally know someone who has lost a job, or had their pay or hours reduced, as a result of workforce automation. Workers who have been impacted by automation are also much more likely than others to say that a wide range of specific technologies have had a negative impact on their jobs or careers.

Among all college-educated workers, the share of women earning a STEM degree varies widely, with 81% in health professions and only 16% in engineering. Among all STEM workers holding a professional or doctoral degree, about 41% are women, compared to 59% of STEM workers holding an undergraduate degree. Women with advanced degrees working in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiencing gender discrimination and to say that their gender has made it harder to succeed at work. Women in STEM jobs who hold a postgraduate degree are less inclined to think women are usually treated fairly when it comes to opportunities for promotion. The representation of women, blacks, and Hispanics holds pocketbook implications for workers, as STEM jobs have relatively high earnings compared with many non-STEM jobs, and the earnings gap persists even after controlling for educational attainment. Among workers with similar education, STEM workers earn significantly more, on average, than non-STEM workers.

Among workers with similar education, STEM workers earn significantly more, on average, than non-STEM workers. The inclusion of healthcare practitioners and technicians as STEM occupations has broad ramifications for the key findings. There are 9.0 million health-related jobs, comprising 52% of the STEM workforce. Health-related occupations are largely women, thus their inclusion boosts the overall representation of women in the STEM workforce. These health-related occupations also have somewhat larger shares of black workers and smaller shares of Asian workers compared with other STEM occupations, which affects the racial and ethnic composition of the overall STEM workforce. Among college-educated workers who majored in a STEM field during their undergraduate education, those who majored in health professions are significantly more likely to work in a STEM occupation, so their inclusion increases figures on the retention of STEM-trained workers."}

For instance, women make up 75% of healthcare practitioners and technicians, which is the largest STEM occupational cluster. However, they are underrepresented in computer and engineering positions, with only 25% and 14% of workers in these fields being women, respectively. In contrast, women account for 47% of life scientists and math workers, which is roughly equal to their overall share in the workforce. The report's Appendix provides a detailed breakdown of the share of women and total number of workers in specific STEM occupations, highlighting the broad variation among occupations in their share of women. For example, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering have some of the lowest shares of women of any engineering occupation, at 8% and 9%, respectively. The data also shows that gains in women's representation in STEM jobs have been concentrated among women holding advanced degrees, although women still tend to be underrepresented among such workers. Overall, the representation of women in STEM jobs is driven in large part by their overrepresentation in health-related jobs, but they are underrepresented in several other STEM occupational clusters, particularly in computer jobs and engineering. The report's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data since 1990 shows that while jobs in STEM have grown substantially, particularly in computer occupations, the share of women working in STEM jobs has remained at about half over time.

The gains are more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings. The BLEU scores of E S, F R, and I T generally follow the hypothesis, with R U and H E showing larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts F R and I T. The gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective. The BLEU scores of E S, F R, and I T do generally follow this hypothesis. As we move to very different languages, R U and H E see larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts F R and I T. This can be largely attributed to the observation from the previous section that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; R U and H E have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger. The results in Table 5 clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. Comparing the second and third columns, we can see the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings. This indicates that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence. The gains from pre-training in the higher-resource languages are consistent: ≈3 BLEU points for all three language pairs. In contrast, for the extremely low-resource languages, the gains are either quite small (A Z and B E) or very large, as in G L which achieves a gain of up to 11 BLEU points. This finding is interesting in that it indicates that word embeddings may be particularly useful to bootstrap models that are on the threshold of being able to produce reasonable translations, as is the case for G L in our experiments. The results in Table 2 clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree.

This is achieved by minimizing the triplet margin loss, which helps in improving the model's performance in ranking translations. The triplet margin loss is a common technique used in machine learning to learn embeddings that capture the relative similarity between data points. In the context of the Translation Ranking model, it helps in distinguishing between better and worse translations by creating a margin between the embeddings of the \"better\" hypothesis and the \"anchors\" (source and reference), and the \"worse\" hypothesis. This margin ensures that the model can effectively rank translations based on their quality. The triplet margin loss is a key component of the model's architecture, as it helps in learning meaningful embeddings that can be used for ranking translations. By minimizing the triplet margin loss, the model can learn to differentiate between better and worse translations, which is crucial for improving the model's performance in translation ranking tasks.

This feedback is then used to refine the outputs, ensuring they are more accurate and reliable. The strategy involves a Language Model, a Refine Model, and a Critic Model, where the Language Model generates outputs, the Refine Model refines them based on feedback, and the Critic Model evaluates the outputs. External models and tools, such as knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, search engines, and other tools, are used to provide diverse and detailed feedback, which helps in correcting errors and improving the quality of the outputs. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that require high accuracy and reliability, such as code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review. By incorporating external feedback, the strategy can address issues such as hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxicity, making the outputs more practical and deployable with minimal human intervention. The effectiveness of this strategy has been demonstrated in various tasks, including question answering, reasoning, code generation, and toxicity detection. The strategy is flexible and does not require training the Language Model or accessing its parameters, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. The strategy also facilitates the incorporation of more informative natural language feedback, offering a more transparent and explainable self-correction process. Overall, the 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy is a promising approach to rectify flaws in Language Models and improve the quality of their outputs.![Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback](image3)"}

These queries are learned positional encodings that are added to the input of each attention layer in the decoder. The model then independently decodes these queries into box coordinates and class labels using a feed forward network (FFN). This process allows the model to globally reason about all objects together using pair-wise relations between them, while being able to use the whole image as context. The object queries are shared across all layers, and the output encodings (object queries) are always learned. This approach simplifies the detection pipeline by removing the need for multiple hand-designed components like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression, and it can be easily reproduced in any framework that contains standard CNN and transformer classes. The model achieves comparable results to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO dataset and can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. The DETR model is straightforward to implement and has a flexible architecture that is easily extensible to panoptic segmentation, with competitive results. It achieves significantly better performance on large objects than Faster R-CNN, likely thanks to the processing of global information performed by the self-attention. The model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. The training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr. The model requires extra-long training schedule and benefits from auxiliary decoding losses in the transformer. The detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, with positional encodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Figure 10. Image features from the CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder, together with spatial positional encoding that are added to queries and keys at every multi-head self-attention layer. Then, the decoder receives queries (initially set to zero), output positional encoding (object queries), and encoder memory, and produces the final set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes through multiple multi-head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention. The first self-attention layer in the first decoder layer can be skipped.

It aims to enhance the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop. This method is particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user's needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The recursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\n\n- **Recursive Retrieval**: This technique involves a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner. It may include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process. This method is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data sources, extracting interconnected information.\n\n- **Adaptive Retrieval**: Methods like Flare and Self-RAG refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced. This approach allows the system to dynamically adjust its retrieval strategy based on the specific requirements of the task at hand, ensuring that the most relevant information is retrieved and used in the generation process.\n\nIn summary, Iterative Retrieval focuses on refining queries through feedback loops, Recursive Retrieval uses a hierarchical approach to summarize and refine searches, and Adaptive Retrieval dynamically adjusts retrieval based on task requirements. Each method contributes to the overall effectiveness and relevance of the information retrieved in a RAG system."}

When the word-order is preserved, LSTM models perform better than SWEM models, as shown in the results of the sentiment analysis tasks. However, when the word-order is shuffled, the performance of LSTM models drops, indicating that word-order is crucial for sentiment analysis. This is consistent with the findings that word-order information is beneficial for predicting sentiment orientations, as highlighted in the text [7]. The performance of LSTM models on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set is very close to the results with SWEM, suggesting that the main difference between LSTM and SWEM may be due to the ability of the former to capture word-order features. This is further supported by the results in Table 8, where LSTM models outperform SWEM models on sentiment analysis datasets. The word-order information is essential for sentiment analysis, as it helps in capturing the nuances of sentiment expressed through word order, such as the difference between \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" conveying different levels of negativity. \n\n![Word-order information is crucial for sentiment analysis in LSTM models](image3)![LSTM models perform better with preserved word-order](image4)![LSTM models' performance drops with shuffled word-order](image4)![Word-order information is essential for sentiment analysis](image7)"}

Slots such as `name`, `area`, and `type` have a high number of instances, while slots like `parking`, `stars`, and `internet` have fewer instances. This distribution is evident from the bar charts in image2 and image6, which show the frequency of each slot across different domains. The uneven distribution can pose challenges for DST models, as they may struggle to learn from underrepresented slots. The model's performance on these slots can be improved by using techniques like data augmentation or transfer learning to leverage knowledge from other domains. The heatmap in image8 further illustrates the distribution of data across different slots, highlighting the need for careful handling of slot-specific data in DST models. The model's ability to generalize and perform well across all slots is crucial for effective dialogue state tracking in multi-domain settings."}

This is evident from the higher AUC scores achieved by the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy compared to random selection, Entropy, Margin, BALD, and Coreset across various datasets. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the AUC scores of the initial and final cycles are also significantly high, indicating a strong positive correlation. This suggests that selecting 'Hard-to-Contrast' data as initial queries can lead to better model performance and efficiency in active learning. The strategy's effectiveness is further supported by its ability to improve model performance within subsequent active learning cycles, as highlighted in Figure 2. The implications for initial query selection in active learning are significant, as the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy provides a strong baseline for sampling initial queries, potentially addressing the cold start problem and improving overall model performance. This is particularly important in scenarios where data is scarce or biased, as it ensures a more diverse and representative initial set of labeled data, which is crucial for effective learning.

The benchmark includes various all-round benchmarks such as POPE, HaELM, LAMM, LVLM-eHub, SEED, MMBench, and MM-Vet, which focus on relatively basic perception abilities without requiring expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate reasoning. More holistic evaluations have been conducted, such as MathVista, which presents visually challenging questions but is limited to the mathematical domain. MMMU is highly different from these benchmarks by collecting more difficult expert-level problems that cover 30 different subjects and require nuanced perception, recalling domain-specific knowledge to perform step-by-step reasoning to derive the solution. MMMU features two unique challenges absent in current benchmarks: diverse image formats and interleaved text-image inputs. A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution. Despite its comprehensive nature, MMMU, like any benchmark, is not without limitations. The manual curation process may carry biases, and the focus on college-level subjects might not fully be a sufficient test for Expert AGI as per the definition. However, it should be necessary for an Expert AGI to achieve strong performance on MMMU to demonstrate their broad and deep subject knowledge as well as expert-level understanding and reasoning capabilities.

It involves the recognition of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, removal of the damaged base, and addition of new normal bases by a polymerase enzyme, followed by ligation by DNA ligase to restore the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA strand [5].\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This repair system is highly conserved among species and can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and more bulky adducts of DNA. It is more complicated in higher eukaryotes than in prokaryotes due to its broad substrate specificity [6].\n\n3. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl-transferase proteins, respectively. It does not involve incision of DNA strands or re-synthesis of new DNA, as the changed or mutated bases are directly reverted to their original states [11].\n\n4. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins, and signal discrimination factors to recognize the mutated strand first and then locate the site of the mismatched pair. This is followed by removal of the mutated sequence by an endonuclease, addition of new pairs by DNA polymerase, and final regain of the DNA double-stranded structure by DNA ligases [12].\n\n5. **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism primarily repairs double-strand breaks of DNA, which are the most devastating mutation-induced lesions. Double-strand breaks can be caused by endogenous factors such as replication errors or exogenous factors like ionizing radiation. Recombination repair mechanisms consist of many steps, including end resection, strand invasion, DNA repair synthesis, branch migration, and Holliday junction resolution.

During the **Problem Formulation** stage, the model translates the problem and goal into a task-specific symbolic language using large language models (LLMs). In the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver, such as a logic programming engine, performs inference on the symbolic formulation. Finally, in the **Result Interpretation** stage, an LLM or rule-based interpreter translates the symbolic answer back to natural language. This approach leverages the strong natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to represent problems using symbolic representations and the logical faithfulness and transparency of symbolic solvers to ensure accurate reasoning.

In D1, there are 637 neutral examples in the training set, which is relatively high compared to D3 and D4. D3 and D4 have 50 and 38 neutral examples in their training sets, respectively, indicating a much lower number of neutral examples. This imbalance in neutral examples is a key factor affecting the performance of aspect-level sentiment classification models, particularly on D3 and D4, as shown in the results of Table 2 and Figure 1. The lack of training examples for neutral instances makes it difficult for models to accurately predict neutral sentiment, which is why the macro-F1 scores are more significantly improved when document-level knowledge is transferred using PRET and MULT. The effectiveness of these approaches is evident in the performance gains observed in Table 2, where the combination of PRET and MULT yields better results across all datasets, especially on D3 and D4. The ablation tests in Table 3 further support the importance of transferring knowledge from document-level data, with the embedding layer transfer being particularly beneficial for D3 and D4 due to the unbalanced label distribution. Overall, the distribution of neutral examples plays a crucial role in the performance of aspect-level sentiment classification models, and leveraging document-level knowledge can help mitigate the challenges posed by this imbalance. \n\n![The distribution of neutral examples varies significantly across datasets D1 to D4, with D1 having the highest number of neutral examples and D3 and D4 having much lower numbers.](image1)\n\n![The macro-F1 scores on D3 and D4 show sharp increases when document-level training examples are added, indicating the effectiveness of PRET and MULT in improving performance on datasets with unbalanced label distributions.](image2)\n\n![The performance gains from PRET and MULT are more significant on D3 and D4, where the label distribution is extremely unbalanced, as shown in Table 2.](image3)\n\n![The combination of PRET and MULT yields the highest macro-F1 scores on D3 and D4, demonstrating the effectiveness of transferring document-level knowledge to improve aspect-level sentiment classification.](image4)"}

The AUC values for CNN+ATT and PCNN+ATT both increased significantly, with CNN+ATT showing an increase from 0.219 to 0.226 and PCNN+ATT from 0.253 to 0.264. This improvement is evident from the table in image8, where the p-values are less than 5e-02, indicating that the improvements are statistically significant. The DSGAN model's integration led to better performance in distinguishing true positives from false positives, as seen in the precision-recall curves in image7, where the models with DSGAN have higher precision and recall values compared to their counterparts without DSGAN. The adversarial learning process effectively enhanced the models' ability to filter noisy data, as depicted in image6, where the decision boundary of the DSGAN model is closer to the true positive data points, reducing the overlap with false positives. This improvement is consistent with the findings in image3, where the DSGAN generator outperforms the pre-trained generator and random selection in generating true positive samples from the noisy dataset. The DSGAN model's robustness is further supported by the consistent performance gains observed in various deep-neural-network-based models, as shown in image2, where the DSGAN model maintains high accuracy across different epochs and bag sequences. The adversarial training process, as illustrated in image4, ensures that the generator and discriminator continuously improve, leading to a stronger generator capable of collapsing the discriminator, which is reflected in the performance metrics of the models.

These fibers help in the movement and alignment of the chromosomes.\n\n3. **Chromosome Duplication**: Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, which are joined at the centromere. This duplication ensures that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of chromosomes.\n\n4. **Crossing Over**: Non-sister chromatids may exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over, which increases genetic diversity.\n\n5. **Chromosome Packing**: The chromosomes are highly compacted, making them visible under a microscope. This packing is crucial for the proper separation during anaphase.\n\n6. **Preparation for Separation**: The chromosomes are prepared for separation, which will occur in the subsequent anaphase I stage, where they will be pulled to opposite poles of the cell.\n\nThese processes ensure the proper segregation of genetic material, leading to the formation of gametes with half the number of chromosomes compared to the original cell."}

When these F1 plants are self-pollinated, the F2 generation exhibits a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers, with a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. This is because the dominant allele (P) masks the effect of the recessive allele (p), resulting in the dominant phenotype (purple flowers) being expressed in the heterozygous and homozygous dominant individuals, while the recessive phenotype (white flowers) is only expressed in the homozygous recessive individuals. The image below illustrates this concept, showing the inheritance of flower color in the F2 generation.\n\n![Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in F2 generation](image1)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers is 3:1, and the genotypic ratio is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. This demonstrates how Mendelian inheritance explains the observed ratios through the segregation of alleles during meiosis and the expression of dominant and recessive traits."}

The lead funnel progression shows the conversion rates between stages such as Total Leads to Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), MQLs to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs), SALs to SQLs, and SQLs to Sales Won Opportunities (SWOs). These rates indicate how well the marketing efforts are performing in moving leads through the funnel.\n\nThe marketing diagnostics provide average conversion rates for various lead sources, such as Website, Online Ad, Trade Show, and others, which show how effective each source is at converting leads into opportunities. These rates help in understanding which channels are most effective and where improvements can be made.\n\nBy comparing these rates, marketers can identify which sources and stages are performing well and which need optimization. For example, if the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is low, it might indicate a need to improve the quality of leads or the sales process. Similarly, if a specific lead source has a low conversion rate, it might suggest that the marketing strategy for that source needs adjustment.\n\nIn summary, both sets of conversion rates are crucial for optimizing the marketing funnel and improving overall conversion efficiency. They provide insights into different stages and sources, helping to pinpoint areas for improvement and enhance the effectiveness of marketing efforts."}

In standard consumption, the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, as shown in the table where the utility from the first hot dog is +6, the second is +2, and the third is 0. This indicates that the enjoyment from each additional hot dog decreases as more are consumed. However, in competitive contexts, such as a hot dog eating contest, the utility can increase significantly with each additional hot dog consumed, as seen in the table where the utility from the 64th hot dog is +5000, and the 65th is +10000. This demonstrates that in competitive settings, the focus and intensity of consumption can lead to increased utility, despite the general principle of diminishing marginal utility. The image of Joey Chestnut tying the Kobayashi record for hot dogs consumed in 2007 highlights the competitive context where focus and determination can lead to extraordinary outcomes, contrasting with the typical diminishing utility in standard consumption scenarios. \n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption](image1)![Increased utility in competitive contexts](image1)"}

Here's a detailed comparison and analysis:\n\n1. **Lead Funnel Progression**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% [4]. This indicates that out of every 100 MQLs, only 1.5 are accepted by the sales team as SALs. This rate is relatively low, suggesting that a significant number of MQLs may not meet the sales team's criteria or that the sales team is highly selective.\n\n2. **Marketing Metrics**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% [4]. This is consistent with the lead funnel progression, indicating a similar level of selectivity in the sales team's acceptance of MQLs.\n\n3. **Lead Source Conversion Rates**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% [5]. This further confirms the consistency of the conversion rate across different datasets, highlighting a consistent challenge in converting MQLs to SALs.\n\n4. **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Accepted Leads (SAL)**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% [7]. This rate is consistent across multiple datasets, suggesting a standardized process or criteria for accepting MQLs as SALs.\n\n5. **Marketing Metrics**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% [4]. This consistency across datasets reinforces the idea that the sales team has a high bar for accepting MQLs as SALs.\n\n### Implications of the Differences Observed:\n\n1. **Selective Sales Process**:\n   - The consistent low conversion rate (1.50%) across multiple datasets suggests that the sales team is highly selective in accepting MQLs. This could be due to stringent qualification criteria or a focus on high-quality leads that are more likely to convert into sales.\n\n2. **Opportunity Quality**:\n   - A low conversion rate might indicate that the MQLs are not as qualified as initially thought, or that the sales team is looking for leads that are further along in the buying process. This could imply that the marketing team needs to refine its lead qualification process to ensure that MQLs are more sales-ready.\n\n3. **Resource Allocation"}
