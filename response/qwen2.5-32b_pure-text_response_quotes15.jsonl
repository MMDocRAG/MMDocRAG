Blacks are significantly more likely than either whites or Hispanics to say they have been following campaign news very closely (30% of blacks compared with 18% of whites and 13% of Hispanics) [6]. This suggests varying levels of engagement and possibly influence on voting behavior.\n\nAmong partisans, there is a notable difference in perceptions of ethical standards. While majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their party as having high ethical standards, independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has “high ethical standards.” About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), say neither party has high ethical standards [10].\n\n![This chart illustrates how perceptions of the Republican and Democratic parties differ across various demographic groups, including education levels and political affiliations.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and political party preferences vary significantly among different education levels and political affiliations, with higher education levels generally showing more skepticism towards both parties' ethical standards and stronger Democratic leanings."}

According to the text quotes, adults under 30 are more concerned about the U.S. going too far in its involvement in Iraq and Syria ([1]). They are also split on whether U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties or do not go far enough to protect the country ([3]). In contrast, majorities in every other age group are more concerned about security than civil liberties, with the concern being most pronounced among those 65 and older ([3]).\n\nThe image quote `![This table displays survey results on opinions about the balance between civil liberties and national protection across different age groups.](image2)` provides further support. It shows that younger adults (ages 18-29) are more likely to believe that civil liberties are being overly restricted, while older adults (ages 65+) are more concerned that the government's policies do not go far enough to protect the U.S.\n\nNext, let's consider political ideology. Text quotes indicate that evaluations of the government’s job reducing the terrorist threat are more positive among those with a postgraduate degree and less so among those with lower education levels ([9]). Additionally, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum since early 2015 ([7]). Democrats are the only partisan group in which a majority still says the government is doing at least fairly well, though even their positive ratings have dropped significantly ([7]).\n\nThe image quote `![The image is a line graph showing data trends over time from 2004 to 2015 for three political affiliations: Republican, Democrat, and Independent.](image4)` illustrates the changing trends in approval ratings for different political affiliations over time. The graph suggests that Republican approval has remained relatively high, while Democratic and Independent approval has seen a gradual decline, indicating a shift in perception over time.\n\nLastly, the text quotes also mention that concerns over government restrictions on civil liberties have fallen dramatically since July 2013, following Edward Snowden’s leaks about NSA surveillance programs ([8]). The image quote `![The image is a line graph comparing two perspectives over a period from 2004 to 2015.](image5)` shows a similar trend, where the percentage of people who think the country has gone too far in restricting civil liberties increased over time, while the percentage who think the country hasn’t gone far enough decreased.\n\nIn conclusion, younger adults are more concerned about civil liberties being overly restricted, while older adults prioritize security. Political ideology influences perceptions, with higher education levels correlating with more positive evaluations of government efforts, and overall perceptions becoming more negative over time."}

This suggests that older generations may have a more pessimistic view of the government’s capabilities in this area.\n\nThe image ![Survey results about how different demographic groups perceive how well something is performing or being done](image2) provides a comprehensive breakdown of demographic perceptions, showing that Republicans are notably less satisfied with government efforts, with a higher percentage viewing the subject negatively.\n\nOverall, Republicans place a higher importance on terrorism and national security, which correlates with a more critical view of the government’s efforts to address the terrorist threat. Democrats, on the other hand, are more supportive of the government’s performance, with 64% giving a positive rating. This reflects a broader partisan divide in both the prioritization of issues and the evaluation of governmental actions.\n\nThe views on the importance of terrorism differ significantly among political affiliations, with Republicans prioritizing it more highly and being more critical of government efforts to address the terrorist threat."}

Cyberattacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights are particularly notable. These concerns have grown over the past year, with significant increases in perceived seriousness. For instance, the percentage of Americans concerned about cyberattacks from China rose from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021, while concerns about China’s policies on human rights increased from 43% to 50%. Similarly, worries about the loss of U.S. jobs to China and China’s growing military power also saw substantial increases, rising by 6% each from 2020 to 2021. ![Concerns about China's issues have increased over time](image1)\n\nFurthermore, there is a widespread perception that China is doing a poor job in handling various global issues. A broad majority of 79% think China is doing a bad job dealing with global climate change, and nearly half (45%) believe China is doing a very bad job in managing the coronavirus pandemic. This sentiment reflects a broader skepticism towards China’s role in global governance and its impact on international affairs. ![Americans are critical of China's handling of global climate change](image8)\n\nThe political landscape also plays a significant role in shaping these concerns. Republicans are notably more likely to advocate for tougher measures against China on economic fronts and to view China as an enemy rather than a competitor or partner. This partisan divide is evident in the increasing percentages of Republicans who feel limiting China’s power and influence is a top priority and who hold colder feelings toward China, compared to Democrats and the overall population. ![Partisan views on China's power and influence](image5)\n\nIn summary, the key concerns of Americans regarding China encompass cyberattacks, job losses, military power, and human rights policies, with these concerns having notably increased over the past year."}

This increase in optimism is particularly notable among those who have completed some college, where the optimism has grown roughly twice as fast compared to those with a high school diploma or less education [2]. Additionally, the economic optimism has increased significantly among various age groups, including those aged 30 to 49 and 50 to 64, with gains of 16 percentage points for each group [5].\n\nThe data also indicates that the share of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve has risen faster than in the general population. In 2015, fully eight-in-ten Latinos (81%) said they expected their family’s financial situation would improve in the coming year, a 14 percentage point increase since 2008 [10]. This is a marked difference from the general population, where the share of Americans who share this optimistic view only rose by 6 percentage points during the same period [9].\n\nMoreover, the financial optimism among different demographic groups within the Hispanic community has also seen substantial increases. For instance, Latino men and Latina women are both more optimistic about their finances now than they were seven years ago, with increases of 18 and 11 percentage points respectively [6].

Just 5% of those 80 and older are smartphone owners [8]. Similarly, smartphone adoption varies significantly by income and education. For instance, among seniors with an annual household income of less than $30,000, only 8% own a smartphone, while this figure rises to 42% for those with higher incomes [6]. Education plays a critical role as well; college graduates are much more likely to own smartphones (35%) compared to those with a high school education or less (10%) [4].\n\nIn terms of overall trends, broadband adoption among older adults has more than doubled over a five-year period, increasing from 19% in May 2008 to 47% in the present day [2][9]. This trend is reflected in the broader adoption of cell phones, where 77% of seniors now own a cell phone, though this still lags behind the national average of 91% [4][9]. \n\nMobile adoption, however, is unevenly distributed. Tablets and e-book readers are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans, and this is also true among seniors. Seniors who have graduated from college are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet compared to those who have not attended college [7]. \n\nTo summarize, internet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults vary significantly by income and education, with higher rates observed among more affluent and educated individuals. These trends align with broader patterns of technology adoption, where wealthier and better-educated populations tend to be early adopters. \n\n![The table shows the percentage of people aged 65 and older who go online and have broadband at home, categorized by age, education, and household income.](image5)\n![The table shows the percentage of people aged 65 and older who own cell phones and smartphones, broken down by age, education, and household income.](image4)"}

For instance, 64% of workers with a college degree find their work more interesting due to technology, compared to only 38% of those with a high school diploma or less, as shown in the bar chart `![This image is a bar chart comparing the perceived benefits of education level in terms of making work more interesting and increasing opportunities for advancement.](image2)`. Furthermore, 53% of college graduates feel that technology has increased their opportunities for advancement, whereas only 32% of workers with a high school diploma or less share this sentiment.\n\nSpecifically regarding technology, the survey asked about the impact of six common workforce technologies, including word processing and spreadsheet software, smartphones, email and social media, scheduling software, customer self-service technologies, and industrial robots. Overall, there is a predominantly positive view toward these technologies. For example, 70% of respondents felt that word processing or spreadsheet software had a positive impact on their careers, while 67% felt the same about smartphones and 60% about email and social media, as illustrated in `![This image is a bar chart showing the perceived impact of various technologies.](image4)`.

According to recent surveys, nearly half of Americans (46%) believe that Wall Street helps the U.S. economy more than it hurts, while 39% think it does more harm than good [6]. However, there are notable differences when looking at specific political affiliations. Republicans are more likely to see Wall Street positively, with 55% believing it helps the economy more than it hurts, compared to just 31% who think it hurts [1][8]. Democrats, on the other hand, are more divided, with 46% saying Wall Street hurts the economy more and 41% saying it helps [7].\n\nThis partisan divide is reflected in broader satisfaction levels regarding national conditions. Overall, seven-in-ten Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, while only about 26% are satisfied [3]. The trend of dissatisfaction has been rising, with public dissatisfaction being higher than at any point in the past year and increasing by 9 percentage points since September [5]. ![The \"Dissatisfied\" line increases to 70% by 2019, while the \"Satisfied\" line decreases to 26% by 2019.](image1)\n\nAmong Democrats, the dissatisfaction is particularly pronounced, with only 8% expressing satisfaction, while 90% are dissatisfied [2][10]. This dissatisfaction has persisted throughout Trump's presidency, with no more than 16% of Democrats expressing satisfaction at any point [10]. Republicans show a similar trend, with satisfaction dropping from 59% in September to 47% currently, marking the lowest GOP satisfaction rating since late 2017 [9].\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely to view Wall Street positively and have shown a decline in satisfaction with national conditions, while Democrats are more divided on Wall Street's impact and predominantly express dissatisfaction with the current state of the nation."}

This trend is evident in the line graph, which shows a steady increase in dissatisfaction from 54% in 1990 to 70% by 2019, while satisfaction has decreased from 41% to 26% over the same period. ![Dissatisfaction with the state of the nation has steadily increased from 1990 to 2019](image2)\n\nPolitical affiliations have also undergone changes, particularly in terms of their relative support over time. The line graph depicting political affiliation trends from 1990 to 2019 shows significant shifts during different presidential administrations. Initially, under G.H.W. Bush, Republicans held a strong lead, but support shifted towards Democrats during the Clinton years. Under G.W. Bush, Republican support surged again but declined towards the end of his presidency. During Obama’s terms, Democratic support generally remained higher, and under Trump, the lines converged closer, indicating a narrowing gap between the two parties. ![Political affiliation trends show a narrowing gap between Republicans and Democrats under Trump](image5)\n\nThese trends in public satisfaction and political affiliations have influenced how different parties view Wall Street’s impact on the economy. Republicans tend to be more positive about Wall Street, with 55% believing it helps the economy more than it hurts, compared to 31% who think it hurts [7]. Democrats, however, are more divided, with 46% believing Wall Street hurts the economy more than it helps, and 41% thinking it helps [7]. The chart illustrating these opinions reflects this divide, where the majority of Republicans see Wall Street as beneficial, whereas Democrats are nearly evenly split. ![Republicans are more likely to believe Wall Street helps the economy, while Democrats are divided](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, public dissatisfaction with the state of the nation has risen significantly since 1990, while political affiliations have fluctuated but narrowed under Trump. These trends reflect a growing partisan divide on the impact of Wall Street on the economy, with Republicans generally holding more favorable views compared to the more mixed opinions of Democrats."}

Women are more likely to experience discrimination at work due to their gender and consider discrimination a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM [3]. Additionally, women often face difficulties in balancing work and family obligations, with 33% citing this as a major reason for not pursuing STEM careers [3].\n\nFurthermore, women in STEM jobs are more likely to report that their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work, raising concerns such as pay gaps and unequal treatment from coworkers due to gender stereotypes [3]. These issues highlight the need for greater support and encouragement for women in STEM from an early age and throughout their careers, as emphasized by many women and minorities in STEM [8].\n\nIn conclusion, while both men and women in STEM value job flexibility, men tend to prioritize higher pay and opportunities for promotion, whereas women place greater importance on jobs that focus on helping others. These differing values correlate with the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering and succeeding in STEM, including discrimination and work-life balance challenges.\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing the job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM fields, showing that while both genders value flexibility equally, men value higher pay and promotion opportunities more, and women value jobs focused on helping others more.](image4)"}

Among self-identified Hispanics, 69% identify as Hispanic or Latino, while 14% identify as White [image4]. However, these proportions change markedly when considering generational differences. Foreign-born Hispanics are more likely to identify as Hispanic or Latino (78%), compared to 66% for second-generation Hispanics and 46% for third or higher generation Hispanics [image4]. In contrast, the proportion identifying as White increases from 11% among foreign-born Hispanics to 25% among third or higher generation Hispanics [image4]. This shift suggests a growing assimilation into non-Hispanic racial categories as generations progress.\n\nMoreover, the level of connection to Hispanic heritage decreases across generations. While 82% of foreign-born Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their Hispanic heritage, this drops to 69% for second-generation Hispanics and further to 44% for third or higher generation Hispanics [image1]. This reduced connection can influence how individuals perceive and experience discrimination, as well as their racial identification.\n\nIn summary, generational differences lead to a decrease in the perception of discrimination and a shift in racial identification among Hispanics, with later generations experiencing less discrimination and identifying more with non-Hispanic racial categories."}

Immigrants who identify as Hispanics tend to feel a strong connection with their country of origin, with 82% reporting a significant attachment [1]. This connection diminishes in subsequent generations, with only 44% of third-generation Hispanics feeling connected to their ancestral countries [1].\n\nThe preference for self-identification also changes significantly. While immigrants most often describe themselves using their country of origin terms, this shifts towards \"American\" as the primary identifier among later generations. Only 7% of immigrants primarily use the term \"American,\" whereas this figure rises to 56% among third-generation Hispanics [3]. This trend is mirrored in the use of terms like \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino,\" where the preference for \"American\" increases with each generation, indicating a stronger tie to U.S. national identity [3].\n\nMoreover, the percentage of Hispanics who feel they are a typical American also varies by generation. Among immigrants, only 36% consider themselves a typical American, but this rises to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics [5]. This suggests that as generations progress, there is an increasing sense of alignment with mainstream American culture.\n\nRegarding language use, the dominance of Spanish decreases dramatically across generations. Among immigrants, 61% are Spanish-dominant, meaning they are more proficient in Spanish than in English. However, this drops to 6% among the second generation and nearly zero among the third generation [10]. Furthermore, the vast majority of self-identified Hispanics, regardless of generation, do not believe that speaking Spanish is necessary to be considered Latino. For instance, 92% of third or higher generation Latinos hold this view [8].\n\nThese patterns are also reflected in the provided images. The first image, which is a horizontal bar chart, likely depicts generational differences in self-identification, showing that third or higher generation Hispanics are more likely to identify as \"American\" compared to earlier generations ![The chart illustrates generational differences in self-identification preferences among Hispanics](image1). Additionally, the fourth image highlights that the percentage of Hispanics who speak Spanish decreases significantly from the foreign-born to the third generation, aligning with the textual evidence ![The chart shows decreasing Spanish proficiency across generations among Hispanics](image4).\n\nIn conclusion, generational differences significantly impact self-identification preferences and language use among Hispanics, with later generations increasingly identifying as \"American\" and less likely to speak Spanish compared to earlier generations."}

The chart compares various countries and regions, with the red and orange segments representing different statistical measures. Although the exact nature of these measures is unclear without additional context, the variation in the segments across different countries suggests that the balance between traditional and modern values differs significantly across the region. For instance, some countries may lean more towards traditional values, while others show a stronger inclination towards modern values. ![Comparison of traditional and modern values across different countries in 2014](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the views on traditional values have been declining over the years, with a concurrent rise in modern values, and these views vary considerably across different countries."}

According to image3, Telkomsel had 35.4 million smartphone users and XL had 15 million smartphone users. Additionally, image4 provides updated figures for 2014, showing Telkomsel with 35.4 million smartphone users and XL with 15 million smartphone users, indicating that the number of smartphone users remained relatively stable during this period [3].\n\nHowever, the trends in ARPU for these companies were more complex. Image2 illustrates the trends in ARPU for three different telecommunications services: Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data, from 2013 to 2017. For Telkomsel and XL, the graph shows a consistent decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, reflecting a shift towards data usage. Specifically, Voice ARPU showed a gradual decline, while SMS ARPU also exhibited a downward trend. This shift can be attributed to the increasing use of data-based instant messaging and VoIP applications, which reduced the reliance on traditional voice and SMS services [4][5].\n\nMoreover, the initial decline in Mobile Data ARPU was followed by an upward trend starting around 2015, suggesting that users were enrolling for larger data plans as their data consumption increased [2]. This pattern aligns with the overall industry trend observed in the late 2014 period [8].\n\nIn terms of influencing factors, the massive price war initiated by the government led to reduced tariffs, which initially caused a decline in ARPU [9]. However, as tariffs hit rock-bottom, the likelihood of further price wars diminished [10]. Additionally, the rise in smartphone penetration among users contributed to a greater demand for data services, which compensated for the declining revenue from voice and SMS [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2014, while ARPU trends showed a decline in voice and SMS revenues but an eventual increase in mobile data revenues, driven by increased data consumption and larger data plans.\n\n![The image shows a line graph illustrating the trends in ARPU for Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data services from 2013 to 2017.](image2)\n![The bar chart compares the number of subscribers, smartphone users, BlackBerry users, Android users, and data users for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat.](image3)\n![The bar chart compares various metrics for different telecom providers including Telkomsel and XL.](image4)"}

With Android's broader base, particularly in older versions, developers may find it necessary to support multiple versions to reach a wider audience. Conversely, the rapid adoption of iOS 9 might encourage developers to focus on the latest iOS features without worrying too much about backward compatibility.[4]\n\nThe visual evidence further supports these points.

According to the confusion matrices shown in the figures, InstructGPT exhibits a tendency towards lower confidence, frequently misclassifying supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information). Specifically, the confusion matrix for InstructGPT indicates that it predicts NEI for a significant portion of supported and refuted claims, with percentages of 26.8% and 23.6%, respectively. This suggests that InstructGPT struggles to confidently distinguish between supported and refuted claims, often defaulting to the NEI category. \n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 shows a different pattern.

The confusion matrix for GPT-4 reveals that it incorrectly predicts supported and refuted claims for NEI instances, with percentages of 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively. This indicates that GPT-4 tends to overestimate the verifiability of claims, failing to recognize when there is insufficient information to make a determination.\n\nThese differences suggest that while InstructGPT may err on the side of caution, GPT-4 is prone to overconfidence in its classifications.

Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on daily knowledge and common sense, MMMU delves into college-level knowledge across 30 subjects and 183 subfields, requiring deliberate reasoning with expert-level subject knowledge [8].\n\nIn terms of image usage, MMMU features a wide variety of image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photographs, paintings, medical images, and more. This diversity is crucial for testing advanced visual perception capabilities and integrating these with textual information [1]. Furthermore, the dataset's questions often interleave text and images, which necessitates joint understanding and complex reasoning based on both modalities [1].\n\nThe unique features of MMMU's question formats include a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions, with explanations required for some. This setup ensures that models not only provide correct answers but also demonstrate their reasoning processes. For instance, the distribution of question formats and image usage highlights that nearly all questions (97.52%) involve images, with varying placements (beginning, middle, end) to challenge models' perceptual and reasoning skills [image3].\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark distinguishes itself by offering a rich, varied set of multimodal challenges that require both deep subject knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, making it a leading benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large multimodal models."}

This approach enhances the model's ability to produce responses enriched with entity-centric information, leading to improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations [6]. The inclusion of entity detection (ED) also plays a crucial role, as evidenced by the ablation study shown in Table 5, where the method \"w/ ED\" significantly outperforms the variant without ED across all evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BLEURT ![The method \"w/ ED\" shows improved scores across all metrics.](image1).\n\nFurthermore, the architecture of the SnapNTell model, as illustrated in the flowchart, involves a series of steps including image encoding, entity detection, retrieval augmentation, and merging of image and text data to generate an answer ![The image is a flowchart diagram illustrating a process for image and question processing involving a large language model (LLM).](image3). This structured approach ensures that the model can effectively utilize both visual and textual information to provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell model outperforms other models in terms of accuracy due to its advanced architecture, particularly the incorporation of retrieval augmentation and entity detection, which significantly enhance its ability to generate knowledgeable and coherent answers."}

In document classification, SPECTER significantly outperforms other baselines, achieving an F1 score of 86.4 (82.0) on the MeSH (MAG) dataset, which is about a $\\Delta{=}+2.3$ $(+1.5)$ point absolute increase over the best baseline on each dataset respectively.

Additionally, SPECTER outperforms a SciBERT model fine-tuned on the end tasks and their multitask combination, showcasing its effectiveness and versatility [2].\n\nIn terms of the impact of additional metadata, removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title leads to a substantial decrease in performance, while adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) actually hurts performance [3]. One possible reason for this is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. Furthermore, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names, leading to noisy correlations [3].\n\nInterestingly, adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, where venues are expected to have high correlation with paper topics [3]. Therefore, SPECTER's ability to perform well without requiring inputs like authors or venues makes it applicable in scenarios where this metadata is not available, such as matching reviewers with anonymized submissions [4].\n\nVisually, the clustering patterns in the embeddings produced by SPECTER and SciBERT provide further insights.

Each classifier's performance is measured using Micro Avg, Macro Avg, and Weighted Avg metrics [![The table presents performance metrics for several classifiers used to evaluate text data, possibly in a context related to natural language processing or sentiment analysis.](image1)][![The table presents performance metrics for different classifiers used in a text classification task. Each row represents a classifier, while the columns provide performance scores across various sentiment categories and average metrics.](image2)]\n\nConsidering the imbalance in the dataset and the need for robust performance across all classes, the Logistic Regression classifier appears to consistently show better results for Negative sentiment detection, as indicated by higher Micro Avg, Macro Avg, and Weighted Avg scores compared to other classifiers.\n\nTherefore, Logistic Regression consistently shows better results for Negative sentiment detection across different performance metrics."}

These improvements are significant because the values for these slots often have different expressions and cannot be easily extracted from the dialog context, leading to lower performance for span-based methods like DS-Span [2].\n\nFurthermore, the table in ![This table displays accuracy percentages for various slots across three different models: DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist.](image1) shows that DS-DST has a relative increase in accuracy compared to DS-Span, while DS-Picklist further improves upon DS-DST for many slots.

According to the text and images provided, the datasets differ significantly in terms of the complexity of the tasks and the metrics used to evaluate performance.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the structure and nature of the datasets. The table in `![Comparison of LANI and CHAI datasets](image1)` provides statistics showing that LANI has 6,000 sequences with an average of 4.7 instructions per sequence and 24.6 actions per instruction, while CHAI has 1,596 sequences with an average of 7.7 instructions per sequence and 54.5 actions per instruction. This indicates that CHAI instructions are more complex, requiring more actions per instruction, and involve more detailed steps.\n\nNext, the evaluation metrics used for both datasets are outlined in [6]. For LANI, the metrics are stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC), while for CHAI, they are stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA). This difference in metrics reflects the varying complexities of the tasks. LANI focuses on navigation between landmarks, whereas CHAI involves both navigation and manipulation tasks, making it inherently more challenging.\n\nIn terms of performance, the comparative analysis of different methods is detailed in `![Performance Comparison Table](image4)` and `![Performance Summary Tables](image5)`. The table in `![Performance Comparison Table](image4)` shows that for LANI, the proposed \"Our Approach (OA)\" achieves an SD of 8.65 and a TC of 35.72. For CHAI, the OA shows an SD of 2.75. The summary table in `![Performance Summary Tables](image5)` further confirms that \"Our Approach\" performs best with LANI Dist: 8.67, Acc: 35.83 and CHAI Dist: 2.12, Acc: 40.3. Despite these improvements, the performance gap to human-level performance remains significant, as highlighted in [2], with humans achieving a TC of 63% on LANI and 100% manipulation accuracy on CHAI.\n\nAdditionally, the text in [5] discusses the challenges of both tasks, noting that while our approach outperforms CHAPLOT 18 on LANI by improving task completion accuracy by 5%, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially on manipulation accuracy. This underscores the increased complexity of CHAI, where the combination of navigation and manipulation tasks poses additional challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the key differences in task completion and performance metrics between the LANI and CHAI datasets lie in the complexity and nature of the tasks, with CHAI being more intricate due to its combination of navigation and manipulation actions. The performance metrics reflect this complexity, with CHAI requiring more detailed evaluations for manipulation accuracy in addition to stop distance."}

The first notable difference lies in the metrics used for evaluation. For LANI, the primary metrics are stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC), whereas for CHAI, they are stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA) [9].\n\nIn terms of performance, our approach outperforms other baselines such as STOP, RANDOMWALK, MOSTFREQUENT, MISRA17, and CHAPLOT18 on both LANI and CHAI tasks. Specifically, on LANI, our approach improves task completion (TC) by 5% compared to CHAPLOT18, and both methods outperform MISRA17. On CHAI, however, both CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17 fail to learn, while our approach shows an improvement in stop distance (SD). Despite this, all models perform poorly on CHAI, particularly in manipulation (MA) [7].\n\nMoreover, when evaluating our approach with oracle goals, there is a significant improvement in navigation performance on both tasks, although it fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI, highlighting the increased planning complexity in this domain [2]. This suggests that the inherent ambiguity of the tasks is a significant factor affecting performance.\n\nLinguistically, the systems differ in their usage of various categories as shown in the table in image2. Spatial relations between locations occur more frequently in LANI (123 occurrences) compared to CHAI (52 occurrences). Similarly, conjunctions of two or more locations are more common in LANI (36 occurrences) than in CHAI (5 occurrences). Temporal coordination of sub-goals appears in both systems, with slightly more occurrences in CHAI (68) compared to LANI (65). Constraints on the shape of trajectory are present in LANI (94 occurrences) but not in CHAI, and co-reference is more prevalent in LANI (32 occurrences) than in CHAI (18 occurrences). Comparatives are rare in both systems, occurring twice in LANI and not at all in CHAI.\n\nOverall, the LANI system tends to utilize more varied and complex linguistic categories compared to CHAI, reflecting differences in the nature of the tasks and the environments they operate in.\n\n![The image contains two tables summarizing the performance of various methods on a held-out test dataset.](image1)\n\n![This table presents data on different linguistic categories, specifically in the context of spatial language or navigation instructions.](image2)\n\n![The table presents comparative results of different methods based on certain metrics evaluated across two datasets, labeled as LANI and CHAI.](image3)\n\nLANI outperforms CHAI in task completion and uses more diverse linguistic categories, while CHAI struggles with manipulation tasks despite having fewer linguistic complexities."}

As the number of train data tokens increases, the average GLUE score also increases, indicating a positive correlation between the amount of pretraining data and performance on the GLUE benchmark.\n\nMoreover, as stated in the text, \"[Experiments on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark show strong gains over the state of the art for each task, including a 9.1 point gain on RTE over Radford et al. (2018)](3)\" and \"[GLUE tasks. For pretraining on Common Crawl, CoLA and RTE benefit most from additional training data.](4)\" These points further reinforce the notion that more training data can lead to significant performance improvements on the GLUE benchmark tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the amount of training data positively correlates with better performance on the GLUE benchmark, as indicated by the higher average scores across different tasks."}

According to Table 5 [1], the cloze loss outperforms the bilm loss and combining the two does not yield additional benefits. This suggests that the cloze approach, which predicts the center word given all left and right context, is more effective than predicting individual left and right contexts separately. \n\nMoreover, the pretraining data size plays a crucial role. Figure 3 [7] illustrates that increasing the amount of Common Crawl data leads to higher GLUE scores, indicating a positive correlation between the quantity of pretraining data and performance. Similarly, Table 3 [3] shows that both stacking methods and fine-tuning improve upon previous state-of-the-art models, with fine-tuning providing the largest gains.\n\nIn terms of data sources, Common Crawl generally performs better than News Crawl, likely due to the multi-sentence structure of Common Crawl data, which averages around 50 words compared to News Crawl's 23-word average [5]. Multi-sentence training examples appear to be more effective for tasks involving sentence pairs, such as RTE.\n\nTo summarize, the cloze modeling approach is more effective than bilm, and increasing the amount of pretraining data enhances performance, with multi-sentence structures proving advantageous.

According to the research, when embeddings are aligned, they can potentially enhance the BLEU scores, particularly when the source and target languages are dissimilar. This is because aligned embeddings allow the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between the source and target languages. For instance, the table in ![Alignment effects on BLEU scores](image3) shows the BLEU scores for different language pairs, with some pairs benefiting slightly from alignment (e.g., AZ → EN and RU → EN) while others see minimal changes (e.g., PT → EN).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of alignment can vary depending on the language pairs involved. In the case of more similar languages, such as those within the same language family, the gains might be less pronounced.

According to the study, pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, with a more pronounced effect on low-frequency words ([1]). This improvement is evident in Table 5, which shows that the gains in translation pairs are roughly in order of their similarity, with G L /P T  showing the largest gains, and B E /R U  showing a slight decrease ([3]).\n\n![Translation improvements for various language pairs to Portuguese](image1)\nThe table in ![Translation improvements for various language pairs to Portuguese](image1) provides further insight into the role of language similarity. It illustrates that translation pairs with higher linguistic similarity, such as ES → PT and FR → PT, show greater improvements with pre-training compared to more distant pairs like RU → PT and HE → PT. This aligns with the hypothesis that more linguistically similar pairs benefit more from pre-training due to more consistent semantic neighborhoods ([10]).\n\nMoreover, the role of training set size is crucial. The study indicates that there is a \"sweet-spot\" where pre-trained embeddings are most effective, specifically when there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all ([4]). This is further illustrated in the graphs in ![BLEU scores and gains for various language pairs to English](image5), which show that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and diminishes as the training set size increases.\n\nIn terms of multilingual translation systems, pre-training and aligning the word embeddings help increase BLEU scores for all tasks. This is because a single encoder is used for both source languages, and pre-training ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are in similar vector spaces, making it easier for the model to learn ([3]).\n\nFinally, qualitative analysis of translations from ${\\mathrm{GL}}\\to{\\mathrm{EN}}$ in ![Qualitative analysis of translation quality](image2) shows that pre-training not only captures rarer vocabulary but also generates more grammatically well-formed sentences. For instance, the system successfully translates a person’s name (\"chris\") and multi-word phrases like \"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation,\" highlighting the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in representing less frequent concepts effectively ([7]).\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training enhances translation accuracy, especially for low-frequency words and in low-resource scenarios, and its effectiveness is influenced by both the size of the training set and the linguistic similarity between the source and target languages."}

For instance, when comparing bilingual and multilingual systems, the alignment of embeddings has been found to be beneficial, especially in multilingual scenarios. In the context of multilingual translation, aligning embeddings ensures that the word embeddings of the source languages are in similar vector spaces, which allows the model to learn more effectively as if it were training on a single language. This is supported by the findings in Table 5, where aligning the embeddings helped increase the BLEU scores for all tasks. Furthermore, the alignment process can make the encoder's job easier, as it does not need to learn a significantly more complicated transformation of the input if the embeddings are in a semantically separate space. \n\nIn terms of F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, pre-training generally improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, with notable improvements for low-frequency words. This can be seen in the bar chart, which demonstrates that \"pre\" (representing pre-training) often outperforms \"std\" (standard) in higher frequency ranges. \n\nFor specific language pairs, the effect of alignment varies. For example, in the table comparing unaligned and aligned scores, the change in scores for \"GL → EN\" shows a slight decrease when aligned (-1.3), whereas for \"RU → EN,\" there is a slight improvement (+0.3). This indicates that the efficacy of alignment can depend on the specific language pair.\n\nTo summarize, the alignment of word embeddings is particularly helpful in multilingual translation systems and tends to improve translation performance, especially for low-frequency words.

According to the text, removing R-GCN leads to a significant drop in performance. Specifically, when comparing the performance of models with and without R-GCN, we see a substantial decrease in accuracy. For instance, the model with GloVe embeddings but without R-GCN shows a drop of 8.0 points in accuracy compared to the model with R-GCN [2]. This suggests that R-GCN plays a critical role in the model's ability to perform multi-hop reasoning.\n\nSecondly, the removal of specific relation types, such as DOC-BASED, MATCH, and COREF, also affects the model's performance. The model seems to heavily rely on DOC-BASED connections, which are connections between mentions that co-occur in the same document. When these connections are removed, there is a noticeable drop in performance, especially in the masked condition. The text states that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections, likely due to the importance of capturing information about mentions appearing closely in the same document [1].\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance is affected differently depending on whether it is evaluated under unmasked or masked conditions. Under the unmasked condition, the model generally performs better overall, but the impact of removing specific relation types is still evident. For example, removing MATCH connections results in a slight drop in performance, while removing COREF connections has a minimal impact [1]. In contrast, under the masked condition, the model's performance drops significantly when relation types are removed, highlighting the importance of these connections in providing context.\n\nExamining the table in `![The table shows the performance of different models or configurations on a task, with columns for unmasked and masked performance.](image1)`, we can see that the removal of specific components and relation types results in varying degrees of performance degradation. For instance, the removal of DOC-BASED connections leads to a drop in performance, while the removal of MATCH connections has a less severe impact. Similarly, the removal of COREF connections has a minor effect on performance, but the overall trend is a decline in accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the table in `![This table compares different models' performances in terms of test and development accuracy scores across two tasks: Unmasked and Masked.](image2)` demonstrates that the Entity-GCN models, particularly the ensemble model, achieve the highest scores on the Unmasked Test and Development sets. This further underscores the importance of maintaining the full set of components and relation types for optimal performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of specific components like R-GCN and relation types such as DOC-BASED, MATCH, and COREF negatively impacts the model's performance, with the extent of the impact varying under unmasked and masked conditions. The model performs best when all components and relation types are included.\n\nThe model's performance deteriorates significantly when key components like R-GCN and relation types such as DOC-BASED are removed, especially under masked conditions."}

According to the text, the model's performance generally benefits more from document-based connections than from coreference links. This is because many connections are between mentions in the same document, and these connections provide important proximity information ([6]).\n\nHowever, the performance of the model drops when coreference information is included in the test set, indicating that the coreference system may struggle with the complexity of the test documents. This suggests that while coreference links can be useful, they might introduce noise in more challenging scenarios ([6]).\n\nIn the masked setting, the model performs better overall, likely due to the consistent labeling of coreferent mentions with the same identifier, which simplifies the task ([2]). In contrast, the unmasked setting introduces variability in the surface forms of mentions, complicating the coreference resolution process.\n\nThe table in the image further illustrates these points. The row labeled \"Entity-GCN without coreference (single model)\" shows higher accuracy scores in both the unmasked and masked settings compared to \"Entity-GCN with coreference (single model)\" ([image4]). Specifically, the unmasked test accuracy decreases from 67.6 to 66.4 when coreference is added, and there is no improvement in the masked setting.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion of coreference information can sometimes degrade the performance of Entity-GCN models, particularly in more complex test scenarios, despite potential benefits in simpler settings.\n\n![The table presents a comparison of different models' performances in terms of test and development (Dev) accuracy scores across two tasks: Unmasked and Masked.](image4)"}

DyGIE also excels on the SciERC and WLPC datasets, showing consistent superior performance.\n\nIn terms of the impact of coreference and relation propagation layers, the results are nuanced. On the entity extraction task, DyGIE without the coreference propagation layer (`−CorefProp`) achieves slightly lower F1 scores compared to the full DyGIE model. However, for relation extraction, DyGIE without the relation propagation layer (`−RelProp`) performs worse than the full DyGIE model.

Relation propagation also contributes positively to both entity and relation extraction, particularly in scenarios with multiple relation instances across different entities.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of these propagation techniques can vary depending on the dataset and the specific task. For instance, on the SciIE dataset, coreference propagation provides only a minor benefit for both tasks, whereas relation propagation offers significant gains. Additionally, the optimal number of iterations for coreference propagation is found to be two, as shown in Figure 3a, indicating that beyond a certain point, additional iterations do not yield further improvements.\n\nIn conclusion, DyGIE consistently outperforms other systems across different datasets, with coreference and relation propagation significantly contributing to its enhanced performance in entity and relation extraction tasks.

The graph shows that as the subspace dimension increases, the accuracy of both SWEM and CNN models improves, approaching the accuracy of their direct implementations. This aligns with the text's findings that SWEM models are more parameter-efficient, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.\n\nFurthermore, the image5 provides another comparison of SWEM and CNN models over different subspace dimensions. The left graph indicates that SWEM's accuracy generally increases and stabilizes at 1.000 for higher dimensions, whereas CNN starts with high accuracy and remains stable. The right graph shows similar patterns, suggesting that SWEM's performance improves as the subspace dimension increases.\n\nIn conclusion, SWEM models demonstrate comparable or even superior performance to CNN models across various datasets and subspace dimensions, especially in document classification and natural language sequence matching tasks. They are also more parameter-efficient, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.\n\n![This image comprises two line graphs comparing the accuracy of two models, SWEM and CNN, as well as their direct implementations, over different subspace dimensions (d).](image1)\n![The table presents a comparison of performance metrics (possibly accuracy percentages) across three datasets: Yahoo, Yelp P., and SNLI.](image4)\n![The image contains two line graphs comparing the accuracy of SWEM and CNN models over different subspace dimensions (d).](image5)"}

According to the table in ![The table presents F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: \"Distractor\" and \"Open.\"](image1), the single-paragraph BERT model achieves a high F1 score of 67.08 in the \"Distractor\" setting but performs poorly in the \"Open\" setting with a score of 38.40. This disparity suggests that the model struggles more with open-domain questions where it has to retrieve information from a broader range of paragraphs.\n\nMoreover, the table in ![The table displays the F1 scores for various settings related to a task, presumably in the context of natural language processing or machine learning.](image2) provides additional insights. It shows that while the \"Distractor\" setting yields an F1 score of 67.08, the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting results in a lower F1 score of 39.12. However, including a \"Gold Paragraph\" in the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting significantly boosts the F1 score to 53.12.

According to the text quotes, foreign exchange risk is the most critical financial risk for Novo Nordisk and can significantly affect the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, and cash flow statement [1]. The company employs financial instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange on financial results [7], and it hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward [8].\n\nIn 2020, the impact of a hypothetical 5% change in exchange rates was analyzed, showing that an immediate 5% increase in the value of certain currencies versus the EUR and DKK would lead to a negative impact of (1,893) DKK million on the other comprehensive income but a positive impact of 299 DKK million on the income statement, resulting in a total effect of (1,594) DKK million. Conversely, a 5% decrease in the same currencies would positively impact other comprehensive income by 1,893 DKK million while negatively affecting the income statement by (299) DKK million, leading to a total effect of 1,594 DKK million.

Specifically, the current provision for income taxes, which includes federal, state and local, and foreign taxes, increased from $3,520 million in 2018 to $4,981 million in 2020. The deferred tax component fluctuated, with a provision of $42 million in 2018, increasing to $230 million in 2019, and then turning into a slight benefit of $(8) million in 2020.\n\nLooking at the deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the data in ![Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for 2020 and 2019](image3) provides insight into the underlying factors contributing to these trends.

This resulted in a net increase in deferred income tax liabilities from $(2,993) million to $(3,367) million. The increase in deferred tax liabilities is mainly attributed to higher balances in U.S. federal and state intangible assets, non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets, capitalized software, depreciation and amortization, and lease right-of-use assets. These increases indicate that the company's deferred tax liabilities grew faster than its deferred tax assets, leading to a larger net deferred tax liability.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's provision for income taxes increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, driven largely by an increase in current tax provisions.

By 2020, the total current liabilities increased to $5,342 million, and the total noncurrent liabilities rose to $7,789 million. This indicates a significant increase in both current and noncurrent liabilities over the year.\n\nThese changes in liabilities can be attributed to several factors, including increased compensation and benefits, higher taxes, income, and other liabilities, as well as larger deferred revenues and operating lease liabilities. For instance, the increase in current liabilities includes a rise in compensation and benefits from $931 million in 2019 to $1,393 million in 2020, along with a substantial jump in deferred revenue from $688 million to $1,212 million. Similarly, noncurrent liabilities saw an increase in taxes, income, and other liabilities from $3,309 million to $4,951 million, among other components.\n\nRegarding total debt, the figures show a slight decrease from $21,729 million in 2019 to $21,204 million in 2020. However, the classification of some debt as long-term due to refinancing options under the Five-Year Facility might have contributed to this change. Specifically, the Company classified approximately $611 million of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper programs and $290 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Yen Notes as long-term debt, reflecting the ability to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. This reclassification likely affected the overall composition of debt but not necessarily the total amount.\n\nIn conclusion, the total current and noncurrent liabilities significantly increased from 2019 to 2020, while total debt slightly decreased, influenced by the reclassification of certain borrowings to long-term debt due to refinancing capabilities.\n\n![The table shows a financial breakdown of liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019, divided into current and noncurrent categories.](image2)"}

This is evident from the table provided, where the net income (loss) shows a clear trend of recovery ![The table provides financial data for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, indicating a shift from significant losses to a substantial gain.](image1).\n\nAdditionally, foreign currency translation adjustments played a role in the comprehensive income. The foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss of $(42) million in 2018, a loss of $(28) million in 2019, and then a gain of $399 million in 2020. This positive adjustment in 2020 helped to significantly boost the overall comprehensive income. \n\nFurthermore, the company's focus on operational efficiencies and improvements in margins contributed to the turnaround. For instance, the operating margin in 2020 was 6.3%, representing a favorable change of 6.6% compared to the prior year [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders improved from a loss of $(1,018) million in 2018 to a gain of $1,120 million in 2020, driven by improvements in net income and positive foreign currency translation adjustments."}

Specifically, Quote [2] lists entries for net income and foreign-currency translation adjustments, among others, which are key components of comprehensive income. Additionally, Quote [4] mentions an audit of the consolidated financial statements, which would include these measures.\n\nExamining the image quotes, image1 provides numerical data that likely corresponds to financial metrics over two periods. Although the exact labels are not visible, the structure suggests that the columns represent different years. The last row of each column, showing dollar amounts, might indicate the total comprehensive income or net income for those periods.\n\nFor the first column:\n- The final amount is $64,166.\nFor the second column:\n- The final amount is $59,268.\n\nGiven the context, it is reasonable to assume that these dollar amounts represent the comprehensive income for the respective years. The increase from $59,268 to $64,166 indicates a positive change in comprehensive income.\n\nSimilarly, the net income, as seen in Quote [5], is a component of comprehensive income. Without specific labels, we can deduce that the positive trend in comprehensive income suggests a similar trend in net income.\n\nIn conclusion, Costco's net income and comprehensive income attributable to Costco increased from 2020 to 2022.\n\n![Comprehensive income for two periods](image1)"}

Additionally, the company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. This means any changes in noncontrolling interests will be reflected separately in the equity section of the balance sheet [1].\n\nIn the comprehensive income statement, we see entries for noncontrolling interests, such as the dividend to noncontrolling interest and acquisition of noncontrolling interest, which affect the total equity [5].

These regional declines were influenced by macroeconomic factors, including the pandemic, which led to clients focusing on near-term priorities and deferring purchases [6].\n\nThe Global Technology Services segment also saw a significant drop in pre-tax income, decreasing by 92.9 percent year to year, highlighting the broader financial challenges faced across various segments [image3].\n\nOverall, the year-to-year percent changes in external revenue and pre-tax income across different systems and regions for IBM in 2020 reflect a challenging economic environment, with declines observed in multiple areas, particularly in Systems Hardware and Global Technology Services, despite some improvements in gross profit margins.\n\n![The table shows \"Systems external revenue\" for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, broken down into different categories.](image1)\n![This table provides financial data comparing two years, 2020 and 2019, specifically for \"Systems\" related to hardware and software.](image2)\n![The table provides financial data for the Global Technology Services segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019.](image3)\n![The table shows the total revenue data for a company broken down by regions for the years 2019 and 2020.](image4)\n\nThe year-to-year percent changes in external revenue and pre-tax income for IBM in 2020 show declines across various systems and regions, reflecting the broader economic challenges faced during the year."}

Specifically, the amortization of intangible assets contributed positively to the gross profit, as seen in the table where the core gross profit increased by 366 million due to amortization adjustments. Additionally, impairments further added to the gross profit by 127 million. These adjustments were consistent across segments such as cost of goods sold, selling, general, and administration, and other income and expense categories. The combined effect of these adjustments elevated the core operating income from 1,043 million under IFRS to 2,334 million under core results. ![Amortization and impairments adjustments positively impacted the core operating income for 2020](image2)\n\nIn 2021, similar patterns emerged but with slightly different magnitudes.

According to the table in image1, there is a significant increase in the total contract amounts and fair values of derivative financial instruments from 2019 to 2020. These instruments are categorized into cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, and their fair values are recognized either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income. This indicates that the company is actively managing its exposure to currency fluctuations and interest rate risks, which can impact the income statement and equity.\n\nAdditionally, the data in image2 shows the financial liabilities, including derivative financial instruments. The derivative financial instruments increased significantly from DKK 734 million in 2019 to DKK 1,365 million in 2020. This increase suggests a greater use of derivatives, likely to hedge against potential adverse movements in financial markets. The recognition of these derivatives in the financial statements can influence the overall financial position and performance of the company.\n\nMoving on to the cash flow changes, the table in image5 highlights the changes in working capital components for 2020 and 2019. The change in working capital, including exchange rate adjustments, decreased significantly from DKK (3,564) million in 2019 to DKK (2,624) million in 2020. This reduction implies improved cash management and potentially reduced reliance on external financing. However, the cash flow change in working capital still reflects a significant outflow of DKK (4,353) million in 2020 compared to DKK (3,388) million in 2019, which could indicate challenges in managing liquidity.\n\nMoreover, the table in image3 provides insights into the reversals of non-cash income statement items. Items like share-based payment costs and provisions have seen substantial increases from 2019 to 2020, contributing to the adjustment in the cash flow statement. These non-cash items, when reversed, help in converting the accrual-based income statement to a cash basis, providing a clearer picture of the actual cash generated or used by the company.\n\nIn summary, the significant increase in derivative financial instruments and the changes in working capital indicate that the company has been actively managing its financial risks and cash flows. These actions have impacted the financial statements by influencing both the income statement and the balance sheet, reflecting a strategic approach to financial management.\n\nThe derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes have a notable impact on the company's financial statements, with an increase in derivative usage and adjustments in working capital reflecting strategic financial management practices."}

Specifically, the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points. This suggests a reduction in SG&A expenses relative to net sales over the period. Furthermore, the improvement in SG&A expenses can be attributed to leveraging increased sales, despite wage increases and additional paid time off for employees.\n\nNext, examining the trend in Interest Income and Other, Net, text [3] mentions that the increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates. However, specific numerical data for interest income is not provided in the text quotes.

For instance, the current and non-current liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities saw a substantial increase from €4,936 million at the beginning of the year to €13,562 million at the end of the year. This large increase is a significant contributor to the overall rise in total financial debt.\n\nIn summary, the total financial debt increased from €5,503 million at the start of fiscal year 2020 to €14,315 million at the end of fiscal year 2021, reflecting a significant rise in liabilities, particularly from financing activities."}

The other comprehensive income (loss) includes several components such as foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. Notably, the foreign currency translation had a significant positive impact in 2020 with a value of $197,696, while it was negative in 2019 and 2018, indicating fluctuations in exchange rates. Additionally, the defined benefit plans showed a positive impact in 2020 with $57,100, contrasting the negative impacts in 2019 and 2018. The total other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Accenture PLC for 2020 was $278,740, significantly higher than the negative values in 2019 and 2018.

The changes in shareholders' equity, as detailed in the tables, include activities such as net income, purchases and issuances of ordinary shares, share-based compensation expenses, and other adjustments. For instance, the net income for 2020 contributed to an increase in retained earnings, which is a component of shareholders' equity. Additionally, the cancellation of treasury shares and issuance of shares for employee programs also impacted the equity balances. The other comprehensive income components, such as foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans, further influenced the overall equity position by contributing to the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.\n\nIn summary, the positive trends in comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020 contributed to the growth in shareholders' equity, reflecting a robust financial performance and strategic management of equity components. ![The table displays the financial data for Accenture PLC over three fiscal years: 2020, 2019, and 2018, showing an increase in comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC from 2018 to 2020.](image1)"}

The net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by receivables [10]. Additionally, there were payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 [10].\n\nIn terms of investing activities, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This significant decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net cash used for acquisitions of $32.3 billion, as there was no major acquisition like the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year [9].\n\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9.721 billion in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9.042 billion in 2019, indicating a shift from a positive cash inflow to a negative cash outflow [8]. This change was largely driven by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, primarily due to the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations [1].\n\nConsidering the overall impact, the table in ![Cash Flow Summary](image2) shows that the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash improved significantly from $(3,290) million in 2019 to $5,361 million in 2020. This improvement is a result of the increased cash inflows from operating activities and the reduced outflows from investing activities, despite the increased cash outflows from financing activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial adjustments and cash flow activities positively impacted IBM's net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, leading to a substantial increase from a negative $3.29 billion in 2019 to a positive $5.361 billion in 2020."}

The table in ![Operating income and related financial metrics for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image3) shows detailed revenue and cost components. For instance, total revenue decreased by $\\mathbb{S}22$ million in 2020 compared to 2019, which included decreases in transportation services revenue and allowance oil revenue, but was partially offset by increases in terminaling services revenue. Additionally, operating income would be influenced by operational costs such as operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and other costs.

According to this table, the net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly from ($87) million in 2019 to ($64) million in 2020. This indicates a reduction in capital expenditures and possibly fewer acquisitions or investments made in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in capital expenditures from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to the completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco, as mentioned in [3].\n\nIn conclusion, while the operating income saw a decrease in revenue sources but with some offsetting increases, the cash from investing activities showed a reduction in spending, likely due to the completion of certain projects. Therefore, the changes in operating income and cash from investing activities reflect the varying financial activities and project completions during the specified period."}

The reduction in non-U.S. office deposits might also suggest a strategic decision to focus more on domestic operations or a response to market conditions abroad.\n\nFurthermore, the decline in time deposits is consistent with the actions taken to manage under the asset cap, which resulted in declines in brokered CDs and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices [10].

According to the data provided, for the year ended December 31, 2018, Amberjack had a net income of $157 million, while Mars had a net income of $154 million. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net income figures for both entities are not explicitly stated in the text quotes provided, but we can infer trends and influencing factors from the broader financial context. For instance, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business operations and market conditions can be significant. Text quote [6] mentions that due to the continuing effects of the pandemic, an impairment evaluation was conducted, though it concluded that no triggering event requiring an update to the impairment evaluation occurred. This suggests that despite challenging market conditions, the companies managed to maintain their asset values.\n\nMoreover, the depreciation and amortization expenses, which can affect net income, have slightly increased from 2018 to 2020. Text quote [7] states that depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant, and equipment was $46 million in 2018, $49 million in 2019, and $50 million in 2020. This gradual increase in expenses could have impacted the net income.\n\nAdditionally, the financial data in the balance sheets and statements of income from 2019 can provide insights into the overall financial health and trends. For example, the balance sheet data for December 31, 2019, shows the financial positions of various entities, including Amberjack and Mars, which might give us an idea about their liquidity and solvency over the period. The data also indicates the total revenues and operating expenses, which are crucial components affecting net income. \n\nFinally, the property, plant, and equipment values and accumulated depreciation can also play a role. The table in image3 shows that the total property value increased from $1,312 million in 2019 to $1,356 million in 2020, while the accumulated depreciation and amortization increased from $613 million to $661 million over the same period. These changes can affect the net income through depreciation expenses.\n\nBased on the provided data, it seems that while the net income for Amberjack and Mars might have been affected by increasing expenses and the economic conditions brought about by the pandemic, they were able to maintain or adjust their financial strategies to sustain their operations.\n\n![The table presents financial data for the year ended December 31, 2019, including statements of income and balance sheets for various entities.](image2)\n![The table details the property, plant, and equipment for the years ending December 31, 2020, and 2019, showing increases in total property value and accumulated depreciation.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact net income figures for Amberjack and Mars in 2020 are not provided, the financial trends suggest that their net incomes were influenced by increasing expenses and market conditions, potentially leading to a fluctuation in net income compared to 2018."}

Despite the growth in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly to $(65) million in 2021 from $32 million in 2020, indicating a reduction in profitability. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA can be attributed to several factors, including increased expenses in the Cable Communications segment due to higher programming expenses and technical and product support costs [3]. Additionally, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA could be influenced by the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, offset by an increased number of sporting events and increases in accounts receivable [5].\n\nCapital expenditures in the Cable Communications segment increased significantly, driven by spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, which could also impact Adjusted EBITDA negatively [2]. Furthermore, the decrease in Corporate and Other expenses, primarily due to severance charges in the prior year period, contributed to the overall change in expenses [7].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that despite these challenges, the company still saw a net increase in Adjusted EBITDA when considering all segments. For instance, the Direct-to-consumer segment saw a 2.0% increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021, while Content revenue decreased by 7.4%, and Advertising revenue increased by 18.4% [image4]. Programming and production costs decreased by 1.3%, but direct network costs increased by 17.1%, which could further explain the overall trend.\n\nIn summary, Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed a slight decrease in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to increased expenses and operational costs despite growing revenue."}

The profit before tax fell from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, a decrease of 7% [10]. The return on tangible equity (RoTE), excluding significant items and UK bank levy, dropped from 9.8% in 2019 to 6.7% in 2020, reflecting a decline in profitability [10].\n\nThe management view of adjusted revenue shows that the Central Treasury experienced a slight decrease from $179 million in 2019 to $156 million in 2020, a drop of 13%. Conversely, the Legacy portfolios saw a marked improvement, with a decrease in losses from $(111) million in 2019 to $(17) million in 2020, an 85% improvement. Similarly, the Other category showed a positive trend, with losses decreasing from $(722) million in 2019 to $(401) million in 2020, a 44% improvement [2].\n\nIn terms of specific segments within Global Banking and Markets, the Global Markets segment reported a significant increase in total revenue, growing from $5,728 million in 2019 to $7,290 million in 2020, a 27% increase. FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) revenues also saw a notable boost, rising from $4,737 million in 2019 to $6,278 million in 2020, a 33% increase [4].

This decline is evident in the table shown in ![Interest and Other Investment Income fell significantly from 2020 to 2021](image5). The drop in interest income was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, reflecting the low interest rate environment that persisted throughout 2021. Despite this, dividend income saw a modest increase of 3.5% over the same period, which helped mitigate the overall impact on net investment income.\n\nThe asset allocations also reflect these changes, as illustrated in the table in ![Assets held in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image1). Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021.

For instance, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019, largely driven by the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, and the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 [1]. This growth in investment income contributed positively to the overall net income and comprehensive income. Additionally, the decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14 million was offset by other sources of income, such as higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020, further supporting the increase in comprehensive income.\n\nMoreover, the table in image1 provides a clear breakdown of these financial metrics, showing a steady rise in net income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership over the three-year period.

Secondly, operating expenses decreased slightly from $(9,544) million in 2019 to $(9,264) million in 2020, a reduction of $280 million or approximately 3%, which helped mitigate some of the decline in profit before tax. Additionally, the decrease in global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments negatively affected revenue. Despite these challenges, the strong performance in Global Markets, particularly in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), partially offset these declines.

The Media segment saw a notable increase in revenue, growing by 20.3% to $22.8 billion in 2021, largely due to the inclusion of the Tokyo Olympics and the growth in distribution, advertising, and other revenues. However, Adjusted EBITDA for the Media segment declined by 18.0% to $4.6 billion, indicating a less favorable margin despite the revenue growth [1].\n\nThe increase in revenue was partially attributed to the operations of Peacock, which generated $778 million in 2021 compared to $118 million in 2020, while operating costs and expenses grew to $2.5 billion from $781 million [1]. Additionally, the Studios segment experienced a 16.2% increase in revenue to $9.4 billion, mainly due to higher content licensing and theatrical revenue as operations returned to full capacity post-COVID-19 [1].\n\nHowever, the Theme Parks segment showed a substantial recovery with a 141.2% increase in revenue to $5.1 billion, as the theme parks operated normally in 2021 compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions in 2020 [1].\n\nRegarding customer relationships, the data indicates a slight decline over the years. As shown in the table, the total customer relationships decreased from 23,280 in 2019 to 23,027 in 2021, with net losses of 198 and 56 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This trend suggests a modest contraction in customer base, potentially impacting revenue growth and profitability. Despite this, the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship improved, increasing from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, a 8.7% rise in actual terms, although the constant currency growth was only 2.6%, indicating some impact from currency fluctuations [2].\n\nIn summary, the revenue trends positively impacted the financial performance of NBCUniversal, particularly in the Media and Studios segments, but the modest decline in customer relationships suggests ongoing challenges in maintaining a robust customer base amidst competitive pressures and changing consumer behaviors. \n\n![The total customer relationships slightly declined from 2019 to 2021, with net losses in both 2020 and 2021.](image1)\n![The average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from 2020 to 2021, despite a slight decline in customer relationships.](image2)"}

However, the exact figures for this category are not specified in the image description provided.\n\nAccording to the text, the cost of revenues has been influenced by several factors, such as an increase in employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, and service delivery costs, particularly due to efforts to increase data center capacity. These increases were noted across the company's operations and are likely to have affected the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category as well [2].\n\nAdditionally, the cost of revenues for subscription and support services has increased by $594 million, and for professional services and other, it has increased by $190 million from 2019 to 2020. This increase is reflected in the overall cost of revenues, which rose from $3,451 million to $4,235 million, representing a variance of $784 million [5]. The percentage of total revenues for the cost of revenues has slightly decreased from 26% to 25%, indicating a slight improvement in efficiency or a shift in the business mix towards more profitable services [5].\n\nGiven these observations, the increase in revenue for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category would contribute positively to the overall financial performance. However, the increase in cost of revenues, particularly in subscription and support services, might have some impact on the margins. Nonetheless, the slight decrease in the percentage of total revenues for the cost of revenues suggests that the company has managed to maintain or even improve its cost structure relative to revenue growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the revenue for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category likely increased from 2019 to 2020, contributing to overall financial performance, while the cost of revenues also increased but remained a slightly smaller percentage of total revenues, indicating improved efficiency."}

This suggests that the company had higher losses in 2020, which could be due to various factors including the impact of COVID-19 on business operations. Additionally, the statement of financial position details show an increase in deferred tax assets across multiple categories, such as property, plant, and equipment, employee benefits, and provisions.\n\nSecondly, the impairment charges saw a significant increase from zero in 2019 to $6,117,000 in 2020. This can be seen in the table that breaks down impairment charges, where the company incurred charges specifically related to exiting the Spanish market and other store impairments. These charges are substantial and indicate strategic decisions made by the company to restructure its operations, likely in response to economic challenges such as the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the major changes in tax expenses include a notable increase in deferred tax assets, particularly due to higher carry-forward tax losses, while impairment charges surged due to strategic exits and write-downs. \n\n![Deferred tax assets increased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n![Impairment charges increased substantially from 2019 to 2020](image4)\n\nThe major changes in tax expenses involved a significant rise in deferred tax assets, primarily due to increased carry-forward tax losses, while impairment charges increased notably due to strategic decisions to exit certain markets and write down assets."}

This increase reflects the shift towards higher-value offerings, enhanced productivity, and operational efficiency. However, the pre-tax income of $1,351 million decreased by 16.8 percent compared to the prior year, and the pre-tax margin declined by 1.2 points to 8.3 percent [1]. The decline in pre-tax income and margin can be attributed to higher workforce rebalancing charges, which had a significant impact [1]. Despite these challenges, GBS revenue decreased by 3.8 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020, with a focus on helping clients engage virtually, modernize applications, empower remote workforces, and enhance cybersecurity [3].\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, GBS revenue of $4,170 million decreased by 2.7 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year [8]. Nonetheless, cloud revenue within the segment grew at a double-digit rate, and Global Process Services revenue returned to growth [8].

This trend is also reflected in the detailed breakdown of interest income and interest expense changes across different financial instruments and deposit categories. Specifically, the interest income saw a substantial decrease of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, whereas there was an increase of $4,452 million from 2018 to 2019. In contrast, interest expense showed a net decrease of $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020, while it increased by $714 million from 2018 to 2019. These figures highlight that the overall net interest income declined significantly more in 2020 due to a much larger reduction in interest income compared to the reduction in interest expense.\n\nThe organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in the organizational chart, plays a crucial role in understanding these financial dynamics. The Consumer Banking division, which includes deposits and consumer lending, experienced a significant decrease in net interest income and noninterest income, reflecting the broader trend observed in the entire bank. The Consumer Banking segment saw a decline in net interest income from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020, and a drop in noninterest income from $10,429 million in 2019 to $8,564 million in 2020. These declines are consistent with the overall decrease in net interest income across the bank.\n\nMoreover, the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) and other segments also likely contributed to the overall decrease in net interest income, although specific figures for these segments are not provided.

The key financial metrics and their trends over the three years are outlined below.\n\nFirstly, the net income attributable to Accenture PLC increased significantly from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, the net income was $4,214,594, which grew to $4,846,241 in 2019, and further to $5,185,313 in 2020. This upward trend can be attributed to a combination of higher revenues and controlled operating expenses, which led to improved profitability over the years.\n\nMoreover, the comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC also showed a positive trajectory. In 2018, the comprehensive income was $3,578,520, increasing to $4,514,706 in 2019, and reaching $5,386,579 in 2020. The increase in comprehensive income can be largely attributed to the growth in net income, as well as favorable changes in other comprehensive income components such as foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans.\n\nFor instance, the foreign currency translation component contributed positively to the comprehensive income, moving from a negative value of $(305,225) in 2018 to a positive value of $197,696 in 2020. Similarly, the defined benefit plans component improved from $(253,039) in 2019 to a positive contribution of $57,100 in 2020. These improvements in the components of other comprehensive income have played a significant role in the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\nIn conclusion, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher revenues, controlled operating expenses, and positive contributions from other comprehensive income components like foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans. ![The table displays the financial data for Accenture PLC over three fiscal years, showing an increase in net income and comprehensive income attributable to the company.](image3)"}

Additionally, the other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss saw a notable shift from a negative €593 million in 2020 to a positive €542 million in 2021, largely due to currency translation differences and changes in cash flow hedges.

This increase was driven by several factors, including higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, although these benefits were partially offset by lower net interest income [6].\n\nIn terms of loans, the total loans (both average and period-end) decreased in 2021 compared to previous years. This decrease was due to paydowns exceeding originations, and the Home Lending loan balances were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations [9]. Furthermore, Small Business period-end loan balances were affected by a decline in PPP loans [9].\n\nOn the deposits front, total deposits (both average and period-end) saw an increase, driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [3].\n\nLooking at the financial summaries provided in the images, we can see the detailed changes in the balance sheet data for Consumer Banking and Lending.

Meanwhile, the international segment experienced a steady decline from $14.1 billion in 2019 to $12.9 billion in 2020 and further to $15.0 billion in 2021.

Specifically, net interest income decreased from $866 million in 2019 to $967 million in 2020 and slightly increased to $1,011 million in 2021. This slight rebound in 2021 could be attributed to a combination of factors, including lower cost of funds and higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances, which contributed to a 3% decline in net interest income versus the prior year [10].\n\nThese changes in average Card Member loans and net interest income have had notable implications for the company's financial performance. Despite the decline in net interest income, the company saw a substantial increase in total revenues net of interest expense, rising from $10,619 million in 2020 to $12,500 million in 2021, primarily driven by a significant increase in non-interest revenues [1].

It includes sections for cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.](image2)\n\nFor 2020, the cash flows from operating activities would have been influenced by the net income of $5,185,313, along with adjustments for share-based compensation and other expenses. This net cash inflow from operating activities strengthens the company's cash position, allowing for more flexibility in financing activities and potentially higher dividends or share repurchases, which in turn can affect shareholders' equity.\n\nIn summary, share-based compensation expenses in 2020 contributed positively to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity through increases in Additional Paid-in Capital and Restricted Share Units, while the net cash inflow from operating activities bolstered the company's cash position, enhancing its overall financial stability and equity base.\n\nTherefore, share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities both positively contribute to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position for the year 2020."}

According to the text, the Group recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for property leases, which impacted the balance sheet significantly. Specifically, the Group recognized $150,464,000 of right-of-use assets as at 28 June 2020. This recognition is evident in the financial data provided in the tables.\n\nSecondly, the depreciation and interest costs associated with these leases also influenced the carrying amounts. During the year ended 28 June 2020, the Group recognized $37,454,000 of depreciation charges and $4,707,000 of interest costs from these leases [1]. This depreciation charge reduced the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets, as shown in the table where the accumulated depreciation and impairment losses increased by $37,454,000 for the year.\n\nAdditionally, the table on right-of-use assets shows the initial balance of right-of-use assets recognized on the adoption of AASB 16 was $138,403,000, with subsequent additions of $48,793,000 and re-measurement of lease liabilities by $1,698,000. However, there were also exchange rate movements that decreased the balance by $1,755,000. The net effect of these transactions resulted in a balance at 28 June 2020 of $187,139,000. After accounting for depreciation charges, the carrying amount of right-of-use assets at 28 June 2020 was $150,464,000.\n\nFor leasehold improvements, hardware, and software, the table shows the initial balances at 2 July 2018, along with movements due to additions, disposals, and exchange rate effects.

By the end of the year, after the sale, the balance dropped by $587.1 billion, resulting in a substantial reduction to $28.9 billion. This dramatic decrease can be seen in the table detailing the balance, inflows, outflows, and market impact for WFAM assets under management. ![WFAM assets under management saw a significant drop due to the sale on November 1, 2021](image5)\n\nIn terms of broader effects on the company's income, the sale contributed to a net gain of $269 million, which positively impacted the company's income. However, this gain was partially offset by the loss of investment advisory and other asset-based fees previously earned from managing and administering these assets. As mentioned in the text, the sale of WFAM resulted in lower asset-based fees and lower lease income due to the impairment of certain rail cars. The impairment charge of $268 million further reduced the lease income, which is included in noninterest income. [6]\n\nAdditionally, the sale of WFAM and other divested businesses led to lower restructuring charges and expenses, but these were offset by higher incentive compensation expense and deferred compensation expense. The overall impact on the income statement is evident from the increase in noninterest income, primarily due to gains from the sale of various business units, including the Corporate Trust Services business and the student loan portfolio. These gains amounted to $674 million and $355 million, respectively. ![Significant gains from the sale of various business units, including WFAM, are noted](image4)\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM contributed to a modest decrease in total assets at the end of 2021, reflecting the timing of cash deployment by the investment portfolio. The decrease in total assets was partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to the affiliated venture capital business. The balance sheet data also shows a decline in net interest income, largely due to lower interest rates and lower loan balances, while noninterest income saw a significant increase. ![Balance sheet data reflects a decrease in total assets, partially offset by increases in equity securities](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, significantly reduced the total assets under management and had mixed effects on the company's income and balance sheet, with notable gains from the sale partially offset by reductions in fees and impairment charges."}

This overall decrease in net interest income, despite a reduction in interest expense, led to a contraction in the net interest spread. The primary driver of this decrease was the significant drop in interest income, particularly in interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, which decreased by $1,464 million. Additionally, there was a notable decline in interest income from debt securities and loans and leases, further contributing to the reduction in net interest income.\n\n![The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.

Despite this decrease, the net cash provided by operating activities increased by $\\S0.2$ billion due to higher net earnings (excluding 2019 non-cash charges related to the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the loss on deconsolidation of RBH), partially offset by higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs [10].\n\nIn terms of investing activities, net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $\\S0.7$ billion from the comparable 2019 period.

Additionally, net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion mainly due to lower rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [8].\n\nIn contrast, the **GWIM** segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, saw a decrease in total revenue, net of interest expense, by $954 million to $18,584 million in 2020 compared to 2019.

However, noninterest income increased by $82 million to $13.1 billion in GWIM, primarily due to higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, although this was offset by declines in AUM pricing and lower other income [3].\n\nRegarding net income, the GWIM segment reported a net income of $3,075 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,176 million compared to $4,251 million in 2019 [image3]. This decline was largely influenced by the same factors affecting revenue, including lower interest rates and higher provisions for credit losses.\n\nIn summary, both the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments experienced a decline in revenue and net income between 2020 and 2019, with lower interest rates being a significant factor in the decline of net income for both segments.

Actuarial valuations rely on several key assumptions, including discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression, among others [2]. Changes in these assumptions can significantly affect the defined benefit obligation and plan assets.\n\nFor instance, a change of half a percentage point in the discount rate, compensation increase, or pension progression can result in substantial impacts on the defined benefit obligation. As illustrated in the table, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point led to an increase in the defined benefit obligation of 271 million euros as of September 30, 2021, compared to an increase of 266 million euros as of September 30, 2020. Similarly, changes in compensation increases and pension progression also had notable effects, with increases leading to positive changes and decreases leading to negative changes [![The table shows the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage point in three categories: Discount rate, Compensation increase, and Pension progression.](image1)].\n\nFurthermore, the funded status of pension plans can be influenced by movements in financial markets and changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly the discount rate [8]. This is evident from the changes in plan assets over time, as seen in the second table, which details the composition of assets for 2021 and 2020. For example, equity securities increased from €554 million to €598 million, fixed income securities rose from €1,359 million to €1,590 million, and alternative investments grew from €200 million to €278 million [![The table displays financial data in millions of euros as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.](image2)].\n\nAdditionally, actuarial gains and losses provide further insight into the impact of changes in assumptions. For instance, changes in demographic assumptions resulted in a loss of 8 million euros in 2021 compared to a loss of 3 million euros in 2020, while changes in financial assumptions showed a loss of 26 million euros in 2021 compared to a gain of 72 million euros in 2020.

Meanwhile, the International Operated Markets segment faced a substantial decline of 15.0% in 2020, contrasting sharply with the 6.1% growth observed in 2019. These changes are reflective of the broader economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly affecting international markets more severely than the U.S. ![The bar chart shows decreasing margins for both franchised and company-operated restaurants from 2018 to 2020.](image1)\n\nMoreover, the revenue data further elaborates on these trends. In the U.S., company-operated sales decreased by 4% in 2020, while franchised revenues declined by 2%. In contrast, the International Operated Markets saw a more pronounced drop, with company-operated sales falling by 19% and franchised revenues declining by 14%. This indicates that the U.S. market was somewhat resilient, possibly due to better management of the pandemic and continued support for marketing initiatives, such as the free Thank You Meals served to essential workers. However, the International Operated Markets suffered significantly more due to prolonged lockdowns and reduced consumer spending. ![The table shows revenue decreases in the U.S. and International Operated Markets in 2020, with the latter experiencing a larger decline.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, along with growth in delivery services, positively impacted comparable sales in the latter half of 2020. However, the overall revenue decline in the International Operated Markets was exacerbated by higher depreciation costs related to investments in Experience of the Future (EOTF) and increased operational expenses related to the pandemic. ![The pie charts show a slight shift in revenue distribution between 2019 and 2020, with a decrease in the largest segment.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the revenue composition and growth rates for McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, with the U.S. showing resilience and the International Operated Markets experiencing severe declines, largely due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

This decrease was largely due to lower average market interest rates across the major currencies compared with 2019. However, it was partly offset by interest income associated with the increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) of $170.1bn or 8.8%. Additionally, the net interest margin (NIM) for 2020 was 1.32%, which was 26 basis points (bps) lower compared with 2019 [1].\n\nThe interest expense for the year ended 2020 was $14,178m, a decrease of $2,900m year-on-year, which can be seen from the detailed financial data provided in the tables [6], ![The table shows financial data related to interest-bearing liabilities for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image3).\n\nFurthermore, the decrease in net interest income included favorable impacts of significant items and adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences.

This growth was driven by improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher fuel surcharge revenue [7]. Additionally, the operating revenues from coal increased by 21.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, due to higher volumes and revenue per car/unit [5]. The volume increase was attributable to higher electricity generation, higher natural gas prices, and improved export demand [5].\n\nOn the expense side, railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020 [4]. Despite this increase, the ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 [4]. This improvement was partially due to productivity enhancements [4].\n\nRegarding net investment income, there was a decrease from 2020 to 2021. Interest and other investment income declined significantly, by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [2]. This trend is also evident in the table shown in `![The table displays financial data related to investment income for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, along with percentage changes between these years.](image2)`, where interest and other investment income dropped from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021.\n\nHowever, dividend income showed an increase of 3.5% from 2020 to 2021, reaching $5,060 million in 2021 [9]. The net investment income also saw a slight decrease, falling from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021 [9]. Overall, despite the decline in interest income, the increase in dividend income helped mitigate some of the decrease in net investment income.\n\nTo summarize, railroad operating earnings improved in 2021 due to higher revenues and productivity gains, while net investment income declined due to lower interest income but was partially offset by higher dividend income. \n\n`![The table displays financial data related to investment income for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, along with percentage changes between these years.](image2)`\n`![The table displays the financial data for a railroad company over three years: 2021, 2020, and 2019.

As of December 31, 2020, the total number of systemwide restaurants was 39,198, compared to 37,855 in 2018, an increase of 1,343 restaurants. This growth is largely driven by an increase in franchised restaurants, which grew from 35,085 in 2018 to 36,521 in 2020, representing a 93% franchise ownership. Additionally, company-operated restaurants decreased slightly from 2,770 in 2018 to 2,677 in 2020.\n\n![McDonald's number of restaurants increased significantly from 2018 to 2020](image1)\n\nSecondly, let's examine the total shareholders' equity. According to the financial data, McDonald's total shareholders' equity saw a fluctuation over the years. The exact figures for total shareholders' equity are not provided in the given tables, but we can infer from the detailed breakdowns in the shareholders' equity section that there were changes due to net income, comprehensive income, dividends, and other factors. Specifically, the net income decreased from $5,924.3 million in 2018 to $4,730.5 million in 2020, while comprehensive income also showed a decrease from $5,493.2 million in 2018 to $4,626.4 million in 2020.\n\n![Financial data indicating changes in net income and comprehensive income](image4)\n\nIn summary, McDonald's total systemwide restaurants increased by 1,343 from 2018 to 2020, with the majority being franchised locations.

This upward trend is consistent with the general increase in non-interest expenses and the specific increases noted in compensation and benefits expenses, as highlighted in the text quotes. For instance, the text mentions that the compensation and benefits expenses of $\\S20,854$ million in 2020 increased $11\\%$ from the prior year, primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation and formulaic payouts ([5]).\n\nThe distribution of these expenses across different business segments in 2020 reveals a significant portion allocated to Wealth Management, followed by Institutional Securities and Investment Management. Specifically, the breakdown in 2020 was as follows:\n- Institutional Securities: $851 million\n- Wealth Management: $1,000 million\n- Investment Management: $268 million\n\nThis distribution indicates that Wealth Management had the highest compensation expense, totaling $1,000 million, which is a substantial increase from $760 million in 2019 and $346 million in 2018.

Starting with lease assets, the operating lease Right-of-Use (ROU) assets increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020. This indicates a rise in the value of lease assets held by the company, likely due to new lease agreements or revaluations. Additionally, the operating lease liabilities, both current and long-term, also saw increases from $158 million and $639 million respectively in 2019 to $189 million and $785 million in 2020. The weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020, indicating a change in the financing costs or market conditions affecting the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities. These changes are reflected in the balance sheet, where the total lease liabilities increased from $797 million to $974 million, impacting the company's liabilities and potentially its cash flow obligations.\n\nRegarding inventories, the company experienced a significant increase across all categories from 2019 to 2020. Specifically, finished goods rose from $833 million to $1,232 million, work in process increased from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials went up from $510 million to $691 million. Consequently, the total inventory jumped from $1,628 million to $2,292 million. This increase in inventory levels could be attributed to higher production activities, strategic stockpiling, or increased sales volumes, which in turn impacts the cost of sales and working capital requirements. The rise in inventory levels is visible in the balance sheet as an increase in current assets, potentially affecting liquidity ratios and inventory turnover metrics.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's lease assets and inventories both saw notable increases from 2019 to 2020, reflecting expanded operations and higher asset utilization. These changes are directly observable in the balance sheet and may influence the company's financial health and operational efficiency.\n\n![Table showing lease balances and terms for 2020 and 2019](image4)\n![Inventory data for 2020 and 2019, displaying significant increases in all categories](image1)"}

The total deferred tax assets decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, while the valuation allowance also decreased from $180 million to $179 million during the same period. Consequently, the total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance reduced from $482 million in 2019 to $466 million in 2020. Meanwhile, the total deferred tax liabilities decreased significantly from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020.

These fluctuations would likely indicate similar trends when comparing 2018 to 2020, though the exact figures for 2018 are not provided.\n\nIn summary, while the exact changes in average production prices for crude oil and NGL from 2018 to 2020 are not fully detailed in the provided quotes, the data suggests that there were fluctuations in these prices across different regions during this period. To get precise figures, one would need to refer to the complete tables for all three years. \n\nThe average production prices for crude oil and NGL fluctuated across different regions from 2018 to 2020."}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million from 2019 to 2020, while long-term debt saw a slight increase of $253 million during the same period. This suggests that IBM continued to invest in long-term assets, possibly aligning with strategic growth initiatives or asset acquisitions. However, the increase in long-term debt indicates a reliance on external financing, which could impact future interest expenses and financial flexibility.\n\nIn terms of cash flows, operating activities generated more cash in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting improved operational efficiency or higher revenue generation. Investing activities, however, showed a significant decrease in cash outflows, likely due to a reduction in capital expenditures or acquisitions. Financing activities, on the other hand, used more cash in 2020, largely driven by dividend payments and debt repayments, which aligns with the observed decrease in total debt and the strategic management of the debt portfolio.\n\nEquity decreased by $258 million in 2020, primarily due to dividends paid and declines in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by net income and common stock increases. Despite this, the return on equity remained constant at 25.8% for both years, suggesting that the company maintained its profitability relative to equity levels despite the changes in asset and debt structures.\n\nOverall, the changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt, along with the shifts in cash flows and equity, indicate a balanced approach to financing and operational performance. IBM appears to have managed its financial resources effectively, maintaining profitability and addressing capital needs through a mix of internal and external financing sources.\n\n![Noncurrent assets and long-term debt figures for 2020 and 2019](image2)\n![Cash flow details for 2020 and 2019](image3)\n![Financial data showing total company debt for 2020 and 2019](image4)\n![IBM's equity decreased by $258 million in 2020](image1)\n\nIBM effectively managed its financial resources, maintaining profitability and addressing capital needs through a mix of internal and external financing sources."}

Additionally, purchase volumes dropped from $277,852 million in 2019 to $251,599 million in 2020. These declines can be attributed to the impact of the pandemic, which led to reduced consumer spending, particularly in travel and entertainment sectors. Furthermore, new account openings also saw a significant drop from 4,320 thousand in 2019 to 2,505 thousand in 2020, indicating a general decline in consumer appetite for new credit card accounts.\n\nIn contrast, debit card purchase volumes increased from $360,672 million in 2019 to $384,503 million in 2020, reflecting the shift in consumer spending towards essential goods and services rather than discretionary spending. This trend suggests that consumers may have been relying more on their existing funds rather than taking on new debt.\n\nFor home equity, `![Home equity production decreased in Consumer Banking and the total Corporation in 2020](image4)` indicates that home equity production in Consumer Banking decreased from $9,755 million in 2019 to $6,930 million in 2020. Similarly, the total home equity decreased from $11,131 million in 2019 to $8,160 million in 2020. This reduction in home equity production can be linked to a decline in applications, likely due to economic uncertainty and a preference for preserving cash reserves during the pandemic.\n\nMoreover, the decline in credit card balances and the increase in debit card usage suggest a conservative approach by consumers towards managing their finances, potentially due to job insecurity and the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. This behavior aligns with the decrease in credit card application activities and the increased focus on maintaining liquidity through existing financial resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the metrics for both credit card and home equity indicate a cautious consumer behavior pattern in 2020, characterized by reduced spending and a decline in new credit applications, reflecting the broader economic challenges posed by the pandemic."}

For instance, a US$1 per ton increase in the price of metallurgical coal can impact profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million. Similarly, a US$1 per ton increase in the price of energy coal impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million. These figures highlight the sensitivity of BHP's financial outcomes to fluctuations in commodity prices. ![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA.](image1)\n\nIn the case of coal, the decrease in underlying EBITDA for Coal by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021 was primarily due to lower prices and volumes, along with increased controllable cash costs, especially from higher maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and increased stripping volumes. However, cost reduction initiatives helped mitigate some of these negative effects. ![This table presents financial and production data for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, showing decreases in revenue and underlying EBITDA for both metallurgical and energy coal.](image2)\n\nFor nickel, the underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns in the prior year and reduced contractor costs. However, unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these benefits. The average realized sales price for nickel increased to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, driven by positive investor sentiment and strong end-use demand. ![The table compares the financial and operational performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC over fiscal years 2020 and 2021, highlighting decreases in revenue and underlying EBITDA for both units.](image5)\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices significantly affect BHP's financial results, with higher prices generally improving profitability, while lower prices and volumes can lead to decreased earnings. Additionally, factors such as maintenance costs, exchange rates, and cost reduction initiatives play crucial roles in determining the overall financial impact."}

Noninterest income, however, experienced a substantial increase, rising from $4,916 million to $10,036 million, marking a 104% growth.

According to the data:\n\n- **QCT**:\n  - 2021: $27,019 million\n  - 2020: $16,493 million\n  - 2019: $14,639 million\n  \n- **QTL**:\n  - 2021: $6,320 million\n  - 2020: $5,028 million\n  - 2019: $4,591 million\n\nNext, we can see the revenue breakdown by country for the same years. The revenue from China and South Korea is particularly significant.\n\n- **China (including Hong Kong)**:\n  - 2021: $21,384 million\n  - 2020: $13,528 million\n  - 2019: $14,152 million\n  \n- **South Korea**:\n  - 2021: $4,327 million\n  - 2020: $3,483 million\n  - 2019: $3,809 million\n\nBy comparing the segment revenues to the country-specific revenues, we can observe that the combined revenue from QCT and QTL is generally higher than the revenue from China and South Korea individually. However, the revenue from China alone is significant and often exceeds the revenue from QTL in any given year.\n\nFor instance, in 2021:\n- Combined QCT and QTL revenue: $27,019 + $6,320 = $33,339 million\n- Revenue from China: $21,384 million\n- Revenue from South Korea: $4,327 million\n\nThis trend is consistent across the years, indicating that while China and South Korea contribute significantly to the overall revenue, the QCT and QTL segments together generate more revenue. Additionally, the substantial growth in QCT revenue from 2019 to 2021 is largely attributed to increases in demand for 5G products, among other factors.\n\n![The table shows financial data across different regions for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.](image4)\n\nOverall, the combined revenue from QCT and QTL segments is consistently higher than the revenue from China and South Korea individually across 2019 to 2021."}

This increase is largely attributed to the capital increase in March 2021, which raised the issued capital by €53 million and the capital reserve by €2,284 million [9]. Additionally, the issuance of new shares contributed to the rise in equity, with the capital increase being implemented to finance the acquisition of Varian [6].\n\nFurthermore, the table detailing the changes in equity components shows that the issued capital increased significantly, reflecting the issuance of 53 million new shares in March 2021, priced at €44.10 per share [7][8]. This capital increase also led to an increase in the capital reserve, partly due to the effects from transaction costs and taxes [9].\n\nIn terms of other components, the retained earnings were affected by the dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020, which decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million. However, this was offset by the net income for the year, resulting in an overall increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million [9].\n\nAdditionally, the acquisition of treasury shares, which increased from 898,249 to 5,328,965, also impacted the equity composition.

The table in image1 provides a detailed financial summary of the equity components, showing that the issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock increased the balance of preferred stock in both 2019 and 2020. This is evident from the increases in the preferred stock balance, which rose from $1,600 million in 2019 to $3,268 million in 2020, reflecting the additional issuance of preferred stock during these years.\n\nAdditionally, the cash flows from financing activities in image5 reveal substantial proceeds from stock issuance and public offerings, particularly in 2020. The table indicates that the Company completed underwritten public offerings of common stock and preferred stock, generating significant net proceeds. Specifically, the 2020 Common Stock Offering and the 2020 MCPS Offering together brought in approximately $3.4 billion in net proceeds, which were used for general corporate purposes (see [2]). These proceeds contributed to the increase in the additional paid-in capital, which grew from $7,565 million in 2019 to $9,698 million in 2020, as shown in the balance sheet in image2.\n\nMoreover, the balance sheet in image2 illustrates the overall impact on total stockholders' equity, which increased from $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020.

However, it's important to note that the operating profit margin in 2018 was 22.9%, so there was a slight decrease from 2018 to 2019, followed by an increase in 2020. Several factors contributed to these changes.\n\nThe increase in operating profit margin in 2020 was influenced by higher core sales volumes, lower spending levels for business travel, and other business activities due to the pandemic. Additionally, there were incremental cost savings from ongoing productivity improvements and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, although these were partially offset by costs associated with new product development and sales and marketing growth investments [2][5].\n\nIn 2020, sales volumes increased significantly, which helped leverage the company's general and administrative cost base, leading to a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. This decline was driven by higher sales volumes, cost savings from productivity initiatives, and reduced travel expenses, all of which contributed positively to the operating profit margin [8].\n\nHowever, the data also shows that the operating profit margin was unfavorably impacted by certain factors, such as impairment charges and continued investments in sales and marketing initiatives [7].\n\nOverall, the operating profit margin improved from 2018 to 2020 despite some fluctuations, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and profitability. \n\n![The table shows financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, including sales, operating profit, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and percentages thereof.](image1)\n\nThe operating profit margin as a percentage of sales increased from 19.0% in 2018 to 22.7% in 2020."}

Firstly, the company's continued focus on store optimization and absorption activities [1][4]. Despite absorbing 578 stores in 2021, Inditex opened 226 new stores and refurbished 130 stores, including 57 enlargements, which contributed to the net increase in the total number of stores [4].

Meanwhile, comprehensive income grew from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020. These increases can be attributed to several factors, including rising revenues and improved operational efficiency.\n\nThe primary source of revenue growth comes from premiums, which increased significantly over the period. For instance, premiums rose from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020, indicating strong performance in their health insurance segments. Additionally, product and service revenues also grew, contributing to overall revenue expansion.\n\nHowever, the cost structure also expanded but at a slower pace compared to revenue growth. Medical costs, a significant portion of operating expenses, increased from $145,403 million in 2018 to $159,396 million in 2020, reflecting the ongoing challenge of managing healthcare costs. Despite this, the company managed to maintain an efficient operation, leading to higher earnings from operations, which grew from $17,344 million in 2018 to $22,405 million in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the statement of cash flows indicates that the company generated substantial cash from operating activities, which was partially offset by significant investments and financing activities.

However, the overall trend showed a positive net effect, contributing to the growth in comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020 due to higher revenues, particularly from premiums, and effective management of operating costs and investments.\n\n![This table represents a statement of cash flows (in millions) for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

This reduction can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [4]. Additionally, the cost of funds had a mitigating effect as it also declined, but not enough to offset the decrease in interest income. According to the data, net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [6].\n\nFurthermore, the table in `![Net interest income and yield trends from 2019 to 2021](image4)` shows the detailed breakdown of net interest income and yields over these years, indicating a steady decline in net interest yield from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, mainly due to higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances and a decline in interest income."}

This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors. First, ENBREL has continued to lose market share, as noted in the text [4]. Additionally, the decrease in unit demand and net selling price further contributed to the decline. The text also mentions that the reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market due to the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend [4].

This indicates a recognition of the broader societal impact of their operations and a commitment to transparency in reporting.\n\nSimilarly, for GHG emissions, Bank of America tracks its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, showing a reduction since 2010. The societal impact of their GHG emissions was estimated at $238 million in 2019 based on the EPA's social cost of carbon [image1]. This underscores the importance the bank places on understanding and mitigating the environmental and societal impacts of its operations.\n\nTo further integrate climate risk management into its operations, Bank of America has established a robust governance framework. This includes oversight by the Board and various committees focused on ESG and sustainability, ensuring a comprehensive approach to managing climate-related risks [3]. The Climate Risk Steering Council meets monthly to oversee climate risk management practices, aligning with the Risk Framework and supporting the bank's overall strategy towards net-zero emissions [3].\n\nOverall, Bank of America addresses environmental issues through a combination of emission reductions, transparency in reporting, and robust governance structures aimed at minimizing the environmental and societal impacts of its operations. Their efforts demonstrate a commitment to sustainable finance and responsible growth, positioning the bank as a leader in the industry.\n\nBank of America addresses environmental issues such as air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through comprehensive reporting, reduction measures, and governance frameworks, aiming to minimize their societal and operational impacts."}

The table shows that the highest price reached in April 2002 was 390.00 Rupees and the lowest was 340.00 Rupees. Over the following months, there was some fluctuation, with the highest peak occurring in July 2002 at 420.00 Rupees and the lowest trough in March 2003 at 286.00 Rupees.

The line graph shows that both GPI and BSE Sensex start at around the same normalized level in April 2002. GPI initially outperforms the BSE Sensex, reaching a peak of 106 compared to the BSE Sensex's peak of 98. However, both indices experience a decline, with GPI hitting a low of 84 and the BSE Sensex hitting a low of 84 in the same period. This suggests that both indices followed similar patterns but GPI had a slightly higher peak and experienced a more pronounced drop.\n\nOverall, the trends indicate that GPI stock prices saw a peak in mid-2002 followed by a decline, mirroring the BSE Sensex but with slightly greater volatility. The normalized index performance further confirms that GPI's performance was closely aligned with the broader market represented by the BSE Sensex, albeit with a higher initial peak.\n\n![GPI and BSE Sensex performance comparison](image4)\n\nIn summary, GPI's stock price trend from April 2002 to March 2003 showed a peak in mid-2002 followed by a decline, closely paralleling the BSE Sensex but with greater volatility."}

Firstly, the company noted that all segments experienced a decrease in their gross margin percentage due to declines in core merchandise categories, as mentioned in [1]. This trend was exacerbated by inflationary pressures on merchandise costs, as indicated in [3], where the company had to absorb cost increases and adjust pricing strategies to maintain competitiveness.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of gasoline prices played a significant role. While higher gasoline prices boosted net sales, they generally have a lower gross margin percentage compared to non-gasoline business, as explained in [2]. In 2022, the average price per gallon of gasoline increased by 42%, positively impacting net sales but negatively affecting the overall gross margin percentage. This is evident from the data in [7].\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. segment saw a decrease in gross margin due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs, as highlighted in [5]. Similarly, the Other International segment was affected by increased rewards programs, which further reduced the gross margin percentage.\n\nIn conclusion, the gross margin percentage decreased from 10.04% in 2020 to 8.88% in 2022, influenced by declines in core merchandise categories, inflationary pressures, and the impact of gasoline prices."}

Specifically, his total compensation is $50,000, which comes entirely from option awards, with no cash fees or stock awards noted. This suggests that his compensation is tied more closely to the potential future performance of the company rather than immediate cash payments. ![Roger Noriega's total compensation is $50,000, coming entirely from option awards.](image1)\n\nIn contrast, Marc Fogassa, who holds multiple high-level positions including CEO, CFO, and Chairman, sees a different compensation structure.

According to the provided financial data, the long-term debt was $5,303 million at the end of 2019 and increased to $6,248 million by the end of 2020. This substantial rise can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the company issued multiple rounds of fixed-rate, long-term debt throughout 2020. For instance, in March 2020, the company issued $750 million worth of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025, and in May 2020, another $750 million worth of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030. These issuances were aimed at general corporate purposes and the repayment of maturing debt [7][9]. Additionally, in September 2019, the company had issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2029 [8].\n\nSecondly, the overall financing activities in 2020 involved receiving net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt, which was slightly higher than the $1.49 billion received in 2019.

Notably, the issuance of new notes due in 2025 and 2030 added to the total long-term debt, as seen in the table showing the total debt increasing from $5,850 million in 2019 to $6,850 million in 2020, with adjustments for unamortized discounts, premiums, and issuance costs resulting in a final total debt of $6,798 million in 2020 and $5,803 million in 2019 ![The table shows details about notes (types of debt) with various due dates and interest rates for the years 2020 and 2019.](image5).\n\nIn conclusion, the long-term debt increased from $5,303 million in 2019 to $6,248 million in 2020 primarily due to multiple rounds of fixed-rate, long-term debt issuances and changes in the maturity profile of the debt."}

This decline can be attributed to the distribution of dividends, repurchases of shares, and possibly other financial activities that reduce retained earnings. Specifically, the repurchase of common shares would have a significant impact on this figure, as it involves using cash to buy back shares, thereby reducing the overall equity.\n\nFor other comprehensive income (loss), the table in ![Shareholders' Equity details](image4) shows that the total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) changed from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021, reflecting a further decrease of $50 million. This negative trend is largely driven by foreign currency translation adjustments, which deteriorated from $(2,229) million in 2020 to $(2,392) million in 2021. Additionally, the net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits also worsened, moving from $(731) million in 2020 to $(576) million in 2021.\n\nThese changes in retained earnings and other comprehensive income indicate a weakening in the equity position of the company. Despite the decrease in retained earnings and the worsening of other comprehensive income, the total shareholders' equity still stands at $22,177 million in 2021, a slight decrease from $22,984 million in 2020. This suggests that while there were negative impacts on specific components of equity, the overall equity base remained relatively stable.\n\nFurthermore, the total liabilities and shareholders' equity decreased slightly from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, as seen in ![Financial statement overview](image1). This indicates a modest reduction in the company's overall financial obligations and equity, which could be due to various factors including operational activities, investments, and financial management strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021, particularly the reduction in retained earnings and worsening of other comprehensive income, suggest a decline in the company's equity position. However, the overall financial position remains relatively stable, with total shareholders' equity and total liabilities and shareholders' equity showing only minor decreases."}

Retained earnings represent the cumulative profits that have been reinvested in the business rather than distributed as dividends. According to the equity table shown in the image, retained earnings began at $43,352 thousand in July 2018 and underwent several adjustments due to profit, changes in accounting policy, and dividends, resulting in a final amount of $49,124 thousand by June 2020. This indicates that the company retained more profits over this period, contributing positively to the total equity. \n\nNext, let's consider the cash flow from operating activities. The consolidated cash flow statement shows that despite the impact of COVID-19 on the business, the Group still managed to generate a significant amount of operating cash flow. Specifically, the net cash flow from operating activities, adjusted to remove the impact of AASB 16, was $48.1 million for the financial year ended 28 June 2020. This strong cash inflow from operations supports the company's ability to sustain its operations and invest in growth, thereby indirectly supporting the total equity.\n\nCombining these insights, the increase in retained earnings and positive cash flow from operating activities contributed to the overall increase in total equity. The total equity grew from $45,242 thousand to $58,368 thousand over the period, reflecting the company's profitability and efficient cash management.\n\n![Table showing equity attributable to the equity holders of a company over the period from July 2, 2018, to June 28, 2020](image3)\n\n![Consolidated cash flow statement comparing financial data from 2020 and 2019](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the cash flow from operating activities and changes in retained earnings positively affected the total equity from July 2018 to June 2020."}

According to the provided data, the total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022, indicating a reduction of $473 million. This decrease can be attributed to various factors such as lower loss and other carryforwards, reduced pension and other retiree benefits, and other adjustments. Specifically, the loss and other carryforwards decreased from $1,030 million to $914 million, and the pension and other retiree benefits declined significantly from $1,476 million to $740 million. Additionally, there was an increase in the valuation allowances, which offset some of the deferred tax assets, rising from $(569) million to $(409) million [3].\n\nOn the other hand, the deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022, marking an increase of $785 million. This rise is mainly due to increases in goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, and other retiree benefits. Goodwill and intangible assets saw a slight increase from $5,761 million to $5,783 million, while fixed assets rose from $1,512 million to $1,542 million. Notably, other retiree benefits jumped from $645 million to $1,031 million, contributing significantly to the overall increase in deferred tax liabilities [5].\n\nThese changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities have implications for the company's financial position. The reduction in deferred tax assets suggests a decrease in potential future tax benefits, which could impact the company's tax planning strategies. Conversely, the increase in deferred tax liabilities indicates higher future tax obligations, which might lead to higher tax expenses in the future. However, the overall net effect on the financial position depends on the balance between these changes and other financial metrics.\n\n![The table provides details on deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30 for the years 2022 and 2021.](image3)\n![The table lists different categories of deferred tax liabilities with their associated monetary amounts for two periods.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the deferred tax assets decreased by $473 million, while the deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 million between 2021 and 2022, leading to a net increase in future tax obligations."}

Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. [9]\n\nIn fiscal 2015, revenue in APAC remained stable compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue. The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. The decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. [5]\n\nExamining the regional revenue distribution in the table provided, we see that APAC's revenue decreased from fiscal 2013 to 2014 and then slightly increased in 2015:\n\n- **APAC Revenue**:\n  - 2015: $671.0 million (14% of total revenue)\n  - 2014: $652.8 million (16% of total revenue)\n  - 2013: $791.6 million (19% of total revenue)\n\n- **Percentage Change**:\n  - 2015-2014: 3%\n  - 2014-2013: (18%)\n\nThus, the APAC region saw a decrease of 18% in revenue from fiscal year 2013 to 2014, followed by a minor increase of 3% from fiscal year 2014 to 2015. Overall, the net change from fiscal year 2013 to 2015 indicates a decrease in revenue.\n\n![Regional revenue distribution for three fiscal years (2013-2015)](image2)\n\nThe percentage change in revenue for the APAC region from fiscal year 2013 to 2015 is a net decrease of approximately 15%."}

According to the text, among college-educated workers with training in other STEM fields, men are often more likely than women to be working in jobs directly related to their major field of study. However, overall, among adults who majored in STEM, women are more likely than men to work in a STEM occupation (56% vs. 49%). This difference is largely driven by college graduates with a health professions degree, most of whom are women. About seven-in-ten (69%) women who majored in a health professions field are working in a health-related occupation, as are 61% of men who majored in a health professions field.\n\nMoreover, the image3 illustrates the employment sectors of men and women with different STEM degrees. The chart shows that for a health professions degree, 61% of men and 69% of women work in jobs in the field of their degree. For computer degrees, the figures are 53% for men and 24% for women. For engineering degrees, the figures are 30% for men and 24% for women.\n\nSummarizing the percentages from the text and image3, we can calculate the overall difference:\n\n- For health professions, the difference is 69% (women) - 61% (men) = 8%.\n- For computer degrees, the difference is 53% (men) - 24% (women) = 29%.\n- For engineering degrees, the difference is 30% (men) - 24% (women) = 6%.\n\nGiven the context, the most significant difference is in the health professions field, which aligns with the overall trend mentioned in the text.

Notably, around 2004-2005, the graph indicates that the market was still saturated with pre-bubble VC funds. However, by 2005, an \"exit boom\" began to drive up demand, suggesting a turning point in the market dynamics. This aligns with the observation that venture capital supply started to dry out only after 2004 [7], leading to a critical supply gap in the latter part of the decade, as highlighted by the large shaded area labeled \"Current supply gap\" on the right side of the graph.\n\nMoreover, the scarcity of VC money in Europe has driven up capital efficiency and yield because the scarcity of money allows the very few investors to be more selective [3]. This trend, coupled with the increasing demand, has contributed to a more competitive environment for startups seeking funding. The image also underscores the significant decline in the number of active VC funds, with 65% of all VC funds sliding to oblivion by 2007-2008, indicating a consolidation phase in the market.\n\nIn summary, early-stage VC fundraising in Europe became more challenging after 2004 due to a significant drop in the supply of venture capital, despite growing demand and improved performance in post-bubble vintages. ![Market dynamics showing a shift in supply and demand with a significant supply gap](image1)"}

For instance, among self-identified Hispanics, the majority (65%) are of the third or higher generation, indicating a substantial shift away from recent immigration. This contrasts sharply with self-identified non-Hispanics, where 96% are of the third or higher generation, highlighting a much longer historical presence in the United States. \n\nThis generational shift is reflected in various aspects of Hispanic identity. For example, among self-identified Hispanics, connections with ancestral national origins decline as immigrant roots become more distant. While 82% of immigrant Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their country of origin, this percentage drops to 69% for second-generation Hispanics and further declines to 44% for third-generation Hispanics [4]. This trend aligns with the observation that non-Hispanic heritage becomes more common among higher generations of those with Hispanic ancestry [3].\n\nFurthermore, the intergenerational changes in language use and cultural practices are evident. Only 7% of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics speak Spanish, compared to 41% of foreign-born Hispanics [image5]. Similarly, only 7% of third or higher generation Hispanics have a Spanish last name, a stark contrast to the 20% among foreign-born Hispanics [image5]. These linguistic and cultural shifts underscore the diminishing influence of Hispanic heritage as the distance from immigrant roots increases.\n\nIn addition, the composition of social networks also varies across generations. While 77% of immigrant Latinos say all or most of their friends are Latinos, this percentage drops to 37% among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos [9]. This suggests a broader integration into American society, with less reliance on ethnic enclaves and more diverse social circles.\n\nIn conclusion, the generational breakdown reveals that self-identified Hispanics show a decreasing connection to their Hispanic heritage as they move further from immigrant roots, whereas non-Hispanics maintain a long-standing historical identity rooted deeply in the United States."}

In December 2003, 69% of Republicans thought Bush would be successful, which aligns with the 65% of Republicans who believed Trump would be successful in January 2019. This indicates a consistent pattern of high support within the party for their president’s performance and future prospects [1].\n\nIn terms of economic policies specifically, there has been a notable shift in opinions. As of October 2017, 63% of Republicans believed that Trump’s policies had made economic conditions better, while only 6% of Democrats agreed. By January 2019, this disparity had widened, with 79% of Republicans saying his policies had improved conditions, compared to just 10% of Democrats [4][10]. \n\nThis polarization is further illustrated by the data showing that in January 2019, the majority of Republicans (75%) rated the economy as excellent or good, a significant increase from the 14% who felt similarly in December 2016 [9]. Conversely, Democrats' views have remained largely unchanged, with 32% offering positive ratings, a drop from 46% in December 2016 [4].\n\nOverall, the shift in perception is starkly different between the two parties. Republicans have become increasingly positive about Trump’s economic policies, while Democrats have grown more negative. This trend is evident in the survey data and charts provided.\n\n![The chart shows the changing perceptions of Trump's economic policies among Republicans and Democrats from October 2017 to January 2019](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, from October 2017 to January 2019, the perception of Trump's economic policies among Republicans became significantly more positive, while it became notably more negative among Democrats."}

According to the data, models tend to perform relatively better in disciplines like Art & Design and Humanities & Social Sciences, where the images are more 'natural' and questions involve less reasoning [1]. This suggests that LMMs might show stronger performance in the 'Human & Social Science' category compared to more intricate domains such as Science or Technology & Engineering.\n\nLooking at the detailed performance metrics in the provided table (as shown in `![The table presents performance metrics of various large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs) across different validation and test sets, and specific categories/disciplines.](image1)`), we can observe the specific scores for the 'Human & Social Science' category and the overall performance. The table breaks down the performance of various models, including both LMMs and LLMs, across different categories and overall performance.\n\nFrom the table, it's evident that models like GPT-4V and other advanced LMMs generally achieve higher scores in the 'Human & Social Science' category than in more complex categories such as Science or Health & Medicine.

For higher-resource languages, the gains from pre-training are consistent, typically around 3 BLEU points across all tested pairs [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the impact can be minimal or substantial. Notably, for the language pair GL → EN, pre-training yields a significant gain of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating its effectiveness in bootstrapping models that are on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [1].\n\nQualitative analysis further supports this, showing that pre-training not only helps in capturing rarer vocabulary but also improves grammatical correctness in translations from GL to EN [2]. Specifically, the model successfully translates names and complex phrases, highlighting the utility of pre-trained embeddings in representing less frequent concepts effectively [2].\n\nMoreover, pre-training demonstrates its effectiveness when the baseline system is moderately effective, usually with a BLEU score in the range of 3-4, suggesting that pre-training becomes beneficial once there is enough data to capture basic language characteristics [4]. This is evident from the results in Table 2, where pre-training the word embeddings, especially in the source language, significantly boosts BLEU scores [6].\n\nIn multilingual translation systems sharing an encoder or decoder, pre-training and aligning word embeddings enhance BLEU scores for all tasks.

The retrieved context from these selected nodes is then combined with the query to generate an answer using a language model (LLM). This method progressively narrows down the focus as it descends through the lower layers, offering control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved [2][9].\n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval also begins with a query that is encoded into a vector. However, instead of layer-by-layer traversal, the tree is collapsed into a single layer, and nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity until reaching a threshold number of tokens.

This method provides a simpler way to search for relevant information by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously, thus offering greater flexibility and ensuring that information is retrieved at the correct level of granularity for a given question [3][1].\n\n![The image illustrates two mechanisms for retrieving information using tree structures: Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval.](image2)\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval follows a hierarchical, layer-by-layer approach, whereas Collapsed Tree Retrieval flattens the tree structure to evaluate nodes collectively across all layers."}

This method ensures that both the long-term and short-term aspects of user behavior are explicitly considered in the final user representation, potentially capturing a broader spectrum of user interests.\n\nThese two methods are visually illustrated in `![Two frameworks depict LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, showing different ways to integrate long-term and short-term user representations](image3)`. The left side of the image shows LSTUR-ini, where the long-term user embedding initializes the GRU network, while the right side shows LSTUR-con, where the long-term and short-term embeddings are concatenated.\n\nIn conclusion, LSTUR-ini initializes the GRU network with the long-term user representation, whereas LSTUR-con concatenates the long-term and short-term representations directly."}

First, it's important to note that word-order information plays a significant role in sentiment analysis. According to the text, for sentiment analysis tasks, both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, indicating that word-order information is crucial for analyzing sentiment orientations. This is consistent with the hypothesis by Pang et al. (2002) that positional information of words can help predict sentiment. For example, the phrases \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment despite having the same words but in a different order.\n\nMoreover, the text mentions that word-order patterns may be less useful for predicting the topic of a document, but they are critical for sentiment analysis. This is evident from the performance drop observed on the Yelp polarity dataset when the word order is shuffled, further confirming the importance of word-order for sentiment analysis.\n\nIn terms of empirical evidence, the table presented in ![The table presents a comparison of performance metrics (possibly accuracy percentages) across three datasets: Yahoo, Yelp P., and SNLI.

The type of the token, $t_{t}$, is determined using a single-layer softmax over $\\mathbf{h}_{t,x}$, which predicts if the token is new, related, or empty [1].\n\nFor the model to refer to an entity it has already mentioned, a Reflexive relation is introduced, which self-relates, i.e., $p = e$ for $(p, RefIexive, e)$ [2]. This means the model can refer back to previously mentioned entities.\n\nIn the context of 'published by', the model goes through a series of steps to decide which entity to render. First, it identifies the type of mention, which in this case would be \"related\" since 'published by' is referring to an existing entity [4]. Then, the model selects the parent entity, which is \"Super Mario Land\" in this example [4]. Next, the model chooses the relation, which is \"Publisher\" [4]. Finally, the model selects the entity to render, which is \"Nintendo\" [4].\n\nThe decision-making process is illustrated in the image, where the model updates its local graph with facts related to \"Nintendo\" and generates the next token \"Nintendo\" from a distribution that includes both the standard vocabulary and aliases for \"Nintendo\" [4].

However, without exact figures, we cannot provide a precise CO2 equivalent emission value.\n\nTo summarize, while we don't have the exact CO2 equivalent emission for training a Transformer (big) NLP model on a GPU, it is likely to be in the range of several thousand pounds of CO₂e, similar to the emissions from a trans-American flight. \n\n![The table captures the difference in resource metrics or performance indicators between a basic configuration and an optimized version of each model.](image1)\n![The table provides data on the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions associated with different types of consumption.](image2)\n\nTraining a Transformer (big) NLP model on a GPU likely results in CO2 equivalent emissions in the range of several thousand pounds of CO₂e."}

These mechanisms include base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair [8].\n\nBase excision repair (BER) is one of the most frequent DNA repair pathways, used for single strand point mutations affecting one or few bases of one DNA strand. It involves the recognition of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme and its removal, followed by the addition of new normal base(s) and the final restoration of the DNA backbone [5].\n\nNucleotide excision repair (NER) is another crucial repair system that excises DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. This repair system is highly conserved across species but is more complex in higher eukaryotes [4].\n\nDirect reversal repair mechanisms directly revert UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts to their original states without the need for DNA strand incision or resynthesis [9].\n\nMismatch repair (MMR) identifies and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that arise from errors during DNA replication. This involves the removal of the mutated sequence by an endonuclease, followed by the addition of new pairs by DNA polymerase and the restoration of the DNA double-stranded structure by DNA ligases [6].\n\nRecombination repair mechanisms focus on repairing double-strand breaks of DNA, which can lead to loss of genetic information and chromosomal instabilities. These mechanisms include homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ) [10].\n\n![The image illustrates various DNA repair mechanisms in response to different types of damaging agents.](image3)\n\nIn summary, Figure 11 demonstrates base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, transcription-coupled repair, and recombination repair."}

This improvement is evident across different categories of questions, as shown in the table in `![The table presents accuracy metrics for various models evaluated in different categories.](image1)`. Specifically, CAUSALCoT achieves the highest performance on all three rungs of the causal reasoning task, with accuracies of 83.35%, 67.47%, and 62.05%, respectively, compared to the original GPT-4's performance.\n\nMoreover, the CAUSALCoT approach also improves the model's ability to handle less common sense-aligned data. On the nonsensical subset, the accuracy jumps from 62.03% to 71.58%, and on the anti-common sense subset, it increases from 62.03% to 70.12%. This indicates that CAUSALCoT not only improves the performance on standard data but also enhances the model's reasoning ability on unseen or less intuitive data [3][4].\n\nAdditionally, the fine-grained error analysis reveals that while the model excels in extracting causal graphs (with high F1 scores for nodes and edges), it struggles with more complex causal inference steps, such as estimating treatment effects and applying causal inference correctly [9]. This is illustrated in `![The table contains data related to different steps in a process, which seem to be numbered sequentially.](image2)`, showing that while Step ① has high F1 scores, later steps involving causal inference have much lower scores.\n\nIn conclusion, the CAUSALCoT approach substantially improves the performance of GPT-4 across different evaluation metrics, particularly in handling challenging causal reasoning tasks and less common sense-aligned data."}

Similarly, the Family & Relationships domain comprises 7.8 million entries, with 5.6 million informal and 1.8 million formal [3].\n\nFurthermore, the overall Yahoo Answers corpus consists of 40 million entries, where 24 million are informal and 16 million are formal [3].\n\nThis distribution is clearly illustrated in the image provided, which shows a bar graph representing the number of informal and formal entries in various domains of Yahoo Answers. The graph depicts that the Entertainment & Music domain has a significantly higher proportion of informal entries compared to formal ones, with the Family & Relationships domain also showing a similar trend but with a slightly higher proportion of formal entries [image4].\n\nIn summary, the Entertainment & Music and Family & Relationships domains in Yahoo Answers predominantly contain informal sentences, with the former having 2.7 million informal and 0.7 million formal entries, and the latter having 5.6 million informal and 1.8 million formal entries out of their respective totals."}

Therefore, the inclusion of all data sources is crucial for achieving optimal performance on ultra-fine categories [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the exclusion of any of the data sources—crowd-sourced data, head-word supervision, or entity linking data—negatively impacts the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category."}

For instance, adjusting the metering mode can significantly impact the exposure of the photo. Matrix metering, which measures light across the entire frame, is ideal for shooting natural landscapes [5]. Center metering, which focuses on light near the center of the screen, is perfect for portraits [5]. Spot metering, focusing on light from a specific region, is useful for capturing details like a subject's eyes [5].\n\nSimilarly, focus modes in Pro Mode enable precise control over the focus of the photo. AF-S (single) is suitable for stationary subjects, while AF-C (continuous) is better for moving subjects [1, image1]. MF (manual) allows manual adjustment, which is particularly useful when you need to focus on a specific part of the scene, such as a subject's face [1, image1].\n\nThese adjustments can be made through the Pro mode interface, where you can select various settings including metering mode, ISO sensitivity, shutter speed, exposure compensation, focus mode, and white balance [image2]. By fine-tuning these settings, photographers can achieve professional-quality photos that cater to different shooting conditions [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by allowing precise control over exposure and focus, making it easier to capture high-quality images under various scenarios."}
