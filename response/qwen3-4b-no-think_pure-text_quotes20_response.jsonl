According to the table, Republicans are more likely to prioritize terrorism, defense issues, and national security or ISIS compared to independents and Democrats. Specifically, 41% of Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues, and national security or ISIS as the most important problem, while only 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats do so. This suggests a stronger focus on national security concerns among Republicans.\n\nThis difference in perception of terrorism's importance is likely related to their perception of government efforts to address the terrorist threat. As shown in text quotes, there is a wide partisan divide on the effectiveness of the government's efforts. For instance, text quote [5] states that Democrats are the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well in reducing the threat of terrorism, down from 85% in January. In contrast, only 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year. \n\nText quote [7] further highlights the shift in conservative Republican views, noting that in January, 59% said the government was doing very well or fairly well, but today, only 18% say this. This indicates that conservative Republicans have become more critical of the government's efforts to address the terrorist threat, which may be linked to their higher prioritization of terrorism as a major issue.\n\nThe relationship between the importance of terrorism and perception of government efforts is also reflected in text quote [11], which shows that Americans are more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%). This concern about the adequacy of government efforts may contribute to the differing perceptions among political affiliations, with Republicans potentially feeling that more needs to be done to address the terrorist threat, given their higher prioritization of terrorism as an issue."}

Specifically, 81% of self-identified Hispanics say they do not need to speak Spanish to be considered Hispanic or Latino, highlighting the diversity in how Hispanic identity is perceived.\n\n![Comparing Spanish speakers and those with Spanish last names among self-identified Hispanics by generation](image1) [1]\n\nThis chart compares the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who speak Spanish and have a Spanish last name across different generations. It reveals that while a majority of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, there is a notable difference between foreign-born, second-generation, and third or higher-generation Hispanics. For instance, 92% of third or higher-generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish, indicating a shift away from linguistic ties as a marker of Hispanic identity over time.\n\n![Reasons why individuals may not identify as Hispanic](image3) [3]\n\nThis bar chart outlines the reasons why some individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic. The most common reasons include mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and lack of cultural links. These factors are particularly relevant for those with mixed heritage or those who have less exposure to Hispanic culture.\n\n![Frequency of self-identification as Hispanic among different groups](image4) [4]\n\nThis chart illustrates how often different groups self-identify as Hispanic. Foreign-born individuals are more likely to often identify as Hispanic compared to second and third or higher-generation individuals. Non-Hispanics, on the other hand, are less likely to identify as Hispanic, with 53% never identifying as Hispanic.\n\nIn conclusion, factors such as cultural ties, language proficiency, family background, and generational status significantly influence the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S., with these factors varying across different generations."}

This suggests that Germany's environmental impact is influenced by both its energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant. The USA's high energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership contribute to its high CO2 emissions, which have a substantial environmental impact. China's lower energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership suggest a smaller environmental impact, although its rising GHG emissions from passenger vehicles may change this dynamic. Germany's environmental impact is influenced by its energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership, but its stringent standards may help mitigate this impact. \n\n![Part of transports InCo2emissions](image2)"}

According to image1, the bar chart shows that despite lower venture invested amounts in Europe compared to the USA, the venture exits are significantly higher, indicating a more robust exit market in Europe. For instance, Germany has venture exits of $4.4 billion, which is much higher than its venture invested amount of $0.8 billion.\n\n![Europe's higher venture exits compared to investments](image1)\n\nImage7 provides a multi-bar chart comparing various metrics between the USA and Europe since 2004. It shows that while the USA has a larger share of total capital invested (82% vs. 18% for Europe), Europe has a higher percentage of exits exceeding $100 million (22% vs. 78%). This suggests that although Europe has less capital invested, it is more efficient in terms of exits.\n\n![Comparison of venture capital metrics between USA and Europe](image7)\n\nAdditionally, image4 highlights that Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2) compared to the USA (4.5), indicating better performance in terms of returns on investment.

According to [9], Europe is producing higher exit multiples globally, and although average exit values are about 25% smaller, lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency overcompensate for this disadvantage. This is further supported by [11], which states that the scarcity of VC money in Europe has led to low entry valuations and higher capital efficiency, roughly 70 percent higher than in the US.\n\n![Higher share in top quartile](image1)  \nThis image shows a comparison of the distribution of US and EU VC funds across quartiles, with Europe having a higher share in the top quartile compared to the US.\n\nAdditionally, [4] indicates that more checks to LPs are being written in Europe than ever before, suggesting a more rigorous and selective investment process. The image [4] also highlights that European VC has finally emerged with strong fundamentals within the context of an inefficient market while benefiting from higher capital efficiency than the US [2].\n\nIn terms of investment multiples, [10] notes that European capital efficiency results from low entry valuations, which contribute to higher multiples. The image [4] provides a direct comparison, showing that Europe has a higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2) compared to the USA (4.5). Moreover, a greater percentage of European investments reach a multiple of 5 or more, indicating stronger performance in terms of returns.\n\nWhile the median exit valuation is higher in the USA, Europe's higher median multiple of cash invested and greater percentage of investments reaching a multiple of 5 or more suggest that European VC performance is superior in terms of investment multiples and exit values."}

However, data usage increased, which could have led to an increase in data ARPU. \n\nThe ARPU trends for Telkomsel and XL can be seen in image1, which shows the trends in ARPU for Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data from 2013 to 2017. The data ARPU initially showed a decline but then picked up as users increased their data consumption. This trend is consistent with the increase in smartphone users, as more users would be using data-intensive applications. \n\nThe decrease in ARPUs for Voice and SMS is also supported by text quote [7], which states that less usage on SMs and voice also leads to reduced ARPUs. Additionally, text quote [4] mentions that recently people use data-based IM, VolP, etc., which leads to even less usage of SMS and voice calls. \n\nThe influence of these changes on ARPU trends is also supported by text quote [5], which states that the continued trend of declining ARPUs until 2015 where data users will start to enroll for bigger data plans due to increased usage of the mobile Internet and compensate the declining voice and SMS ARPUs. \n\nTherefore, the number of smartphone users and ARPU trends for Telkomsel and XL changed between 2013 and 2014 due to the increasing adoption of smartphones and the shift in user behavior towards data-based services."}

For instance, removing spatial positional encodings leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 AP, whereas passing them in the decoder only results in a minor AP drop. This suggests that while spatial positional encodings contribute to performance, their necessity is less critical than the output positional encodings, which are always learned.\n\nRegarding loss components, the text indicates that the set-based loss used in DETR does not require non-maximum suppression (NMS) by design. However, when NMS is applied, it improves early AP but reduces AP in later layers due to the removal of true positive predictions. This implies that the choice of loss function and the inclusion of NMS can significantly affect AP, with NMS having a diminishing return as the model depth increases.\n\nThe image that visually represents these findings is ![image4](image4), which shows the average precision (AP) and AP at 50% IoU (AP₅₀) performance as a function of decoder layers in a model, likely referring to the DETR model. The graph compares the performance without NMS and with NMS set to 0.7, illustrating how NMS affects AP across decoder layers.\n\nIn summary, different configurations of positional encodings and loss components can significantly influence the Average Precision (AP) in the DETR-DC5 model for object detection, with the specific impact depending on the configuration and the stage of the model's processing."}

Recall (orange line) remains relatively stable, staying around 15. F1-Score (green line) shows a moderate increase, starting at 14 and ending around 18. This indicates that while the model's ability to identify absent knowledge improves, its recall remains consistent, suggesting a limited capacity to handle missing information.\n\n**Image2** provides numerical data showing that as knowledge elements are removed, precision and recall metrics change. For instance, when no knowledge is removed (0), recall is 57.1, but it drops to 42.5 when one knowledge element is removed. This drop highlights the model's struggle to maintain accuracy when faced with missing information. The F1-Score also decreases, reflecting a balance between precision and recall.\n\n**Image7** further supports these findings by showing how retrieval accuracy affects the scores. As retrieval accuracy decreases, precision, recall, and F1-Score all decline, with correctness remaining relatively high. This implies that while models can identify some absent knowledge, their overall performance suffers when retrieval accuracy is low.\n\nThese changes suggest that models have a limited ability to handle absent knowledge, especially when retrieval accuracy is low. The \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting is crucial for evaluating how models perform under such conditions, highlighting the need for improved retrieval mechanisms and better handling of missing information."}

As shown in **image1**, increasing the number of demonstration samples from 1 to 5 leads to evident improvements in performance, but further increases beyond 5 have limited effects. Additionally, adding logical constraints to LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE achieves a higher performance (25.7%) than 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%). This indicates that combining \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) is crucial for enhancing model performance.\n\n![Logical Constraints and Demonstration Samples](image1)\n\nFurthermore, **image3** illustrates that models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT achieve better performance when logical constraints are applied. For example, Vicuna-13B-PT on MAVEN-ERE reaches a Micro-F1 of 18.0% with CoT and logical constraints, while Llama2-13B-PT achieves a higher Micro-F1 of 26.4% under similar conditions.

This is because the semantics of the post-processing answer may be far from the ground truth due to the random selection. On the other hand, ![Logical Constraints and Post-Processing Effects](image6) shows that adding logical constraints into LLM instructions can provide stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. The performance of incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass that of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations. This indicates that it is important to tell LLMs both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints). \n\n![Model Performance Comparison](image3) presents the evaluation of different models on three tasks, including MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank, and ProofWriter.

However, the inconsistency tends to increase with more hops. This suggests that logical constraints are essential for maintaining consistency in complex reasoning tasks.\n\nOverall, the effectiveness of logical constraints and post-processing on reducing logical inconsistency in different LLM models across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets varies. Logical constraints provide stable improvements and can even surpass the performance of prompts with a larger number of demonstrations.

It is characterized by a simple \"Retrieve\" and \"Read\" mechanism, with limited flexibility in adjusting interaction flow or integrating new modules [1].\n\nIn contrast, the Advanced RAG introduces specific improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG. It focuses on enhancing retrieval quality through pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies, such as refining indexing techniques with a sliding window approach and incorporating metadata [10]. Additionally, it includes optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process [8].\n\nThe Modular RAG framework offers remarkable adaptability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges. It introduces additional specialized components, such as the Search, RAG-Fusion, Memory, Routing, Predict, and Task Adapter modules, which enhance retrieval and processing capabilities [6]. The flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases the benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques like FLARE and Self-RAG, enabling the system to evaluate the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios [3].\n\n![{The image compares three paradigms of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), illustrating their structures and components.}](image4) [4]\n\nThe Modular RAG architecture advances beyond the former two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and versatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its components, such as adding a search module for similarity searches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning [11]. Innovations like restructured RAG modules and rearranged RAG pipelines have been introduced to tackle specific challenges, supporting both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components [11].\n\nIn summary, the Naive RAG is the simplest form, the Advanced RAG introduces optimizations to enhance retrieval quality, and the Modular RAG provides the most flexibility and adaptability through the integration of various specialized modules."}

Additional error analysis of TimeQA is in Appendix A.\n\n![Error Distribution](image1)\n\n[6] All five types of errors are happening during the Reasoning step except Principle Error which points to the failure of the Abstraction step. As shown in Figure 4 (right), Principle Error in fact comprises only a small fraction of the errors the model makes: more than $90\\%$ of the errors happen at the Reasoning step. Among the four error types during Reasoning, Reasoning Error and Math Error are the major loss buckets. This corroborates with the finding in the ablation study above that very few exemplars are needed to teach LLMs the Abstraction skill. Reasoning step is still the bottleneck of how well S TEP -B ACK P ROMPTING can perform tasks such as MMLU requiring complex reasoning. For MMLU Physics specifically, the Reasoning and Math skills are critical for solving the problems successfully: even if the first principles are retrieved correctly, deep reasoning and math are involved to derive a correct final answer through a typical multi-step reasoning process.\n\n![Error Analysis](image8)\n\n[10] We evaluate the models on the test-set of TimeQA. As shown in Table 2, the baseline models of GPT-4 and PaLM-2L achieved $45.6\\%$ and $41.5\\%$, highlighting the difficulty of the task. Applying either CoT or TDB zero-shot (and one-shot) prompting to the baseline model shows no improvement. In contrast, augmenting the baseline model by regular retrieval augmentation (RAG) improves the accuracy to $57.4\\%$, highlighting the factual intensive nature of the task. The result of Step-Back $+\\;\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{G}$ shows the effectiveness of going back to a high-level concept, which enables much more reliable retrieval augmentation: the accuracy on TimeQA achieves a remarkable $68.7\\%$.\n\n[11] We evaluate S TEP -B ACK P ROMPTING on TimeQA (Chen et al., 2021) and SituatedQA (Zhang & Choi, 2021) in the Knowledge QA category. We first teach the LLMs to do Abstraction. The step-back question “What was Estella Leopold’s education history” in Figure 2 is generated by the LLM through few-shot demonstrations (see Appendix D.2 for details). Given the knowledge-intensive nature of these queries, we use retrieval augmentation (RAG) in combination with S TEP -B ACK P ROMPTING. The step-back question is used to retrieve relevant facts, which works as additional context (see Table 12 for the prompting template) to ground the final reasoning step.\n\n[12] On the SituatedQA benchmark, we observe a moderate quality gain from $54.3\\%$ to our best method of Step-Back $^+$ RAG $61\\%$ with a small gap to GPT-4’s $63.{\\dot{2}}{\\bar{\\%}}$. Similar to TimeQA, prompting techniques such as CoT and TDB don’t help significantly for SituatedQA.\n\nThe performance of different methods, including Step-Back and RAG, in various QA tasks compared to GPT-4 shows that Step-Back Prompting with RAG significantly outperforms GPT-4, particularly in tasks like MuSiQue and StrategyQA. Common error types associated with Step-Back Prompting include reasoning errors and math errors, which are the major loss buckets in the reasoning step."}

Beam search with fewer beams (e.g., 2 beams) shows improved scores over random sampling but lower than greedy decoding. As the number of beams increases, the scores decrease slightly, indicating that while more candidates may be generated, the quality of the generated tuples can be compromised.\n\n![Classifier accuracy and novel tuples](image1)\n\nVariations in training data percentages affect the model's metrics as shown in image8. Using 10% of the training data results in a BLEU-2 score of 12.72 and N/U ° score of 58.34, both of which are higher than when using 1% of the training data. The model performs best with 50% of the training data, achieving a BLEU-2 score of 13.97 and N/U ° score of 50.37. However, using full training data (FULL train) yields the highest BLEU-2 score of 14.34 and N/U ° score of 50.05, indicating that more training data leads to better performance on these metrics.\n\nThe comparison between different decoding methods and the impact of training data percentages on model performance highlights the importance of both decoding strategy and training data in generating high-quality commonsense inferences. While greedy decoding outperforms other methods in terms of score, human validation remains the gold standard for evaluating the correctness of generated tuples. The results also suggest that using a larger amount of training data can improve the model's performance on various metrics, although the exact impact may vary depending on the specific metric and the type of training data used."}

The table distinguishes between \"Insurance and Other\" and \"Railroad, Utilities and Energy\" segments, highlighting key components such as unpaid losses, unearned premiums, and regulatory liabilities.\n\nThe increase in liabilities is primarily attributed to the growth in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which rose from $79,854 billion in 2020 to $86,664 billion in 2021. Additionally, the liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts increased from $40,966 billion to $38,256 billion, reflecting the company's exposure to these complex financial instruments. The rise in unearned premiums from $21,395 billion to $23,512 billion also contributes to the overall increase in liabilities.\n\nOn the shareholders' equity side, the consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $\\S506.2$ billion, an increase of $\\S63.0$ billion from 2020. This growth is largely due to net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders of $\\S89.8$ billion, which included after-tax gains on investments of approximately $\\S61.6$ billion. The increase in equity is also supported by the company's strong capital base and the management of its reinsurance liabilities, as noted in text quote [2], where the company's claim liabilities were approximately $\\S125$ billion, with 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.\n\nThe key factors contributing to these changes include the volatility in investment gains and losses, the management of reinsurance liabilities, and the company's strong financial position, which allows for significant capital appreciation and stable earnings. The company's ability to maintain a strong capital base and effectively manage its liabilities is crucial to its financial health and long-term stability."}

The increase in compensation expenses in 2020, which was $2,119 million, was driven by factors such as increases in discretionary incentive compensation and formulaic payouts, as mentioned in [1]. The lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 may have contributed to the higher effective tax rate, as lower tax benefits can lead to a higher effective tax rate when combined with higher earnings. However, the direct relationship between the tax rate changes and compensation expenses is more indirect, as tax provisions are influenced by a variety of factors beyond just compensation expenses."}

According to image4, total depreciation and impairment losses for 2019 were 4,192 million DKK, while for 2020 they decreased slightly to 4,307 million DKK. This suggests that although the total amount increased, the composition of these losses changed.\n\nLooking at the specific categories, image5 provides detailed information on intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. For instance, intangible assets not yet being amortised amounted to DKK 9,607 million in 2020, up from DKK 3,380 million in 2019, primarily due to patents and licences related to research and development projects. This indicates an increase in the value of intangible assets, which are tested annually for impairment, irrespective of any indications of impairment [12].\n\nImage6 details the changes in \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment.\" In 2020, the balance at the end of the year for \"Land and buildings\" was DKK 2,901 million, down from DKK 3,029 million in 2019, with depreciation of DKK 644 million. Similarly, \"Other equipment\" decreased from DKK 503 million in 2019 to DKK 479 million in 2020, with depreciation of DKK 320 million. The effect of exchange rate adjustments also impacted these figures, reducing the balances by DKK 144 million and DKK 22 million respectively.\n\n![Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment](image5)  \n![Land and buildings and other equipment](image6)\n\nThe impact of depreciation and impairment losses on the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment is significant. For instance, image4 shows that total amortisation was 487 million DKK in 2019 and 1,096 million DKK in 2020, while total impairment losses were 982 million DKK in 2019 and 350 million DKK in 2020. These figures highlight the importance of impairment testing and the adjustment of carrying amounts when necessary. The decrease in impairment losses in 2020 compared to 2019 could be attributed to management's review of expectations related to patents and licences not yet in use [10]. \n\nIn summary, the depreciation and impairment losses have evolved from 2019 to 2020, with changes in the composition of these losses across different asset categories, affecting the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment."}

The drop in interest income can be attributed to lower short-term interest rates, which prevailed through 2021, resulting in significantly lower interest income. \n\n![Investment asset allocation](image6) shows that the company held substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. These assets are typically less sensitive to interest rate changes, but the overall low interest rates affected the income generated from these holdings. Additionally, the company's fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 thousand in 2020 to $16,386 thousand in 2021, which could also contribute to lower interest income.\n\nThe asset allocation reflects a strategy focused on maintaining ample liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield with respect to short-term investments, as mentioned in the text. This approach aligns with the observed decline in net investment income, as the company may have chosen to hold more low-risk, liquid assets rather than higher-yield but more volatile investments. \n\nThe decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to lower interest rates and a shift in asset allocation towards safer, more liquid investments."}

For instance, the **Medicare & Retirement** segment saw an increase of 9% in revenue, which may be attributed to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans, as noted in [5]. Similarly, the **Community & State** segment experienced a 6% increase in revenue, partly due to states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans [5].\n\nHowever, the **Global** segment saw a significant decrease of 21% in revenue, resulting from increased unemployment and underwriting discipline [5]. The **Employer & Individual** segment also saw a slight decrease of 2% in revenue, likely due to employer actions in response to the pandemic [5]. \n\nThese changes can be attributed to various factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment rates, changes in healthcare access and delivery, and the overall economic environment. The temporary deferral of care, as mentioned in [9], impacted all businesses, leading to decreased demand for care in some segments while increasing it in others.

In 2020, the company's total equity attributable to equity holders increased from RMB 43,590 million to RMB 52,245 million, reflecting growth in retained earnings and other comprehensive income. This was partly due to the Initial UMG Transaction in March 2020, where the company invested 10% equity in a consortium led by Tencent to acquire a 10% stake in Universal Music Group (UMG), and later exercised its option to purchase an additional 10% stake in 2020. These investments are accounted for as investments in an associate, which affects the equity structure.\n\nIn 2021, the equity attributable to equity holders decreased slightly to RMB 51,055 million, despite the completion of the Second UMG Transaction in January 2021, where the consortium acquired another 10% equity interest in UMG. The decrease was mainly due to a shift in the revenue mix, with online music services contributing a higher percentage of revenue, which typically has a lower gross margin. Additionally, increased investments in new products and content offerings, along with content costs such as long-form audio, impacted the gross margin and, consequently, the equity structure.\n\nKey transactions affecting these changes include the acquisition of Shenzhen Lanren in January 2021, which added significant value to the company's equity through the purchase of a 100% equity interest in the audio platform for RMB2.7 billion. Furthermore, the company's capital contributions to its PRC subsidiaries and the intercompany fund transfers also played a role in shaping the equity composition over the years."}

This indicates a substantial decrease in tax provisions over the period. Additionally, there were notable changes in specific areas such as the benefit from FDII deduction, excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards, and the derecognition of deferred tax assets on distributed intellectual property. \n\nIn fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was 12%, which is much lower than the 41% in 2019.

However, due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, the balance at the end of 2021 dropped to $(587.1) billion, indicating a substantial reduction in the assets under management following the sale. This is also reflected in text quote [5], which mentions that prior to the sale, WFAM earned investment advisory and other asset-based fees from managing and administering assets through WFAM.\n\nThe sale of WFAM also had broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet.

According to **image1**, there was a notable downturn in net interest income primarily due to the significant decrease in interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses from 2019 to 2020. Specifically, interest income decreased by $19,747 million, while interest expense decreased by $5,627 million, leading to a net decrease in net interest income of $14,120 million.\n\nThis decline in net interest income contributed to a reduction in the net interest spread. The net interest spread is influenced by several factors, including changes in interest rates, the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the overall economic environment. As noted in **text2**, the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet increased in both up-rate and down-rate scenarios due to continued deposit growth invested in long-term securities. This sensitivity means that the bank's earnings are more vulnerable to changes in interest rates, particularly on the short end of the yield curve.\n\nAdditionally, **text6** mentions that the decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. These factors highlight the complex interplay between interest rate changes, deposit and loan balances, and the bank's strategy for managing its balance sheet.\n\nIn summary, the decrease in net interest income from 2019 to 2020, combined with the decrease in net interest expense, led to a narrower net interest spread, primarily due to lower interest rates and the composition of the bank's earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. ![Net Interest Spread](image1)"}

The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits could affect the company's effective tax rate and overall financial health, as these liabilities are not included in the reconciliation of tax provisions. On the other hand, the decrease in share repurchases might indicate a shift in the company's capital structure strategy, potentially affecting shareholder value and financial flexibility. ![Common Share Repurchases](image1) ![Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits](image5) \n\nThe company's financial position reflects a balance between managing tax liabilities and maintaining a strategic approach to share repurchases, which are both critical components of its financial strategy."}

This suggests that their DPO is likely to be relatively low, as they pay their suppliers quickly.\n\nLooking at image1, which is a balance sheet for Amazon.com, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we can see that \"Accounts payable\" is listed under \"Current Liabilities.\" However, the exact amount for accounts payable in 2017 is not provided in the image description. \n\nFrom text quote [2], we learn about changes in revenue recognition, but this does not directly relate to DPO.

This is reflected in the bar chart (image1), which shows that 53% of Latino registered voters prefer a Democratic candidate, compared to 28% for the Republican, with 18% undecided. This indicates a consistent preference for the Democratic Party among Latino voters.\n\n[7] Latinos’ party affiliation little changed in recent years [7], as evidenced by the data in image1, which shows that the percentage of Latino voters identifying with or leaning toward the Democratic Party has remained relatively stable over time. However, there is a notable difference between those who identify as Democrats or lean Democratic and those who identify as Republicans or lean Republican, with the former showing a much stronger preference for the Democratic Party.\n\n[4] Even so, Latino registered voters’ future party affiliation remains uncertain. A 2021 Pew Research Center study found that many Latino voters have soft ties to the political parties, indicating that while they may currently lean Democratic, their future alignment could shift [4]. This uncertainty is also reflected in the data from image1, where a significant portion of Latino voters are undecided or prefer another candidate.\n\n[6] Among Latino registered voter Democrats and Latino independents who lean Democratic, more liberals (36%) than conservatives and moderates (21%) say they have given a lot of thought to the elections. Among Latino voters who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, the data is less clear, indicating that while some may be considering the elections, others may not be as engaged [6].\n\n[8] Meanwhile, abortion has risen the most in importance as a voting issue among Hispanics in recent months, a shift that comes after the Supreme Court’s decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion in the United States. Nearly six-in-ten Hispanic voters (57%) say the issue is very important, up from 42% in March [8]. This change in perception is also reflected in the data from image3, which shows that the importance of abortion has increased significantly from March to August.\n\n[5] The views of Latino voters have received widespread news coverage leading up to the 2022 midterm elections. Latino voters are the nation’s second-largest group of eligible voters and are among its fastest-growing voter blocks. In 2022, nearly 35 million Latinos will be eligible to vote, accounting for 14% of the nation’s eligible voters [9]. This large and growing population means that their political preferences can have a significant impact on the outcome of elections.\n\n[10] The August 2022 survey finds about half of Latino registered voters (53%) say they would vote for or are leaning toward the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in their congressional district, compared with 28% who say they would vote for the Republican candidate. About one-in-five (18%) say they would vote for another candidate or are not sure who they would vote for [10]. This data is consistent with the findings in image1, which shows that a majority of Latino voters still prefer the Democratic Party, though a significant portion remain undecided.\n\n[11] % of Latino registered voters who say each issue is very important in making their decision about who to vote for in the 2022 congressional elections [11]. This is reflected in the data from image3, which shows that the economy is the top issue affecting their vote, followed by health care, education, violent crime, and gun policy.\n\n[12] % of Latino registered voters who identify with or lean toward the __ [12]. This is reflected in the data from image1, which shows that a significant portion of Latino voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, though there is also a substantial number who are undecided or prefer another candidate.\n\n![The bar chart illustrates the preferences of different voter demographic groups towards Democratic or Republican candidates](image1)\n\nThe data from image1 shows that Latino registered voters have a strong preference for the Democratic Party, though a significant portion remain undecided or prefer another candidate.

The image [image1] and the text [1] together indicate that 72% of Latinos believe their children will be better off financially, but [9] and [6] show that half of Latinos feel their family income is not keeping up. \n\nThe answer is: 5% of Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children, as indicated by the pie chart showing 72% feeling better off, but half of Latinos feel their family income is not keeping up with the cost of living."}

Indosat had 54.2 million subscribers and 29 million data users. \n\nFrom 2013 to late 2014, there is no direct data provided on the change in subscriber and data user numbers, but the trend in ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) from 2013 to 2017 shows a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, with Mobile Data ARPU initially declining and then increasing. This suggests that the growth in data usage may have contributed to an increase in ARPU over time. \n\nThe data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat indicate that Telkomsel had the highest number of data users, followed by XL and Indosat. This could indicate that Telkomsel was performing better in terms of data usage compared to the other two companies. \n\nThe subscriber numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat also indicate that Telkomsel had the highest number of subscribers, followed by XL and Indosat. This suggests that Telkomsel was the leading telecom provider in Indonesia during this period. \n\nThe combination of high subscriber numbers and data user numbers for Telkomsel suggests that it was performing well in terms of both market share and data usage. The data user numbers for XL and Indosat were lower than Telkomsel's, which could indicate that they were not as successful in attracting data users as Telkomsel was. \n\nThe overall trend in ARPU from 2013 to 2017 suggests that the growth in data usage may have contributed to an increase in ARPU over time. This indicates that the companies that were able to attract more data users may have been performing better in terms of revenue generation. \n\nIn conclusion, the subscriber and data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat from 2013 to late 2014 indicate that Telkomsel was the leading telecom provider in Indonesia during this period, with the highest number of subscribers and data users.

For instance, while the share of Republicans who say the loss of U.S. jobs to China poses a very serious problem increased by 14 percentage points, there was no significant change among Democrats. On issues where concern rose overall, increases tended to be especially steep among conservative Republicans. ![China Perceptions by Political Affiliation](image1)  \n[12] Negative views of China up substantially since 2018  \n\n[3] While negative feelings toward China have increased among both Republicans and Democrats, the size of the partisan gap has also grown since 2018. Today, 62% of Republicans feel “very cold” (0-24) toward China – up 31 points since 2018. In comparison, 38% of Democrats report “very cold” feelings, up 21 points over the same period. ![China Perceptions by Demographics](image2)  \n[9] Men (51%) are more likely than women (43%) to have “very cold” feelings toward China. A majority of those 50 and older (55%) have “very cold” opinions of China, whereas only 40% of those under 50 report the same. Americans with lower levels of education are more likely to feel “very cold” toward China: 51% of those who have not completed college feel this way, compared with 39% of those with at least a bachelor’s degree.  \n\n[10] Because of these mode differences, we fielded two different survey questions on the ATP this year. The first is a “feeling thermometer,” which asks people to evaluate their opinion of China on a 0 to 100 scale, where a rating of 51 or higher is “warm,” 50 is neutral and below 50 is “cold.” This question, which is the predominant focus of this report, was previously asked on the ATP in 2018 and 2016. Looking at these three points in time, we can see that the sharp increase in negative views of China that we have been documenting via our phone surveys is also evident via these online surveys. On this measure, those who say they are “cold” (0-49) toward China has increased from 46% in 2018 to 67% in 2021, or 21 percentage points.  \n\n[4] Today, 67% of Americans have “cold” feelings toward China on a “feeling thermometer,” giving the country a rating of less than 50 on a 0 to 100 scale. This is up from just 46% who said the same in 2018. ![Negative Views of China Over Time](image5)  \n[5] A majority of Americans have negative feelings toward China, up substantially since 2018. Respondents indicated their feelings using a “feeling thermometer” where a rating of zero degrees means they feel as cold and negative as possible, a rating of 100 degrees means they feel as warm and positive as possible, and a rating of 50 degrees means they don’t feel particularly positively or negatively toward China. Based on this, 67% of Americans today feel “cold” toward China (a rating of 0 to 49). This is up 21 percentage points from the 46% who said the same in 2018.  \n\n[7] Second, we also asked our traditional four-point favor ability question. Because of the mode differences previously identified, we decided that this number from the online survey was not directly comparable to the phone surveys previously conducted. But we want to “restart” this trend, beginning to measure it consistently on the ATP going forward, much as we have done so on the phone for the past 15 years. Results of this question indicate that a majority of Americans (76%) have an unfavorable view of China. This is consistent with the majority who say they are “cool” toward China on the feeling thermometer rating, though there are differences between the two measures due, in part, to the fact that the feeling thermometer has an explicit “neutral” category.  \n\n[11] % who rate China as __ on a feeling thermometer from 0 (coldest rating) to 100 (warmest rating)  \n[8] Nearly half (47%) of Americans feel “very cold” toward China – rating it below 25 on the same 100-point scale – which is around twice as many as said the same in 2018 (23%). Similarly, the share of Americans who give China the lowest possible rating of zero has nearly tripled, from 9% in 2018 to around a quarter (24%) in 2021.  \n\n[6] While most Americans have unfavorable views toward China, results of an open-ended question about China indicate that opinions can be multifaceted. Even among those who say have “cold” feelings toward China, there are instances where people report good and bad things.  \n\n[10] Looking at these three points in time, we can see that the sharp increase in negative views of China that we have been documenting via our phone surveys is also evident via these online surveys. On this measure, those who say they are “cold” (0-49) toward China has increased from 46% in 2018 to 67% in 2021, or 21 percentage points.  \n\nPerceptions toward China have significantly increased from 2018 to 2021 among different political affiliations in the U.S., with Republicans showing a more pronounced rise in negative sentiments compared to Democrats."}

According to image3, Rock has a stream share of 82%, while Pop has a stream share of 58%. This suggests that Rock music is more heavily driven by streaming compared to Pop. The higher stream share for Rock could indicate that Rock music is more popular in the streaming space, or that listeners are more likely to stream Rock music rather than purchase it. This could be due to the nature of Rock music, which is often associated with live performances and concerts, making it more suitable for streaming. In contrast, Pop music may have a more diverse consumption pattern, with a mix of album sales and streaming, leading to a lower stream share.

The decoder uses multi-headed self-attention and decoder-encoder attention mechanisms to process these queries, allowing the model to globally reason about all objects together using pairwise relations between them while being able to use the whole image as context [5]. \n\nThe object queries are also transformed into an output embedding by the decoder, which are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network. This process enables the DETR model to predict the final set of predictions in parallel, without the need for post-processing steps like non-maximum suppression [9]. \n\nThe use of object queries allows the DETR model to effectively localize and identify objects within the given scenes, with a particular emphasis on extremities to aid in accurate classification and localization [1]."}

As highlighted in the text quotes, **word-order information plays a vital role for sentiment analysis tasks** [2], yet **CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM** on sentiment analysis datasets, suggesting that **word-order information may be required for analyzing sentiment orientations** [7]. This is consistent with findings from Pang et al. (2002), who hypothesized that positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment. For instance, the phrase \"not really good\" and \"realy not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, while being different only by their word orderings. CNN and LSTM models can both capture this type of information via convolutional filters or recurrent transition functions.\n\n![Word-order information's effect on sentiment analysis](image3)\n\nHowever, the importance of word-order features varies across tasks. On the Yelp polarity dataset, **the results drop noticeably**, further suggesting that **word-order does matter for sentiment analysis** [11]. In contrast, **for the topic categorization and textual entailment problems, word-order information does not contribute significantly** [11]. This indicates that **word-order information is more crucial for sentiment analysis than for other tasks**.\n\nAdditionally, experiments where the training set was shuffled to remove word-order features showed that **LSTM models trained on shuffled training sets showed comparable accuracies to those trained on the original dataset**, indicating that **the main difference between LSTM and SWEM may be due to the ability of the former to capture word-order features** [12]. This aligns with the observation that **SWEM is less effective at extracting representations from short sentences than from long documents**, as word-order features tend to be more important in shorter texts [10].\n\nIn summary, **word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models**, as these models are capable of capturing such information through their architecture, which is essential for accurately predicting sentiment orientations."}

This cropping ensures that the model focuses on the specific objects that are relevant for recognition. Following this, the cropped region is resized to a fixed proportion, standardizing the input size for the image encoder. This step is essential for maintaining consistency in the input data, which is critical for effective feature extraction.\n\nAdditionally, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This blurring helps to direct the attention of the multimodal large language models (MLLMs) towards the relevant objects by reducing the visual complexity of the surrounding areas. By doing so, the blurring strategy enhances the model's ability to focus on the foreground objects, thereby improving the accuracy of zero-shot recognition.\n\nThese pre-processing steps are designed to align the input data with the requirements of the MLLMs, ensuring that the models can effectively utilize the retrieved information to make accurate predictions. The combination of cropping, resizing, and blurring not only prepares the images for efficient processing but also enhances the overall performance of the zero-shot recognition system."}

First, the dishwasher must be level for proper dish rack operation and wash performance [6]. This involves using a spirit level to check and adjust the three leveling legs individually.\n\nWhen loading dishes, it is important to follow the loading instructions carefully. Curved items or those with recesses should be loaded aslant so that water can run off. All utensils should be stacked securely and not tip over, and they should be placed in a way that allows the spray arms to rotate freely during washing [3]. Hollow items such as cups, glasses, pans, etc., should be loaded with the opening facing downwards to prevent water from collecting in the container. Dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other, and glasses should not touch one another to avoid damage [3].\n\nIt is recommended to load the lower basket first, then the upper one. The lower basket is suitable for large items and the most difficult to clean items, such as pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls. Serving dishes and lids should be placed on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm [12]. The maximum diameter advised for plates in front of the detergent dispenser is 19 cm to ensure the opening is not hampered [12].\n\n![Dishwasher rack with numbered guide indicating different dishware items](image2) [2]\n\nAdditionally, long and/or sharp items of cutlery, such as carving knives, must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket. Long bladed knives stored in an upright position are a potential hazard. It is also important not to overload the dishwasher, as this is crucial for good results and for reasonable consumption of energy [3].\n\nFinally, the warning sign indicates that non-compliance with the loading can result in poor washing quality [4].

This map also highlights areas like the Exploratorium museum and Ferry Terminal Plaza, as well as ferry routes to Alcatraz. The presence of numbered piers suggests that each pier has a distinct location and possibly a unique length of coastline.\n\nImage3 is a map of the Fisherman’s Wharf area, which includes Pier 39. This pier is known for its historic significance and is a popular tourist attraction. However, the text quote [4] mentions catching a ferry to Alcatraz from Pier 39, which could indicate that Pier 39 is a significant point on the waterfront.\n\nThe text quote [5] mentions Lombard Street leading to the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, where one can see what it was like to stow away on a schooner. This suggests that the area around Lombard Street is part of the waterfront and may be connected to several piers.\n\nConsidering the information from the image quotes, particularly image5, which shows piers numbered from 1 to 39 along The Embarcadero, it is likely that Pier 39 is one of the longer piers along the coast. However, without specific measurements or lengths provided in the quotes, it is challenging to definitively state which pier has the longest coastline. \n\n![Pier 39](image3)  \n![Waterfront Piers](image5)  \n\nThe pier with the longest coastline in San Francisco is likely Pier 39, given its prominence and the detailed mapping of the waterfront area."}

According to the text quotes, one of the key problems is that adoption barriers relate to management and culture, not data and technology [11]. This is further supported by image6, which highlights issues such as \"There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" at 52%, and \"We are too siloed by business line/product/brand\" at 46%. These statistics illustrate that siloed approaches and lack of unified ownership are significant challenges.\n\nAdditionally, image4 shows a list of business-related topics organized in colored blocks, indicating that customer experience and brand and market management are critical areas of focus. However, the effectiveness of these areas is hindered by the lack of a 360-degree view, where marketers and agencies often look at tactical metrics in isolation rather than considering a complete dashboard of all activities and customer behavior [2]. This fragmentation is also reflected in image1, where \"Seldom or Never a Factor\" is at 20%, \"Often a Factor\" at 32%, and \"Primary Factor\" at 11%, suggesting that many factors are not frequently considered in decision-making processes.\n\nMoreover, the text quotes emphasize the importance of measuring customer engagement, conversion, and satisfaction, which are crucial for effective customer management [11]. Image3 further supports this by showing that 52% of respondents attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, indicating a tendency to overattribute performance to the last click, which can skew marketing strategies and lead to ineffective resource allocation.\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include siloed structures, lack of unified ownership, and a focus on quantitative data over qualitative insights, as highlighted by the provided text and image quotes."}

They also provide support across various industries, helping organizations achieve their growth and transformation goals, as noted in [2].\n\nIn terms of office presence, employee numbers, and countries covered, we can infer from the image quotes that the organization has a significant global footprint. For instance, ![Offices 20, Countries 12, Employees 1914](image7) indicates that the company operates in 20 offices across 12 countries with 1914 employees. This suggests that both departments likely have a similar level of global presence, but the specific details might vary based on their operational needs and client base.\n\nWhile the exact numbers for each department are not provided in the text quotes, the image quotes suggest that the organization has a substantial international presence, which would be relevant for both Assurance and Consulting departments. However, the Consulting department might have a more diverse range of activities and client interactions, as indicated by the text quotes, which could influence their office distribution and employee count. \n\nIn summary, while both departments contribute to the organization's global operations, the Consulting department is likely involved in a broader range of client interactions and service offerings, which may affect their office presence, employee numbers, and countries covered."}

For instance, the principle of **Proximity** is evident as the letters are arranged in a way that suggests unity and connection, with the letter \"E\" depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together [10]. This arrangement helps the viewer perceive the letter as a single unit rather than separate components.\n\nThe principle of **Closure** is also demonstrated, where the \"G\" and \"E\" together create a perception of a closed shape or form, even though part of it is missing [11]. This reflects how our minds tend to fill in gaps to perceive completeness.\n\nAdditionally, the **Similarity** principle is shown through the letters \"T\" and \"A\" which share a similar striped pattern, indicating that we group them together based on visual similarity [10]. The **Continuity** principle is illustrated by the \"S\" following a continuous contour line, suggesting a smooth flow or pathway [3].\n\nThe **Pregnância (Prägnanz)** principle is evident in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A,\" which suggests that our perception tends towards seeing the simplest form [7].

In standard consumption economics, this is a key principle, where the first few hot dogs provide high utility, but as more are consumed, the utility drops, as shown in the table. For example, the first hot dog provides +10 utility, while the sixth provides -10 utility [8]. This is depicted in image1, where the utility from each hot dog decreases, and at 64 hot dogs, there's a dramatic jump to +5000 utility, suggesting a unique context or event [1].\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the dynamics can shift. The cumulative effect of focus may be beneficial, as seen in the case of athletes at larger schools who can hone their abilities through focused, directed practice [7]. This is also reflected in the behavioral economics series outline, which discusses how focus and intentional practice can lead to improved outcomes [5]. Image6 shows a line graph illustrating the accumulated practice hours of violinists, highlighting early divergence among different groups, indicating that focused practice leads to significant differences in skill levels over time.\n\nIn competition, the emphasis on focus and intentional practice can override the diminishing marginal utility seen in standard consumption scenarios. As noted in the text, \"In competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be good...\" [9], suggesting that in competitive settings, the value of continued practice and focused effort can lead to substantial improvements and even exceptional outcomes, as seen in the image of the person holding a large tray of hot dogs, tied for a championship [1].

According to [4], the process involves tracking how many of your MQLs convert into SALs, which is a key step in the lead-to-sale journey.\n\nIn [7], it is mentioned that the ratio of search engine delivered visitors to search terms is an important metric, but this is more related to SEO and less directly to the conversion rate from MQL to SAL. However, the importance of optimizing for long-tail keywords can indirectly affect the quality of MQLs, thus influencing the conversion rate.\n\nLooking at [8], there is detailed data on engagement rates across different channels, which could be relevant as higher engagement might lead to better-qualified MQLs. The engagement rates for search (24%) are notably higher than display tactics (19.66%), suggesting that leads generated through search might be more qualified, potentially leading to higher conversion rates from MQL to SAL.\n\n[9] provides insight into how each keyword drives traffic, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns that generate MQLs. If a keyword has a high number of visitors per keyword, it might indicate a more effective campaign, possibly resulting in higher-quality MQLs and thus a higher conversion rate to SAL.\n\n[10] discusses lead scoring, which is a method used to determine the sales readiness of a lead. This process helps in identifying which MQLs are most likely to convert into SALs, thereby affecting the conversion rate.\n\n[11] highlights the importance of tracking customer behavior and the impact of user-generated content (UGC) on purchasing decisions. This can influence the quality of MQLs, as leads that engage with UGC might be more likely to convert into SALs.\n\n[12] presents the Lead Funnel Progression, which includes the conversion from MQL to SAL. The data shows that the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50% according to [4], which is relatively low. This suggests that while many leads are qualified as MQLs, only a small percentage are accepted by sales, indicating a need for improvement in the qualification process or the quality of the MQLs.\n\n![Conversion Rates](image7)  \nThis image illustrates cross-industry average conversion rates at various stages of the sales funnel, including the conversion from MQL to SAL, which is shown to be 45-75%. This range indicates that while the conversion rate from MQL to SAL can vary significantly across industries, it is generally higher than the 1.50% observed in [4], suggesting that the data in [4] might be specific to a particular context or industry.\n\nThe differences in conversion rates from MQL to SAL across different datasets can be attributed to various factors such as the quality of the MQLs, the effectiveness of the lead scoring process, and the overall efficiency of the sales team in accepting and working with qualified leads. A higher conversion rate indicates that the marketing efforts are effectively generating high-quality leads that are ready for sales, whereas a lower conversion rate may suggest issues with lead qualification or sales readiness."}
