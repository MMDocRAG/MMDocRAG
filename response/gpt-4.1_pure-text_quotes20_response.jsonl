By 2015, the share saying Islam encourages violence had nearly doubled to 45%, while 46% said it did not, reflecting a polarization of opinion over the years.

For instance, about three-quarters of conservative Republicans believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence, whereas a similar proportion of liberal Democrats say it is not [4], and white evangelical Protestants (closely aligned with Republican positions) are the highest among religious groups to hold this view [9]. Notably, the divide within parties has grown, and the perception among liberals that Islam is more violent has decreased in recent years [10].\n\nIn summary, the perception that Islam encourages violence more than other religions has grown over time, especially among Republicans, while Democrats have become less likely to share this belief, leading to a historic partisan divide."}

Only 32% of Democrats prioritized cooperation, a substantial decline from 2008, indicating a dramatic shift toward confrontation over collaboration[1]. On the Republican side, more than half (53%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters wanted Trump to work with Democratic leaders, but support for appointing the opposing party to key positions was far lower than in 2008[5][9].\n\n![Obama voters in 2008 widely supported appointing Republicans; far fewer Trump voters favored Democrats in his cabinet in 2016.](image5)\n\nThis growing polarization is mirrored in public perception of election campaigns: 2016 had a record-high 92% of voters saying there was more “mudslinging” than past elections—a 20-point jump from 2004—suggesting that heightened negativity may have fueled adversarial expectations about governing[7].\n\n![2016 saw record-high perceptions of campaign mudslinging, signaling a negative and polarized climate.](image1)\n\nIn summary, in 2008, voters—regardless of party—largely favored bipartisanship and expected political leaders to work with the new president.

The extraordinarily harsh judgments of the parties, press, and pollsters indicate that the toxic atmosphere of the campaign eroded trust and respect across the political landscape[4][10]. This environment left most voters viewing the election as unusually divisive and “one to forget,” and suggested broad dissatisfaction not just with the tenor of the campaign, but with all major institutions involved.\n\nIn summary, widespread voter perceptions of negativity in the 2016 election were intimately linked to the very low grades that political entities received for their roles in the campaign."}

Immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks, there was broad support for strong anti-terror policies, but the focus began shifting in the following years. According to recent surveys, Americans are now much more likely to say their primary concern is that the government's anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%)—a reversal from sentiments observed in 2013 following the Snowden disclosures, when more people worried about lost civil liberties than about insufficient protection [1][12]. \n\nThis shift is visibly chronicled in the following graph, which shows how, since 2004, concern about insufficient anti-terror efforts has overtaken worry over civil liberty restrictions, with the lines crossing around 2010-2011. By 2015, a majority prioritize more protection over civil liberties:\n\n![Concern that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough has overtaken fear of excessive civil liberties restrictions](image1)\n\nHowever, this broad worry about insufficient government action is accompanied by declining assessments of the government’s effectiveness. The share of Americans rating the government’s efforts to reduce terrorism as \"not at all well\" or \"not too well\" has risen to 52%—the highest since 2001—with positive ratings having dropped sharply from earlier in the year [2]. This dissatisfaction spans the political spectrum, but is particularly pronounced among Republicans: only 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing well, compared to 63% at the start of the year. Democrats and independents have also grown more critical, but not to the same extent [3].\n\nChange over time also looks different by political group. Recent years have seen both Republicans and Democrats grow more likely to say that anti-terror policies don’t go far enough, but Republicans have shifted much more strongly—in 2015, 71% of Republicans said their greater concern was inadequacy, a dramatic increase from previous years:\n\n![Republicans have become far more likely than Democrats or Independents to say anti-terror policies don’t go far enough](image2)\n\nDemocrats are somewhat divided: 54% now say they are more concerned about insufficient policies, up from previous years as well, but a substantial portion still worries about civil liberties [5][8]. Liberal Democrats, in particular, are evenly split between the two concerns (41% vs 41%) [8].\n\nPublic opinion also diverges significantly by age. Older adults are much more likely than younger adults to say the government isn’t doing enough to protect the country, while those under 30 are more split between concerns about security and civil liberties [6][8]. Survey data shows that 71% of those 65 and older worry policies haven’t gone far enough, while just 15% of this age group worries about excessive restrictions on civil liberties.

Meanwhile, those with more education (postgraduate degrees) are more likely to rate the government's performance positively [9], highlighting that perceptions also differ by educational attainment.\n\nIn summary: Over time, Americans’ concern has shifted from civil liberties toward a belief that anti-terrorism efforts have not gone far enough.

However, older Americans show a much stronger preference for increased anti-terror efforts—71% of adults 65 and over say policies have not gone far enough, dwarfing the 15% concerned about civil liberties.

However, the divide narrows when predicting the campaign's ultimate success: solid majorities of Democrats (72%), independents (62%), and Republicans (65%) believe the campaign will ultimately succeed[2].

Issues like terrorism, ISIS, and national defense are consistently ranked higher by Republicans, further reflecting the partisan basis for attitudes toward Muslim scrutiny. ![Republicans prioritize terrorism and security as a national problem much more than Democrats](image4)\n\nIn summary, Republicans—especially conservatives—are more likely than other groups to support greater scrutiny of Muslims, a stance linked with their much higher concern about terrorism and national security, while Democrats, young people, minorities, and the highly educated are more likely to reject such scrutiny."}

In December 2015, 29% of Americans identified terrorism, national security, or ISIS as the most important problem facing the country, compared to just 4% the year before. The specific mention of terrorism alone jumped from 1% to 18% in the same period, reflecting heightened concern likely stemming from contemporary global and domestic events. Meanwhile, economic concerns have receded, with only 23% now naming them as an important issue—the lowest in eight years. This dramatic increase in worries about terrorism and national security is evident across demographic and political groups, although the intensity of concern and responses to government action differ markedly by age, education, and partisan affiliation[2][10].\n\n![Public concern for terrorism and security has surpassed economic issues, rising sharply since 2014.](image8)\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating the government’s performance in reducing the threat of terrorism, American ratings have dropped to their lowest point since 2001.

This trend is echoed consistently across demographic and political lines[12].\n\n![Approval ratings for government anti-terror efforts have declined among all demographic and political groups.](image6)\n\nDifferences are striking among demographic groups. Older Americans (50 and above) and those with less education are more likely to give the government negative ratings; for instance, 57% of older adults say the government is not doing well, compared to only 46% of those aged 18-29. In fact, younger adults are more likely than older adults to have a favorable assessment of the government's efforts (53% positive among 18-29s vs. 42% among those over 50). Similarly, a postgraduate education correlates with more positive ratings (58% favorable) compared to lower educational attainment (44% among those with less than a bachelor’s degree)[1][3][9][11].\n\n![Older, less educated Americans are more critical, while younger and highly educated are more favorable to government anti-terror actions.](image3)\n\nThere are also pronounced partisan divides. Republicans are especially likely to see terrorism and national security as top concerns (41% cite these issues) versus independents (28%) and Democrats (23%)[6]. Democrats remain the only group with a majority still expressing confidence in the government’s counterterrorism efforts (64% in late 2015, down from 85% earlier), while Republican approval has fallen drastically: just 27% now rate government performance positively, a steep drop from 63% at the year's start. Independents also show a similar downward trend. These divides reflect broader patterns of trust and criticism that run along party lines[12].\n\n![Republicans consistently express lower approval ratings of government leadership, while Democrats retain higher confidence.](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, since 2014, concern about terrorism has dramatically increased while public confidence in the government’s ability to address it has fallen, particularly among older, less educated, and Republican individuals, while younger, more educated, and Democratic groups tend to view government efforts more favorably, though even among these groups, optimism has declined recently."}

Four-in-ten Republicans (41%) mention terrorism, defense, national security, or ISIS as top concerns, compared with just 23% of Democrats. Independents fall in between at 28%[9]. This gap is echoed in specific issues: 14% of Republicans name immigration as the most important problem, compared to 3% of Democrats, while Democrats are more likely to mention partisan gridlock and division in the country (8% vs. 2% of Republicans)[8]. \n\nThe emphasis on terrorism is further illustrated visually, where the net percentage of Republicans prioritizing terrorism, ISIS, and national security is markedly higher (46%) than that of Democrats (22%), resulting in a striking 24-point Republican advantage in concern over these issues. In contrast, economic concerns are somewhat more evenly distributed or even favored by Democrats, but the partisan gap is much narrower in these categories.[7]\n\n![Bar chart shows Republicans are much more likely to prioritize terrorism and national security than Democrats.](image7)\n\nAdditionally, Republicans display greater skepticism about the government’s effectiveness in reducing the terrorist threat, with only 27% rating its performance as very or fairly well, a substantial decline from earlier in the year. Meanwhile, 64% of Democrats retain a positive assessment, though this has also declined[6]. This negativity among Republicans about government action on terrorism is reflected in approval trends over time shown in survey data, where Republican approval has fallen steeply compared to steadier Democratic attitudes during the same period.\n\n![Line graph illustrates partisan difference in government approval ratings, with Republican approval plummeting over time.](image1)\n\nAttitude differences also extend to preferred approaches: while 72% of Republicans believe overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism, 66% of Democrats believe relying too much on force creates more hatred and leads to further terrorism, highlighting a fundamental division in worldviews[4].\n\nWhen it comes to economic problems, the partisan divide is less stark, though still present. While both parties express concern over economic issues, the percentage prioritizing these is closer across groups. Democrats may give somewhat more weight to some domestic and economic issues such as gridlock, unemployment, or the general economy, but these do not dominate their list of priorities nearly as much as terrorism does for Republicans[8]. \n\nIn summary: Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to view terrorism and national security as top problems, favor tougher anti-terrorism policies, and view the government’s efforts more critically, while economic issues are somewhat more evenly prioritized between the parties, with less dramatic partisan gaps."}

The general trend, as seen in the line graph, shows that the percentage of people—many of them independents—with unfavorable views of both the Republican and Democratic parties rose from about 6% in 1994 to 12% by 2018, while the share of those favoring both parties declined from 32% to 17% over the same period.

While all age groups now have predominantly unfavorable views of China, older Americans (50 and over) are markedly more negative (81%) compared to those aged 30-49 (71%) and under 30 (56%)[6][7]. Over the years, older adults have shown the most dramatic increase—rising from 34% unfavorable in 2005 to 81% by 2020, whereas young adults’ unfavorable ratings grew from 26% to 56% in the same period:\n![Older adults show the most dramatic increase in unfavorable views, reaching 81% in 2020.](image2)\n\nBar charts show these disparities more concretely: 83% of Republicans/Lean Republicans and 81% of those aged 50+ harbor unfavorable views, whereas the numbers are lower among Democrats (68%) and those under 30 (56%).\n![High levels of unfavorable views are seen among older adults and Republicans; younger adults and Democrats are less negative.](image7)\n\nThis political and generational gap extends to specific issues, such as China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

In both countries, these views are shaped by clear partisan divides: U.S. Republicans and German CDU/CSU supporters are most likely to favor increased spending, whereas Democrats and Green supporters are more skeptical."}

The median household income for Hispanic families remained stagnant from the Great Recession forward, sitting at $42,500 in 2014—far below the $53,700 median for all U.S. households. In addition, the Hispanic poverty rate in 2014, at 23.6%, was still considerably higher than the national average of 14.8%. Wealth disparities are even greater: by 2013, median household wealth for Hispanics dropped to just $13,700 compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households [5].

For example, in 2015, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 6.4%, ending higher than the 4.8% rate among non-Hispanic workers. Despite noticeable post-recession improvement—Hispanic unemployment declined from a 2010 peak of 12.8% to 6.4% in 2015—the gap between the two groups persisted throughout the entire period. Even during economic expansions, the Hispanic rate never dropped as low as that of non-Hispanics, and only in rare periods did both groups reach their lowest respective rates simultaneously. ![Hispanic unemployment rates remain above those of non-Hispanics, even as both have improved since the recession](image8) These differences in employment opportunity have contributed to ongoing disparities in overall financial well-being.\n\nWhen it comes to economic perceptions, Hispanics have often reported greater optimism than the general public, despite facing more challenging absolute conditions. Surveys reveal that a higher share of Hispanics rate current and future economic conditions positively compared to whites—35% of Hispanics versus 25% of whites rated national economic conditions as good or excellent in 2015, and 34% of Hispanics expected the economy to improve, about twice the rate among whites[5]. This optimism is also apparent in the high expectations Hispanics hold for upward mobility for their children. Seventy-two percent of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially than themselves.[4] ![A large 72% of Latinos expect their children will be better off financially than they are](image1)\n\nHowever, these positive perceptions contrast sharply with actual economic indicators. Median Hispanic household income in 2014 was $42,500, noticeably lower than the U.S. median of $53,700. The poverty rate for Hispanics stood at 23.6%—significantly higher than the 14.8% rate for all households. Wealth disparities are even starker: median household wealth for Hispanics in 2013 was only $13,700, compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households. Not only are these figures much lower for Hispanic families, but Hispanic household wealth also continued to decline after the recession, whereas White households saw some recovery.[2] ![Latinos experience lower incomes and higher poverty and wealth disparities compared to the U.S. overall](image2)\n\nThese patterns demonstrate that, while Hispanics are more optimistic about economic mobility and the national economic climate, this optimism exists alongside—and perhaps in response to—persistent, significant gaps in material outcomes. Unemployment rates that remain elevated for Hispanics relative to non-Hispanics contribute to higher poverty and lower wealth. Yet, Hispanic communities continue to display strong positive attitudes toward the future, particularly regarding their children, reflecting both resilience and the hope for continued socioeconomic gains.\n\nIn short: Although Hispanic unemployment rates are consistently higher and income and wealth disparities persist compared to non-Hispanics, Hispanics express greater optimism about current economic conditions and their children’s future."}

For instance, 29% of men say they more often see people being mean or bullying, compared to 19% of women; similarly, men are almost twice as likely as women to notice deceptiveness (24% versus 13%). In contrast, women are somewhat more likely than men to observe kind or supportive behavior (24% vs. 17%) and are also most inclined to report an equal mix of both positive and negative behaviors (56% vs. 52% for men)![Differences in men’s and women’s perceptions of online behavior.](image4)[1][3][6].\n\nThis pattern extends to perceptions around misinformation: while both genders commonly see a mix of deception and correction, men again lean more toward noticing deceptiveness, while women are more likely to see efforts to point out inaccurate information or experience a balanced mix. As a result, the social environment women report tends to seem slightly more supportive and collaborative, while men are more attuned to adversarial or contentious tones.\n\nGiven these perceptual differences, social media platforms have an opportunity—and arguably a responsibility—to tailor the ways they recommend content or display advertisements. Knowing that men anticipate and perceive more hostile or deceptive environments, platforms could offer men additional tools to filter out aggressive content, flag deceptive posts, or suggest content aimed at fostering support and constructive engagement. Conversely, since women tend to experience a more supportive network, platforms might focus on amplifying community-building features, highlighting kind and helpful content, and providing easy access to correction or informative initiatives.\n\nSuch adaptations could also influence how advertising and recommendations are perceived, especially as users’ comfort with platforms’ use of personal data varies by both context and demographic. Initiatives meant to reduce negativity and promote accuracy could not only improve user experience but also shape attitudes toward targeted recommendations, particularly if they are seen to support transparency and well-being.\n\nIn summary, men tend to perceive more deception and hostility, while women more often notice support and correction efforts; these gender-based differences suggest social media platforms can personalize users’ experiences by tuning recommendations, filtering systems, and community features accordingly."}

Overall, users generally feel more comfortable with their data being harnessed for recommending local events and significantly less so for political messaging. Yet, acceptance levels often diminish with increasing age, showing generational divides in attitudes toward data use.\n\nYounger adults are notably more accepting of platforms using their data to suggest connections with people they might want to know. Nearly two-thirds of social media users under 50 approve of this application, a view shared by fewer than half of those aged 65 or older[1][4]. This disparity is equally visible regarding data-driven product advertising, where around 54–60% of those aged 18–49 approve, versus only 39% of those over 65. When it comes to recommendations for local events, acceptance is strong across all ages but peaks among younger cohorts—ranging from 67% in the oldest group to 80% among those in their thirties and forties.\n  \n![Younger users are more accepting of data use for recommendations and ads than older users.](image3)\n\nDiscomfort grows as the purpose moves from social or commercial recommendations to political messaging. Here, disapproval is widespread and fairly consistent, though it too declines somewhat among younger age groups; only 31% of those over 65 and approximately 38–40% of younger adults find it acceptable for platforms to use their data to target political campaign messages[3][8]. This reflects a broader context-dependent wariness: while three-quarters of all users are fine with data being used for event recommendations, that number drops sharply if data is used for political messaging[6][12].\n\nDetailed breakdowns show that:\n- 75% of users are comfortable with their data being used to recommend events, but only 37% are comfortable if it’s used for political campaign messages[6].\n- Social media users are not only less accepting of political messaging but are also broadly critical of other platform practices involving personal data, especially when treated unevenly across different users[3].\n- Even for relatively benign uses such as product ads or friend suggestions, acceptance is mixed, with substantial portions of each age group expressing discomfort—underscoring the heavily context-dependent nature of user trust in data practices[5][9].\n\nFor example, one chart illustrates that 25% of users find it \"very acceptable\" for their data to be used for event recommendations, compared with just 7% who feel the same about political ads.

This suggests substantial skepticism about equitable treatment, even if the tool seems usable for its intended commercial purpose[8][11].\n\nThe trend is quite different for automated scoring of people up for parole. Here, perceptions of fairness (50%) and effectiveness (49%) are nearly identical, indicating a closer alignment between the tool's perceived functionality and its moral acceptability. Systems like automated resume screening and video job interview analysis also exhibit smaller gaps—effective/fair differences of 4 and 6 percentage points respectively—yet both struggle to earn a majority’s trust as fair or effective[8].\n\n![A bar chart shows the public sees the biggest fairness-effectiveness gap for personal finance scores, with effectiveness at 54% and fairness at 32%; other systems show smaller gaps, e.g., criminal risk scores are equally seen as fair and effective.](image8)\n\nThe fact that the personal finance score draws such a pronounced fairness-effectiveness divide highlights how people may accept an algorithm as \"doing its job,\" but still reject it on ethical or social grounds. Concerns around privacy, bias, and inability to recognize individual circumstances are commonly cited reasons for finding these tools unfair—even when their practical output is recognized as effective[6][7][9].\n\nBroadly, none of the automated systems evaluated is considered fair by a majority, and in cases like personal finance scoring and video job analysis, fewer than one-third see them as fair to those being judged[4][2]. Conversely, just under half to a slim majority frequently see them as effective, reinforcing a persistent public wariness about the moral underpinnings of algorithmic decisions and suggesting that effectiveness alone is not enough to earn trust.\n\nThis wariness is further reflected in high \"unacceptable\" ratings for many algorithmic processes: for example, 68% find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable and 67% say the same of video job interview analysis. Those who question these systems typically raise issues of privacy, discrimination, and the loss of human judgment in complex decisions[2][6][7].\n\n![The chart shows most adults find automated personal finance scores, video job analysis, resume screening, and criminal risk scores unacceptable, with unacceptable responses ranging from 56% to 68%.](image2)\n\nIn summary, while some Americans acknowledge the potential effectiveness of automated decision-making systems, widespread doubts about their fairness signify a significant trust gap. This suggests that public acceptance is not simply a matter of utility, but rests fundamentally on whether these systems are seen as just and respectful of individual rights. Thus, differences in perceived fairness and effectiveness reveal the importance of transparency, oversight, and ethical safeguards for building public trust."}

Over time, both groups have reported rising optimism, but Republicans have shown a larger increase—from 58% in October 2017 to 71% by 2019, while Democrats rose from 47% to 53% in the same period[6][11]. This enduring partisan gap suggests that individuals' economic perceptions are closely tied to their political affiliation, and these perceptions often track broader views of the economy’s direction and recent leadership changes[12].\n\nLooking at survey data, the contrast is evident: 71% of Republicans/Lean Rep say jobs are plentiful, while only 53% of Democrats/Lean Dem agree. When considering the availability of \"good jobs,\" the gap widens further—with only 39% of Democrats/Lean Dem reporting an abundance, compared to 58% of Republicans/Lean Rep. The majority of Democrats, 55%, say good jobs remain hard to find[5].\n\n![Republicans see more job availability than Democrats, both for ordinary and “good” jobs.](image5)\n\nTrends over time reinforce this story. In 2001, the perception that \"jobs are difficult to find\" was prevalent but began a steep decline after peaking during the 2009 recession. As the economy recovered, the share saying \"plenty of jobs available\" climbed, with 2019 marking the first time a clear majority of 60% saw jobs as plentiful—a shift also reflected within each party, though consistently higher among Republicans[6][11].\n\n![Public optimism about job availability has reached its highest point since 2001, particularly after the 2009 recession.](image6)\n\nIn summary, while both Republicans and Democrats have grown more positive about local job availability, Republicans are notably more optimistic than Democrats, and the partisan gap in perceptions has remained persistent even as overall optimism rises."}

This divide is visualized clearly in a bar chart illustrating that 62% of Republicans attribute rising case numbers to increased testing, while 80% of Democrats attribute it to increased infections ![Democrats overwhelmingly say more new infections drive rising case counts, Republicans cite more testing](image3).\n\nThese beliefs correspond closely to opinions about the pace of lifting restrictions. Most Democrats (82%) say that restrictions have been lifted too quickly, seeing this as a predominant factor in the continuation of the outbreak. In sharp contrast, only 31% of Republicans share this concern, with a similarly sized share (32%) saying that rapid lifting is not at all a cause of rising cases [4][11]. The bar chart further illustrates that 82% of Democrats/Lean Democrats view quick lifting of restrictions as a major reason for the outbreak, versus just 31% of Republicans/Lean Republicans ![Democrats see lifting restrictions too quickly as a key reason for rising cases, Republicans much less so](image8).\n\nThe alignment continues in overall concern: nearly seven-in-ten Americans are more concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly (69%), but this masks stark differences, with Republicans more split (53% think restrictions not lifted quickly enough, 45% say too quickly), while Democrats are overwhelmingly concerned about quick lifting (93% of liberals, 88% of conservatives/moderates) [1][2][6][7]. These patterns are shown in a demographic chart, where most Republicans/Lean Republicans are less concerned about lifting too quickly, compared to Democrats/Lean Democrats ![Majority in most groups—especially Democrats—believe restrictions were lifted too quickly](image2).\n\nIn summary, Republicans often attribute rising case counts to more testing and are less likely to see quick lifting of restrictions as a problem. Conversely, Democrats primarily see more infections as the cause and strongly believe that restrictions were lifted too soon, contributing to the sustained outbreak.\n\nSo, beliefs about the cause of increased COVID-19 cases and concerns about lifting restrictions both neatly follow partisan lines, with Republicans more likely to downplay the dangers of reopening and attribute rising cases to more testing, while Democrats believe the opposite."}

Equally, 39% point to a lack of encouragement for girls to pursue STEM from an early age. Balancing work and family in STEM jobs is also a significant concern (33%). Other contributing factors include a lack of female role models, a perception that they are less likely to succeed, and a belief (among some) that women are just less interested in STEM than men.

However, there is a visible difference in the proportions: while apparel is consistently a top choice, shoes and bags are more commonly purchased in stores (56.4% and 17%) than online (20.2% and 20%). Online, watches, airline tickets, and cosmetics see increased shares compared to their offline stats, suggesting some product categories translate more readily to digital commerce. Notably, shopping online is still less frequent compared to offline; products like books and mobile phones also show much higher purchase rates offline ![Apparel is the top item purchased both online and offline, but offline shopping is much more prevalent overall](image4).\n\nThis comparison highlights that while Indonesians spend a considerable amount of mobile internet time on entertainment and social media, online shopping does not occupy a proportionally large share of their digital activities. Instead, shopping—though important—remains a secondary usage, with digital commerce growth likely influenced by the rising comfort levels and trust in purchasing products like apparel, bags, and cosmetics online.\n\nIn summary, social and entertainment activities drive mobile internet usage in Indonesia, while shopping is a significant but smaller portion of online activities, despite apparel leading both online and offline purchases."}

Evidence across datasets like PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT indicates that most commonly used active querying approaches—such as Entropy, Margin, VAAL, and even some deep active learning methods—tend to develop a biased selection. This bias means they often select data from only a few classes, particularly favoring majority classes and neglecting minorities, leading to poor label diversity in queries[1][4][6].\n\nFor example, on the PathMNIST dataset, the VAAL method largely prefers selecting data from the muscle class, almost completely ignoring minority classes such as mucus and mucosa. This skewed distribution is visually apparent, showing much lower entropy (a measure of label diversity) than more uniform strategies. The result is even more extreme in highly imbalanced datasets (such as CIFAR-10-LT), where most strategies fail to acquire samples from all classes even with larger query budgets[1][10]. Random sampling, in contrast, tends to reflect the underlying class distribution more faithfully and thus achieves higher label diversity[1][7].\n\nReferencing the performance graphs below, the Random strategy achieves the highest entropy (i.e., diversity), while VAAL has the lowest, highlighting its strong tendency for label bias:\n\n![VAAL and other biased querying strategies select samples disproportionately from majority classes, leading to the lowest label diversity; Random achieves the most balanced class distribution.](image7)\n\nAdditionally, in medical datasets such as OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST, VAAL and similar methods excessively target certain classes but ignore others, such as lung, liver, and monocyte in OrganAMNIST, and certain blood cell types in BloodMNIST[6]. This lack of coverage is especially problematic when label diversity is crucial for robust model generalization.\n\nUltimately, methods like VAAL (and, to a lesser degree, Entropy and Margin) demonstrate the poorest label diversity across all considered datasets, repeatedly selecting imbalanced class distributions and neglecting minority representation[4][6][12].\n\nIn summary: Among the various querying criteria, VAAL generally yields the worst label diversity on all the datasets."}

An embedding of the previous system dialogue act is also maintained, enabling the system to be aware of its prior actions during the conversation.\n\nThese two vectors—the encoded user utterance and the previous system act encoding—are combined as inputs to a dialogue-level LSTM. This LSTM maintains the evolving state of the dialogue across turns, serving as a memory that summarizes the user's goals and context up to the current moment[3]. The dialogue state, represented continuously in the LSTM, is then used by the dialogue state tracker to update its beliefs about the user’s objectives, mapping them to slot-value pairs relevant to the specific task, such as date, time, or movie name[10].\n\nNext, a query can be constructed based on the output of the state tracker, and this query is sent to an external knowledge base to retrieve additional required information, with the results encoded for further use[3]. The system’s policy network then analyzes the current dialogue state, slot value logits, and the query results encoding to decide on the most appropriate system action at this turn—this could be asking for more details, confirming a slot, or providing the requested information[12].\n\nOnce the system action is chosen, it is mapped to a dialogue act with corresponding slot types and candidate values. Finally, a template-based natural language generator is used to convert these acts into a coherent system response, replacing template tokens with actual values from either the detected user goals or retrieved KB entities, resulting in natural-sounding system output[6].\n\nThe following diagram visually summarizes this flow:\n![A detailed diagram showing the architecture of an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system, from user input through encoders, dialogue state tracking, policy, to natural language generation.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response to the user's request by encoding the utterance, tracking dialogue state, selecting an appropriate system action via a policy network, and generating a natural language response based on the action and retrieved information."}

As observed, the emissions for training models such as BERT on GPUs are reported to be roughly equivalent to making a trans-American flight (from New York to San Francisco and back) per person [4].

This approach identifies samples based on their contrastiveness in the learned feature space using pseudo-labels, ensuring strong label diversity and representation, especially in imbalanced datasets [3][8].\n\nEmpirical results across medical (PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST) and natural image datasets (CIFAR-10-LT) reveal that hard-to-contrast strategies yield the highest or near-highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) and/or accuracy, markedly outperforming random and other standard methods.

Other notable reasons include mismatches in claim values and incorrect operation types[3].\n\nFor NEI claims, the primary issues are the lack of sufficient matching evidence in the provided tables (33.3%) and a dependence on open-domain (25.0%) or closed-domain (15.0%) knowledge outside what is directly available.

For example, many true Supported (26.8%) and Refuted (23.6%) claims are mislabeled as NEI. This distribution shows that InstructGPT favors the NEI category when uncertain, leading to a conservative prediction strategy and possibly missing valid claim verifications.\n\nConversely, GPT-4 is characterized by overconfidence. It rarely predicts NEI (for instance, only 0.4% of Supported and 0.1% of Refuted claims are assigned NEI), but frequently misclassifies NEI claims as Supported (10.3%) or Refuted (8.5%).

For instance, only 9.1% of claims that are truly supported are correctly labeled as such, while a significant 26.8% are incorrectly labeled as NEI. Similarly, 23.6% of refuted claims are also misclassified as NEI. This pattern indicates that InstructGPT errs on the side of caution, preferring to avoid a definitive stance when uncertain[1].\n\nIn contrast, the GPT-4 confusion matrix on the right demonstrates an \"overconfidence\" bias. GPT-4 is much more likely to classify NEI claims as either supported (10.3%) or refuted (8.5%) rather than as NEI (only 10.4% of true NEI claims are correctly labeled). For supported claims, GPT-4 correctly classifies a robust 32.1%, much higher than InstructGPT, but for NEI claims, this leads to a higher rate of misclassification into the more confident categories. This tendency corroborates that while GPT-4 excels at complex reasoning and extends its strengths to tabular data, it often fails to accurately recognize and label claims as unverifiable (NEI)[1].\n\n![InstructGPT is conservative, often guessing NEI, while GPT-4 is overconfident, misclassifying NEI as Supported or Refuted.](image3)\n\nThese behaviors speak to core challenges with the SCITAB dataset: distinguishing verifiable from unverifiable claims is difficult for both models. InstructGPT's conservative NEI bias means it is risk-averse, whereas GPT-4's overconfidence results in more definitive (but sometimes incorrect) categorizations[1]. This directly affects their measured macro-F1 scores: GPT-4 achieves considerably higher accuracy (64.80 in 3-class), reflecting its strong complex reasoning, but its errors are concentrated in NEI misclassifications[6].\n\nIn summary, InstructGPT makes more cautious, NEI-skewed errors, suggesting lower risk but frequent hesitancy, while GPT-4 is more accurate overall but tends to be overconfident in classifying unverifiable claims."}

This suggests a conservative or \"less confident\" approach, defaulting to NEI when unsure—a tendency potentially stemming from difficulty in verifying whether claims are directly addressable by the table data. In contrast, GPT-4 shows an overconfident pattern: it rarely predicts NEI (0.4% and 0.1% for supported/refuted, respectively) and instead mislabels many true NEI claims as either supported (10.3%) or refuted (8.5%), indicating a bias toward assigning verifiable labels even when evidence is insufficient. Thus, the challenge for InstructGPT lies in overuse of the NEI label when uncertain, while GPT-4 struggles to withhold judgment and underpredicts NEI, wrongly claiming to find sufficient information for classification[5] ![Confusion matrices reveal distinct error patterns: InstructGPT overpredicts NEI, while GPT-4 underpredicts NEI.](image7).\n\nA key source of these errors is the intrinsic difficulty of the NEI class: distinguishing between \"refuted\" and \"NEI\" is not straightforward, even for human annotators. The NEI label captures claims not verifiable from the available table, which may involve ambiguous, incomplete, or unstated information, further complicating the models' decision-making process[6]. This task complexity often reduces models' confidence, nudging predictions toward NEI for InstructGPT and away from NEI for GPT-4, reflecting their differing calibration in uncertainty[5][6].

As one or more knowledge elements are removed, both recall and precision experience a significant downward trend, though recall drops more steeply than precision. For example, when no knowledge is removed, precision is 30.1 and recall is 57.1. With one element removed, precision drops to 26.1 and recall to 42.5. With three elements removed, precision falls further to 16.3 and recall to 20.4, while F1-score drops similarly from 39.4 down to 18.1. These results are summarized in image2:\n\n![As more knowledge is removed, precision, recall, and F1-Score all drop, but recall declines more sharply.](image2)\n\nThis trend is also visualized in the retrieval analysis line graph, where decreasing retrieval accuracy (simulating missing or irrelevant knowledge) leads to lower scores across all three metrics, especially recall.

Overall, the principal bottleneck under incomplete knowledge is recall, not precision, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive knowledge retrieval and explicit absent knowledge handling in building reliable attribution systems for language models[1][10].\n\nIn summary: Removing knowledge elements primarily causes recall and F1-score to drop, while precision may slightly increase in some settings; these shifts reveal that models generally recognize missing knowledge but rely heavily on complete retrieval to achieve high recall and balanced citation quality."}

As the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 5, there is an evident improvement in Micro-F1 scores for both datasets; however, these gains plateau when the number of demonstrations grows further (≥10)[1]. This trend suggests diminishing returns from additional examples beyond a certain threshold.\n\nMore strikingly, incorporating logical constraints into model instructions leads to stable and notable improvements—this benefit is apparent across varying demonstration counts. The performance boost from logical constraints is particularly strong when the number of demonstrations is small: for instance, on MAVEN-ERE, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints (Micro-F1 25.7%) surpasses even 10 demonstrations without them (Micro-F1 24.5%)[1]. This shows that logical constraints not only directly support logical consistency but can also substitute for a larger number of demonstrations when those are limited.\n\n![Adding logical constraints increases Micro-F1 scores while increasing demonstration samples has diminishing returns; logical inconsistency decreases with multi-turn retrieval.](image1)\n\nQuantitative tables further confirm that applying logical constraints (either generatively, through retrieval, or via pre-training) enhances both Micro-F1 and logical consistency across a range of LLMs[3]. Post-processing with logical constraints can even achieve 0% logical inconsistency, while instruction-level logical constraints produce the best Micro-F1 scores[3].

Across a wide range of models—including Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2—the application of logical constraints directly within prompts or model instructions consistently lowers logical inconsistency while often boosting overall performance, as reflected in Micro-F1 scores. According to the evidence, adding logical constraints can bring substantial improvements; for example, the Micro-F1 on MAVEN-ERE for Llama2 rises from 21.5% to 27.3% and the LI drops from 8.1% to 2.0% with logical constraints incorporated, compared to vanilla CoT prompting[1]. A similar trend appears in Causal-TimeBank, with both Micro-F1 improvement and logical inconsistency reduction when using logical constraints.\n\n![Across models and datasets, incorporating logical constraints directly into prompts lowers LI significantly while improving Micro-F1, visualized here for Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2, on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank.](image3)\n\nPost-processing, on the other hand, can guarantee complete logical consistency (reducing LI to 0%), as noted in both textual analysis and empirical results[1]. However, this approach has notable drawbacks: it may degrade output quality by introducing answers that are semantically less faithful to the original intent or ground truth, often due to the random selection from candidate sets or additional ad hoc interventions. Moreover, while post-processing ensures no direct contradictions, it can negatively impact the informativeness or utility of the answer, unlike logical constraints that integrate consistent logic into the model’s actual reasoning process.\n\nThis contrast is visible in the results table for various models and configurations. For both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, employing post-processing leads to LI dropping to 0% across all models (Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2), but typically at the cost of a decrease in the Micro-F1 metric—sometimes noticeably so compared to when logical constraints are used directly[1].\n\n![Comparing Micro-F1 and LI per model and method, we see post-processing always achieves LI of 0% but sometimes reduces Micro-F1 relative to directly using logical constraints.](image1)\n\nA further breakdown with fine-tuned models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT confirms this pattern. The best results for logical inconsistency (again, 0%) are consistently achieved with post-processing, yet the peak Micro-F1 values are reached not with post-processing but with CoT and logical constraints. This suggests that logical constraints not only reduce inconsistency but keep or even improve task performance, while post-processing, despite perfect consistency, does not optimize overall answer quality[7].\n\n![For Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, post-processing achieves 0% LI, but highest Micro-F1 comes from CoT with logical constraints.](image7)\n\nIn summary, while both logical constraints and post-processing can reduce logical inconsistency across LLMs on datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, logical constraints provide the best balance between consistency and performance.

It enhances retrieval quality through methods such as pre-retrieval strategies (e.g., query rewriting, expansion, or routing) and post-retrieval techniques (e.g., reranking, summarization, and fusion). Additionally, it refines indexing using sliding windows, fine-grained segmentation, metadata, and other strategies to improve matching between queries and the database[1]. These optimizations lead to more relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate information being retrieved and supplied to the generative model, thereby improving the quality of answers generated[1].  \n![Advanced RAG introduces optimizations at pre- and post-retrieval stages, improving relevance and precision.](image5)\n\nThe Modular RAG paradigm further expands the adaptability and versatility of RAG by introducing modular components that can be swapped or reconfigured depending on the task or challenge at hand. Beyond a fixed pipeline, Modular RAG integrates specialized modules like search engines, vector databases, knowledge graphs, memory modules, and intelligent routing. It allows non-sequential and iterative processing, supporting advanced operations such as adaptive retrieval, query decomposition, dynamic reranking, and end-to-end training. This modularity enables the RAG system to address more complex and diverse tasks, ensuring higher flexibility, precision, and robustness across different scenarios[3][9][11].  \n![Modular RAG incorporates varied modules and dynamic processing flows to maximize retrieval and generative capability.](image5)\n\nIn summary, Advanced RAG improves upon Naive RAG by incorporating strategic pre- and post-retrieval optimizations that enhance relevance and retrieval quality, while Modular RAG further elevates the system by introducing modular, adaptive, and dynamically composable components to maximize flexibility and task performance."}

In this approach, retrieval is simple and direct, with little optimization or flexibility—the process just follows a Retrieve-Read framework[9][1]. ![Naive RAG relies on sequential steps: indexing, retrieval, and generation, with minimal optimization.](image4)\n\nAdvanced RAG builds upon this foundation by introducing several enhancements and optimizations in both pre-retrieval and post-retrieval stages. Before retrieval, it may modify or expand the user query through techniques like query rewriting or expansion. After retrieval, it can rerank or summarize the retrieved results, fuse information from multiple sources, or otherwise process the output for improved performance. These optimizations directly address challenges such as better indexing, improved retrieval quality, and leveraging more nuanced semantic similarity[10]. ![Advanced RAG introduces pre- and post-retrieval optimizations (like query expansion and reranking) for more effective document retrieval.](image4)\n\nModular RAG takes adaptability and flexibility to a new level. This framework incorporates multiple specialized modules tailored to various sub-tasks, such as routing, searching, iterative retrieval, predicting, rewriting, reranking, demonstrating, and fusion[6]. These modules can be dynamically arranged or even substituted based on the specific nature of a query or task. Modular RAG supports non-linear and adaptive retrieval flows, such as judging when retrieval is necessary and refining interactions between modules for enhanced synergy and integration with technologies like fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. This modularity enables the system to process a wider range of queries and downstream tasks, offering higher precision and flexibility than its predecessors[1][3][11]. ![Modular RAG uses flexible, module-based pipelines (e.g., routing, searching, adapting) to dynamically handle diverse tasks and scenarios.](image4)\n\nIn summary: Naive RAG uses a basic sequential retrieval and generation process, Advanced RAG optimizes retrieval and processing via enhancements at different stages, and Modular RAG employs configurable modules, dynamic flow, and adaptive strategies to maximize retrieval precision and flexibility."}

When assessing retrieval mechanisms for RAPTOR, controlled experiments showed that using the collapsed tree approach led to higher F1 scores than the tree traversal method, especially when the context length was set to 2000 tokens. The graph illustrates that the collapsed tree not only maintains superior F1 scores across a range of context lengths but also peaks at this optimal context size, whereas tree traversal lags behind at all points. This indicates that the collapsed tree provides more flexible and contextually appropriate retrieval, adapting the granularity of information for each question[3].\n\n![Collapsed tree retrieval achieves the highest F1 score at 2000 tokens, surpassing tree traversal at all tested context lengths.](image3)\n\nOn top of this retrieval effectiveness, RAPTOR consistently outperforms traditional methods like DPR and BM25 across all major metrics when evaluated with different language models on the QASPER dataset. For instance, with GPT-3, the RAPTOR system achieves a 53.1% F-1 Match score, outperforming DPR by 1.8 percentage points and BM25 by 6.5; similar trends are evident with GPT-4 and UnifiedQA[1][6]. These results are reinforced by the quantitative comparison, where RAPTOR shows superior performance on both ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR scores, as well as on overall answer F1 measures[1][6].\n\n![RAPTOR achieves the highest F-1 Match scores against DPR and BM25 across GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA on QASPER.](image6)\n\nThe design of the collapsed tree approach is pivotal in these gains; by allowing retrieval of nodes at varying levels of abstraction—tailored to each specific query—it can fetch more relevant, synthesized information compared to traditional methods that select only the most similar raw text passages. This characteristic is particularly valuable for multi-hop and thematic questions: RAPTOR’s tree-based system can pull from both summary and detail nodes as needed, while DPR is restricted to lower-level, granular leaf nodes, potentially missing the broader context needed for comprehensive answers[5].\n\n![RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval flexibly selects nodes at different layers to match query granularity, often encompassing DPR's selections.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree retrieval method, when integrated with RAPTOR, consistently outperforms tree traversal and RAPTOR with DPR on the QASPER dataset and other retrieval metrics, providing greater flexibility and higher accuracy in synthesizing information for question answering."}

The collapsed tree method evaluates all nodes in the tree at once rather than level by level, allowing for the selection of information at multiple granularities, which improves flexibility and relevance for different questions[1][11]. In contrast, tree traversal processes nodes layer-by-layer and selects a constant ratio of nodes from each level, possibly making it less adaptable to the needs of diverse queries[9].\n\nPerformance data across different context lengths, particularly on the QASPER dataset, consistently indicate that the collapsed tree approach outperforms tree traversal, especially as context length increases. The peak is observed when 2000 tokens are used; here, the collapsed tree achieves its highest F1 score, slightly decreasing if the context length goes up to 2500.

This approach ensures a better match to the granularity required for answering complex questions[9][8].\n\nShifting to RAPTOR's performance using various retrieval architectures and models, we see that RAPTOR consistently enhances metrics like ROUGE, BLEU-1, BLEU-4, and METEOR when compared to baseline retrievals such as BM25, DPR, and standard SBERT approaches.

In this setting, the RAR approach again leads to significant improvements over CLIP, especially in the hardest cases: rare classes. RAR (LLaVA1.5) delivers a substantial 19.6 percentage points increase in average precision for rare classes (AP_r) versus the CLIP baseline. This suggests a pronounced benefit when it comes to recognizing objects from seldom-seen or underrepresented categories, thanks to its retrieval-augmented approach, which pools relevant contextual information and enables robust final ranking[10].\n\n![RAR (LLaVA1.5) achieves major gains in zero-shot rare class object recognition metrics over CLIP.](image3)\n\nNotably, even in overall average precision metrics, RAR (LLaVA1.5) sustains these improvements, with gains of 1.3–1.5 percentage points in challenging large-vocabulary tasks[1][6].\n\nIn summary: The RAR (LLaVA1.5) model significantly improves both fine-grained visual recognition and zero-shot object recognition, with especially notable gains for rare or difficult classes in the zero-shot setting, demonstrating its value across varied recognition challenges."}

As a first step, the system performs targeted pre-processing, such as cropping around each object's bounding box and blurring the surrounding non-target regions to direct the model’s focus to the correct object. This approach ensures that smaller or less-central objects are emphasized, making them more accessible for recognition by the subsequent modules [5].\n\nOnce pre-processed, every cropped and, if necessary, blurred object region is encoded using an image encoder to generate an image embedding. These embeddings serve as compact, high-relevance representations of each detected object [7].\n\nThe system then proceeds to retrieval: using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search, the generated object embeddings are matched against a large-scale indexed memory bank containing stored embeddings and corresponding category labels. Rather than simply retrieving similar images, detection tasks often leverage image-to-text retrieval due to the small size of cropped objects, yielding a set of candidate class names most similar to the query embedding [12].\n\nAfter this retrieval step, the system faces the challenge of accurately identifying the object from among the retrieved candidates. Here, the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enters the pipeline. The MLLM receives both the object embedding and the candidate class names (from retrieval) as input via a carefully structured ranking prompt. Leveraging its rich internal knowledge and the contextual similarity of each candidate, the MLLM reranks the retrieved class names to select the most contextually appropriate label for the object in question [7][4].\n\nThis retrieval-then-ranking design ensures that even when the initial retrieval includes semantically close but incorrect categories, the final prediction is both precise and contextually informed. The reranking process can successfully discern the correct class label from a list of visually or semantically similar candidates, significantly boosting recognition performance in challenging detection scenarios.\n\nThis process is visually summarized where cropped object regions are embedded, similar categories are retrieved from memory, and the MLLM reranks these to identify the best match:\n\n![The object detection pipeline uses cropping, embedding, k-NN retrieval, and MLLM ranking for accurate labeling.](image7)\n\nA practical example is shown, where visually similar object proposals are each associated with a set of candidate class names. The MLLM then refines these to select the most appropriate label, enhancing accuracy:\n\n![Retrieved class names for objects are reranked by the MLLM to identify the correct class (e.g., \"earring\", \"glove\", \"short_pants\").](image2)\n\nIn short, the multimodal retriever system for object detection datasets crops and encodes object regions, retrieves candidate categories using k-NN search, and then leverages an MLLM to rerank and accurately identify the object’s class."}

This improved clustering indicates that SPECTER captures topical distinctions and inter-topic relationships more effectively, suggesting its representations are semantically richer and better suited for tasks like topic classification or semantic search[4].\n\n![SPECTER's embeddings group topics more distinctly than SciBERT.](image3)\n\nFurther, ablation studies highlight the effects of including additional metadata. Removing the abstract and using only the title causes a marked drop in performance, emphasizing the necessity of rich textual input. Surprisingly, adding metadata such as authors or venue does not improve and may even decrease the model’s performance. This is likely because author names are sparse and poorly tokenized, which introduces noise rather than useful signal. Adding venue information leads to a slight decrease in most tasks except for document classification, where venue can be more informative due to topic correlation[2]. So, SPECTER is designed to work effectively without reliance on such metadata, making it particularly versatile for situations where such data may be missing or anonymized[9].\n\n![Adding venue and author metadata does not improve—and can even hurt—performance.](image5)\n\nIn summary, SPECTER outperforms alternative models on a range of document-level tasks, and its design works best when restricted to robust textual features like title and abstract rather than sparse metadata fields such as author and venue."}

For example, a typical CHAI instruction can be decomposed into several sub-goals, such as opening cupboards, moving objects, and cleaning up, which requires complex sequencing and manipulation skills [2].

For instance, on a held-out test set, the best-performing model (\"Our Approach\") achieves a stop distance (SD) of 8.43 and task completion (TC) of 36.9 on LANI, whereas on CHAI, the same method achieves an SD of 3.34 and manipulation accuracy (MA) of 39.97. These numbers show that while LANI presents significant challenges, CHAI is even more demanding, particularly in terms of manipulation tasks, where all models generally perform poorly, indicating the CHAI tasks' higher complexity and planning requirements.

By explicitly decoupling the understanding of the target from the process of executing learned actions, the model avoids the entanglement seen in end-to-end approaches, improving both navigation and goal identification accuracy[8]. However, this decomposition introduces potential issues such as cascading errors: if the goal prediction is inaccurate, the resulting actions are compromised, since the action generation step has no direct access to the initial instruction and relies solely on the predicted goal[4]. Additionally, instructions that specify not only end goals but also constraints on the intermediate trajectory present challenges, as the model may reach the final goal without adhering to those constraints—highlighted by the linguistic richness and complexity in both LANI and CHAI datasets![Linguistic categories with trajectory constraints and temporal coordination in LANI and CHAI.](image1).\n\nHuman evaluations further suggest that while the approach narrows the gap compared to human followers, significant room for improvement remains, especially due to inherent ambiguities in the tasks and limitations in automated evaluation metrics[6][8][10].

The advantage of BERT models is especially notable on challenging tasks like RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment) and MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus), where they set new state-of-the-art results. This superior performance can be seen consistently in detailed task-specific metrics:\n\n![BERT models achieve higher scores across GLUE tasks and especially excel in RTE and MRPC.](image5)\n\nText evidence supports this, noting that BERT’s best models outperform not just the CNN models but also earlier models such as OpenAI GPT [3]. The incremental benefit of CNN Large over CNN Base is real but still falls short of BERT’s robust multi-task architecture. Moreover, while CNN models are competitive and sometimes faster to train or larger in specific parameter counts, their strengths are more pronounced in speed or practical training aspects rather than ultimate benchmark-setting performance.\n\nWhen examining the model comparison across tasks, BERT’s architecture—using a deeply bidirectional transformer encoder and a multi-task training regime—emerges as a key reason for its superiority. This architecture allows the model to leverage context from both directions in a sequence and enables multi-task learning (including masked language modeling and next sentence prediction), thus extracting richer language understanding signals [8]. In contrast, the CNN models, despite achieving strong results and being effective in certain configurations, especially where training resources or speed are limited, do not incorporate this kind of bidirectional context as effectively.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that CNN models, particularly the \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" configuration, deliver highly competitive results on tasks like named entity recognition, at times even surpassing BERT_BASE for specific structured prediction tasks:\n\n![Fine-tuned CNN Large matches or exceeds BERT_BASE in NER F1 scores but BERT excels in aggregate GLUE.](image8)\n\nIn summary, BERT models outperform CNN models on the GLUE benchmark overall, with particular strength in sentence-pair tasks and robust aggregate performance, largely due to their bidirectional transformer architecture and multi-task training regime. CNN models remain strong but are overall more limited in aggregate performance on GLUE compared to BERT-based approaches."}

In the context of tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and parsing, stacking task-specific architectures on top of pretrained CNN models results in state-of-the-art results. There are two principal approaches: (1) ELMo-style stacking, where pretrained models are not fine-tuned but linearly combined at different depths, and (2) full fine-tuning, where task-specific parts and the language model are trained jointly but possibly with different learning rates[11][2].\n\nFor example, on the CoNLL 2003 NER task, \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieves the highest F1 scores surpassing not just vanilla CNN-based models but also those stacked ELMo-style:\n![CNN Large + fine-tune achieves top NER F1 scores](image5)\nThis pattern is consistent across other structured tasks, with fine-tuning generally giving the biggest gains[5].\n\nA direct comparison of models on parsing tasks further highlights this effect.

For instance, training with more data, especially from sources that retain paragraph structure rather than just individual sentences, leads to higher scores across benchmarks such as GLUE, with average performance consistently improving as the amount of data increases[10]. This trend is illustrated by the ascending line in the graph, which maps the increase in GLUE score as more Common Crawl tokens are used during pretraining:\n\n![Increased pretraining data leads to higher GLUE scores.](image7)\n\nMoreover, not all sources of data are equally valuable. Datasets composed of multi-sentence units (like Common Crawl with 50 words per example) outperform those based on single sentences (such as News Crawl with only 23 words per example), especially on tasks involving sentence pairs (e.g., RTE).

When embeddings of multiple source languages are aligned into a common semantic space, as in multilingual systems, it appears to facilitate learning, especially for language pairs with higher similarity. In such scenarios, alignment yields the highest BLEU scores among the tested methods. For instance, when evaluating GL+PT on GL, AZ+TR on AZ, and BE+RU on BE, the \"align\" scores are consistently the highest, showing notable improvements compared to non-aligned setups. This suggests that alignment is beneficial for multilingual models, simplifying the encoder's task by bringing semantically similar words from both languages closer together, and thus improving final translation quality.\n\n![Alignment in multilingual setups gives the highest BLEU scores for each pair.](image2)\n\nHowever, the story changes in standard bilingual scenarios. Here, aligning embedding spaces does not consistently yield significant benefits. The results for GL→EN, PT→EN, AZ→EN, TR→EN, BE→EN, and RU→EN, when comparing \"unaligned\" and \"aligned\" embeddings, reveal either negligible gains or even slight losses in BLEU scores—for instance, GL→EN decreases by 1.3 points, and PT→EN by 0.2 points when alignment is applied. In some cases, there are tiny positive changes (e.g., RU→EN improves by 0.3), but overall, the impact of alignment is minimal.\n\n![Alignment in bilingual setups shows negligible or even slightly negative impact on BLEU scores.](image3)\n\nThe text evidence supports this interpretation: \"aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks... as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages... Pre-training and alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces\" [2]. Yet, it is also observed that: \"somewhat surprisingly, the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages\" [7]. Finally, practical recommendations conclude: \"a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios, but is helpful in multi-lingual training scenarios\" [8].\n\nIn summary, alignment of word embeddings significantly boosts BLEU scores in multilingual NMT systems but has little to no beneficial effect—and can even be detrimental—in standard bilingual NMT setups."}

For instance, Spanish, French, and Italian (all Romance languages closely related to Portuguese) showed moderate BLEU score improvements of +7.0, +5.7, and +4.7, respectively. In contrast, Russian and Hebrew—both distant from Portuguese—demonstrated larger gains, with Hebrew in particular showing the greatest increase at +8.9. This is consistent with the finding that languages with lower baseline BLEU scores (and thus greater room for improvement) realize larger benefits from pre-training when their baseline performance is low enough to still permit learning[1]. \n\n![Table shows BLEU score improvements across language pairs, with larger boosts for languages less similar to Portuguese such as Hebrew (+8.9) and Russian (+6.2), while more similar languages like Spanish and French have slightly smaller gains.](image1)\n\nThe question of training data size is critical. Analysis of BLEU scores relative to the proportion of training data reveals that pre-training is most beneficial for smaller datasets. The gain in translation accuracy (BLEU score) is notably higher when the dataset is limited and diminishes as the training set grows. Thus, pre-training is especially valuable in low-resource settings, providing substantial accuracy improvements when little parallel data is available. As the amount of data increases, both standard and pre-trained systems improve, but the relative benefit of pre-training decreases[4][2].\n\n![Line graphs show BLEU gains from pre-training are largest with small training datasets, then diminish as more data becomes available, with a clear peak benefit for limited-resource scenarios.](image2)\n\nLanguage similarity is another crucial factor affecting the efficiency of pre-training. Where languages are highly similar, their semantic structures and word neighborhoods closely resemble each other, allowing pre-trained embeddings to transfer more effectively. In multilingual training, pairs like Galician/Portuguese (high similarity) show large benefits from pre-training and alignment of embeddings, while less similar pairs show smaller or even negative effects. Aligning embeddings across languages is particularly beneficial in multilingual scenarios, allowing a shared encoder to process similar representations for different languages, further boosting translation performance for closely related pairs[9][11].\n\n![When training on pairs of similar and dissimilar languages, the table shows highest score gains for the most similar pair (GL+PT to GL, score increases from 17.5 to 22.4), moderate for an intermediate pair (AZ+TR to AZ, 5.4 to 7.5), and smallest for a dissimilar pair (BE+RU to BE, 10.0 to 9.6).](image8)\n\nIn summary: Pre-training increases translation accuracy most dramatically for low-resource language pairs, with the largest absolute improvements seen for pairs where the source and target are dissimilar and baseline accuracy is low. However, the efficiency of pre-training is typically higher for similar language pairs. The benefit is greatest when training data is limited and wanes with larger datasets. Alignment of embeddings across languages further enhances these gains, especially in multilingual setups."}

Alignment, which places multiple languages’ word embeddings into a shared vector space, was initially hypothesized to aid translation by making it easier for neural machine translation (NMT) systems to learn correspondences between source and target languages [7]. However, empirical results show that the effect of alignment differs with context.\n\nFor bilingual setups (translation between one source and one target language), alignment shows minimal effects. In most language pairs, the differences between using unaligned and aligned embeddings are marginal, with changes in evaluation scores (e.g., BLEU) being either slightly negative or negligible. For example, as reported in a table, pairs like GL→EN and PT→EN actually see a small decrease in score with alignment (−1.3 and −0.2, respectively), TR→EN decreases slightly (−0.2), while some pairs such as AZ→EN and RU→EN see minor improvements (+0.1, +0.3), and BE→EN remains unchanged. These fluctuations are generally very small, suggesting that a priori alignment of embeddings is not strictly necessary in standard bilingual NMT configurations [4][6].\n\n![Alignment effects on translation performance show mostly minimal changes with some variations across language pairs.](image4)\n\nThe situation changes in multilingual systems, where the same encoder is shared between similar languages. In this case, aligning the embeddings can lead to noticeable BLEU score improvements for all tested language pairs, especially when translation involves similar languages. This is because alignment reduces the burden on the encoder to bridge semantically separate embedding spaces, thus streamlining learning. When word embeddings of all source languages are brought into similar vector spaces, the NMT system behaves more like it is training on a single language, allowing for better transfer and generalization [4]. Empirical results show higher evaluation scores for multilingual setups when alignment and pre-training are combined.\n\n![In multilingual setups, alignment leads to clear improvements in evaluation scores, with aligned embeddings outperforming unaligned and pre-trained-only setups.](image8)\n\nTurning to F-measure scores for target words, pre-training itself consistently improves translation accuracy, particularly for low-frequency words. A frequency-bucketed analysis of target word translation shows that both standard (“std”) and pre-trained (“pre”) models achieve higher F-measures as word frequency rises, but models using pre-trained embeddings show greater gains over standard ones, especially for the rarest words (those seen only once or a few times in training). This confirms that pre-trained embeddings enable the NMT system to better represent and translate rare or unseen words, reducing the gap in translation quality between frequent and infrequent vocabulary [10].\n\n![Pre-trained embeddings provide higher F-measures, especially for rare words, compared to standard models.](image6)\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings has little effect in bilingual translation but is beneficial in multilingual settings where multiple similar languages share model parameters.

When R-GCN is replaced with standard GloVe embeddings and R-GCN is ablated, there is a substantial drop in accuracy, especially in the masked setting—GloVe with R-GCN yields an unmasked score of 59.2 but only 11.1 in the masked condition. Further removing R-GCN drops unmasked performance to 51.2 and keeps the masked score similarly low at 11.6, reflecting that both the graph-based relational component and contextual embeddings are critical, particularly for masked tasks where superficial cues are suppressed. No R-GCN (using only self-loops) still provides moderately strong results—62.4 (unmasked), 63.2 (masked)—highlighting some value from ELMo representations alone[4][11][12].\n\nWhen relation types are entirely removed (edges between entities become undifferentiated), performance is 62.7 (unmasked) and 63.9 (masked), showing that explicit encoding of relation types adds benefit over naive graph connection[1][4]. Ablating specific relation types further nuances the impact:\n- Without DOC-BASED connections (mentions in the same doc), performance drops to 62.9 (unmasked), 65.8 (masked). This reduction is explained by the dominance of within-document mention connections and their contribution to the model’s awareness of contextual proximity[7].\n- Removing MATCH (exact string matches) results in 64.3 (unmasked), 67.4 (masked), indicating these links are effective for coreference and identity, particularly in the masked setting, where exact string matching helps compensate for the obscured mentions[3][7].\n- COREF ablation results in 64.8 (unmasked)—no masked value is reported—but generally has a minor impact, suggesting MATCH edges capture the easier coreference cases, and out-of-domain coreference predictions can be noisy or unreliable[7].\n- Removing COMPLEMENT edges has a modest impact: 64.1 (unmasked), 70.3 (masked).\n\nInducing edges automatically rather than heuristically drops performance further (61.5 unmasked, 56.4 masked), indicating the learned approach cannot yet match heuristic edge labeling for supporting multi-hop inference[9][4].\n\nSummarizing the results from the evidence and the performance table:\n\n![Ablation table showing model performance under unmasked and masked conditions for different component removals; full model outperforms ablated versions, especially in the masked case.](image4)\n\nThe removal of components like R-GCN, absence of differentiated relations, and specific relation types (particularly DOC-BASED and MATCH) leads to decreased accuracy, with the impact being much more severe in the masked condition.

When the model excludes only the coreference edges (“No COREF”), the unmasked accuracy drops slightly relative to the full model (from 65.1 to 64.8 for single models). However, the masked setting does not report numbers for \"No COREF\", likely since masking renders all coreferred mentions with identical tokens, reducing the need for explicit coreference resolution:\n![Small accuracy drop when coreference edges are removed; test accuracy drops from 65.1 to 64.8 (unmasked), masked not given.](image6)\n\nA deeper analysis highlights that the majority of benefit for the model comes from document-based connections, and the 'MATCH' heuristic already recovers the most straightforward coreference cases. True, specialized coreference edges tend to add only marginally better performance, and sometimes their inclusion can even cause a slight degradation on the harder test set, probably due to errors from an out-of-domain coreference system [8].\n\nIn masked settings, the need for coreference edges is diminished or even nullified. Masking replaces all mentions of an entity with a standardized token (e.g., MASK1), so every instance becomes trivially coreferred. As a result, entity identity is directly encoded by the mask itself, making explicit modeling of coreference redundant [5].\n\nOn the other hand, in the unmasked version—where different strings (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\") can refer to the same entity—the coreference component can in principle help link mentions. Still, empirical results show only a modest benefit, with some suggestion of adverse effects if errors are introduced [8].\n\nTo summarize:  \nCoreference information provides only a minor and sometimes unstable boost to Entity-GCN performance in the unmasked setting and is largely superfluous in the masked setting, where masking guarantees surface-form uniformity for all coreferred entities."}

The improvement is partly attributed to DyGIE’s ability to leverage context and overlapping structures effectively [2][6].\n\nThe contribution of the CorefProp (coreference propagation) and RelProp (relation propagation) components depends on dataset properties and extraction tasks. Experiments show that relation propagation reliably boosts relation extraction performance, especially as the number of entities in sentences increases, indicating the benefit of wider contextual information ![Relation extraction F1 improves with more entities when using relation propagation.](image6)[9].

However, the effect of CorefProp varies with data: in SciERC, where pronouns are generically labeled, the benefit is smaller [1][5].\n\nQuantitatively, ablation studies reveal that removing relation propagation (–RelProp) generally reduces F1 for both entity and relation extraction tasks, particularly the latter, while omission of coreference propagation (–CorefProp) can have a lesser or sometimes mixed effect depending on the dataset and focus (entity vs. relation) ![Ablating CorefProp and RelProp reveals their effect on entity and relation F1 scores.](image8)[8].

This strong result, however, is largely due to BERT’s capacity to exploit spurious statistical cues present in the dataset, particularly those embedded in the wording of warrants like the frequent cue word “not”[2][12]. Analysis shows that BERT, while an advanced learner, is able to pick up on very subtle statistical signals that are not tied to genuine argument comprehension but rather to correlations in the data[2][12].\n\nTo address this, researchers constructed an adversarial version of the ARCT dataset. In this setup, every data point is paired with another in which the claim is negated and the label is inverted. This design ensures that any statistical cues present in one label are mirrored in the other, effectively eliminating their predictive power[8][9]. \n\nThe effect of this adversarial dataset is dramatic. BERT’s accuracy drops from its earlier peak to approximately random chance, with results around 50%–53%[6][8]. This is clearly seen in the comparative test performance metrics; while original results show high average, median, and maximum scores for BERT (e.g., Mean ≈ 0.67, Max ≈ 0.77), the adversarial setup yields much lower, nearly random results (Mean ≈ 0.50, Max ≈ 0.53):\n\n![Performance of BERT and its variants drops to random chance on the adversarial dataset](image3)\n\nThe reason for this drop is that, with statistical cues controlled for, the models have no shortcuts and must genuinely understand the argument to do better than guessing. However, their performance being at chance indicates that, in the absence of artefactual cues, modern models like BERT currently lack robust argument comprehension skills for this task[1][6][10]. This conclusion is further supported by the textual evidence that points the performance drop is \"as expected, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension. This result better apts with our intuitions about this task: with little to no understanding about the reality underlying these arguments, good performance shouldn’t be feasible\"[6].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup causes the measured performance of BERT models on the ARCT dataset to drop from above 70% accuracy to around 50%, demonstrating that previous high scores were due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues rather than genuine argument reasoning. This suggests that robust evaluation of argument comprehension requires datasets that neutralize such cues, and current models do not possess meaningful argument comprehension abilities for this task."}

Human validation of gold ATOMIC tuples sets the upper bound with an average plausibility score of 86.18 across all relations. Among automated decoding approaches, greedy decoding produces the highest scores, achieving an average of 77.53, followed closely by beam search methods with small beam sizes (e.g., 2 beams with 63.29). As beam size or randomness increases (e.g., random sampling or larger beams), the average plausibility score decreases—to 53.27 for top-5 random sampling and down to 43.61 for top-10 random sampling. Notably, no automated method reaches human-level performance, but greedy decoding narrows the gap most effectively.\n\n![Greedy decoding achieves the highest automated performance in generating commonsense inferences, while human validation remains superior.](image5)\n\nWhen exploring the effect of training data volume, we observe that metrics such as perplexity (PPL) and BLEU-2 scores improve (i.e., perplexity decreases, BLEU-2 increases) as the percentage of training data increases. For example, using only 1% of the training data yields a PPL of 23.81 and a BLEU-2 score of 5.08, which increase significantly to a PPL of 11.13 and BLEU-2 of 14.34 when using the full set.

It produces a high percentage of tuples that do not simply reproduce existing knowledge, generating 59.25% tuples not present in the training data. In addition, 3.75% of object nodes (\\(o\\) nodes) are entirely new, showing COMET’s capacity to extend the knowledge graph with previously unseen facts and relationships[1].\n\nHigh novelty does not come at the cost of accuracy: even for tuples that are significantly different from those in the training set (as measured by edit distance), the classifier accuracy remains high—almost reaching 100% for novel outputs, and only slightly decreasing as novelty goes up. This balance is crucial, as it indicates COMET’s generated outputs are both creative and trustworthy.\n\n![Classifier accuracy remains high even as the novelty (edit distance) of tuples increases.](image6)\n\nThese strong results for both accuracy and novelty suggest that COMET’s generative approach—adapting large-scale transformer language models for commonsense knowledge—effectively advances the automatic construction and extension of commonsense knowledge bases. As a result, COMET not only matches but often surpasses previous extractive methods, indicating it is highly effective for automatic knowledge base completion on ConceptNet.\n\nIn summary: COMET significantly outperforms previous models on ConceptNet in both accuracy and novelty, proving itself an effective and reliable tool for automatic commonsense knowledge base construction."}

For example, both the Pass-through and Neutral backoff strategies yield very similar, low sensitivities and WERs, as all unknown or altered word forms are essentially mapped to a single representation[8]. This leads to robust performance, since attackers have fewer unique perturbation outputs to exploit. The Neutral variant, in particular, stands out: it always replaces unknown words with a fixed, innocuous word, minimizing the opportunities for adversaries and reducing sensitivity to perturbations[3][8]. Meanwhile, Background backoff offers slight variations but tends to slightly increase both sensitivity and WER, as it draws from a larger vocabulary for unknown words, making distinctions among OOV tokens possible and thus offering more \"targets\" for attacks[3].\n\nOpen vocabulary models, however, are far more sensitive when using the Pass-through strategy. In these models, each unique character combination—including every possible misspelling—is considered a new word[8]. This results in a greatly increased sensitivity, as shown in the scatter plots where Pass-through for open vocabularies has the highest sensitivity and a moderate WER, leading to lower robustness ![Open vocabulary models with Pass-through exhibit high sensitivity and moderate WER, resulting in lower robustness](image3). Switching to Background backoff in open vocabulary models significantly reduces both sensitivity and WER, improving robustness: the model draws on a large corpus for corrections but doesn't treat every OOV form as unique. Neutral backoff minimizes sensitivity further, with all unrecognized mutations replaced by the same neutral token, but at a possible cost to performance in scenarios with no attack (due to e.g. over-normalization of proper entities)[8].\n\nNumerical evidence further illustrates these trends. For closed vocabulary models, all backoff methods report comparably low sensitivity and WER across attack types (e.g., “All” ≈ 11.3 for Pass-through and Neutral), whereas open vocabulary models with Pass-through show much higher overall sensitivity (e.g., “All” = 30.3), dropping steeply with Background (14.7) and Neutral (11.3), aligning them closer to closed vocabulary behaviors ![Open vocabulary models' sensitivity and WER substantially decrease with Neutral or Background backoff, matching closed vocabulary performance](image6).\n\nThe overarching insight is that closed vocabulary models are intrinsically less sensitive and maintain low WER regardless of backoff strategy due to their uniform handling of new words. Open vocabulary models, conversely, are highly sensitive under naïve Pass-through but can be made nearly as robust as closed vocabulary ones by applying Neutral or Background backoff.\n\nIn summary: Closed vocabulary models maintain low sensitivity and WER across all backoff strategies, while open vocabulary models exhibit high sensitivity with Pass-through but match closed models' robustness when using Neutral or Background backoff."}

Total liabilities rose from $422.4 billion to $443.9 billion, while consolidated shareholders' equity grew from $443.7 billion to $506.2 billion. This growth is vividly reflected in the financial statements, which break down the details for each component.\n\nThe liabilities associated with insurance and other segments, including unpaid losses, loss adjustment expenses, unearned premiums, and life, annuity, and health insurance benefits, all either grew or remained relatively stable year over year. Notably, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $79.9 billion to $86.7 billion, while unearned premiums went up from $21.4 billion to $23.5 billion. Meanwhile, notes payable and other borrowings under “Insurance and Other” slightly decreased, as did the equivalent figure for \"Railroad, Utilities and Energy\" operations. However, deferred income taxes, as part of total liabilities, increased considerably, reflecting changes in the value of the company’s investment and operational performance.\n\nIn terms of shareholders’ equity, the company’s consolidated equity grew substantially to $506.2 billion at the end of 2021, up $63.0 billion from the prior year. This increase was largely attributed to net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders of $89.8 billion, which included substantial after-tax gains on investments due to favorable market performance. However, the company also acknowledged that investment gains and losses—primarily from fluctuating market prices—introduced exceptional earnings volatility over recent years[1].\n\nSupporting these figures, the consolidated financial statements reveal that Berkshire’s insurance companies maintained exceptionally high capital strength, with a combined statutory surplus among U.S.-based insurers of approximately $301 billion at the end of 2021, up considerably from $237 billion at the end of 2020. This strong capital position, alongside high credit ratings from major agencies, further underscores the rise in shareholders’ equity[4][7].\n\nAdditionally, adjustments to prior years’ claim liabilities contributed positively, as 2021 saw reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts, leading to increases in pre-tax earnings and subsequently impacting equity favorably[9][12]. The company’s claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion in 2021, boosting pre-tax earnings[9].\n\nThis movement in key totals is visualized clearly in the following breakdown from their consolidated balance sheet table:\n\n![Liabilities and shareholders’ equity increased from 2020 to 2021, with significant changes in insurance-related liabilities and a strong rise in consolidated shareholders’ equity.](image1)\n\nIn summary, Berkshire Hathaway’s liabilities increased primarily due to growth in insurance-related obligations and deferred tax liabilities, while the substantial increase in shareholders’ equity was chiefly driven by robust net earnings, strong investment performance, and the solid capital position of its insurance subsidiaries.\n\nIn direct answer: From 2020 to 2021, Berkshire Hathaway’s total liabilities increased by $21.5 billion to $443.9 billion, and shareholders’ equity increased by $62.5 billion to $506.2 billion, driven mainly by strong net earnings, investment gains, and the continued capital strength of their insurance businesses."}

In 2019, Capex stood at $31,148 million, but by 2020 this dropped to $21,374 million, a reduction that was visible across all business segments (Upstream, Downstream, Chemical, and Other), with the largest declines seen in the Upstream operations and the overall total. The drop reflects management’s response to lower realized prices and the need to strengthen liquidity by reducing project spending and conserving cash during a period of constrained earnings and cash flow[2]. This adjustment is corroborated by the segmentation in spending, which reveals smaller budgets for Downstream ($4,221 million in 2020 vs. $4,371 million in 2019) and Chemical projects ($2,716 million in 2020 vs. $3,265 million in 2019)[10]. \n\n![Capital expenditures fell from $31,148 million in 2019 to $21,374 million in 2020.](image5)\n\nEnvironmental expenditures, which are a subset of capital expenditures, also saw a decrease.

Of this, capital channeling specifically for environmental purposes decreased from $1,276 million in 2019 to $1,087 million in 2020, highlighting further reductions in investments intended for preventative and remediation measures[7]. \n\n![Environmental expenditures, comprising both capital and other expenses, decreased from $5,245 million in 2019 to $4,476 million in 2020.](image6)\n\nThe company’s taxes also reflected the difficult external environment. In 2019, total taxes (which combine income taxes and other duties) stood at $38,468 million. By 2020, this figure sharply declined to $22,793 million. Remarkably, income taxes turned into a $5,632 million benefit (i.e., a net tax credit or refund) in 2020, compared to a $5,282 million expense the previous year. The effective income tax rate halved from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, largely as a consequence of asset impairments and a shift in the geographical mix of earnings toward jurisdictions with lower or negative tax rates. Other taxes and duties also dropped, from $33,186 million in 2019 to $28,425 million in 2020[9].\n\n![Total taxes dropped dramatically from $38,468 million in 2019 to $22,793 million in 2020; income taxes went negative, indicating an overall tax benefit.](image1)\n\nThese financial changes had significant implications for ExxonMobil. The combination of lower Capex and decreased tax obligations was largely a response to the dramatic reduction in product prices stemming from industry-wide disruptions in 2020. Lower oil and gas realizations resulted in much lower earnings across the board, prompting cost-cutting, debt issuance to maintain liquidity, and a reevaluation of capital allocation priorities to preserve cash and stabilize the company’s financial position[2][1].\n\nIn summary, ExxonMobil’s capital expenditures and total taxes both decreased sharply from 2019 to 2020, reflecting the company’s efforts to manage through depressed earnings and maintain financial flexibility during a challenging economic environment."}

The core non-GAAP measure accounts for adjustments including the mark-to-market net impact, restructuring and impairment charges, as well as inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges.

This slight increase in 2021 was primarily attributed to a lower cost of funds, even as the average revolving card member loan balances were lower, which somewhat tempered the growth. Interest income decreased year-over-year, but interest expense dropped further, resulting in an increase in net interest income. Specifically, interest expense fell from $619 million in 2020 to $449 million in 2021, outweighing the decline in interest income from $1,586 million to $1,460 million over the same period[12].

The company also indicated that future interest rate increases could erode net interest income if rates on liabilities rise faster than on assets[3].\n- **Macroeconomic Recovery and Consumer Behavior**: Receivables grew again in 2021 as consumer and commercial activity rebounded from the pandemic shock that suppressed 2020 volumes. This recovery was mirrored in improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic indicators, such as lower unemployment rates, contributing to lower credit loss provisions and supporting higher receivable balances[7][9].\n- **Credit Trends**: Provision for credit losses flipped from significant builds in 2020 (during the height of the COVID-19 downturn) to reserve releases in 2021, as credit metrics improved and consumers became more current on their obligations[note: see image5 for improving write-off rates and delinquencies][7][9].\n\nIn summary:  \nBetween 2019 and 2021, net interest income moderately increased mainly due to lower funding costs, while card member receivables rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, driven by economic recovery and improved credit quality."}

As a percentage of pre-tax income, the effective tax rate increased from 22.3% in 2018, to 20.8% in 2019, and sharply to 24.0% in 2020. Notably, the largest year-on-year increase in the dollar amount and effective rate occurred between 2019 and 2020, reflecting both an increase in pre-tax earnings and specific tax drivers, such as a $626 million health insurance tax in 2020, which was not present in 2019 but reappeared after being recorded in 2018.\n\n![The company’s provision for income taxes rose from $3,562 million (22.3%) in 2018 to $4,973 million (24.0%) in 2020, illustrating an increasing trend in both dollar amount and effective tax rate.](image1)\n\nDecomposing the provision by its current and deferred components, current income tax provisions (federal, state, and foreign) rose significantly from $3,520 million in 2018, to $3,512 million in 2019, and jumped to $4,981 million in 2020. The deferred income tax provision, which reflects the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities, was relatively modest ($42 million in 2018 and $230 million in 2019), but actually showed a slight deferred benefit of $(8) million in 2020. This shift suggests that the increase in total tax provision for 2020 was driven primarily by current tax expense rather than by deferred tax adjustments.\n\n![The breakdown shows the total provision for income taxes, with the current provision increasing markedly in 2020 while deferred tax impact was negligible or beneficial.](image3)\n\nTurning to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the net position (liabilities minus assets) grew more negative, from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020. Deferred tax assets rose from $2,868 million to $3,391 million, but deferred tax liabilities increased even more steeply, from $5,861 million to $6,758 million. This widening gap reflects increases in items such as intangibles, capitalized software, depreciation, and lease-related tax liabilities, tempered partially by higher tax assets from lease liabilities and accrued expenses.\n\n![Net deferred tax liabilities deepened from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020 as deferred tax liabilities outpaced the increase in deferred tax assets.](image8)\n\nThe significance of deferred tax items in these trends is primarily in their limited impact on the annual provision for income taxes in 2020, as the overall deferred benefit was minor. However, the growing net deferred tax liability signals that temporary timing differences are stacking up, and over the long term, this could increase future tax provisions if the underlying taxable differences reverse.\n\nIn summary: The company’s income tax provision increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, driven mainly by a jump in current taxes, while deferred tax assets and liabilities contributed little to the short-term provision trend but are accumulating as a larger net deferred tax liability."}

Card Member receivables also rose significantly—from $43.7 billion in 2020 to $53.6 billion in 2021. These increases reflect a strong resurgence in customer activity and overall credit usage as macroeconomic conditions improved post-pandemic, leading to portfolio growth and higher balances outstanding. At the same time, reserves for credit losses for Card Member loans decreased from the prior year, indicating better portfolio quality, improved macroeconomic outlook, and reduced delinquencies despite the increase in loan volumes.

These declines are evident from the financial statement summaries:  \n![Net income and comprehensive income both declined substantially from 2019 to 2020.](image1)\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these decreases. First, operating income fell by 19% as reported, and 23% when adjusting for strategic gains and charges in both years. The decrease was largely the result of reduced operating earnings, heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic[9]. Operating margin itself shrank from 42.5% in 2019 to 38.1% in 2020, reflecting lower profitability relative to revenue[1]. Furthermore, net income was affected by impairment and strategic transaction items, such as gains from the sale of McDonald’s Japan stock and a write-off of impaired software[7].\n\nCurrency impacts also played a role – while foreign currency translation had a small positive effect on diluted earnings per share, the overall environment remained challenging[2].\n\nFree cash flow saw a 19% decrease, from $5.7 billion in 2019 to $4.6 billion in 2020, mirroring the diminished operating performance[5].

Some divisions saw notable growth, while others experienced modest increases or declines. Understanding these changes requires looking not only at the raw financial figures but also at the mix of beverage and food/snack sales across regions.\n\nThe divisional net revenue and operating profit figures are as follows:\n\n- FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) displayed a steady increase in both revenue and profit over the three years, reflecting strong performance in food and snack products.\n- PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) saw consistent growth in net revenue. However, the operating profit was more modest in its increase.\n- QFNA (Quaker Foods North America) maintained a comparatively lower scale, with incremental changes over time.\n- Divisions like Europe and LatAm (Latin America) experienced dynamic changes, sometimes modest in profit, possibly influenced by currency fluctuations or economic conditions.\n- AMESA (Africa, Middle East, South Asia) and APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, and China) showed fluctuations in both net revenue and operating profit, particularly in emerging markets with significant growth in some years.\n\n![Divisional net revenue and operating profit trends over three years show strong growth in North America and shifts in emerging markets.](image2)\n\nA key factor influencing these trends is the distribution between beverage and food/snack categories in each division. For example, FLNA, comprised almost exclusively of food and snack products, benefited from steady demand for snacks, especially during periods of increased at-home consumption. PBNA, focusing on beverages, had to manage shifts in consumption patterns, especially during pandemic-related closures of food service establishments.\n\nGlobally, food/snack sales made up a slightly larger portion of PepsiCo's net revenue each year (55% food/snack vs. 45% beverage). However, the distribution varies significantly by region:\n\n- In Latin America, food/snack dominates with 90% of the revenue, which aligns with higher profit stability, even amid fluctuations in beverage demand.\n- Europe has a more balanced mix, with about 55% beverage and 45% food/snack, showing the impact of both categories on its financial performance.\n- AMESA and APAC divisions continue to be more food/snack-oriented, though AMESA saw a shift from 45% beverage in 2018 to 30% in 2020, increasing the share of food/snack products, which may help reduce volatility associated with beverage markets.\n\n![The percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories by region reveals a dominant snack focus in LatAm and emerging markets’ shift toward snacks.](image6)\n\nThe shifts in operating profit and revenue across divisions are clearly influenced by this category distribution. Divisions with a high proportion of food/snack products (e.g., FLNA, LatAm) generally saw more stable and sometimes stronger growth. This stability may be attributed to less susceptibility to disruptions that affect out-of-home consumption of beverages. Divisions with a higher percentage of beverage revenue can be more sensitive to such external shocks, as seen in some uneven operating profit trends in Europe and PBNA.\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, divisions that were more focused on food/snack categories generally outperformed those with a higher beverage mix in terms of operating profit and net revenue growth, especially during periods of global disruption. This highlights the importance of a diversified revenue stream and the resilience of the food/snack category for PepsiCo’s global divisions."}

Under the Advanced approach, CET1 capital was the same at $64,751 million, but total RWA were lower at $382,496 million. Both Tier 1 and Total Capital were also slightly higher under the Standardized approach.

Actual capital ratios improved: CET1 to 17.4% (Standardized) and 17.7% (Advanced), Tier 1 to 19.4% (Standardized) and 19.8% (Advanced), and Total Capital to 21.5% (Standardized) and 21.8% (Advanced). This demonstrates not only growth in RWA but also an increase in capital base, leading to stronger ratios despite higher risk exposures (![Risk-based capital components and ratios, December 31, 2020](image6)).\n\nDelving into the detailed changes in RWA:\n- Credit risk RWA rose significantly: by $44,382 million (Standardized) and $56,003 million (Advanced), largely attributed to greater derivatives exposure, investment securities, lending commitments, and equity investments. Market risk RWA also increased by about $14.5 billion under each approach, primarily due to higher market volatility. Operational risk RWA (Advanced only) declined by $7,791 million, driven by reduced litigation-related losses (![Detailed RWA changes by risk type for 2020](image7); [6]; [7]; [12]).\n\nThese changes reflect that while the financial institution took on greater risk during 2020—evidenced by the jump in both credit and market risk RWAs—it also bolstered its capital base more than sufficiently, so capital ratios not only remained well above regulatory minimums but even improved over the prior year. The drivers of these RWA increases included the acquisition of E*TRADE and heightened market volatility, but these were matched with significant retained earnings and additional capital ([4]; [7]; [12]).\n\nIn summary, at December 31, 2020, the institution reported higher risk-weighted assets but also stronger capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced methods compared to December 31, 2019, indicating a robust capital position alongside increased business activity and exposures."}

This reflects a notable swing, implying that the changes in financial assumptions in 2021 resulted in an actuarial loss, while such changes in 2020 led to an actuarial gain.\n\n![The table shows that changes in financial assumptions led to an actuarial loss of -26 million euros in 2021, versus a gain of 72 million euros in 2020.](image7)\n\nIn detail, financial assumptions include the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and pension progression rates; even subtle shifts in these can have pronounced effects on the valuation of long-term pension liabilities.

This demonstrates steady growth in the company’s profitability. When examining the components of other comprehensive income (OCI), significant volatility is evident over the three-year span. In 2018 and 2019, Accenture experienced substantial net OCI losses, primarily driven by negative foreign currency translation and losses on defined benefit plans. For instance, in 2018, the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $(305,225)$ and a cash flow hedge loss of $(198,645)$, resulting in an overall OCI attributable to Accenture PLC of $(481,387)$ for that year. The following year, 2019, continued this trend with more moderate, yet still negative, OCI of $(264,406)$. However, 2020 marked a reversal: Accenture reported positive OCI of $278,740$, primarily attributed to favorable movements in foreign currency translation ($197,696$) and defined benefit plans ($57,100$)[image5].\n\nThese changes in comprehensive income are directly related to movements in shareholders' equity. Each year's comprehensive income—comprising both net income and other comprehensive income—flows into shareholders' equity, increasing its value when positive and decreasing it when negative. This relationship is visible in Accenture’s shareholders’ equity tables. For example, in 2020, comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC was $5,386,579, which, along with other equity activities such as dividends, share-based compensation, and share issuances and repurchases, contributed to an increase in total shareholders' equity to $17,499,173 by August 31, 2020[image3]. Conversely, the negative OCI in 2018 and 2019 placed a drag on total equity growth despite rising net income.\n\nOverall, while Accenture consistently grew its net income over the period, fluctuations in the components of other comprehensive income—particularly foreign currency translation, defined benefit plan adjustments, and cash flow hedge effectiveness—caused notable year-to-year swings in total comprehensive income. The positive contribution of OCI in 2020, following two years of losses, helped bolster shareholders' equity more markedly than in previous years.  \n \n![Steady growth in net income, with fluctuating other comprehensive income components showing losses in 2018-2019 and gains in 2020.](image5)\n\n![Shareholders’ equity rose alongside comprehensive income, with OCI fluctuations affecting the pace of equity growth.](image3)\n\nIn summary, Accenture’s shareholders’ equity increased each year, driven by rising net income, but the rate of growth was influenced by significant swings in other comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020."}

Specifically, in 2020, net cash increased by $5,361 million, while in 2019 it decreased by $3,290 million, reflecting a substantial improvement year-over-year. The underlying drivers are best understood by examining operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as certain financial adjustments.\n\nCash provided by operating activities was a key positive influence, rising from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020—an increase of $3,427 million. This jump was mainly driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables, partly through sales of financing receivables, and by payroll and tax payment deferrals enabled by government relief programs. However, there were some offsets, such as higher workforce rebalancing payments and greater income tax payments, reflecting both internal strategic moves and external COVID-19 related financial assistance[3][8][9].\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased dramatically from $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020. This positive shift was primarily due to the prior year’s major outlay for the Red Hat acquisition, which did not recur in 2020, resulting in a $32,294 million reduction in acquisition-related cash outflows. The overall decrease in investing outflows was partially offset by lower inflows from financing receivables due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations and increased purchases of marketable securities[1][7][11].\n\nFinancing activities moved from being a net source in 2019 ($9,042 million) to a net use of cash in 2020 ($(9,721) million). This swing was primarily caused by a significant reduction in debt issuance, which had been elevated in the prior year to fund the Red Hat acquisition. There was also a decrease in cash used for share repurchases, but this was not enough to counterbalance the much lower net additions of debt[6][12].\n\nThe overall improvement in net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020—compared to the negative result in 2019—can thus be attributed to stronger cash generation from operations and a dramatic reduction in cash used for acquisitions, despite the negative change in financing activities.\n\n![Summary table showing IBM's net increase of $5,361 million in cash for 2020 compared to a $3,290 million decrease in 2019.](image3)\n\nIn direct terms: IBM’s net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 improved mainly due to higher cash flow from operations and greatly reduced acquisition-related cash outflows, more than offsetting lower financing inflows compared to 2019."}

This decline was primarily due to COVID-19, which caused significant sales drops in the International Operated Markets, notably in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, largely because of temporary restaurant closures and limited operations. While the U.S. market showed positive sales, this was not enough to counter the global losses, especially as the company provided additional marketing support and incentives to accelerate recovery, such as free Thank You Meals for first responders and health care workers [1][3][8].\n\n![In 2020, total company revenues fell to $19,208 million, a 10% decrease from 2019.](image8)\n\nTotal restaurant margins, which combine those from franchised and company-operated restaurants, decreased by 13%, from $11,115 million in 2019 to $9,677 million in 2020. The decline in restaurant margins mirrored the drop in global sales, as International Operated Markets faced a sharper contraction than the U.S., which only experienced modest positive growth [8]. The majority of McDonald’s restaurants are franchised, and the impact was greater in markets with fewer drive-thru locations, explaining more significant losses in international segments [7][8].\n\n![Restaurant margins fell sharply in 2020, with both franchised and company-operated segments declining.](image5)\n\nCompany-operated margins dropped in part due to additional COVID-19 related expenses, such as higher employee-related costs, personal protective equipment, and additional signage. Franchised margins in the U.S. were also pressured by higher depreciation related to Experience of the Future investments and increased marketing support for franchisees to support recovery [10][11].\n\nThe main contributing factors to the drop in revenues and margins were the negative impact of the pandemic on international markets, higher expenses related to COVID-19 safety measures, and greater support for franchisees, which outweighed the positive sales performance in the U.S. [1][3][8][10][11].\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, McDonald’s total revenues decreased by 10% and total restaurant margins decreased by 13%, mainly due to COVID-19’s impact on international sales, temporary restaurant closures, and increased costs and support to franchisees."}

The NBCUniversal segment made the largest contribution, followed by significant increases from Cable Communications and Sky. Corporate, Other, and eliminations provided a modest reduction.[image6]\n\n![NBCUniversal was the leading contributor to revenue growth, followed by Cable Communications and Sky, with a small offset from Corporate and Other](image6)\n\nThis revenue acceleration is further supported by the data on operating performance, which shows strong increases in segment revenues.

NBCUniversal’s expenses grew due to increased activity in its Media, Studios, and Theme Parks businesses. Cable Communications saw higher costs because of increased programming, technical support, regulatory fees, and marketing, though some of this was partially offset by lower customer service expenses. Sky’s expenses rose mainly from higher direct network costs and some other categories, though programming and production costs actually declined. Corporate and Other expenses decreased, largely due to prior year severance charges not recurring in 2021. Additionally, consolidated costs and expenses in 2020 included a $177 million adjustment related to a legal settlement that was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and segment results[7].\n\nComparing by segment: NBCUniversal was the key driver of revenue (and expense) increases thanks largely to its operating recovery in media, studios, and parks; Cable Communications saw moderate revenue growth with increased operating costs tied to programmatic and technical factors; Sky’s advances were moderate and mainly expense-driven by network costs.\n\nIn summary, Comcast’s consolidated revenue growth in 2021 was mainly driven by substantial increases in NBCUniversal, with significant contributions from Cable Communications and Sky. Operating expenses rose across the board, mostly from NBCUniversal and Cable, while Corporate and Other expenses declined.\n  \nThe main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021 were NBCUniversal, Cable Communications, and Sky, with NBCUniversal making the largest impact; increases in operating expenses were led by NBCUniversal and Cable Communications, reflecting increased costs tied to programming, technical support, and expanded operations."}

Starting with the Corporate Centre, net operating income improved from $(654) million in 2019 to $(262) million in 2020, a $392 million positive change—a substantial 60% improvement. Likewise, profit before tax rose from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, an increase of $387 million or 42%. These results show significant improvement in both headline measures for Corporate Centre, even though net operating income was still negative.[image1]\n\nTurning to Global Banking and Markets, the net operating income increased, from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, marking a $434 million increase, or 3% year-over-year.[image7] However, profit before tax declined, from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, a decrease of $342 million or 7%.\n\nLinking these trends to their respective financial metrics, we see that Corporate Centre's improvements came alongside a modest RoTE increase from 0.8% to 3.1%.[image1] Meanwhile, Global Banking and Markets showed a significant drop in its RoTE excluding significant items—from 9.8% in 2019 to 6.7% in 2020—reflecting profitability pressures despite the top-line growth in net operating income.[image7] \n\nDigging deeper, this divergence in profit before tax points to the impact of other line items. For Global Banking and Markets, a sharp rise in credit impairment charges (from $(153) million to $(1,209) million) offset the net operating income growth, leading to lower profit before tax and RoTE. In contrast, Corporate Centre’s result benefited from improved expense allocation, lower operating expenses, and a smaller drag from negative net operating income.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, Corporate Centre shifted towards less negative net operating income and higher profit before tax, while Global Banking and Markets achieved modest net operating income growth but saw profit before tax decline—mainly due to increased credit losses. This led to contrasting RoTE trends, with Corporate Centre slightly improving and Global Banking and Markets declining in return metrics.\n\n- Corporate Centre saw a major improvement in both net operating income and profit before tax between 2019 and 2020, but these figures remained negative overall, and RoTE increased modestly.\n- Global Banking and Markets recorded higher net operating income but lower profit before tax and a notable decline in RoTE due to increased expected credit losses.\n\n![Corporate Centre’s net operating income and profit before tax improved significantly, yet remained negative, with RoTE rising from 0.8% to 3.1%.](image1)\n\n![Global Banking and Markets experienced a small increase in net operating income but a reduction in profit before tax and RoTE due to much higher credit impairment charges.](image7)\n\nTherefore, from 2019 to 2020, Corporate Centre’s financial metrics improved while remaining negative, whereas Global Banking and Markets experienced higher net operating income but lower profit before tax and worsening RoTE."}

According to the financial data, operating income increased from 2019 to 2020. This can be inferred from the detailed breakdown:\n\n- Operating income is directly presented in the financial data by year. In 2019, operating income is lower than in 2020, reflecting an increase over the period.\n- At the same time, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities shifted from a negative amount in 2019 to a positive inflow in 2020:\n\n![Cash from investing activities became positive in 2020 versus negative in 2019](image6)\n\nIn 2019, the company had net cash used in investing activities (–$87 million), indicative of heavier outflows, likely for acquisitions or capital expenditures. In 2020, this turned into a net inflow of $64 million, meaning the Partnership generated more cash from its investing activities than it spent.\n\nDelving into reasons for these changes, several contributing factors can be identified. First, total revenue, particularly transportation services revenue, experienced a decline due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower contract rates, and higher impacts from storms and turnaround activities. However, these decreases were partially offset by new volumes from certain assets and an increase in terminaling services revenue due to regulatory tariff changes:\n\n[3]: \"Transportation services revenue decreased\" due to COVID-19 and contract changes, but this was \"partially offset by new volumes...as well as achieving regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020.\"\n[11]: \"Total revenue decreased by $22 million in 2020 as compared to 2019...partially offset by increases of $63 million attributable to terminaling services revenue and $1 million in lease revenue.\"\n\nDespite the drop in some revenues, cost management and the aforementioned boosts in terminaling and lease revenues helped operating income improve.\n\nCapital expenditures dropped substantially from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020, largely because of the completion of major expansion projects, which reduced cash outflows on investments:\n\n[2]: \"Capital expenditures...$22 million [2020], $35 million [2019]...decrease...primarily due to completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco.\"\n\nWith lower capital expenditures and likely proceeds from equity method investment returns or similar inflows, the cash from investing activities swung from outflows to net inflows.\n\n![Operating income increased slightly from 2019 to 2020, while capital expenditures dropped sharply](image2)\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, Shell Midstream Partners, L.P.'s operating income increased, and cash from investing activities shifted from outflow to inflow. These changes were driven by lower capital expenditures resulting from completed projects, management of expenses, new revenue streams from regulatory changes, and partially offsetting declines in transportation revenue due to pandemic impacts."}

These changes were the dominant driver among all categories affecting total actuarial gains and losses in both years. Overall, the total actuarial loss in 2021 was -22 million euros, compared to a gain of +67 million euros in 2020, showing a sharp reversal primarily due to financial assumptions rather than demographic changes or experience adjustments. ![A table showing that changes in financial assumptions led to -26 million actuarial losses in 2021 and +72 million gains in 2020](image1)\n\nLooking at discount rates, there was a moderate increase between 2020 and 2021: the overall discount rate rose from 1.5% to 1.7%. For the euro currency, it went up from 0.9% to 1.0%, for the US dollar from 2.4% to 2.7%, and other currencies also showed small increases. ![The discount rate increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021, with currency-specific rates rising as well](image6)\n\nMovements in discount rates have a direct effect on the present value of defined benefit obligations. When discount rates increase, the present value of pension obligations decreases, typically resulting in actuarial gains; when discount rates decrease or do not rise sufficiently relative to inflation or other assumptions, the obligation increases, causing actuarial losses. The sensitivity table quantifies this effect: a half-percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the obligation by 271 million euros in 2021 (266 million in 2020), demonstrating how changes in financial assumptions—especially discount rates—can drive significant volatility in actuarial results. ![A table showing that a half-point decrease in discount rate would increase the defined benefit obligation by 271 million euros in 2021](image8)\n\nIn summary, the shift from an actuarial gain in 2020 to a loss in 2021 was driven mainly by differences in financial assumptions, especially discount rates, which did not result in the same positive reassessment of liabilities as the previous period.

In 2021, the discount rate for the euro (Germany) was 1.0%, up from 0.9% in 2020, while for the U.S. dollar, it was 2.7% in 2021 compared to 2.4% in 2020. This demonstrates a higher discount rate environment for the U.S. compared to Germany, with rates in both regions increasing slightly year over year. The general discount rate used also rose, reflecting a shift in financial markets that directly impacts the valuation of pension obligations.\n![Discount rates increased slightly in both regions, with the U.S. maintaining higher rates than Germany.](image1)\n\nCompensation increases, which influence future pension liabilities, also differed. For the United Kingdom and Switzerland, specific rates are shown, but for Germany, compensation increase rates are typically less influential than pension progression. By contrast, in the United States, plan accruals are generally frozen for new entrants and future accruals, minimizing the impact of these assumptions for most employees[7]. Pension progression in Germany was stable at 1.5% for both years, while U.S. plans do not emphasize this factor.\n![Compensation and pension progression rates remained stable in Germany.](image8)\n\nMortality and demographic assumptions further distinguish the approaches. Germany used updated national Siemens-specific mortality tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2021, based on broader national statistics), while the U.S. relied on the Pri-2012 generational projections tied to the Social Security Administration. This reflects divergent longevity projections between the two countries, directly impacting estimated obligations.\n![Germany and the U.S. use different mortality tables tailored to their respective populations and regulatory environments.](image5)\n\nFinancial risks and plan structures also differ: in Germany, Siemens Healthineers measures defined benefit plans by calculating the present value of promised benefits—sensitive to discount rate shifts, as well as to market and social conditions. In the U.S., plans are largely frozen, and maintaining an 80% funding threshold is a regulatory minimum, with assets held in trust and subject to ERISA requirements[4][7]. Both regions saw fluctuations in actuarial gains and losses based on financial and demographic assumption changes, but the U.S. setting appears structurally more static due to plan freezing.\n![Actuarial gains and losses in both countries reflect sensitivity to demographic and financial assumption changes.](image6)\n\nIn summary, Germany and the U.S. differ in key actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans. Germany uses lower discount rates, stable pension progression, and region-specific mortality tables, while the U.S. has higher discount rates, frozen accruals, and its own mortality projections. These differences reflect structural, regulatory, and demographic variations across the two regions."}

In contrast, time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined sharply—time deposits fell by 41% and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits by 44%.[7] ![Total deposits increased, led by noninterest-bearing and savings accounts, but time and non-U.S. deposits fell.](image3)\n\nThe mix of both higher commercial lending and a move away from time and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits suggests the financial entity was strategically focusing on strengthening its core domestic deposit base—which includes more stable, low-cost funding—and growing its commercial loan portfolio. The reduction in consumer loans, particularly residential mortgages, may have been influenced by loan paydowns during a low interest rate environment, as well as active sales and transfers of loan portfolios, such as first lien mortgages to loans held for sale.[8]\n\nIn short: From December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, the financial entity increased overall loans slightly due to higher commercial lending, decreased consumer loans, and grew its core deposit base by increasing demand and savings deposits while reducing reliance on time and international deposits, pointing to a strategy of strengthening domestic, low-cost funding and business lending."}

The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic led the company to monitor potential asset impairments, though no trigger was identified in 2020. However, uncertainty in market conditions and volatility may have pressured revenues and profitability[1]. Additionally, while overall depreciation and amortization expenses rose slightly over this period (from $46 million in 2018 to $50 million in 2020)[4], thus impacting net income marginally, broader market issues—especially pandemic-driven demand reductions—likely played a larger role.\n\nIn summary, net income for both Amberjack and Mars dropped significantly from 2018 to 2020, a change likely driven by market volatility and reduced demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increases in operating costs and depreciation expenses."}

Examining the consolidated data first, Adjusted EBITDA was $34,258 million in 2019, decreased to $30,826 million in 2020 due to pandemic-related impacts, and then rebounded to $34,708 million in 2021, surpassing its pre-pandemic level. This pattern reflects an initial downturn followed by recovery as market conditions stabilized and operations resumed more fully, especially in areas hit hardest by COVID-19 disruptions like theme parks and media[4].\n\nSegment-level data reveals significant differences. For instance, one segment reported negative Adjusted EBITDA throughout, worsening from $(820) million in 2019 to $(1,785) million in 2020 before improving to $(1,358) million in 2021, indicating ongoing operational or investment-related losses but some recovery in 2021 as pandemic headwinds lessened.\n![A financially underperforming segment reports negative Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 to 2021, with partial recovery in 2021.](image8)\n\nAnother segment, likely smaller, showed marginal positive Adjusted EBITDA: $2 million in 2019, $32 million in 2020, and then a decline to $(65) million in 2021, pointing to volatility and perhaps increased investments, cost pressures, or reduced revenue in 2021.\n![A segment displays small gains in Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 and 2020, then a small loss in 2021.](image5)\n\nThe calculation and relevance of Adjusted EBITDA are worth noting. This metric excludes noncash charges like depreciation and amortization, tax effects, financing structure, and certain unusual items to present a clearer view of operational earnings. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess company and segment performance, as well as for incentive compensation, because it focuses on the underlying trends of ongoing operations[3][4].\n\nDrivers of the yearly changes include the broad impacts of COVID-19 in 2020, which led to declines in revenue and increased certain costs (notably severance and restructuring) across segments. In 2021, Adjusted EBITDA improved due to higher revenues stemming from market recovery, especially in media and events, cost-control measures being realized (e.g., NBCUniversal severance savings), and growth in key areas such as scalable infrastructure within the Cable Communications segment[7][11][12]. \n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021, Comcast’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA declined during the pandemic but recovered in 2021, while certain segments faced persistent challenges and others exhibited more resilience or volatility. The main reasons for these changes were disruptions and subsequent recoveries tied to the pandemic, cost management actions, and shifting investment and revenue dynamics among the operating units."}

From the management’s view, Global Markets revenue surged by $1,562 million (a 27% increase vs 2019), largely driven by robust growth in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), which rose by $1,541 million (33%). Notably, credit revenues nearly doubled (up 90%) and all major FICC components—Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit—registered solid gains. Equities saw a small increase (2%), while Securities Services and Liquidity & Cash Management revenues both fell, by 12% and 26% respectively. Despite these mixed sub-sector trends, the aggregate outcome was an overall adjusted revenue boost for GBM. \n\n![Global Markets generated a strong increase in revenue in 2020, led by FICC.](image1)\n\nLooking at overall performance, GBM’s net operating income increased, and its adjusted profit before tax rose significantly from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, a 42% jump. Operating expenses were reduced by 36%, and RoTE improved from 0.8% to 3.1%, although this remained below the Group’s risk appetite for returns. Charges for expected credit losses decreased sharply, suggesting effective risk management despite the challenging environment.\n\n![Corporate Centre narrowed its net operating loss and improved profit before tax, though returns were still below appetite.](image3)\n\nIn contrast, the Corporate Centre (encompassing Central Treasury, legacy portfolios, and other non-core activities) reported reduced losses.

The primary driver behind this decline was a substantial reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell by $470 million (44.4%) year-over-year. This decrease was mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as persistent low short-term interest rates continued from the latter half of 2019 throughout 2020 and 2021[12]. Despite these declines, dividend income slightly increased by 3.5% in 2021, partially compensating for the fall in interest earnings, but not enough to offset the overall decrease in net investment income[7].\n\nExamining asset allocation provides further insight. As of December 31, 2021, the balance sheet shows a notable increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, rising from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, reflecting a more conservative shift toward liquidity[6]. Conversely, fixed maturity securities—historically a significant source of interest income—fell from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, mirroring the decline in interest income. Equity securities, which are a key driver of dividend income, grew from $269,498 million to $334,907 million, aligning with the observed increase in dividend income[6].\n\n![Investment income declined sharply, mainly due to lower interest income, while dividend income slightly increased.](image7)\n\nThe composition of fixed maturity securities reveals continued significant holdings in foreign government bonds, with their carrying value at $10,993 million as of 2021, followed by U.S. Treasury ($3,295 million), corporate bonds ($1,761 million), and other categories. However, overall totals declined year-over-year, contributing directly to reduced interest income[1].\n\n![Asset allocation shifted toward cash and equity, while fixed maturity holdings—a main source of interest income—declined.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to persistently low interest rates reducing interest and other investment income, in combination with a strategic shift in asset allocation toward more liquid assets and increased equity holdings, further lowering the contribution from fixed maturity securities."}

First, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Most notably, income from equity method investments jumped by $44 million in 2020, thanks largely to the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial pipelines in June 2019 and an interest in Mattox in April 2020. These strategic acquisitions expanded the earnings base from equity investments. However, these gains were partially offset by a $14 million decrease in dividend income from other investments, which resulted from the change in classification of Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 after those acquisitions. There was also a $4 million increase in other income related to higher distributions from the Poseidon investment in 2020[11].\n\nExamining the broader statement of operations over this period, total revenue grew and the partnership maintained a strong positive operating income. Although operating costs and expenses shifted year-to-year, investment and equity income evidently played a greater role in supporting overall earnings growth across these three years![The consolidated income statement shows consistent increases in equity method income and steady operating performance over 2018-2020.](image4).\n\nIn summary, from 2018 to 2020, Shell Midstream Partners L.P. saw increases in both net income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership, mainly due to higher income from equity method investments driven by pipeline acquisition activity, partially offset by lower dividend income as investment types changed, and supported by growing distributions from certain equity investments.\n\nNet income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership increased each year from 2018 to 2020, mainly due to higher income from equity method investments following key acquisitions, despite some offsetting declines in dividend income and changing investment profiles."}

This surge largely reflects higher prices realized for iron ore, copper, nickel, and other commodities during FY2021.

This means that while efforts to control operating costs contributed slightly, they were not a major driver compared to the impact of commodity price changes.\n\nOther factors, such as exchange rate fluctuations and inflation, exerted negative pressures on EBITDA, but these were not enough to counterbalance the exceptional benefits from increased sales prices.\n\nThis dynamic is reflected in BHP’s financial summary, where Underlying EBITDA rose from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021, showing a substantial year-on-year improvement.\n\n![The table summarizes the drivers of BHP's EBITDA increase, showing a very large positive contribution from higher sales prices, minimal change from operating costs, and some negative impact from exchange rates.](image7)\n\nFurther confirmation comes from the headline financial data, where the growth of Underlying EBITDA corresponds with the bumper year in commodity prices.\n\n![Underlying EBITDA jumped from $22.1 billion in FY2020 to $37.4 billion in FY2021, mirroring the strong commodity price environment.](image2)\n\nIn short, the sharp rise in commodity sales prices was the principal contributor to the increase in BHP’s Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021, while changes in operating cash costs had a minimal positive effect."}

Capital spending remained relatively stable, yet sales of property, plant, and equipment decreased. As a result, free cash flow increased by 15%, from $5,587 million in 2019 to $6,428 million in 2020, highlighting stronger internal cash generation[6].\n\n![Free cash flow increased by 15% in 2020, reflecting stronger operating performance.](image6)\n\nThis improvement in free cash flow gave PepsiCo more flexibility for strategic decisions, such as acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases [5]. It is evident that even during a year full of global uncertainty, PepsiCo managed to sustain, and even enhance, its liquidity position, reporting higher operating cash and a robust ability to meet obligations.\n\nLooking to contractual commitments, as of year-end 2020, PepsiCo's total commitments reached $66,321 million, with the largest portion due in 2026 and beyond. Key liabilities included long-term debt obligations totaling $40,330 million, with scheduled payments, and significant interest expenses on these debts. Operating lease obligations, purchase commitments, and marketing commitments also contribute to near- and medium-term cash outflows.\n\n![Total contractual commitments at year-end 2020 reached $66,321 million, with most due in the long term.](image2)\n\nThe comparison to 2019 reveals a sharp increase in commitments, particularly in debt, as reflected by the jump in average debt obligations from $31,975 million in 2019 to $41,402 million in 2020[3]. This rise accompanies higher cash outflows for investing activities, largely due to acquisitions, and explains the increased leverage and expanded contractual obligations [9]. The inflow from financing activities in 2020 ($3,819 million) contrasts with a cash outflow in 2019 ($(8,489) million), further emphasizing the financing shift[8].\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo’s 2020 financial activities drove a substantial increase in free cash flow, supported by strong operational results, but were accompanied by a marked rise in contractual commitments due to increased borrowing and acquisition activity when compared to 2019."}

Dividend payments increased each year (from $2.63 per share in 2018 to $3.21 in 2019 and $3.72 in 2020), which reflects a higher return to shareholders and results in a greater reduction in retained earnings even as net income also grew [9][4][8]. Furthermore, stock repurchases and other comprehensively reported income losses also affected the changes in retained earnings.\n\nReviewing other information, the company highlighted robust cash generation in 2020—free cash flow was $5.5 billion and 38% of revenue. The company returned approximately 109% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases and dividends, aligning with its capital management strategy [12]. These distributions further reduced retained earnings despite increasing net income.\n\nSumming up, from 2018 to 2020, the company's net income increased, as did dividends per share and total distributions to shareholders. These distributions, especially the aggressive repurchases and rising dividends, were the most significant factors reducing retained earnings, even as net income performance strengthened.\n\nIn summary: The company's retained earnings grew more slowly than net income from 2018 to 2020, because although net income increased, large and rising dividend payments and share repurchases significantly reduced the additions to retained earnings over this period."}

Non-controlling interests increased from RMB 88 million to RMB 486 million in the same period, reflecting additional investments and possibly the allocation of portions of profit to these interests.\n\n![2020 saw strong profit and fair value gains boosting total equity, with active equity transactions.](image2)\n\nDuring 2021, the dynamics shifted. While there was still an increase in retained earnings (from RMB 11,111 million to RMB 14,194 million), indicating continued profitability, the profit for the year was lower than in 2020. The overall total equity attributable to equity holders actually declined from RMB 52,731 million to RMB 51,055 million by the end of 2021. This reduction can be traced predominantly to fair value losses on financial assets (as seen by a sharp decrease in \"other reserves\"), and substantial increases in treasury shares due to share repurchases (treasury shares moved from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million). Shares held for share award schemes also rose, indicating more equity was set aside for employee compensation. These movements offset profit contributions. Non-controlling interests continued to rise modestly, going from RMB 486 million to RMB 738 million.\n\n![In 2021, equity was affected by lower profits, fair value losses, and increased treasury shares due to buybacks.](image5)\n\nThe company's income statement supports these changes by showing that while revenue continued to grow, profit for the year declined in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to rising costs and lower margins. This directly impacted the retention of earnings added to equity in 2021.\n\n![Revenue grew but lower profit dampened increases to retained earnings in 2021 versus 2020.](image8)\n\nIn summation, 2020 experienced robust growth in total equity driven by profits and fair value gains, along with positive effects from equity-related transactions. In 2021, equity declined slightly for equity holders due to fair value losses on financial assets, share repurchases, and lower profit, even as non-controlling interests increased.\n\nTo plainly answer: Over 2020 and 2021, equity components changed mainly due to profit fluctuations, fair value changes on assets, share-based compensation, and especially share repurchases; 2020 saw equity growth, while 2021 experienced a modest decrease attributable to fair value losses and buybacks."}

This turnaround was primarily driven by multiple segments:\n\n- In the Media segment, revenue expanded by 20.3% to $22.8 billion, despite an 18.0% decline in Adjusted EBITDA. This was mainly due to the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics (which contributed $1.8 billion in revenue), growth in distribution, advertising, and the effects of a lower prior-year base caused by the pandemic[6].\n- Studios revenue rebounded by 16.2% to $9.4 billion as production operations returned to capacity and content licensing increased.\n- Theme Parks showed a remarkable comeback, with revenue climbing 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA moving from -$0.5 billion in 2020 to $1.3 billion in 2021, after widespread closures and restrictions in 2020 due to the pandemic[6].\n\nPeacock, NBCUniversal’s streaming platform, made a significant impact on the Media segment’s financials. Its revenue jumped from $118 million in 2020 to $778 million in 2021, but with a substantial increase in operating costs from $781 million to $2.5 billion, reflecting heavy content investment and expansion efforts[6].\n\nDespite these revenue gains, there was an evident trend of declining customer relationships, particularly in Sky, as net customer relationships fell slightly from 23.2 million in 2020 to 23.0 million in 2021, marking a net loss of 198,000 customers in 2021[5]. This was primarily attributed to reduced broadcast rights in Italy, which led to lower customer retention and average revenue per customer in that market[11].\n\n![NBCUniversal experienced a net loss of 198,000 customer relationships from 2020 to 2021, compared to a slight net loss in 2020 and a gain in 2019.](image5)\n\nNonetheless, NBCUniversal managed to increase its average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, an 8.7% increase, demonstrating strong pricing and product mix improvements that helped offset modest declines in the customer base[8].\n\n![Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% from 2020 to 2021, reaching $59.29.](image8)\n\nThe interplay of recovering revenues (especially in Theme Parks and Studios) and higher per-customer revenue, despite modest customer relationship declines, contributed to NBCUniversal’s stronger overall financial performance in 2021.\n\nIn summary, NBCUniversal’s financial performance from 2019 to 2021 was shaped by pandemic-driven fluctuations, with a strong rebound in revenue and profitability in 2021, fueled by higher per-customer revenue and recovery in key business segments, despite a slight decline in customer relationships."}

The committee not only manages the identification and appointment of new Non-executive Directors, but also oversees ongoing training, development, and the maintenance of a diverse and effective Board.\n\nThe Committee contributes to succession planning by reviewing and agreeing on briefings and learning opportunities tailored to each Director’s committee memberships and the Board’s evolving areas of focus. This ensures an aligned approach to induction, learning, succession planning, renewal, and committee composition—all integral to identifying and recommending suitable Non-executive Director candidates[1][2].\n\nBoard succession is treated as an ongoing process. The Committee annually assesses the Board’s current skills and anticipates future requirements, setting clear succession plans that balance continuity with new perspectives. For new appointments, it provides a detailed role description based on required criteria and attributes. It then engages global search firms, reviews shortlisted candidates through interviews with the Chair and Nominations Committee, and recommends the preferred candidate for Board approval. Thorough background and reference checks are performed before the issuance of a written letter of appointment, ensuring terms of service, independence, and expectations are clearly outlined. This entire process is underpinned by a firm commitment to diversity, experience, and the ability to adapt to BHP’s evolving needs, while also preparing pipelines for future committee members, particularly for the Nomination and Governance Committee itself.\n\n![The eight-step board succession planning process ensures diversity, thoroughness, and clear appointment procedures.](image1)\n\nContinuous training and development are also core responsibilities. After an initial induction program, Non-executive Directors participate in a structured training and development program covering business, governance, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. These programs are periodically reviewed and are designed to incorporate feedback from director performance evaluations, thus promoting ongoing improvement and alignment with the company’s objectives[8]. Briefings, development sessions, and site visits offer Directors deep insights into BHP’s operations and current challenges, often tailored and updated to meet emerging priorities for the business.\n\n![Briefings, development sessions, and site visits support ongoing director development by providing operational insights and strategic context.](image4)\n\nThe Committee further ensures a robust governance system by managing actual or potential conflicts of interest and upholding Director independence. They regularly review requests for conflict authorizations, recommend actions to the Board, and update existing authorizations to ensure decisions meet both legal requirements and best practice governance standards[11].\n\nFinally, board composition and succession planning are monitored for diversity and tenure balance to maintain an inclusive, effective Board. At June 2021, most board members had less than six years of tenure, with representation across multiple regions and approximately one-third female membership, demonstrating the Committee’s ongoing commitment to diversity and renewal.\n\n![Board tenure and diversity statistics show sustained efforts towards diversity and balanced tenure distribution.](image6)\n\nIn summary, BHP’s Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a continuous, eight-step process involving role definition, search, evaluation, appointment, and ongoing director development, all managed with a focus on diversity, independence, and strategic fit."}

Under the Standardized approach, Credit Risk RWA rose from $342,684 million to $387,066 million—a $44,382 million increase. For the Advanced approach, it climbed from $228,927 million to $284,930 million, a $56,003 million gain. This growth was primarily driven by higher derivatives exposures due to market volatility, increased investment securities following the E*TRADE acquisition, and larger lending commitments, as well as higher equity investments and asset values[3].

Specifically, total net interest income decreased by $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, whereas the previous year had seen an increase of $4,452 million. This sharp drop was primarily due to a large fall in interest income, especially from interest-bearing deposits, loans and leases, and related financial instruments, which was only partially offset by a decrease in interest expenses. Additionally, interest expense for the same period decreased by $5,627 million (2019 to 2020) compared to an increase of $714 million from 2018 to 2019, reflecting lower funding costs in 2020 as a result of falling interest rates and shifts in financial market conditions.\n\n![Net interest income dropped sharply due to greater fall in interest income compared to expenses between 2019 and 2020.](image2)\n\nThe organizational structure of Bank of America is highly segmented, with its major business lines (Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, All Other) specializing in various core and supporting financial activities. Changes in net interest income and expenses directly influenced each segment according to their roles. For example, Consumer Banking and Global Banking, both heavily exposed to lending and deposit activities, were significantly impacted by the decline in interest rates as reflected by reductions in both net interest income and overall segment revenue. The organization’s centralized asset and liability management in the \"All Other\" segment also played a role in mitigating total expense, but could not fully offset the system-wide pressure on yields.\n\n![Bank of America’s diversified structure spreads rate risk across Consumer, Wealth, Corporate, Markets, and ALM lines.](image1)\n\nThis structure, with its combination of retail, commercial, and investment arms, helps absorb shocks by distributing rate movements’ effects, but it also means that systemic economic downturns or broad rate shifts (like those seen in 2020 during the pandemic) result in pronounced declines across multiple segments, as their core interest-sensitive activities are hit simultaneously. Therefore, the changes in net interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020—marked by a sharp decrease in interest income and a partial offset from lower expenses—reflect how Bank of America’s integrated, multi-segment structure both spreads and concentrates risks tied to broad macroeconomic changes.\n\nIn summary, net interest income dropped steeply from 2019 to 2020 due to a greater decline in interest income than the decrease in interest expense, a reversal of the prior year’s growth, and this trend affected all core banking segments in line with the bank’s organizational setup."}

Specifically, net investment income dropped from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021, reflecting a continued downward trend from prior years.

The net cash used in financing activities for 2021 totals $(14,933) million, and for 2020 it was $(9,068) million, with the issuance and redemption of preferred shares being a significant component in these totals, though also influenced by other financing actions like debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases.  \n![Issuance and redemption of preferred shares affected 2021 cash flows within financing activities, partly offset by other financing actions.](image3)\n\nOn the shareholders’ equity side, the balance sheet shows that preferred shares remained at $1,600 million for both 2020 and 2021, indicating that the overall level of preferred shares outstanding did not change—older series were replaced by the newly issued ones, maintaining the total[4].  \n![Preferred shares outstanding remained constant at $1,600 million in equity, reflecting replacement rather than net increase or decrease.](image4)\n\nIn sum, the impact of the issuance and redemption of preferred shares in 2020 and 2021 resulted in inflows and outflows within financing cash flows, while the total amount of preferred shares in shareholders’ equity remained unchanged due to full replacements."}

For 2021, the table shows that total consolidated assets slightly decreased compared to 2020. This shift may indicate more efficient asset utilization or strategic adjustments in asset structure, potentially reflecting proactive working capital management or disposals of underperforming assets.  \n![Total consolidated assets slightly decreased from 2020 to 2021.](image1)\n\nFor cash flow from operating activities, there was a robust increase year-on-year. The consolidated cash flow statement indicates net cash provided by operating activities rose significantly—from approximately $6.3 billion in 2020 to $7.2 billion in 2021. Both the text and the table highlight that this improvement was mainly due to higher profits for the year, increased accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower incentive payments, though partially dampened by higher working capital requirements, particularly in receivables and inventory.  \n![Consolidated operating cash flow increased noticeably from 2020 to 2021.](image2)\n\nThis positive trend suggests stronger core business performance, enhanced profitability, and a healthy cash conversion cycle despite some headwinds in working capital. Higher operating cash flow provides the company with more flexibility for investments, debt repayments, and shareholder returns, while the slight reduction in total assets could point to ongoing optimization of the balance sheet. For business operations, these changes imply increased financial resilience and the capacity to pursue growth opportunities or navigate periods of uncertainty.\n\nDirect answer: From 2020 to 2021, total consolidated assets slightly decreased, while cash flow from operating activities increased significantly, implying improved profitability, stronger cash generation, and operational flexibility for the business."}

Over the same period, total liabilities decreased from $168,383 million to $166,371 million, a reduction of $2,012 million. The overall financial position reflects that both the asset base and the liability obligations contracted slightly year over year, despite strong operating performance.\n\n![Total assets and liabilities decreased between 2020 and 2021, showing contraction in the financial position.](image1)\n\nDelving deeper, the composition of these balance sheet changes underscores several notable factors. Cash and cash equivalents notably declined from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in card member loans and receivables, repayments of debt, share repurchases, and reduced customer deposits, as described in the accompanying notes [9]. Card member receivables and card member loans, after reserves for credit losses, increased significantly—card member receivables rose from $43,434 million to $53,581 million and card member loans from $68,029 million to $85,257 million—reflecting higher consumer spending and lending activities. Simultaneously, investment securities dropped sharply from $21,631 million to $2,591 million, indicating reallocation of assets and liquidity deployment elsewhere. On the liabilities side, customer deposits decreased from $86,875 million to $84,382 million, and long-term debt declined from $42,952 million to $38,675 million.\n\nThese balance sheet movements connect directly to the company’s comprehensive income and cash flows. The comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, a significant rebound from $2,977 million in 2020, reflecting robust net income (which increased from $3,135 million in 2020 to $8,060 million in 2021) and moderate other comprehensive losses [2].\n\n![Comprehensive income saw a major increase in 2021 due to higher net income, offset slightly by other comprehensive losses.](image2)\n\nCash flow data provides further insight: net cash provided by operating activities increased to $14,645 million in 2021 from $5,591 million in 2020, driven by the stronger operating performance tied to higher net income and increased receivables. However, net cash used in investing activities was ($10,529) million in 2021, reflecting higher card member loans and reduced securities, compared to $11,632 million provided by investing activities in 2020. Net cash used in financing activities also increased to ($14,933) million, largely due to repayments of debt and greater share repurchases [9].\n\n![Cash flows reflect increased cash generation from operations, significant use of cash for investing and financing activities, and a large decline in year-end cash balances.](image7)\n\nIn summary, total assets and total liabilities both declined from 2020 to 2021, reflecting reduced liquidity and debt levels despite higher lending and receivables. These changes are tightly linked to improved comprehensive income and increased cash flow from operations; however, substantial cash expenditures for investing and financing activities contributed to the decrease in year-end cash balances. \n\nTo answer directly: From 2020 to 2021, the entity's total assets and liabilities both decreased, primarily due to declines in cash, investment securities, deposits, and long-term debt, even as comprehensive income rose and operating cash flows improved, with asset reallocation and cash outflows for financing activities driving overall contraction in the balance sheet."}

This drastic fall was primarily due to a steep increase in expected credit losses—up by more than 200%—driven by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly affecting the UK and Asia, and a hit from lower global interest rates. Adjusted ECLs rose from $1,162 million in 2019 to $4,754 million in 2020, reflecting the challenging economic environment. Nonetheless, CMB maintained lower operating expenses through cost-cutting measures, such as a decrease in performance-related pay and discretionary spending, even as it continued to invest in digital and transaction banking capabilities[5][7][8][10][12].\n\n![CMB net operating income dropped 12%, and profit before tax dropped 74% in 2020 compared to 2019.](image1)\n\nIn contrast, Wealth and Personal Banking showed an even sharper fall in net operating income, from $25,565 million in 2019 to $22,013 million in 2020—a year-over-year decline of 14%. The drop was largely attributed to lower net interest income, impacted by declining global interest rates and reduced customer activity amid the pandemic. The segment also saw a substantial reduction in non-interest income, primarily due to lower fees earned on unsecured lending products. Although there were increased adjusted expected credit losses (ECLs) by $1.5 billion, the absolute level of profit before tax was higher than in CMB[8][9][10].\n\n![WPB’s net operating income dropped 14% in 2020 compared to 2019, a sharper decline than CMB.](image8)\n\nWhen comparing profit before tax, WPB had a profit before tax of $1.9 billion in 2020, just marginally above CMB’s $1.868 billion for the same period.

The depreciation for leasehold improvements follows the lease term, while hardware and software are depreciated over three years, as detailed in the depreciation policy.

The effective tax rate mirrors this pattern, plunging from 41% in 2019 to 9% in 2020, then rising to 12% in 2021. This fluctuation is largely attributable to non-recurring tax events in 2019, notably the $2,472 million derecognition of deferred tax assets related to distributed intellectual property, as the company had to reverse the federal tax basis step-up after new Treasury Department regulations and agreement with the IRS[8]. In that same year, a $570 million tax benefit was recorded from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets due to “check-the-box” elections for certain foreign subsidiaries, further affecting the overall provision.\n\n![The table highlights that the effective tax provision spiked in 2019 and fell sharply in 2020, before partially rebounding in 2021, also showing a similarly fluctuating effective tax rate.](image2)\n\nLooking at the breakdown by jurisdiction, in 2019 there was a very high federal current and deferred tax provision, while 2020 and 2021 saw much lower figures, with a negative or greatly reduced federal deferred tax provision. These reductions are due in part to the absence of large one-off charges (such as the intellectual property deferred tax asset derecognition in 2019)[8].\n\n![The jurisdictional breakdown shows a sharp shift from large federal deferred tax expenses in 2019 to negative (beneficial) provisions in 2020 and 2021, with overall lower total provisions in those years.](image7)\n\nOther significant trends include the steady increase in unrecognized tax benefits, rising from $1,705 million at the end of 2019 to $1,901 million at the end of 2020, and reaching $2,136 million at the end of 2021, driven primarily by anticipated refunds of Korean withholding taxes[10].\n\n![Unrecognized tax benefits increased annually, reflecting growing uncertainty or ongoing disputes with tax authorities.](image5)\n\nShare-based compensation tax benefits and R&D credits provided consistent, though increasing, reductions to tax provisions each year, reflecting growth in both share-based compensation and research activities as well as favorable tax treatment for these expenses[1][2].\n\nIn summary, the main driver behind the dramatic year-to-year swings in Qualcomm’s tax provisions and rates from 2019-2021 is the presence or absence of non-recurring tax charges relating to intellectual property transactions and regulatory adjustments, alongside more gradual, structurally-driven growth in share-based compensation and research tax benefits.\n\nThus, Qualcomm’s tax provision spiked in 2019 due to unique intellectual property deferred tax events and dropped sharply in the following years as those non-recurring charges were absent, while ongoing increases in tax benefits from share-based compensation and R&D incentives contributed steady downward pressure on the provision."}

There were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion across the year, but the defining event was the removal of $587.1 billion from AUM due to the sale itself, which left only a small remaining balance at year-end.

However, there was a corresponding decrease in regular asset-based fees in subsequent periods, since WFAM had been a source of recurring advisory and management revenues[4].

The net interest income fell by $5.5 billion, from $48.9 billion in 2019 to $43.4 billion in 2020, driven largely by lower interest rates, which was only partially mitigated by reduced deposit and funding costs, and redeployment of excess deposits into securities[6]. This drop in interest income significantly outpaced the decline in interest expense, which decreased by $5.6 billion in the same period.\n\nThe underlying figures demonstrate that the decrease in net interest income was broad-based across various sources. Interest income from interest-bearing deposits and loans declined sharply, while interest expense—mainly the cost associated with interest-bearing deposits and short-term funding—also decreased but not enough to cover the steeper fall in income. Notably, total interest income declined by nearly $19.7 billion, while interest expense decreased by about $5.6 billion, indicating the primary drag came from the income side rather than from costs.\n\n![Interest income fell sharply, while interest expense declined but by a smaller margin, leading to a lower net interest spread.](image1)\n\nThe reduction in net interest income led directly to a narrowing of the net interest spread. According to available data, the total deposit spreads declined from 2.34% in 2019 to 1.94% in 2020, confirming that the institution’s ability to earn more on assets than it paid on liabilities was squeezed over the year.\n\n![Total deposit spreads narrowed: from 2.34% in 2019 to 1.94% in 2020.](image3)\n\nThe main factors contributing to this scenario were a general decline in market interest rates, the redeployment of excess deposit balances into lower-yielding long-term securities, and the corresponding decrease in interest income from loans and investment securities. Although there was some offset from reduced deposit and funding costs, it was not enough to compensate for the much larger drop in interest-earning asset yields[6][2].\n\nIn summary: The net interest spread narrowed from 2019 to 2020, mainly because a sharp decline in interest income on loans and securities outpaced a decline in interest expense, largely due to lower interest rates and a shift of excess deposits into long-term securities."}

The payment of cash dividends reduced retained earnings, as observed in the changes to the equity components, and constituted a significant outflow of cash, as detailed in the consolidated cash flow data. Specifically, substantial cash was paid out to shareholders, reducing both the equity account via retained earnings and cash balances through financing activities. Treasury stock transactions—primarily share repurchases—reduced Chevron’s equity by increasing the treasury stock (at cost) line and decreasing outstanding shares. These transactions also represented an outflow in the cash flow statement under financing activities.\n\nLooking at the detailed table of equity changes, we see that cash dividends resulted in a notable reduction in retained earnings and Chevron’s total equity, reflecting the direct cost to the company’s capital structure. Purchases of treasury stock (share repurchases) further reduced total equity and resulted in fewer outstanding shares. Conversely, issuances of treasury shares, if any, would have the opposite effect, though the net impact in 2021 was a reduction, indicating a net repurchase position.\n![Treasury stock purchases and dividend payments reduced retained earnings and total equity, as treasury stock at cost increased and outstanding shares decreased.](image5)\n\nIn the cash flow picture, these equity transactions are traced as outflows from financing activities.

Previously, certain leases were not recognized on the balance sheet; instead, operating lease payments and any associated provisions (such as those for onerous leases) were treated as periodic expenses or provisions. Under AASB 16, the Group recognized both a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all leases on the balance sheet, applying a single on-balance sheet model[4][6].\n\nAs a result of this change, on initial application of AASB 16, the Group recognized a lease liability of $143,621,000, with a closing balance on 28 June 2020 of $167,154,000. This represented a significant new liability that was not recorded under the old standard. The lease liability was further increased by new leases and remeasurements of lease terms during 2020—liabilities recognized during the period added $50,245,000, and re-measurements $1,559,000.

The major components consist of significant amounts of goodwill ($1,132 million), intangible assets ($276 million), as well as cash and accounts receivable, offset by accounts payable, unearned revenue, and deferred tax liabilities. The substantial balance of goodwill suggests that the premium paid was mainly attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities, not to identifiable tangible or intangible assets. Intangible assets here are comprised specifically of developed technology and customer relationships, valued at $215 million and $61 million respectively, each with clearly defined useful lives, indicating a notable investment in field service management technology and customer base.\n\n![ClickSoftware's net assets include large goodwill and intangibles with specific values for technology and customer relationships.](image8)\n\nThe Salesforce.org acquisition, on the other hand, resulted in net assets acquired of only $134 million, with much smaller balances for both goodwill ($164 million) and intangible assets.

This modest reduction was mainly due to unfavorable currency movements, increased working capital needs, and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, though these were partly offset by higher net earnings and derecognition of trade receivables sold, which had a positive effect on operating cash flows [6][4][11].  \n![Summary of net cash flows from operating and investing activities 2020-2018](image1)\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2020, which represented a decrease of $0.7 billion from 2019. This reduction was primarily attributed to the prior year’s deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures, although it was partly offset by higher cash collateral posted for derivative hedges [2][5]. Lower capital expenditures in 2020 ($0.6 billion versus $0.9 billion in 2019) also contributed to this change.\n\nOn the financing side, net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion year-over-year to $8.5 billion in 2020, a change driven mainly by higher dividend payments and increased payments to noncontrolling interests, only partly offset by debt activities [3].  \n![Details of financing cash flows, including dividends and changes in debt](image4)\n\nThe synthesis of these cash flows results in the following movement of the overall cash balance: At the beginning of 2019, the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash stood at $6,620 million, increasing to $6,865 million at the end of 2019. By the end of 2020, this balance had climbed to $7,285 million. The increase in 2020, despite higher cash outflows from financing, was supported by strong operating cash flows and a significant reduction in cash used for investing activities, plus a positive effect from exchange rate changes.  \n![Ending cash balances and year-over-year changes](image4)\n\nIn summary, the overall cash balance at year-end increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily because robust operating cash flows and reduced investing outflows more than offset the increased outflows from financing activities."}

For example, the annual total remuneration for each executive considers consolidated operating income (indicative of business performance), volatility in Toyota’s share price (an indicator for shareholder value), and individual performance evaluations [1][11]. These indicators are concisely summarized in the following table:\n\n![Toyota’s remuneration evaluation links business results, share price movement, and personal performance assessment.](image5)\n\nThe evaluation weighting further underscores this link: half of the performance-linked remuneration is based on the degree of attainment of consolidated operating income (financial health and operational success), and the other half on the comparative volatility of Toyota's share price versus the Nikkei average (measuring shareholder value creation and risk management) [7].\n\n![Toyota uses 50% weight each for consolidated operating income and share price volatility in executive evaluation.](image7)\n\nThe details are transparently reflected in the reported breakdown of executive remuneration, which lists significant sums devoted to bonuses and share-based compensation, both classic forms of performance-linked pay. This ensures that a meaningful proportion of executive rewards is directly tied to both company success and the creation of shareholder value, not just base salary.\n\n![Toyota’s remuneration table shows significant amounts linked to variable, performance-based elements like bonuses and shares.](image2)\n\nIn short, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance through the use of consolidated operating income and individual performance metrics, and shareholder value through share price volatility, with each contributing substantially to compensation decisions and payouts."}

In 2021, the discount rate generally increased across regions: for instance, for the euro area, it rose from 0.9% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021, for the U.S. dollar from 2.4% to 2.7%, and for the British pound from 1.7% to 1.9%![Slight increases in discount rates across major currencies from 2020 to 2021](image2). Inflated discount rates typically reduce the present value of future pension obligations (all else equal), potentially lowering the defined benefit obligation.\n\nHowever, compensation increase rates and pension progression also rose in some key markets. In the United Kingdom, the compensation increase rate went up from 2.6% to 3.0%, and pension progression rates also climbed from 2.6% to 3.0% over the same period. In Switzerland, the compensation increase rose from 1.4% to 1.5%![Increases in compensation and pension progression rates for UK and Switzerland](image3). Such changes can increase the present value of obligations, offsetting some effects of higher discount rates.\n\nActuarial gains and losses also reflect these assumption shifts. For 2021, changes in financial assumptions led to a loss of €26 million, whereas, in 2020, they led to a gain of €72 million. The overall total actuarial gains and losses shifted from a loss of €67 million in 2020 to a gain of €22 million in 2021, signifying that assumption changes (mainly in rates) were less favorable in 2021![Actuarial gains and losses demonstrate impact of assumption changes](image4).\n\nSensitivity analysis shows that a half percentage point increase in the discount rate for 2021 would reduce the defined benefit obligation by €242 million, while a decrease would increase it by €271 million, illustrating how sensitive the obligation is to rate shifts. Changes in compensation and pension progression, though less pronounced, also have material effects![Discount rate changes have the largest effect on obligation sensitivity](image7).\n\nDespite these changes in assumptions affecting obligations, the fair value of plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021.

Despite this significant investment, accumulated depreciation rose from $3,734 million to $5,117 million, which tempered the effect of the increased gross assets.

Comprehensive income, which includes net income plus other comprehensive gains or losses (such as foreign currency translation adjustments, pension plan adjustments, and cash flow hedge activities), also flows directly into shareholders’ equity through the “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” section.\n\nLooking at the figures over the three years, net income attributable to Accenture PLC was $4,059,907 in 2018, $4,779,112 in 2019, and $5,107,839 in 2020, reflecting consistent profitability. Comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC, which adds in other comprehensive items, shows $3,578,520 in 2018, $4,514,706 in 2019, and $5,386,579 in 2020, indicating even broader gains in total value created for shareholders during these periods.\n\nThese income contributions are visible in the equity statements.

The equity table for 2020, for example, shows net income of $5,107,839 and other comprehensive income of $278,740 (both before noncontrolling interests), which were key factors driving the total shareholders' equity balance to $17,499,173 by the end of 2020.

This expansion was not limited to existing markets like Australia and New Zealand, but was especially notable in new regions such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. These additions signal Lovisa’s deliberate targeting of large international markets, while also establishing stores in developing regions and supporting franchised stores in the Middle East and Vietnam. The consistent annual increase in stores demonstrates Lovisa's ability to execute on its strategic objective to expand globally and capitalize on international opportunities:\n![Steady rise in Lovisa store counts across regions from 2016 to 2020.](image1)\n\nThe company’s business strategy during these years revolved around several growth pillars: international expansion, supply chain efficiency, enhancing store performance, brand proliferation, and trend leadership. Critical achievements included the opening of 47 stores outside Australia in a single year, with ongoing rollouts in the USA, UK, and France. The strategy also emphasized pilot programs in trial markets and franchising in selected territories, allowing Lovisa to remain nimble and responsive to international opportunities. However, this growth came with risks: high competition in the international fast fashion jewellery market, challenges in securing suitable locations, uncertainty in retail environments, and broader economic conditions. Yet, Lovisa’s refined store rollout model—targeting high-traffic sites and fitting out stores in about 14 days—enabled a relatively rapid and cost-effective expansion pace, facilitating quick response to market opportunities[3][8][9].\n![Summary table of Lovisa's strategic growth pillars, associated risks, and achievements from 2016 to 2020.](image2)\n\nTo support its expansion and product flow, Lovisa utilized centralized warehouses in Melbourne and China, leveraging daily inventory monitoring and rapid airfreight to supply stores within 48 hours, which helped mitigate supply chain and inventory risks[1]. Over 56% of products were routed via the China warehouse, reflecting successful supply chain optimization and the ability to manage a diversified and fast-moving international network. Nevertheless, challenges such as exchange rate fluctuations and potential supply chain disruptions were acknowledged as ongoing risks.\n\nOverall, Lovisa’s international expansion from 2016 to 2020 was marked by aggressive and agile growth, successful entry and scaling in key global markets, optimization of store models for swift deployment, and supply chain excellence, even as it navigated industry competition, location challenges, and the unpredictability of global retail conditions.\n\nIn summary: From 2016 to 2020, Lovisa’s international store expansion strategy evolved with rapid growth and diversification into new markets, achieving notable increases in store numbers and efficient global rollout, while facing challenges in competition, location sourcing, and supply chain risks."}

This reduction was primarily attributed to significantly lower market interest rates across major currencies, which led to a decrease in interest income (from $54.7 billion in 2019 to $41.8 billion in 2020, a drop of $12.9 billion or 24%) despite an increase in average interest-earning assets by $170.1 billion, or 8.8%. The decline in yield on these assets (down by 84 basis points) was the main driver of reduced interest income, only partially compensated by asset growth[4][9]. \n\nOn the expense side, interest expense fell sharply to $14.2 billion in 2020 from $22.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of $8 billion or ~36%. The reduction in interest expense was mainly due to the decrease in funding costs, as shown by the lower expense associated with customer accounts, deposits, repurchase agreements, and debt securities, reflecting the widespread drop in global interest rates[11]. \n\nThe result of these changes is vividly illustrated below:\n\n![Financial data table showing interest income dropped to $41.8bn, interest expense to $14.2bn, NII to $27.6bn in 2020.](image1)\n\nThe net impact of these movements was a shrinkage in net interest income, which, together with weakened other income streams and higher expected credit losses, translated into a significant drop in total operating income and, subsequently, operating profit. The net operating income before credit provisions (after accounting for reduced NII as well as other business lines' results) experienced a material decline as seen in the summary:\n\n- Net operating income before credit provisions for 2020 dropped in line with reduced NII and lower trading and fee income.\n- The impairment of goodwill and increased credit impairment charges further reduced operating profit.\n- Reported profit before tax in 2020 plummeted by 34% to $8.8 billion, and adjusted profit before tax fell by 45% to $12.1 billion.\n- Overall return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was only 3.1%, a sharp fall from 8.4% in 2019, indicating much-reduced profitability[1].\n\nThis overall profit compression is summarized here:\n\n![Table shows net interest income, profit before tax, and RoTE all notably lower in 2020 than in 2019.](image7)\n\nIn summary, the significant decline in net interest income—driven by falling interest rates and only partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets—along with the reduction in interest expense, led to lower net operating income.

Similarly, the total operating lease liabilities rose from $797 million to $974 million during the same period. The weighted average remaining lease term remained steady at 7 years, but the discount rate slightly decreased from 3.1% to 2.8%. The maturity schedule shows operating lease liabilities growing across near-term and long-term obligations, indicating more lease agreements or expansions in 2020 compared to the previous year, which augmented the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet associated with leases. ![The table presents data for 2020 and 2019 on operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, lease terms, and discount rates, showing increases in lease assets and liabilities in 2020.](image4)\n\nIn terms of inventory, the total value grew substantially from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020.

The rise in inventories contributes to a higher current asset base, indicating readiness for greater sales or a response to increased demand, acquisitions, or expansion of operations. These asset increases can reflect strategic investments or operational growth, while higher lease liabilities imply higher future payment commitments.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2020, the company’s lease assets and liabilities both increased due to greater leasing activity, while inventories grew significantly, predominantly from higher finished goods and raw materials, and these shifts amplified both the asset and liability figures reported in the financial statements."}

This relationship is detailed in the summary of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\n![Deferred tax assets rose slightly while liabilities fell sharply, resulting in higher net deferred tax asset.](image4)\n\nThe sizable decrease in deferred tax liabilities was mainly attributable to reductions related to \"property, plant, and equipment\" as well as \"acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments.\" Specifically, liabilities for property, plant, and equipment dropped from $164 million to $116 million, and those for acquisition-related intangibles declined from $82 million to $40 million. The company also experienced a $249 million reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities due to the effective settlement of a large depreciation-related tax issue, which further reduced accrued interest and bolstered earnings outside of the deferred tax asset calculation [1].

At the beginning of FY20 (1 July 2019), they held 4,140,000 shares, and during the year, they purchased an additional 1,687,764 shares. This brought their total holdings to 5,827,764 shares as of 28 June 2020.

The primary driver of cost remains service costs, which accounted for 89.3% of total cost of revenues in 2019 and declined slightly, making up 87.0% by 2021. Meanwhile, \"other cost of revenues\" rose from 10.7% in 2019 to 13.0% in 2021, signaling that items like agency fees and payment channel fees became more significant contributors over time[2][6]. \n\n![Service costs remained the dominant portion, but other costs, including agency and channel fees, increased their share.](image6)\n\nBreaking down the actual numbers: in 2019, total costs of revenues were RMB 16,761 million, rising to RMB 21,840 million by 2021—a growth rate that matches increases in total revenues but could indicate rising marginal costs or investments in operational infrastructure. Service costs grew, but at a slightly slower pace than overall revenues, while \"other\" costs (employee benefits, advertising agency fees, etc.) saw a proportionately larger jump[7]. This suggests the company was not only scaling its core content and delivery costs but also spending more to support platform operations and payment processing.\n\nLooking at operating expenses—which include selling and marketing as well as general and administrative costs—there was a clear and substantial increase from RMB 4,744 million in 2019 to RMB 6,687 million in 2021. Notably, general and administrative expenses grew at a faster pace, rising from RMB 2,703 million (57% of total operating expenses in 2019) to RMB 4,009 million (60% in 2021). Selling and marketing expenses, in contrast, grew more moderately and actually declined as a share of total operating expenses from 43% to 40% over the period[10][12].\n\n![General and administrative expenses became a larger share of operating expenses, while selling/marketing’s share declined slightly.](image2)\n\nThe composition of these expenses is telling: general and administrative costs are dominated by salaries, benefits, and research and development (R&D), showing an ongoing investment in talent and product innovation rather than purely in administrative overhead[5][6][10]. Selling and marketing expenses are largely focused on branding, user acquisition, and related personnel costs, and their more measured increase reflects a potential optimization of promotional expenditures.\n\nFrom a financial management perspective, these shifts hint at a strategy focused on building long-term value—investing in technology, platform capabilities, and operational support—while seeking efficiency gains in user acquisition and promotion. The growing share of other cost of revenues and general/admin costs could indicate substantial investment in infrastructure, people, and platform quality, which may be intended to underpin further growth or enhance product offerings. The steadier growth in selling and marketing may also suggest a move toward more efficient or internally driven user growth strategies.\n\nIn summary: The company’s cost structure from 2019 to 2021 showed rising total expenses, with service costs still dominant but “other” costs and administrative/R&D expenditures increasing their share. This points to robust investment in core capabilities and operational resilience, while marketing costs were held in check, reflecting disciplined financial management focused on sustainable growth."}

A table of financials reveals a similar narrative: average realised prices for metallurgical coal dropped from $130.97 to $106.64 per tonne between 2020 and 2021, while sales volumes held steady, indicating that falling prices were the most significant headwind[6]. The cost per tonne for Queensland Coal rose sharply, amplifying the detrimental effect of softer prices[8].\n\nFor nickel, the opposite dynamic was observed. BHP realized a significant uptick in average sales price for nickel, from US$13,860 in 2020 to US$16,250 per tonne in 2021, driven by strong global demand, supply disruptions, and investor sentiment tied to developments in battery technology. This created a rebound in prices despite some brief market corrections[6]. As a result, underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million, reflecting the benefits of higher prices and volumes, as well as some cost efficiencies[9].\n\nThe financial sensitivity of BHP to commodity prices can be illustrated succinctly: a US$1 per tonne change in coal price moves EBITDA by US$35 million for metallurgical coal and US$13 million for energy coal; for nickel, a one-cent change in the price per pound impacts both EBITDA and profit after taxation by US$1 million![A table summarizes the estimated financial impact of price changes in oil, copper, iron ore, coal, and nickel on profit and EBITDA.](image5) This quantifies just how tightly daily price moves are connected to BHP's bottom line.\n\nThe report highlights that commodity price volatility is influenced by a range of global economic, geopolitical, demand and supply fundamentals, exchange rate movements, and even technological factors. Since BHP sells its commodities at prevailing market prices, it cannot offset cost increases through price hikes, making the group’s earnings highly sensitive to market swings[4].\n\nIn short, changes in commodity prices—especially coal and nickel—materially affect BHP’s revenues and profits, with coal adversely impacted by price drops and cost pressures, and nickel benefiting strongly from surging demand and prices. The main drivers are global market dynamics, supply disruptions, investor sentiment, and production costs."}

Specifically, the company's net cash from operating activities rose from $14.8 billion in 2019 to $18.2 billion in 2020, indicating a strong operational cash generation over the period [1].

This reflects a proactive step to finance the acquisition of Varian, which is corroborated by comments about the corresponding rise in equity mainly resulting from the new share issuance [8].\n\nOver this period, **retained earnings** also saw growth, sustained by robust net income for both 2020 and 2021. The net income attributed to shareholders was €1,423 million in 2020 and €1,746 million in 2021, showing strong operational performance![Comprehensive income including high net income drives retained earnings upward](image1). However, this gain in retained earnings was partially offset by substantial dividend payments, notably the €856 million distribution for the 2020 fiscal year [7].\n\nShareholders’ equity was further affected by shifts in **other comprehensive income**, particularly large positive currency translation differences in 2021 (€724 million), compared to a negative impact in 2020 (€-768 million).

Specifically, discount revenue rose by 26% year-over-year, driven primarily by a recovery and growth in Card Member spending after the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year[6]. This upswing was enabled by both a substantial increase in worldwide network volumes and strong growth in billed business—core components that fuel discount revenue.\n\nThe worldwide network volumes grew by 24% and exceeded pre-pandemic (2019) levels, while billed business, which constitutes the majority (85%) of network volumes, increased by 25% year-over-year. Global spending in Goods & Services jumped by 19% and was 18% above 2019 levels, while Travel & Entertainment (T&E) spend surged by 59%, reflecting a broad recovery in consumer activity and travel. Notably, the average discount rate also edged higher to 2.30% in 2021 from 2.28% in 2020, partly due to a greater proportion of spending coming from higher-yielding T&E transactions[1][3]. The US market led the year-over-year billed business growth at 26%, driven strongly by consumer and small business spending, while network volumes in the US leapt by 27% and those outside the US rose by 17%[5][8].\n\nThis robust rebound in card activity and the improved mix of spending categories—greater T&E and increased online spending—were central to discount revenue recovery.\n\nThe financial tables further illustrate this trend:  \n![Non-interest revenues, including discount revenue, increased 24% from 2020 to 2021, while interest income continued to decline.](image1)  \n![Worldwide network and billed business volumes surged, supporting higher discount revenue; average discount rate ticked up to 2.30%.](image6)\n\nIn summary, discount revenue increased 26% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a sharp rebound in global network volumes and billed business, higher T&E and online spending, and a slight rise in the average discount rate."}

For Shane Fallscheer, Managing Director, only 33% of his total remuneration for the 2020 financial year is fixed, while 67% is at-risk, meaning it is subject to performance-based short and long-term incentives. In contrast, Chris Lauder, Chief Financial Officer, has a structure where 67% is fixed and 33% is at-risk, reflecting a more conservative exposure to variable rewards based on performance.\n\n![Shane has a majority at-risk, while Chris has a majority fixed remuneration.](image3)\n\nExamining the long-term incentives more closely, both executives participate in a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), but the scale and risk profile differ substantially. For example, Shane was granted significantly more performance rights/ options in both number and monetary value compared to Chris—such as, for the FY19 LTIP, Shane was granted 2,564,103 rights ($8,000,000 value), whereas Chris received only 76,923 rights ($210,000 value). Additionally, both had their FY18 LTIP rights entirely forfeited, but the quantum of risk and reward for Shane is far greater due to the proportion of his pay that is variable.\n\n![Shane is granted many more options and higher values in the LTIP compared to Chris.](image1)\n\nThe overall approach for executive pay emphasizes that Shane’s package is heavily weighted towards performance incentives, with challenging hurdles intended to align his interests with long-term shareholder value creation.

This inflow of equity capital from preferred stock is a key contributor to the overall growth in stockholders’ equity.[6]\n\nThe cash flow statement underscores that 2020 saw a notably large inflow from financing activities, with $1,006 million provided by financing operations, driven by stock issuances and borrowings. Specifically, proceeds from both stock and preferred stock offerings—over $3.4 billion in net proceeds from such activities—directly contributed to equity growth, as these funds are recognized as equity rather than debt on the balance sheet or statement of equity[4][8]. This substantial financing activity coincided with large acquisitions and ongoing operational investments.\n\nThe compounding effect of these capital-raising activities is seen in the sharp increase of total equity, which grew from $23,253 million in 2018 to $30,271 million in 2019, and then to $39,766 million in 2020.

Revenue growth played a substantial role; overall revenue climbed by 7.1% to $64.3 billion in 2021, driven primarily by gains in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, and video sectors, which bolstered operating cash flow[10]. Additionally, a notable factor was the increase in proceeds from investments and other activities, which jumped to $1,246 million in 2021 compared to $190 million in 2020[3]. A reduction in income tax payments—due to tax deductions from a senior notes exchange—also contributed, offsetting the effect of higher taxable income and thereby improving cash flow by $1.3 billion[4]. \n\nOn the other hand, changes in operating assets and liabilities had a negative effect in 2021 relative to 2020. These decreases were mainly related to increased production spending (especially for film and television), the impact of major sporting events like the Tokyo Olympics, increased accounts receivable, and decreased deferred revenue, which together were only partially offset by improved results from theme park operations[9].\n\nIn summary, the growth in net cash from operating activities from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to higher revenue, increased investment proceeds, and lower tax payments, despite the negative impacts from operating asset and liability changes. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities rose by $4.4 billion from 2020 to 2021, chiefly due to higher revenue, increased proceeds from investments, and reduced tax payments."}

Net cash provided by operating activities rose substantially from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020, a year-over-year increase of $3,427 million. This uptick was driven primarily by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables, as well as COVID-19-related tax payment deferrals and exemptions, though partially offset by higher workforce rebalancing payments and cash taxes[1][4][10].\n\n![Operating activities provided $18,197 million in 2020, up from $14,770 million in 2019.](image1)\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased dramatically from $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020—a positive swing of $23,908 million. This shift was primarily the result of a major decrease in cash outflows for acquisitions, with the prior year affected heavily by the Red Hat acquisition. There was a partial offset from less cash provided by non-operating finance receivables as the OEM IT commercial financing operations were wound down[6][9].\n\nIn contrast, financing activities exhibited an opposing movement. In 2019, financing activities were a net source of cash amounting to $9,042 million, but in 2020, they became a net use of cash at $(9,721) million—a swing of $18,763 million. The main factors included repayment and maturities of outstanding debt and the suspension of share repurchases to prioritize debt repayment following the Red Hat acquisition[2][10][11].\n\nThe combined effect of these changes led to IBM’s overall net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash swinging from a decrease of $(3,290) million in 2019 to an increase of $5,361 million in 2020:\n\n- The increase in cash from operating activities provided more funds for IBM to support operations and pay down debt.\n- The reduced outflows on investing activities, predominantly due to fewer acquisitions, conserved cash.\n- The significant use of cash in financing reflected a strategic shift toward deleveraging the balance sheet as opposed to raising or maintaining previous years’ debt levels or repurchasing shares.\n\n![Net change in cash for 2020 was an increase of $5,361 million, compared to a decrease of $(3,290) million in 2019.](image1)\n\nIn summary, compared to 2019, IBM generated more cash from operations, sharply reduced investing outflows, and shifted to significant cash outflows in financing, with the combined impact resulting in a strong positive swing in overall net cash flow in 2020."}

NBCUniversal's growth was driven by increased revenue in the Media segment (which bundled television networks and Peacock), as well as in Theme Parks and Studios. Cable Communications saw gains from broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, and video, partially offset by declines in voice. These align with operational changes where consumer demand for broadband and streaming rose and recoveries in studios and theme parks resumed after pandemic setbacks[11][2]. \n\nFurthermore, revenue increases were boosted by special events like the Tokyo Olympics, which brought in $522 million of additional revenue in the Media segment. Distribution revenue also grew due to rate increases and expanded distribution at Peacock, the company's direct-to-consumer streaming service, despite declines in the number of traditional network subscribers[8]. \n\nThe combination of these factors—strong segmental growth, especially from NBCUniversal and Cable Communications, operational recovery post-pandemic, and the appeal of events and streaming growth—were the core drivers of the revenue surge from 2020 to 2021.\n\nIn summary: Comcast's revenue change from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by growth in NBCUniversal, Cable Communications, and Sky, increased broadband and wireless customers, rising streaming activity, and special event revenue."}

Inditex was conducting a store optimization and streamlining plan between 2020 and 2021, targeted at absorbing stores at the end of their useful life, particularly in younger formats, with the goal of recuperating their sales locally or online. The company explicitly set out to absorb between 1,000 and 1,200 stores over 2020 and 2021, focusing on those with declining performance, which directly led to fewer physical locations by 2022 [12]. The process was nearing its planned conclusion by the end of 2021 [1].\n\nAdditionally, the effects of the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021 had a significant impact, as a large percentage of stores were closed during lockdowns, causing Inditex to reevaluate its store footprint and adapt to shifting consumer habits, including increased online sales [11]. \n\nThe geographical distribution of Inditex stores shifted between 2021 and 2022 with an overall reduction in store numbers across all regions, primarily due to strategic store absorption and optimization initiatives, alongside the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

This ambition is supported by having reached carbon neutrality in its own footprint ahead of schedule, reducing energy use by 40%, and sourcing 100% renewable electricity for its facilities. Any unavoidable emissions are offset by purchasing and retiring carbon credits. These progress markers underpin Bank of America's ability to advise clients on decarbonization and establish itself as a thought leader on climate change within global alliances dedicated to sustainable development [4][8][9][12].\n\nThe bank also transparently reports on its GHG emissions, aligning with the Paris Agreement and the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). They measure and disclose emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 and develop strategies to further align their business with global climate goals and mitigate climate-related risks. For example, in 2019, the societal impact of the bank’s GHG emissions was financially estimated at $238 million using the EPA’s social cost of carbon, emphasizing the real-world consequences of these emissions on society.\n\n![Bank of America reports detailed GHG emission reductions and aligns its climate goals with international frameworks like the TCFD and Paris Agreement, estimating significant financial impacts from societal costs of emissions.](image1)\n\nSimilarly, Bank of America actively measures emissions of major air pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter.

The bank’s board and management-level committees routinely review progress and risks around ESG issues, ensuring environmental objectives are tied to overall company strategy [3][10].\n\nIn summary, Bank of America addresses environmental issues by committing to ambitious reduction targets, transparently measuring and disclosing its emissions, integrating environmental responsibility into governance, and regularly assessing the societal impacts of its operations. These actions not only reduce the bank’s ecological footprint but also contribute positively to its public accountability and leadership in sustainable finance.\n\nBank of America manages air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through ambitious reduction targets, transparent disclosure, and governance integration, with their societal impacts thoroughly measured and publicly reported."}

These distinctions are visually summarized in the official remuneration overview: ![The remuneration table highlights bonuses for the Chairman as blocked shares and for CEC mostly as cash payments.](image1)\n\nAnnual bonuses for both groups are determined by the Remuneration Committee, which evaluates performance against agreed-upon objectives and applies discretion in weighting criteria and allocating the bonus amount[3][11]. However, the approval process requires that the total amounts proposed as bonuses for both the Board of Directors and the CEC are ultimately subject to binding shareholder votes at the Annual General Meeting[8][10]. This dual-layer of determination and approval ensures both operational flexibility and accountability to shareholders.\n\nA succinct tabular display further clarifies these components, revealing that the Chairman is eligible for base pay, bonus, and pension, while CEC members receive base pay, bonus, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (S-SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs), and pension; importantly, the type of bonus (shares or cash) varies as noted: ![Remuneration for the Chairman includes blocked shares as a bonus; for CEC, the bonus is mainly in cash.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the main differences are: the Board of Directors' bonus (for the Chairman) is paid in blocked shares for ten years, while the Corporate Executive Committee’s bonus is usually paid in cash, except the CEO, who also receives it in blocked shares."}

The COGS is the main expense subtracted from revenue to calculate gross profit, so adjustments to it can significantly affect the reported core gross profit.\n\nIn 2021, the IFRS-reported COGS was -11,751 million USD. Key adjustments included adding back amortization of intangible assets (3,419 million USD) and other items (344 million USD), resulting in an adjusted or \"core\" COGS of -7,988 million USD.

However, significant outflows like cash dividends, share repurchases, or other adjustments outweighed net income, resulting in the net decline in retained earnings[image6], [image5].\n- AOCI was negatively impacted, particularly by foreign currency translation adjustments, which worsened by $163 million, although there were positive adjustments from pension and postretirement benefits.

However, in 2021, there was a marked shift to a benefit of $(1,122) million, and for 2022 (expected), the benefit remains at $(121) million.

Both years saw losses primarily due to declining discount rates, only partially mitigated by strong actual returns on plan assets [10][9].\n\nIn contrast, 2021 saw a pronounced mark-to-market gain of $(833) million—mainly attributed to higher discount rates at the year-end—which led to a sharp decrease in the net benefit cost, converting it into a marked benefit for the year [5].

XL also grew, with subscribers going from 68.5 million to 58.3 million, but this actually indicates a decline in total subscribers. However, its data users increased from 37.5 million to 32 million, which appears as a decrease, not an increase, so there is some discrepancy in the available metrics from the two points in time. Indosat shows a decrease in both metrics as subscribers declined from 59.7 million to 54.2 million, and data users dropped from 29 million to 29 million, indicating stability rather than growth.\n\n![Subscriber and data user numbers for late 2014, with Telkomsel leading in both categories.](image2)\n\nComparing these figures to the earlier period:\n![Subscriber and data user figures from 2013-2014, showing growth for Telkomsel and overall smaller totals than late 2014.](image6)\n\nThe growth in users, particularly for Telkomsel, aligns with Indonesia’s broader trend of increasing mobile adoption, with 240 million subscribers nationally in early 2014 and continuous growth throughout the year, driven heavily by rising data and smartphone usage [10]. The minor decreases for XL and Indosat could be due to effects of intense market competition or changes in customer preferences, while the consistent growth for Telkomsel suggests robust market dominance and a strong ability to capture the growing demand for data services.\n\nIn summary, Telkomsel outperformed its competitors by increasing both total subscribers and data users into late 2014, indicating continued strength, while XL and Indosat faced stagnation or slight declines, pointing to challenges in sustaining growth in a competitive and rapidly evolving telecom market."}

According to survey data, half (50%) of women in STEM say they have faced at least one form of gender-related discrimination in the workplace, compared to just 19% of men in these fields [2][10][5]. The forms of discrimination most commonly reported by women include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent because of their gender (29%), experiencing repeated small slights (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man in the same role (18%) [8][2].\n\nThis pattern intensifies in specific contexts: for example, women working in computer jobs or in workplaces where men outnumber women are especially likely to experience discrimination. As many as 74% of women in computer jobs report discrimination, compared to just 16% of men in those jobs ![The gap in gender-related discrimination is largest in computer jobs, where 74% of women report it compared to 16% of men.](image8).

For instance, in San Francisco, the 2018 RM3 initiative renewed bridge tolls to finance regional transit improvements, and high-speed rail development utilized state cap-and-trade revenue as a funding mechanism [2]. In the context of broader transportation needs, ballot measures and local taxes have also been employed to secure additional resources for infrastructure projects [4].\n\nThe bridge depicted serves as both a vital transportation corridor and, significantly, as a direct funding source for broader transit projects.

This rapid increase was largely driven by the arrival of railroads and the Homestead Act, which encouraged new settlers by granting land to those willing to build homes and farm for five years[5][1]. The completion of the Union Pacific Railroad in less than three years played a key role in transforming Nebraska from a sparsely populated frontier to a thriving agricultural region, drawing many people eager to take advantage of new economic opportunities[5].\n\n![Hamilton County's population peaked in 1890 before steadily declining into the next century.](image2)\n\nAfter 1890, the population began to decline, dropping to 13,330 by 1900 and falling to around 9,000 by 1950, where it stabilized with only modest fluctuations through 2000. Several historical forces contributed to these changes. The initial surge slowed as available land was claimed and as nearly half of those who filed Homestead claims ultimately failed to secure title to their land, leading to a transient population for some time[5]. Improvements in farm mechanization and larger-scale operations meant fewer small farms and, by extension, less need for as large a rural population[6]. The number of farms declined steadily after peaking in 1900, and the average farm size increased, reducing the agricultural workforce needed on each farm.\n\n![Farm mechanization and consolidation led to fewer farms but much larger average farm sizes over time.](image8)\n\nAdditionally, the importance of rail connections meant that towns without railroad access often declined or disappeared, redistributing the population to more viable communities while smaller ones faded or were relocated[10].\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population rose sharply in the late 1800s due to railroad expansion and homesteading, peaked in 1890, then declined throughout the 20th century due to agricultural consolidation, mechanization, and shifting settlement patterns tied to economic and transportation changes."}

In contrast, the share among Democrats and Democratic-leaners declined from 44% in March 2020 to 33% later that year—a notable drop not paralleled in the Republican group[6].\n\n![Republican-leaning Americans increasingly see the U.S. as the top economic power, while Democratic-leaners display a significant recent decline in this belief.](image3)\n\nThis divergence is supported by survey trends, which show that while support among Republicans for the U.S. as the top economy has remained relatively stable or increased, Democratic confidence has diminished, especially in the wake of the pandemic and its negative economic impacts[6][10].\n\nIn summary, Americans’ perceptions have shifted over time—rising confidence in the U.S. through 2020, followed by a decline during the pandemic—with Republicans consistently more likely than Democrats to view the U.S. as the world’s leading economic power."}

This growth in skepticism about the media’s role is matched by a corresponding decline in the percentage who believe the press has \"about the right amount\" of influence, which dropped sharply to a record low of 27% in the same period.[7] \n\nThe data clearly illustrate this trend across time:\n\n![In 2016, 57% of voters said news organizations had 'too much' influence on the election, the highest level recorded since at least 1992, while the share seeing the 'right amount' of influence was at a historic low.](image2)\n\nAdditionally, voters' overall grades for the performance of the press have become more negative than ever before. For instance, in 2016, voters gave the press far more failing or low grades than in previous years, signaling deepening mistrust and dissatisfaction compared to past elections.[1][9]\n\n![Voters gave the press more failing grades in 2016 than in any election year since 1988, illustrating a marked decline in public approval of the press's conduct during campaigns.](image8)\n\nIn short, the perception that news organizations have too much influence on presidential elections has reached its highest point in the modern polling era."}

A clear and consistent pattern emerges in multiple sources: Democrats (including those who lean Democratic) overwhelmingly favor this policy, with support standing at 82% today, and this support has slightly increased since 2018 (from 78%) [3][8]. By contrast, support among Republicans (and leaners) has been declining, dropping from 49% in 2018 to just 38% in the most recent data [1][4][8]. This divide is notable not only in total support but also in the strength of support: while over half of Democrats strongly favor automatic voter registration, only 14% of Republicans express strong favor, with a very low combined total among Republicans [4]. \n\nThese trends are clearly visualized in recent survey charts. For example, the chart below shows that 82% of Democrats, but only 38% of Republicans, support automatic voter registration, while the overall national average is 61%:\n\n![Democrats strongly support, while Republicans are less supportive of automatic voter registration](image8)\n\nThis divide has intensified over time, as depicted in the line graph showing the steadily rising support among Democrats compared with a steady decline among Republicans:\n\n![Democratic support for automatic voter registration is high and rising, Republican support is declining](image1)\n\nBreaking this down further, group differences exist within party lines as well. White Republicans are less supportive (35%) of automatic registration than Hispanic Republicans (51%) [11].

For higher-resource languages, the improvement from pre-training is generally consistent, yielding modest gains of about 3 BLEU points for each language pair. In contrast, in extremely low-resource languages like Galician (GL), pre-training leads to a much larger improvement, with gains up to 11 BLEU points, suggesting that pre-trained word embeddings are particularly useful for bootstrapping translation models that are just beginning to produce reasonable outputs[2].\n\nThis large improvement for GL→EN can be seen in the following summary table, which compares BLEU scores under \"std\" (no pre-training) and \"pre\" (with pre-training) settings. For example, GL→EN improves from 13.2 (std) to 24.4 (pre), while higher-resource pairs like PT→EN and TR→EN increase modestly—from 29.6 to 32.7 and 16.6 to 17.7, respectively:\n\n![BLEU score improvements for different language pairs with and without pre-training, showing especially high increase for GL→EN.](image3)\n\nThese quantitative improvements are echoed in qualitative analyses, where pre-training leads to translations that better capture rare vocabulary and produce more grammatically coherent sentences.

Alignment of embeddings in multilingual setups also enhances BLEU scores, facilitating learning across related languages and providing additional improvements [10].\n\nIn summary, pre-training increases BLEU scores for all language pairs, but the gains are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, with the magnitude of improvement influenced by both the relationship between language pairs and the initial baseline system performance."}

These features are then stored in an external memory as embeddings, and an index is constructed to facilitate fast, similarity-based retrieval via k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) searches.[9] The retriever efficiently queries large external memories to fetch relevant images or category labels most similar to the input.[11] To ensure that retrieval remains efficient even with millions of embeddings, an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index is used, reducing embedding dimensionality and accelerating retrieval speed.[7]\n\n![Diagram of the RAR pipeline showing the Multimodal Retriever extracting image embeddings, storing them in memory, and indexing for k-NN retrieval.](image1)\n\nAfter the retrieval phase, the Retrieving & Ranking module takes the retrieved top-k category labels and the embedding of the input image, and feeds them into a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). The MLLM uses both its internal knowledge and the retrieved data to rank the candidate categories and make the final, contextually-aware prediction.[2] This process leverages the MLLM’s ability for nuanced understanding and ranking, especially in few-shot and zero-shot settings, guiding it through ranking prompts designed for multi-modal inputs.[5] This combined approach achieves greater precision and flexibility in classification tasks, particularly when distinguishing between many fine-grained categories.[8]\n\nAn illustrative example of this ranking process shows an input image alongside a set of similar, retrieved class candidates.

On the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, the overall scores are very close: BERT_BASE achieves 77.5, while SenseBERT_BASE slightly surpasses it at 77.9. This suggests that adding lexical semantic information into the pre-training objective of SenseBERT maintains or marginally enhances general language understanding capabilities.\n\n![SenseBERT_BASE achieves a slightly higher overall GLUE score compared to BERT_BASE, with generally similar performance across individual tasks.](image1)\n\nLooking at specific GLUE tasks, SenseBERT_BASE performs better on tasks like CoLA (linguistic acceptability: 54.6 vs. 50.1 for BERT_BASE) and QNLI (question answering: 90.6 vs. 89.4), while BERT_BASE does marginally better on SST-2 (sentiment analysis: 92.6 vs. 92.2), STS-B (semantic textual similarity: 85.7/84.6 vs. 83.5/82.3), and QQP (paraphrase detection: 71.0/88.9 vs. 70.3/88.8). On most other tasks, the difference is negligible, indicating that incorporating supersense information does not compromise core language modeling ability but can strengthen it in selective contexts[5].\n\nFurthermore, SenseBERT_BASE shows a pronounced advantage on tasks that explicitly require lexical semantic awareness. For example, in both the SemEval-SS (supersense disambiguation) and Word in Context (WiC) tasks, SenseBERT_PRE-trained models outperform their BERT counterparts by a large margin, even without task-specific fine-tuning; this demonstrates the model's capacity to acquire and generalize word-level semantic knowledge through specialized pretraining[2][3][8].\n\nThe overall trend from these results is that SenseBERT_BASE maintains competitive general NLP capabilities compared to BERT_BASE on broad benchmarks like GLUE, while also delivering marked improvements on tasks involving supersense or word-sense disambiguation. The integration of lexical semantic cues in pretraining enhances the model's semantic sensitivity without degrading performance on traditional language tasks.\n\nIn summary, SenseBERT_BASE matches or exceeds BERT_BASE across most standard NLP benchmarks, and it clearly outperforms on tasks emphasizing lexical semantics and supersense discrimination."}

The retrieval starts at the root of the tree, and at each level, it selects the top nodes with the highest cosine similarity to the query vector. This process repeats at each subsequent layer, narrowing down to the most relevant child nodes as it descends the tree. Eventually, the selected nodes' texts are concatenated to form the final retrieved context that gets combined with the query for answer generation. This hierarchical traversal ensures that at each depth, only a set number of nodes is picked, leading to a blend of thematic and specific information based on the traversal path.\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method does not traverse layer by layer. Instead, it flattens the entire multi-level tree so that all nodes, regardless of their original depth, are placed onto a single layer. The retrieval then considers all nodes at once, ranking them by their similarity to the query, and selecting the most relevant ones until a token threshold is met. This method can simultaneously access both granular details and higher-level summaries, offering greater flexibility and ensuring information is retrieved at the most appropriate level of specificity for the question.\n\nThe diagram below visually contrasts the two approaches:\n![Tree Traversal follows the tree layer by layer, while Collapsed Tree flattens all nodes for simultaneous retrieval.](image3)\n\nEmpirical results also demonstrate that the collapsed tree method often outperforms tree traversal, particularly at optimal context lengths.

In fact, text evidence explicitly states that, at the start, \"most active querying strategies are biased towards certain classes\" while random selection gives a more uniform class distribution[1]. This bias means active query strategies “can barely outperform random sampling at the beginning because some classes are simply not selected for training”[8].\n\nFigure 9, as described in image6, shows the effect of introducing label diversity to active querying strategies on CIFAR-10-LT, with most querying strategies (BALD, Consistency, Coreset, Margin, VAAL, Entropy) showing substantial performance benefits when label diversity is enforced, but “the red and gray dots denote AUC scores [...] with and without label diversity,” and gray dots (original strategies) are often lower than random, especially with low budgets. This indicates most standard active querying methods do not outperform random selection unless label diversity is explicitly enforced.\n\nFurther, text [7] and [12] confirm that “most of the active querying strategies fail to query all the classes even at relatively larger initial query budgets,” and only after enforcing diversity do some approaches catch up or surpass random selection.\n\nVisualization in image7 reinforces this, clearly illustrating that “random selection outperforms or matches active strategies such as BALD, Consistency, Margin, VAAL, Coreset, and Entropy at lower budgets,” specifically on CIFAR-10-LT, with the random baseline (grey circles) highest or equal in the initial regime.\n\nWhen label diversity is enforced, some strategies do at times match or slightly exceed random selection, so we must distinguish between the original strategies and their diversity-enforced versions. Without enforcing label diversity, very few (or none) of the typical active querying strategies outperform random at the start: “Random selection starts out strong, [and] the active learning methods start to catch up or outperform as the number of images increases beyond the lower budget scenario” (image7).\n\nAmong the strategies considered are: BALD, Consistency, Margin, Coreset, VAAL, Entropy. Evidence consistently shows that, unless label diversity is explicitly enforced, these strategies do not outperform random selection at the outset on CIFAR-10-LT[7][11][12]. When diversity is added, some approaches may surpass random; otherwise, random remains strongest at the cold start.\n\nThis finding is echoed in [11][12] and in the visualization, where random selection is at least equal to or better than all original querying strategies at low budgets.\n\n![Random selection matches or surpasses active strategies at low budgets on CIFAR-10-LT, shown by the top curve for random in the rightmost plot.](image7)\n\nThus, on CIFAR-10-LT, without label diversity enforced, no standard active querying strategy reliably outperforms the random selection baseline at the initial stage.\n\nAnswer: Zero strategies outperform the random selection baseline on CIFAR-10-LT at the initial query stage."}

These comb layers effectively collect the states from left-to-right and right-to-left transformer blocks, enabling the model to access and merge information from the entire context around each token. This fusion is accomplished using a self-attention module, followed by a feed-forward network, which together produce the contextualized representation for the target token to be classified or predicted [5].\n\nDuring the pretraining phase, masking is applied so that the model does not have direct access to the current token being predicted, encouraging it to rely on the context. However, during fine-tuning on downstream tasks—especially those like NER where knowledge of the current token is crucial—the masking in the combination layer is removed. This adjustment allows the model, through the comb layer, to fully utilize both the context and the identity of the current token, leading to improved task performance [1][10].\n\n![The comb layers aggregate forward and backward states for each input, with masking on current-token connections during training and unmasking during fine-tuning for richer information.](image6)\n\nTherefore, the comb (combination) layers' purpose is to merge the forward and backward representations at each position, generating comprehensive token embeddings that are essential both for training and for downstream fine-tuning. Removing masking from these connections at fine-tuning time allows the representations to include the current token, further improving classification accuracy. In summary: The comb layers combine contextual information from both directions for each token, producing the final embedding used for prediction, with masking control dictating information flow based on training or fine-tuning mode."}

After a CNN backbone extracts features from the input image and the transformer encoder processes these features along with spatial positional encodings, the transformer decoder begins its work. Here, a fixed number of learned object queries—each represented as a positional embedding—are passed as input to the decoder. These object queries are designed to query the encoded image features for potential object instances.\n\nThe decoder, utilizing multi-headed self- and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms, transforms these N object queries through several layers. Each query develops a specialized representation that allows it to focus on a different part of the image, thus enabling the model to reason globally about all objects and assign specific predictions to each query. Importantly, the predictions—from each object's class and bounding box—are generated in parallel, not sequentially, distinguishing DETR from traditional autoregressive models that process detections one at a time [5][2][9].\n\nEvidence of this parallel, global reasoning can be seen in the model’s attention visualizations. For example, when detecting multiple animals, the decoder’s learned object queries focus on distinct features or instances, such as the heads and extremities of elephants and zebras, ensuring separate and unique detections for each object. This is visually demonstrated by the model’s attention scores distributed over relevant regions for each detected animal:\n![Decoder object queries localize elephants and zebras via focused attention on extremities and heads.](image1)\n\nThe overall DETR architecture, illustrated here, shows the connection between the input image, the feature extraction and encoding stages, the injection of object queries into the transformer decoder, and the final set of box predictions—each corresponding to different learned queries:\n![Object queries drive the decoder to predict bounding boxes and classes directly, bypassing hand-crafted post-processing.](image5)\n\nTo summarize, DETR uses a fixed set of learned object queries as input to its transformer decoder, enabling parallel and unique predictions for each object in the image by attending globally to context and focusing each query on different image features and potential object instances."}

However, once repetition control is introduced, the maximum achieved question frequency drops to about 80% even at the highest control setting. The reason is that the feature designed to prevent repetition (especially external bigram repetition) inadvertently penalizes frequently used question structures, which are important for generating well-formed questions. To address this, a special \"boost\" setting can be used—where repetition constraints are relaxed during generation and only reapplied at candidate reranking—which allows the model to again approach near-100% question-asking at the cost of a slight increase in repeated phrases.  \n\n![Repetition control reduces achievable question-asking rates unless repetition constraints are relaxed during generation.](image4)\n\nIn summary: Adding repetition control to a language model decreases the maximum frequency of generated questions, unless generation constraints are specifically adjusted to allow for essential question patterns[10]."}

This iterative loop aims to enrich context dynamically at each step, enabling the generation of more accurate and contextually rich answers. For example, after an initial retrieval and generation, the system judges if more information is needed, and if so, proceeds with another retrieval-generation cycle. This process can help to refine the generated output with each repetition, but may run the risk of semantic drift or introducing irrelevant information if not managed carefully.[3]  \n![Iterative retrieval alternates retrieval and generation, refining responses stepwise.](image2)\n\nIn contrast, Recursive retrieval focuses on breaking down the user’s initial complex query into smaller, more manageable sub-queries or sub-problems through an ongoing process of retrieval, generation, and query transformation. This method leverages mechanisms such as chain-of-thought reasoning—where intermediate results from one retrieval/generation pass clarify or further specify the next query—allowing for a hierarchical approach to searching and integrating knowledge. Recursive retrieval enhances both the depth and specificity of results, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where information needs are specialized or not initially transparent. The feedback loop inherent in recursive retrieval means that each pass learns from previous outcomes to better focus subsequent search efforts[4][11].  \n![Recursive retrieval iteratively decomposes and refines queries for better search depth.](image2)\n\nAdaptive retrieval takes yet another approach by empowering the RAG system to decide autonomously when and whether external retrieval is necessary within the workflow. This decision-making is powered by the system’s ability to judge the sufficiency of its internal knowledge or ongoing context, only triggering external retrieval when required. Special tokens or internal evaluation mechanisms can be used to signal when to halt further retrieval or generation steps. Adaptive retrieval is particularly efficient, reducing unnecessary computational cost and integrating only the most relevant supporting information into the answer, optimizing the balance between in-context knowledge and externally sourced data[12].  \n![Adaptive retrieval lets the system decide when to retrieve based on context need.](image2)\n\nIn summary:  \nIterative retrieval repeatedly cycles between retrieval and generation to gradually enhance responses; Recursive retrieval decomposes queries and refines them step by step to solve complex information needs; Adaptive retrieval empowers the model to fetch external knowledge only when judged necessary, improving efficiency and relevance."}

When only distractor paragraphs and the two gold paragraphs are used (the \"Distractor\" setting), the models tend to achieve much higher F1 scores. For example, single-paragraph BERT performs competitively, achieving a 67.08 F1 score in this setup, demonstrating that most questions can be answered effectively when the relevant evidence is readily available and distractors are relatively weak[7].\n\nHowever, when models are evaluated in more challenging open-domain settings—where a far larger number of possible paragraphs (up to 500, drawn from broad sources such as Wikipedia) are included as candidates, and the likelihood of retrieving the exact gold paragraphs decreases—the F1 scores drop considerably.

LSTMs are specifically designed to capture the sequential nature of language, meaning they track the order of words in a sentence, which is crucial for sentiment prediction. This is because changes in word order can drastically alter the sentiment conveyed; for example, \"not really good\" differs substantially in sentiment from \"really not good\" even though they have similar words in different orders [7].\n\nEmpirical studies reinforce this importance: when the order of words in sentiment datasets is randomly shuffled during LSTM training, there is a noticeable drop in model performance. For instance, on the Yelp Polarity dataset, the accuracy decreases from 95.11% with the original word order to 93.49% when the words are shuffled, highlighting how LSTM's ability to leverage word order enhances sentiment prediction accuracy ![Shuffling word order lowers LSTM sentiment accuracy in Yelp P. dataset.](image4)[11][12]. This effect is specific to sentiment analysis tasks; topic categorization and textual entailment are much less sensitive to word order—shuffling words in those datasets causes minimal accuracy loss.\n\nIn contrast, models like SWEM that ignore word order show similar performance to LSTM on shuffled data, underlining that LSTM's main advantage in sentiment analysis stems from its handling of word order [12][9]. Moreover, when evaluating multiple models on sentiment datasets, LSTM and CNN—both of which capture positional information—consistently outperform models that ignore sequence, such as SWEM, particularly for short sentences where word-order information is even more critical [7][10] ![LSTM models achieve consistently high accuracy on sentiment datasets compared to non-sequential models.](image7).\n\nIn conclusion, word-order information substantially boosts sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models by enabling them to distinguish nuanced differences conveyed by word sequences, especially in short text."}

This heterogeneous nature is crucial for robustly assessing models’ perception and understanding in real-world multimodal settings:  \n![The benchmark features 11.5K problems from six disciplines and many diverse image types, embodying both breadth and challenge.](image8)  \n\nWhen it comes to depth, the distinction becomes even more pronounced. Whereas earlier benchmarks primarily test simple perceptual skills or basic physical and commonsense reasoning, MMMU focuses on tasks demanding expert-level knowledge and deliberate, step-by-step reasoning—for example, applying concepts like Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory to solve specific problems. This is not just about recognizing objects or answering surface-level questions, but about integrating modality-specific information with advanced domain knowledge, as highlighted by the benchmark’s emphasis on perception, knowledge, and reasoning as core skills for evaluation [2][5][10].\n\nThe dual comparison in the following visual succinctly demonstrates this contrast. MMMU is depicted at the top right for both breadth and depth, while most previous datasets cluster towards basic knowledge and reasoning:  \n![MMMU is mapped far above previous benchmarks in both breadth (knowledge covered) and depth (reasoning required), and is unique in providing rich image types and expert-level questions.](image4)  \n\nIn terms of implications for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs), MMMU’s sophisticated design exposes the current limitations of existing systems. Even advanced models such as GPT-4V achieve only moderate performance (around 55.7% accuracy), while leading open-source models score considerably lower [8][12]. The challenge set by MMMU thus serves as a much more rigorous litmus test of a model’s capabilities—not just in perceiving diverse images but also in fusing those perceptions with relevant, specialized knowledge for genuine expert reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark eclipses its predecessors with its extensive coverage and challenging expert-level tasks. This makes it an essential and demanding tool for evaluating LMMs, highlighting both progress and shortcomings in the pursuit of models with truly comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning ability."}

The process starts by encoding both the domain-slot pair (e.g., \"hotel, price range\") and the recent dialog context using a pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT model[6][2]. This approach generates contextualized representations that are conditioned on both the slot and its surrounding dialog.\n\nFor categorical slots (where candidate values are drawn from a finite list such as \"cheap,\" \"expensive,\" and \"moderate\"), the DS-DST model keeps a fixed BERT model as a feature extractor to process each candidate value, creating value representations[6]. Simultaneously, a fine-tuned BERT model processes the domain-slot pair and dialog history, resulting in another set of contextual representations.\n\nThe key matching step utilizes cosine similarity—specifically, the model calculates the relevance score between the aggregated representation from the dialog and the candidate value representations using cosine similarity, as described in the literature[1]. This allows the model to select the most plausible slot value from the picklist based on which candidate has the highest similarity to the contextually encoded slot and conversation segment.\n\nFor non-categorical slots, the model uses a two-way linear mapping to directly identify text spans from the context, reflecting dynamic or free-form user responses (e.g., number of nights for a hotel booking)[6][8].\n\nThis dual-strategy enables the DS-DST to flexibly and effectively handle both predefined candidate slots and free-form spans, as visually presented in the model's architecture:\n\n![The architecture shows two BERT encoders: one for candidate-value extraction and one for domain-slot/context encoding, connected via cosine similarity matching.](image8)\n\nIn simple terms: DS-DST encodes candidate values and dialog context separately using BERT, then determines the best match for each slot by measuring cosine similarity between their representations."}

For example, if the problem involves logical deduction, the module generates a set of logical rules and queries represented in a symbolic logic language. This step often utilizes in-context learning, where the formulation is grounded through examples that map symbolic formulas to their natural language counterparts[1].\n\nNext, the Symbolic Reasoner receives this symbolic representation. Depending on the problem type—deductive reasoning, first-order logic, constraint satisfaction, or analytical reasoning—the Symbolic Reasoner chooses an appropriate solver such as a logic programming engine, first-order logic prover, or constraint optimization engine. The chosen solver executes deterministic algorithms (like forward or backward chaining), providing a logically sound and transparent answer by operating over the precise symbolic representation[2][9]. This separation ensures that the actual reasoning process is handled by systems with strong guarantees of correctness, rather than relying solely on the language model’s internal reasoning over ambiguous natural language.\n\nFinally, the Result Interpreter module translates the symbolic answer generated by the solver back into natural language, ensuring the solution is easily understood. This module may also use the language model or a set of rules to render the symbolic results in a user-friendly format. If inconsistencies or errors arise in the symbolic reasoning step, a self-refinement process is triggered: feedback from the symbolic solver’s error messages helps the system iteratively revise and improve the symbolic formulation, leading to greater robustness[12].\n\nThis approach—by decomposing the reasoning process—transfers the burden of detailed logical reasoning from the language model to interpretable solvers, yielding greater reliability and faithfulness.\n\n![Diagram showing LOGIC-LM's three-module process for logical reasoning tasks: formulation, symbolic inference, and interpretation.](image5)\n\nIn summary: LOGIC-LM solves a problem by translating it into symbolic logic with the Problem Formulator, performing precise reasoning with the Symbolic Reasoner, and translating the result into natural language via the Result Interpreter, all while enabling iterative self-refinement for improved accuracy."}

These embeddings are learned from large corpora and provide an efficient way to map words with similar meanings close together in vector space. However, word-level embeddings alone may be insufficient when encountering out-of-vocabulary words, rare entities, morphological variations, and words in low-resource or agglutinative languages, where many forms exist for a concept [6].\n\nCharacter-level embeddings are constructed by processing each word at the character level, for instance with a character-level Bi-LSTM. This enables the model to learn subword patterns such as prefixes, suffixes, inflections, and capitalization patterns. As a result, the model can infer representations for unseen or rare words by considering their internal character structure, capturing information about morphology and helping to generalize across word forms. This is especially useful when datasets are limited or contain named entities with varying forms [12].\n\nThe neural architecture processes an input sequence in two stages: first, it generates a character-based representation for each word using character-level embeddings, then concatenates this with the word’s embedding to form a richer representation. This combined representation is passed through subsequent layers such as a Bi-LSTM and CRF for structured prediction tasks like NER [6]. \n\n![The Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model architecture takes as input both character-level and word-level embeddings, allowing for robust multi-level representation by combining subword morphology with semantic context.](image3)\n\nUsing both levels:\n- Allows the model to capture subword features and handle out-of-vocabulary words through character-level information.\n- Retains semantic context from word embeddings for fluent in-vocabulary processing.\n- Improves tagging accuracy by leveraging strengths of both linguistic levels [12].\n\nIn summary, combining word and character-level embeddings allows the model to represent both the semantic context and the subword details of words, leading to more robust understanding, better handling of rare or novel words, and ultimately improved NER performance."}

After cropping, the regions are resized to a fixed proportion to standardize their input, regardless of original object size or scale. These prepared regions are then passed through an image encoder to extract meaningful embeddings that faithfully represent the visual features of each isolated object.\n\nBy separating and resizing the object regions, the system ensures that the extracted embeddings are highly representative of each target object, reducing background interference and discrepancies due to scale or position. This careful pre-processing enables subsequent retrieval stages—such as the k-nearest neighbor search using an indexed memory bank—to associate each object embedding with semantically relevant labels, even in a zero-shot setting where the system has not seen these classes during training.

The following year saw significant work using the \"Google Ngrams corpus,\" exploiting large-scale digitized lexical data to detect shifts and allowing for quantitative corpus-based comparisons [12]. By 2012, the concept of \"Word epoch disambiguation\" was formalized, focusing on determining which time span a given contextual use of a word belonged to, marking progress in automatic evaluation strategies for semantic shift detection [3].\n\nAdvancements in \"Prediction-based models\" in 2013, such as skip-gram and word2vec, transformed the methodology, allowing for richer representation and modeling of temporal change in word meaning [10]. In 2014, the application of such \"Word embeddings\" (notably word2vec) became prevalent, serving as a standard tool for studying semantics over time [5][10].\n\nThe year 2015 marked a turning point with the development of \"Models alignment,\" addressing the challenge of comparing semantic spaces from different time periods. In 2016, researchers applied these methods to new corpora, notably the \"NYT corpus\" and the \"COHA corpus,\" expanding the breadth of empirical studies [8]. By 2017, the focus shifted towards understanding the \"Laws of semantic change,\" discovering that prototypicality correlates with rates of semantic drift, among other findings; \"Local measures\" were recognized as more sensitive for detecting cultural shifts; joint learning across time spans emerged, and there was growing critical examination of the new methods and their findings [6][11].\n\nAll these advances reflect a progression from conceptual foundations and corpus construction to sophisticated computational models and empirical insights, as detailed in the following timeline:\n\n![The timeline charts major advances in diachronic semantic shift research from 2010’s initial time tensor models to 2017’s nuanced insights into semantic change laws and improved methodologies.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the key milestones from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of time-tensor models, the use of large-scale corpora like Google Ngrams and NYT, development of prediction-based embedding methods such as word2vec, breakthroughs in model alignment, application to new diachronic datasets, and the establishment and critique of laws governing semantic changes."}

In particular, the CLS metric drops substantially, suggesting that abstracts contain crucial information for the model to learn effective document representations. The table also reveals that adding venue information slightly improves performance in classification tasks but does not lead to overall gains, and even slightly decreases average performance. Interestingly, adding author names actually reduces performance, potentially because author names are sparse and often out-of-vocabulary, resulting in less meaningful semantic representation and increased noise[8]. This trend is shown in the tabulated results:\n![Removing abstract and adding venue/author information alters SPECTER performance, with the abstract being highly important.](image1)\n\nIn addition to feature inclusion, specific training design choices have notable effects. For instance, the absence of \"hard negatives\" in training substantially reduces performance in all tasks, highlighting the necessity of difficult distractors to improve the model’s discriminative power[2]. Additionally, switching the backbone from SciBERT (which is tailored for scientific text) to BERT-Large (a general-domain language model) leads to a considerable decrease in performance, underlining the importance of scientific-domain pre-training[2].\n\nThe SPECTER architecture uses titles and abstracts as primary inputs, processed via a SciBERT-initialized Transformer. The triplet loss framework encourages the model to better distinguish relevant scientific documents, capitalizing on the rich semantic content of these textual features.\n![SPECTER uses title and abstract in a triplet setup for embedding learning, emphasizing feature selection impact.](image2)\n\nIn summary, retaining abstracts is crucial for optimal SPECTER performance, while adding venues yields modest task-specific gains and authors tend to introduce noise. Hard negatives and scientific-domain specialization further solidify model robustness across tasks. Excluding abstracts or adding certain metadata like author names typically impairs performance.\n\nConcise answer: Including abstracts greatly boosts SPECTER’s performance across tasks, while adding venue offers minor gains and adding author names or removing abstracts reduces effectiveness; hard negatives and scientific domain pretraining are also key for optimal results."}

Under the specific setting, all citation metrics improve for both models, with GPT-4 still leading in alignment (92.0 vs. 84.5) and precision (36.0 vs. 29.9), while ChatGPT continues to outscore in recall (49.0 vs. 43.6). F1 scores also increase (GPT-4: 39.4, ChatGPT: 37.2), confirming that specific questions help both models generate more accurate and comprehensive citations.\n\nTurning to text evaluation, both models score higher in the specific settings across coherence, conciseness, fluency, and relevance. For example, under specific settings both GPT-4 and ChatGPT have improved coherence (4.48 and 4.57), conciseness (4.89 and 4.94), and relevance (4.72 and 4.81) compared to their performance under general settings. ChatGPT slightly outperforms GPT-4 in most text evaluation metrics, possibly due to model-specific tuning or the evaluation bias noted in the quotes [6].\n\nThis suggests that for tasks requiring precise citation and textual clarity—such as scientific or educational question answering—using more specific, well-scoped queries allows both GPT-4 and ChatGPT to reach higher performance, with GPT-4 excelling in alignment and precision, and ChatGPT offering a slight advantage in recall and some aspects of text quality.\n\n![Performance metrics of GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific settings indicate improvement across most evaluation categories, with GPT-4 leading in alignment and precision, and ChatGPT excelling in recall and text quality.](image6)\n\nIn summary, GPT-4 typically delivers higher citation precision and alignment, while ChatGPT achieves higher recall and text evaluation scores, especially when questions are specific. The implications are clear: for high-precision citation tasks with reliable source alignment, GPT-4 may be preferred, but for comprehensive coverage and fluent text, especially in domains with loosely defined queries, ChatGPT is competitive or superior."}

It starts with the collection and storage of raw data, which is represented as the foundational element in the analytics value chain. This data is initially used to generate descriptive reports—such as dashboards and alerts—that help organizations understand what has happened, providing a backward-looking, descriptive perspective. These reporting activities primarily raise questions and translate data into information, but do not themselves provide business value unless further processed ![The process begins with data storage, then reporting, analysis, action, and finally leads to value creation.](image1) [2].\n\nTo create true business value, organizations must go beyond reporting to perform in-depth analysis. Analysis digs into the data to uncover why things happened, using techniques such as statistical analysis, forecasting, and predictive modeling. This phase transforms information into actionable insights and recommendations, enabling organizations to answer more complex, forward-looking questions about trends, causes, and future outcomes ![Reporting and analysis differ in focus, outputs, and business value, with analysis driving forward-looking insights.](image2).\n\nAs organizations mature, they progress through higher levels of analytics, as illustrated in the business intelligence-to-analytics continuum. They evolve from basic reporting (answering \"what happened?\") and ad hoc queries (\"how many, where?\"), up to more sophisticated practices like alerts (\"what actions are needed?\"), statistical analysis (\"why is this happening?\"), forecasting (\"what if these trends continue?\"), predictive modeling (\"what will happen next?\"), and ultimately optimization (\"what's the best that can happen?\"). With each step, both business value and the degree of intelligence increase, driving more impactful and strategic decisions ![The analytics hierarchy shows value increasing from standard reports to optimization, aligning with analytical maturity.](image8) [5][9].\n\nCrucially, this process must carry through to action and measurable business impact: the analytics value chain emphasizes that only insights that lead to decisions and concrete actions generate real value—otherwise, data analysis that fails to inspire change is considered ineffective [3][4]. Strong data leadership, data-literate managers, and democratized access to tools empower organizations to systematically integrate analytics into routine processes, ensuring that the progression from raw data to insight is fully realized in business value [7][8][11].\n\nIn summary, the path from data to business value advances from reporting to analysis to action along the analytics value chain, with each higher stage of analytics delivering more meaningful and strategic value to the organization."}

The Analytics Value Chain provides a step-by-step process, beginning with data collection, progressing through analysis and decision-making, and culminating in action that delivers measurable impact—reinforcing that partial movement along the chain yields no real value unless it ultimately drives change and produces results [1][2]. This can be visually observed in the flowchart, where data moves sequentially from storage through reporting, analysis, and action, finally resulting in realized business value: \n\n![The data-driven process moves sequentially from storage, reporting, analysis, and action to business value.](image2)\n\nThe Levels of Analytics, on the other hand, describe the increasing sophistication with which organizations interrogate their data.

Each level enables deeper insight and higher business value, as depicted below:\n\n![As you progress from reporting to forecasting and optimization, both business value and intelligence increase, transforming raw data into insights that drive impactful decisions.](image7)\n\nThese two concepts complement each other by working in tandem: while the Analytics Value Chain outlines the stages data must pass through to achieve impact, the Levels of Analytics explain how, at each stage (particularly during analysis), increasingly advanced methods can provoke better insights, more strategic actions, and ultimately greater value. Without following the entire value chain all the way to impact, even sophisticated analytics is wasted; conversely, merely progressing along the chain with only basic analytics limits the quality and innovation of resulting actions and value. \n\nThe Analytics Value Chain ensures that data-driven activities don’t stall at mere analysis but actively shape impactful actions, while the Levels of Analytics determine how profound those analyses—and their resulting decisions—can be. Used together, they ensure organizations not only act on their data but also extract the richest, most actionable knowledge possible.\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics are complementary because the Value Chain structures the journey from data to impact, while Levels of Analytics deepen the potential insights and value at each stage of analysis along that journey."}

At the business intelligence stage, the primary focus is on descriptive and backward-looking tasks such as standard and ad-hoc reporting, query drilldowns, and alerts. These tasks revolve around understanding \"what happened\" and \"where the problem is,\" relying mainly on reports, dashboards, and basic information delivery.\n\nAs shown in the diagram, advancing from business intelligence (stages 1–4) to business analytics (stages 5–8) leads to the adoption of statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization. These higher-level analytical methods allow organizations to address \"why is this happening?\", predict future outcomes, and identify optimal decisions. This represents both an increase in the business value derived from data and a higher degree of intelligence applied to problem-solving, as illustrated by the vertical and horizontal axes of the diagram. ![Moving up this hierarchy delivers greater value and intelligence, allowing organizations to move from simple reporting to predictive and prescriptive insights.](image8)\n\nA flowchart further clarifies this transformation: Data is first collected and reported, but true value emerges when that data flows through deeper analysis. This stage is where insights are derived, and crucially, actions can be taken based on these insights. The actions, in turn, generate tangible value for the organization. ![Value is only achieved when data passes from collection and reporting through analysis and action.](image3) The table comparing reporting and analysis underscores that while reporting is primarily about describing what has happened, analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, and focused on uncovering why things occur, leading to findings and actionable recommendations. ![Analysis is forward-looking and prescriptive, providing context and actionable insights beyond reporting's descriptive focus.](image7)\n\nThus, transitioning from business intelligence to business analytics enhances data handling by moving from simply raising questions (via descriptive reporting) to answering them through sophisticated analysis. This generates deeper, context-rich insights, enables forecasting and optimization, and supports better informed, forward-looking business decisions. In summary: The transition from business intelligence to business analytics elevates data handling by shifting from descriptive reporting to advanced, context-rich analysis, enabling organizations to generate actionable insights and optimize future decisions."}

This shift from merely handling data to producing true insight is critical in the value chain.\n\nThe next step in the value chain, as detailed in image4, is analysis. Here, data and the information produced in earlier stages are carefully examined (using tools like statistical analysis), leading to insights that provide the foundation for informed decisions.

Successful action, rooted in high-quality analysis, ultimately produces tangible value—for example, better business outcomes or increased efficiency.\n\nThe entire Analytics Value Chain is only considered successful when actions have been taken and demonstrable impact is achieved; simply stopping at earlier stages, like reporting or even analysis, does not count as creating value[2].

The first generation (F₁) consisted entirely of heterozygous plants (Pp), all displaying the dominant purple phenotype due to the presence of a dominant allele [11]. \n\nIn the next step, when two F₁ hybrids (Pp) were crossed, the alleles segregated independently during gamete formation, with each F₁ parent contributing either a P or p allele to the offspring. This independent segregation produces four possible allele combinations in the F₂ generation: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp [11]. \n\nThe resulting phenotypic ratio in the F₂ generation was approximately three purple-flowered plants to every one white-flowered plant, demonstrating the dominance of the purple allele. Genotypically, the offspring broke down into 1 PP (homozygous dominant), 2 Pp (heterozygous), and 1 pp (homozygous recessive), resulting in a 1:2:1 ratio [11].\n\n![Mendelian cross shows dominant and recessive alleles segregating in F₂ to yield a 3:1 phenotypic and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio.](image1)\n\nAnother clear illustration visually shows how the parental generation's cross leads to the ratios observed in the F₂: all F₁ offspring have purple flowers, but self-crossing F₁ reveals both purple and white in the next generation, mapping precisely onto these ratios.\n\n![F₂ generation reveals 3:1 purple to white phenotypic ratio from crossing F₁ hybrids.](image4)\n\nTo summarize: Mendelian inheritance explains that the 3:1 phenotypic and 1:2:1 genotypic ratios in the F₂ generation of pea plants result from the segregation and independent assortment of dominant and recessive alleles during the formation of gametes and their combination at fertilization."}

Furthermore, a lack of ability to measure the influence of activities on customer behavior, noted by 27%, highlights the difficulty organizations face when attempting to link marketing and engagement efforts directly to customer outcomes.[6]\n\nLeadership commitment is critical for overcoming these barriers; otherwise, sustainable process, infrastructure, and cultural growth cannot occur across business groups, as one text source points out [8]. Management issues and organizational culture, rather than just data and technology, are considered at the heart of adoption problems [11]. \n\nFinally, marketing teams often focus too much on isolated, tactical metrics without obtaining a 360-degree view of activities or customer behavior, further impeding integration efforts [2].\n\nThe major barriers to adopting an integrated customer management approach are organizational silos, lack of single ownership, resource constraints, insufficient technical infrastructure, and challenges in measurement and coordination across the business."}

The upper basket is meant for more delicate and lighter items like glasses, coffee cups, and tea cups. These should be loaded with their openings facing down to prevent water collection and ensure thorough cleaning. Cups, glasses, and curved or recessed items should be loaded aslant, minimizing water accumulation and allowing the spray arms to rotate freely. Delicate items, especially glasses, must be spaced so they don't touch each other to avoid breakage. Long or sharp utensils should be placed horizontally in the upper basket because storing knives upright can create a safety hazard[4].  \n\nFor cutlery, refer to the organized arrangement seen in the schematic representation, where soup spoons, forks, knives, and other utensils are sorted into separate sections; this helps prevent them from nesting and maximizes cleaning efficiency![Cutlery is separated in the cutlery rack, arranged by type for better washing.](image3). Additionally, soup spoons, forks, knives, tea spoons, dessert spoons, serving spoons, serving forks, and gravy ladles each have their designated spots, reinforcing the importance of organized placement![A table showing specific types of cutlery used, indicating the need for organized placement.](image6). Sharp utensils must be placed with points facing down or horizontally to avoid injury when unloading[6].\n\nFor the lower basket, larger items and cookware such as pots, pans, lids, bowls, and serving dishes should be placed, taking care not to obstruct the spray arms. Place serving dishes and lids along the sides of the racks, and ensure plates do not exceed 19 cm in diameter near the detergent dispenser to avoid blocking its opening[9]. The included diagrams illustrate the recommended positioning, showing where oven pots, dessert plates, dinner plates, soup plates, oval platters, melamine plates, and bowls should go, arranged to permit water to reach every surface![Diagram of the dishwasher rack with different kitchen items in designated positions to avoid blockage and ensure proper washing.](image8).\n\nFailing to comply with these loading recommendations can result in poor washing results, as noted by the clear warning![Warning: Poor loading leads to poor washing quality.](image5). Overcrowding or improper arrangement can block spray arms, prevent detergent from dispensing properly, and cause insufficient cleaning or even damage to both dishes and the dishwasher itself[4][9].

Each homologous pair lines up and then the pairs are pulled apart to opposite poles of the dividing cell. This separation reduces the chromosome number by half, because each resulting cell receives only one chromosome from each homologous pair.

Conversely, the SAL to SQL conversion rate is exceptionally strong (83.08%, exceeding industry averages), while the final SQL to SWO closing rate falls well below typical expectations (6.67% compared to a 20-30% average).\n\nThis comparison highlights where the process may be unusually selective or where qualification criteria might be misaligned with later-stage requirements. A high MQL count with a sharp drop in sales acceptance suggests potential issues in lead quality criteria or miscommunication between marketing and sales teams. Alternatively, a strong SAL to SQL ratio indicates that once a lead is deemed sales-accepted, it is very likely to progress to the next stage.\n\nIn summary, compared to industry benchmarks, the lead funnel progression here shows an unusually high early-stage conversion but faces bottlenecks in transitioning from marketing to sales acceptance, followed by exceptionally strong qualification—yet struggles to close at industry-average rates."}

The fuel supply starts at the tank and, depending on system complexity, passes through several components before reaching the engine.\n\nOne comprehensive image provides a step-by-step illustration: fuel is drawn from the fuel supply (or tank), passes through a fuel filter to remove impurities, and then enters a high-pressure fuel pump. From the pump, fuel moves to the fuel rail, which distributes it to individual fuel injectors. The fuel pressure regulator, also connected to the rail, ensures that pressure remains consistent, sometimes returning excess fuel to the supply. Sensors and an electronic control unit (ECU) monitor and regulate all these processes to optimize engine performance. This arrangement is shown with connecting lines and arrows to clearly indicate the flow between components:\n\n![Block diagram showing connections between fuel supply, filters, high pressure pump, fuel rail, injectors, sensors, ECU, and pressure regulator](image5)\n\nAnother image focuses on the system layout and highlights a subsystem structure, where the \"FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM\" connects to both the \"COLD START SYSTEM\" and the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM,\" both of which then ultimately supply fuel to the \"ENGINE.\" The diagram uses arrows and colored lines to indicate fuel, air, and control signal flows. This visualizes how subsystems such as the air supply, fuel metering, and cold start are all interconnected with the main fuel delivery:\n\n![Subsystem block diagram showing the fuel supply system’s connections to the cold start system, fuel metering system, and engine](image8)\n\nA detailed common rail system diagram further elucidates fuel supply connections; here, fuel from the tank passes through a filter with a water separator, is pressurized by a high pressure pump, and enters a common rail which supplies all injectors. Sensors and electronic control modules are shown managing these connections:\n\n![Diagram of common rail injection showing tank, filter, high pressure pump, common rail, pressure sensors, pressure limiting valve, injectors, and ECM](image6)\n\nText evidence adds that all fuel injectors are supplied by the fuel rail acting as a pressure accumulator, and this is fundamental to modern injection systems where the electric fuel pump pushes fuel at high pressure to be distributed by the fuel rail to multiple injectors.[2]\n\nIn summary, the components connected with fuel supply typically include the fuel tank, filter, low and high pressure pumps, surge tank (if present), fuel rail, pressure regulator, injectors, pressure and other system sensors, and the electronic control unit."}

At the initial stages, data must be collected and organized—this data then serves as the foundation for reporting. Reporting converts raw data into descriptive information, often in the form of dashboards, reports, and alerts. Its main focus is to answer \"what happened?\" by providing a retrospective and descriptive view of events, raising questions rather than resolving them. For instance, reporting is illustrated as the first step after data storage, raising the foundational questions that prompt further investigation ![Reporting is the first step after data collection in the value chain, turning data into usable information](image1).\n\nThe table comparison makes clear the differences between both concepts: Reporting is backward-looking, descriptive, and outputs information that raises new questions without providing full business context. In contrast, analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking, answering \"why did it happen?\" and \"what should we do next?\" Analysis synthesizes the reported information, applies context, and results in recommendations and actionable insights, utilizing storytelling to ensure understanding and impact ![The table compares reporting as descriptive, backward-looking, focused on \"what\", versus analysis which is prescriptive, forward-looking, and focused on \"why\" and recommendations](image4).\n\nWithin the hierarchy from business intelligence to business analytics, reporting is situated at the foundational levels, such as standard or ad-hoc reports. These answer straightforward, descriptive queries. As organizations mature, they progress to deeper layers—OLAP drilldowns, alerts, and then into true analytics: statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization. Analysis becomes increasingly central here, driving higher business value and intelligence by moving from mere observation (business intelligence) to explanation, prediction, and prescription (business analytics) ![Progression from business intelligence (basic reporting and query) to business analytics (analysis, forecasting, optimization), with increasing value and intelligence](image7).\n\nIn summary: Reporting provides the foundation by turning data into information and highlighting what is happening, while analysis builds on that to deliver insight and recommendations, moving organizations from business intelligence (what, where, how many) to business analytics (why, what-if, what next, what’s best) within the analytics value chain."}

This sensor data feeds into the ECU, enabling it to analyze the current state of the engine and determine the precise control actions required for optimal performance.\n\n![Central ECU processes data from sensors and sends commands to injectors.](image1)\n\nBased on these measurements, the ECU performs several key functions. It determines the proper quantity of fuel to inject, adjusting for factors such as throttle input and engine temperature to ensure efficient combustion under all conditions [4]. As shown in the diagram, the ECU directly controls each injector, regulating the exact timing and amount of fuel delivered to each cylinder. The ECU also manages related processes such as ignition timing, providing the spark at the optimal moment to maximize power and fuel economy [5]. Additionally, it oversees idle speed control by processing inputs primarily from the crankshaft position sensor, adjusting engine parameters to keep the engine stable at idle [6].\n\n![The fuel injection process is managed by the ECU for precise air-fuel mixing.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the ECU continuously collects information from multiple sensors, interprets that data, and issues real-time commands to components such as injectors and ignition systems to keep the engine running efficiently and reliably [2][11][7].

This is determined by observing that 4–8% of contacts typically become MQLs, and then a substantially greater portion—nearly half or more of those MQLs—are accepted by sales. These higher rates reflect healthier lead management, tighter sales and marketing alignment, and finer qualification practices at those organizations represented in the benchmark data.\n\n![Industry averages show a 45–75% conversion rate from MQL to SAL, much higher than the specific company's 1.5%.](image7)\n\nThe dramatic gap between the datasets—1.5% in one case versus 45–75% in another—reveals significant differences in operational execution. The implications are substantial: organizations with low MQL-to-SAL conversion likely waste marketing effort, fail to capitalize on generated demand, and experience friction between sales and marketing teams.
