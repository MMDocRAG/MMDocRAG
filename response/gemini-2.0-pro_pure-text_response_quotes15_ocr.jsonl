While the provided text does not explicitly state GBM division’s adjusted profit before tax, it states that the group's profit before tax decreased by $342 million (7%), to $4,830 million [6].\n\n![2020 Adjusted results](image2)\n\nThe contributing factors of the change of profit before tax were higher expected credit losses, other credit impairment charges, and lower revenue, with these negative impacts partially being offset by reduced operating expenses [2, 6].\n\nIn summary, GBM's net operating income increased by 3% in 2020 due to strong Global Markets performance, while the Group's adjusted profit before tax decreased by 7% due to increased credit losses and lower revenue in some sectors.\n"}

Specifically:\n\n*   **Discount Rate:** An increase in the discount rate by half a percentage point would decrease the DBO by €242 million, while a decrease of the same magnitude would increase the DBO by €271 million as of September 30, 2021.

The valued impact of the bank's air pollution (including SOx, NOx, CO, VOCs, and particulate matter) in 2019 was estimated to be $146,000. This figure was calculated using the social cost factors of each pollutant as reported in the World Resources Institute’s Transport Emissions & Social Cost Assessment (TESCA) Tool v1.0 [5]. These calculations reflect the bank's efforts to quantify the broader environmental and social costs associated with its emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, Bank of America addresses environmental issues by committing to net-zero GHG emissions before 2050, reporting and reducing GHG and air pollutant emissions, and quantifying the societal impacts of these emissions.\n"}

The Homestead Act, in particular, offered 160 acres of land to pioneers who built a permanent structure and lived on the land for five years, leading to a \"great tide of emigration for the west and especially Nebraska\" [9]. By 1900, almost 69,000 people had acquired land in Nebraska under the Homestead Act [9].\n\nAfter 1890, Hamilton County's population slowly declined [5]. The image that show the table illustrate this trend, with the population decreasing over the decades.\n![Map of Hamilton County, Nebraska.](image5)\nThis decline can be attributed to changes in agricultural practices. Mechanization led to farm consolidation, reducing the number of farms and increasing their average size [4]. This meant fewer people were needed to work the land.\n\nDespite the overall decline, some towns within Hamilton County, like Aurora, experienced population gains, contrary to the trend of small towns disappearing [2, 3].\n\nIn summary, the population of Hamilton County boomed in the late 1800s due to federal land policies and railroad construction, then declined in the 1900s as agricultural practices changed, leading to farm consolidation and reduced labor needs.\n"}

Its primary function is to query a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input image [8]. This retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, with a focus on optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [1, 8]. The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is implemented to enhance retrieval speed [7]. This system helps reduce the dimensions, optimizing the process of searching for the most relevant images or text matches [7].\n![Multimodal Retriever](image3)\n\nFollowing the retrieval phase, the **Memory** component, constructed by the multimodal retriever, stores explicit information about different categories [9]. This memory is utilized during the inference phase to retrieve the top-*k* similar results [6, 9].\n\nSubsequently, the retrieved information, including category labels and image embeddings, is integrated and passed to the **MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models)** [4]. The MLLMs use the retrieved results to rank the candidate object categories, utilizing a specially designed ranking prompt [4, 5]. This prompt guides the MLLMs to combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information, leading to the final prediction of the image category [4].\n![Ranking Prompt Example](image4)\n\nFor object detection datasets, two additional pre-processing steps, **cropping and blurring**, are applied [3]. Cropping isolates specific regions of interest within an image based on bounding box coordinates, and blurring non-target areas helps direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects for detection [3].\n![Pre-processing and Embedding & Retrieve Steps](image5)\n\nIn summary, the main components of the RAR pipeline are the Multimodal Retriever, Memory, MLLMs, and additional pre-processing steps for object detection, each contributing to an efficient and accurate retrieval and ranking process.\n\nThe main components in the RAR pipeline for multimodal retrieval are the Multimodal Retriever, Memory, and MLLMs, along with pre-processing steps (cropping and blurring) for object detection, each contributing to efficient and accurate retrieval and ranking.\n"}

To mitigate this, a special setting `z=10 (boost)` is introduced, which does not use the `extrep bigram` feature during weighted decoding, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate [4]. \n![Question-Asking Control Level with and without Repetition Control](image4)\n\nIn summary, at the highest control level (z=10), the introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate from the expected 100% to 79.67%.\n"}

However, they often fail to capture semantic similarity beyond the lexical level [10]. More recent approaches use word embeddings to capture semantic similarity [1]. Metrics like BERTScore create soft-alignments in an embedding space to compute semantic similarity [1].\n\nThe COMET framework is introduced, which leverages cross-lingual language modeling to predict human judgments of MT quality [6].

COMET models generally outperform other metrics across various language pairs, the COMET-RANK model performs particularly well. For language pairs with English as the target, COMET models are either better or competitive with all others [3].

Here's a breakdown of how it contributes:\n\n*   **Focusing on Relevant Objects:** In object detection, images often contain multiple objects of varying sizes, with some objects occupying very little space [4]. Pre-processing involves cropping the image regions based on the bounding box coordinates of potential objects [4]. This cropping isolates the individual objects, making it easier for the system to analyze them independently. Cropping can help system to identify the image region in `image2`.\n*   **Directing MLLMs' Attention:** Unlike image classification tasks where objects are usually centered and prominent, objects in detection datasets can be smaller and located anywhere in the image [4]. To guide the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a blurring technique is applied to the areas surrounding the target object [4]. This blurs out the background and irrelevant details, making the object of interest stand out.\n*. The pre-process step can direct the MLLMs’ focus toward the relevant objects in `image2`.\n* Use bbox to sort the candidate.\n\nThe pre-processing step in the diagram enhances zero-shot object recognition by cropping relevant regions based on bounding boxes and blurring non-target areas to focus the MLLMs' attention.\n"}

As consumption increases, the utility gained from each additional hot dog decreases [4, 5]. Eventually, the utility can even become negative, indicating dissatisfaction or discomfort [5].\n\nFor example, in one scenario, the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, but by the fourth hot dog, the utility has dropped to -2 [4]. This illustrates that the pleasure or benefit derived from each subsequent hot dog diminishes [9].\n![Utility diminishes with each additional hot dog consumed, eventually becoming negative.](image4)\n\nAnother scenario, the 64th hot dog give -40 utility, and 65th hot dog give -45 utility [5].

One key aspect is the concept of closure, where we perceive incomplete objects as whole [3]. Our mind fills in the visual gaps when parts of an image are missing [3]. Another core principle of Gestalt psychology emphasizes that when the human mind perceives a form, the whole has a reality of its own, independent of its parts [10]. This is related to the law of good gestalt, which focuses on conciseness [8]. As individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity to observe reality in its simplest form, which is the basis of gestalt theory [5, 8]. This means that perception prioritizes a global regularity over spatial relations [8].
