According to the data, Cuban voters are more inclined to favor Republican candidates compared to other Latino subgroups, with 55% supporting the Republican candidate, while only 35% support the Democratic candidate [3]. This is a notable contrast to Mexican and Puerto Rican voters, who predominantly support Democratic candidates [5].\n\nIn addition to their preference for Republican candidates, Cuban voters also show a higher likelihood of wanting former President Donald Trump to remain a major national political figure. Specifically, 25% of Cuban voters say Trump should run for president in 2024, which is significantly higher than the percentages among other Latino groups such as Mexicans (15%) and Puerto Ricans (13%) [7]. This indicates that Cuban voters not only lean toward Republican candidates but also express greater support for Trump's potential return to the presidency.\n\n![Cuban voters are more likely to support Republican candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and to want Trump to run for president in 2024](image3)\n\nFurthermore, when considering the broader context of political engagement, Cuban voters align with other Latino groups in terms of their interest in the upcoming elections, with a significant portion expressing that it really matters which party wins control of Congress [5]. However, their distinct political preferences set them apart from other Hispanic origin groups in the United States.\n\nIn conclusion, Cuban registered voters are the Hispanic origin group most likely to vote for a Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in their district and to say Trump should run for president in 2024."}

In 2008, following Obama’s victory, majorities of voters—regardless of party affiliation—favored their party's leaders moving in a more moderate direction [4]. Specifically, nearly six-in-ten (59%) Republicans and Republican leaners believed GOP leaders should work with Obama, indicating a willingness to engage in bipartisan efforts [8]. This contrasts sharply with the sentiments observed by 2016, where Republican and Republican-leaning voters overwhelmingly wanted the GOP to move in a more conservative direction. In 2016, 60% of Republicans expressed a preference for the party to adopt a more conservative stance, while only 36% supported a more moderate direction [7].\n\n![Republican Party leaning toward conservatism](image5)\n\nFor Democratic voters, the shift has also been significant. After Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012, only about a third of Democratic voters wanted the party to move in a more liberal direction [9]. However, by 2016, this sentiment had changed dramatically. About half of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (49%) believed that Democratic leaders in Washington should move in a more liberal direction, while nearly as many (47%) favored a more moderate approach [9]. This indicates a growing desire among Democrats to take a more progressive stance compared to previous years.\n\n![Shift in Democratic preferences toward liberalism](image3)\n\nThese trends are further reflected in public sentiment captured in surveys. For example, in November 2016, there was a stark divide between Trump and Clinton voters regarding their satisfaction with the election outcome. While Trump voters were overwhelmingly happy (94%), Clinton voters were largely unhappy (87%) [image1]. This division highlights the deepening partisan divide over time, especially when compared to the more unified feelings of 2008, when nearly six-in-ten Republicans supported working with Obama [8].\n\nIn summary, from 2008 to 2016, Republican voters increasingly favored a more conservative direction for their party, while Democratic voters showed a stronger inclination toward a more liberal stance, marking a clear shift in political orientation across both parties."}

In contrast, only **26% of Trump voters** believed that the president-elect should appoint Democrats to serve in his administration [6]. This highlights a notable divergence in expectations regarding cross-partisan appointments between the two presidential transitions.\n\nFurthermore, when considering all voters, **60% believed Obama should appoint Republicans**, whereas **only 26% of Trump voters supported the idea of him appointing Democrats** [6][8].

Conversely, the share of those who thought the campaign would \"definitely or probably fail\" dropped from 36% to 27% during the same period [7]. This indicates a growing optimism about the effectiveness of the military effort against ISIS.\n\n![Optimism about U.S. success against ISIS increased from July to December 2015](image3)\n\nAdditionally, overall ratings of how well the U.S. military effort was going remained negative, but there was an uptick in the belief that the campaign would ultimately be successful [3].

According to recent surveys, the overall percentage of Americans who believe Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence has decreased slightly since a historical high in September 2014, when 50% held this view. By December 2015, this share had dropped to 46%, indicating a modest but notable decline [4]. However, this change is not uniform across all groups.\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a significant role in shaping these perceptions. For instance, Republicans have consistently held higher rates of belief that Islam encourages violence compared to other groups. In December 2015, 68% of Republicans believed this, which is a historical high and only slightly changed from the previous year [6]. In contrast, Democrats have seen a more substantial shift. The share of Democrats who associate Islam with violence has declined by 12 percentage points since last year, from 42% to 30% [6]. This divergence has widened the partisan divide, making it the widest it has ever been [8].\n\nIdeological divides are even more pronounced. Among conservative Republicans, 77% believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, while only 16% disagree [7]. On the other end of the spectrum, liberal Democrats show nearly the opposite view: 73% say Islam is no more likely to encourage violence than other religions [7]. This stark ideological contrast highlights how political identity influences perceptions of Islam and its association with violence.\n\nAge also plays a factor. While younger Americans (ages 18 to 29) are less likely to associate Islam with violence—only 32% hold this view compared to roughly half of those in older age groups—the gap between age groups has narrowed slightly since last fall [2]. This suggests that while generational differences still exist, they are not as pronounced as before.\n\n![The table presents percentages from surveys conducted in July 2014, September 2014, and December 2015 across various demographic and political groups, including changes between September 2014 and December 2015.](image1)\n\n![The image is a line graph comparing two perceptions over time (from 2002 to 2015) regarding the encouragement of violence among followers of a religion versus other religions.](image4)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of whether Islam encourages violence more than other religions have shown some decline overall but remain deeply polarized along political lines, with Republicans holding more negative views and Democrats showing a marked decrease in such beliefs over time."}

Among these, 24% have heard or read “a lot” about it, suggesting a significant level of awareness and engagement with the topic [7]. However, while many find the idea plausible, they tend to express more worry than enthusiasm. For instance, 72% of Americans express worry about a future in which robots and computers do many human jobs, compared to only 33% who express enthusiasm [9].\n\nThis sentiment is further reinforced by the general public's anticipation of negative outcomes over positive ones. For example, 76% believe that inequality between rich and poor will be much worse as a result of automation, while only 43% think the economy will be more efficient [3]. Similarly, most Americans (57–59%) do not expect that people will find jobs more meaningful or that new, better-paying jobs will be created [3].\n\nDespite these concerns, there is still a notable level of optimism among those who are highly aware of the concept. Nearly half (48%) of Americans who have heard a lot about this idea find it extremely realistic that machines might one day perform many human jobs [6]. Additionally, these individuals express higher levels of enthusiasm compared to those with lower awareness [2].\n\nThe perception of risk also varies depending on personal experience with automation. Those who have already been impacted by automation in their careers are more likely to view the concept as realistic and are more supportive of interventions like universal basic income [5].\n\n![Americans are more worried than enthusiastic about the idea of machines performing human jobs, with 72% expressing concern versus 33% showing enthusiasm.](image4)\n\n![A majority of Americans (77%) consider it realistic that robots and computers might one day perform many human jobs, with 20% finding the prospect extremely realistic.](image3)\n\nIn summary, Americans generally perceive the concept of machines performing human jobs as plausible but are more concerned about its implications than excited about it."}

A significant majority of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, support limiting machines to performing dangerous and unhealthy jobs. This sentiment is strongly reflected in survey data, with **85% of Americans favoring** such a policy, and nearly half (47%) expressing strong support [9]. \n\nThis aligns with broader attitudes toward automation, where **58% of Americans believe there should be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines**, even if the machines are better and cheaper at doing the work [2]. This view is echoed across both major political parties, with 60% of Democrats and 54% of Republicans supporting such limitations [3].\n\nMoreover, when considering potential policy solutions to address job displacement caused by automation, the public shows notable enthusiasm for specific measures. For example, **60% of Americans support providing a guaranteed income** to meet basic needs, while **58% favor a national service program** that pays people to perform tasks even if machines could do them faster or cheaper [10]. These findings are visually represented in image4, which shows the distribution of opinions on these three policies, with the strongest support for limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs [image4].\n\nDespite this general support for limitations, there is still division on the issue. While **58% believe there should be limits on automation**, **41% think businesses are justified in replacing humans with machines** if it leads to better work at lower cost [7]. This divergence is illustrated in image2, which presents a pie chart showing the split between those who support limits and those who oppose them [image2].\n\nIn addition, the public appears more comfortable with the idea of machines handling dangerous or dirty jobs than with their widespread use in other areas. For instance, **85% of Americans are in favor of limiting machines to performing primarily those jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans** [10], while concerns about driverless vehicles remain high, with over half of the public not wanting to ride in one today [1]. This is further highlighted in image1, which details the varying levels of trust and enthusiasm among those who would and would not ride in driverless vehicles [image1].\n\nIn conclusion, public opinion leans heavily toward supporting limits on machine use in the workforce, especially in roles that pose risks to human health and safety, while also showing openness to policy solutions like universal basic income and national service programs to manage the impact of automation."}

Specifically, in January 2019, a majority of Democrats (70%) wanted their party’s leaders to \"stand up\" to Trump, even if it meant less gets done in Washington [6]. This aligns with earlier sentiments, as a year prior, 63% of Democrats held the same view [6]. This suggests a slight increase in the proportion of Democrats advocating for confrontation with Trump over time.\n\nFor Republicans, the data shows a similar trend but with different dynamics. In January 2019, 51% of Republicans wanted their leaders to \"stand up\" to Democrats, a notable increase from 40% a year earlier [6]. This reflects a growing sentiment within the Republican Party to adopt a more confrontational stance toward Democratic opposition.\n\nVisual support for these trends can be found in image1, which displays survey results on how U.S. adults feel about various topics, categorized by political affiliation. While the chart primarily focuses on general satisfaction levels, it highlights the stark contrast between Republicans and Democrats in their attitudes. For instance, 55% of Republicans expressed very positive feelings, while only 5% of Democrats did so [image1]. This reinforces the idea of diverging perspectives between the two parties, particularly regarding leadership approaches toward opposition.\n\nAnother relevant image is image4, which provides a detailed comparison of confidence levels in political abilities between Republicans/Lean Republicans and Democrats/Lean Democrats across various issues. Although this chart does not directly address the \"stand up\" to opposition sentiment, it illustrates the broader partisan divide in perceptions of leadership effectiveness.

Specifically, 42% of Americans believe that limited access to quality education is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in STEM fields [6]. This view is especially prevalent among black STEM workers, with 73% holding this belief [6].\n\nAnother critical factor is the **lack of encouragement to pursue STEM subjects at an early age**. A notable percentage of Americans, including 39% who believe this is a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in some STEM areas and 41% who see it as a major reason for the lack of blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs [5]. This aligns with findings that many individuals in STEM attribute the disparity to insufficient early encouragement for these groups to pursue such careers [1].\n\nThe **absence of role models** also plays a crucial role. For instance, 32% of those in STEM jobs cite the lack of black and Hispanic role models as a major reason for the underrepresentation of these groups [1]. Similarly, 24% of respondents identified the lack of female role models in STEM as a major reason for the underrepresentation of women [5].\n\nDiscrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is another significant concern. Among black STEM workers, 72% believe that discrimination is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs [7]. However, this perception varies across racial and ethnic groups, with only around a quarter of whites and Asians sharing this view [7].\n\n![Lack of access to quality education is seen as a major barrier for blacks and Hispanics in STEM](image1)\n\nAdditionally, **perceived differences in confidence and interest** are reported.

It describes the probability of an outcome occurring, based on statistical analysis, model results, or expert judgment. Likelihood statements are assigned specific numerical ranges, such as \"very unlikely\" (≤1 in 10), \"unlikely\" (≤1 in 3), \"as likely as not\" (~1 in 2), \"likely\" (≥2 in 3), and \"very likely\" (≥9 in 10) [3].\n\nThe evaluation process for both confidence and likelihood involves assessing the available literature, determining the quality and quantity of evidence, and evaluating the level of agreement across different studies. This process is documented in Traceable Accounts, which provide detailed information on how each chapter’s author team reached its conclusions [5].\n\n![Levels of confidence are categorized based on the strength of evidence and consensus among experts](image2)\n\n![Likelihood terms correspond to specific probability ranges, allowing for a quantitative description of uncertainty](image3) \n\nIn summary, the levels of confidence and likelihood are evaluated through a systematic assessment of evidence quality, quantity, and expert consensus, with confidence being a qualitative measure and likelihood a quantitative one."}

In comparison, **Trump voters are more optimistic**, with **50% expecting race relations to get better** and only **9% expecting them to worsen** [9]. This divergence highlights a significant divide in how each group perceives Trump's influence on race relations.\n\nRegarding political cooperation, or partisan relations, the data shows that **Trump voters are slightly less optimistic than Obama voters were in 2008** about improvements, with **47% expecting improvements** compared to **55% of Obama voters** [4]. Meanwhile, **Clinton voters are more likely than McCain voters in 2008 to believe that relations will get worse**, with **43% of Clinton voters** holding this view versus **31% of McCain voters** [4].\n\nThese findings are visually supported by image1, which compares overall opinions on whether Trump’s and Obama’s elections led to better, no change, or worse race relations. The chart clearly illustrates that **Trump voters are much more optimistic about improvements** in race relations (50% expect improvement) compared to **Clinton voters**, who are highly pessimistic (only 2% expect improvement) [image1].\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides further insight into how different voter groups perceived changes in the political climate.

This divide was even more pronounced among Clinton and Trump voters: 84% of Clinton voters anticipated worsening race relations under Trump, whereas half of Trump supporters expected improvement [1]. These findings are echoed in another text quote, which states that just a quarter (25%) of voters think Trump’s election will lead to better race relations, while 46% believe it will make them worse [3].\n\nIn contrast, expectations for partisan relations were similarly bleak but not as starkly divided. Overall, voters were largely skeptical about improvements in partisan relations, with only 27% expecting them to improve and 27% anticipating deterioration, while 45% expected little change [8]. However, there was a notable difference in expectations based on political affiliation. Trump voters were more optimistic than Clinton voters regarding partisan relations, with 47% of Trump voters expecting improvement compared to only 9% who thought they would worsen [6]. On the other hand, Clinton voters were more pessimistic, with 43% expecting partisan relations to worsen [9].\n\nThe implications of having enthusiastic supporters for a president were also surveyed, revealing that most Americans do not believe that such enthusiasm hinders legislative progress. In fact, 73% of all voters disagreed with the idea that having highly enthusiastic supporters means less gets done, while only 22% agreed [3].

In 2016, 60% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters wanted the GOP to head in a more conservative direction, while only 36% favored a more moderate approach [4]. This trend has remained largely unchanged from recent years, as seen in the data spanning from 2008 to 2016 in image2, which shows that the percentage of Republicans favoring a more conservative direction has remained relatively stable at around 60%, with only minor fluctuations over time.\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic voters have experienced a significant shift toward supporting a more liberal direction. In November 2016, 49% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters believed their party should move in a more liberal direction, compared to 47% who favored a more moderate stance [7]. This is a marked increase from previous years, such as 2012 and 2008, when fewer Democrats supported a more liberal direction [9]. Image3 visually captures this change, showing a narrowing gap between \"More moderate\" and \"More liberal\" preferences by 2016, with the latter gaining ground.\n\nThe reactions to the outcomes of the 2016 election further highlight these partisan divides. According to image5, the majority of all voters (52%) were happy with the Republican Party maintaining control of Congress, while 45% were unhappy [10]. However, this sentiment was starkly divided along partisan lines. Trump voters were overwhelmingly happy (94%) with the outcome, whereas Clinton supporters were predominantly unhappy (87%) [8].\n\n![Republican voters prefer a more conservative direction](image2)  \n![Democratic voters show increased support for a more liberal direction](image3)  \n![Partisan reactions to the 2016 election outcome are sharply divided](image5)\n\nIn summary, Republican voters have consistently favored a conservative direction, while Democratic voters have increasingly supported a more liberal stance, and these changes are reflected in their contrasting reactions to the 2016 election outcome."}

This sentiment was echoed across different groups: **59% of Republicans or those leaning Republican** supported working with Obama, while **36% wanted them to stand up to him** [10]. Even among Democrats or those leaning Democratic, **86% wanted Republicans to work with Obama**, with only **11% preferring them to stand up to him** [10]. This suggests a general expectation that political leaders should prioritize collaboration over confrontation in the wake of an election.\n\nContrastingly, in 2016, after Donald Trump's election, the sentiment shifted significantly. Among all voters, **59% believed Democratic leaders should work with Trump** to get things done, even if it meant disappointing their supporters, while **39% felt they should stand up to Trump on important issues** [image1]. However, this contrast became more pronounced when looking at partisan divides. **Among Republicans or those leaning Republican, 84% preferred working with Trump**, while only **14% preferred standing up to him** [image1]. In stark contrast, **among Democrats or those leaning Democratic, 32% supported working with Trump**, and **65% supported standing up to him** [image1]. This indicates a growing divide in expectations between the two major parties regarding how political leaders should engage with newly elected presidents.\n\nFurthermore, the data from 2008 shows that **nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of Obama’s voters** believed Democratic leaders in Washington should work with Republicans even at the risk of disappointing their supporters [9], which contrasts sharply with the **65% of Democratic voters in 2016 who supported standing up to Trump** [image1].\n\n![Voter expectations towards political leaders working with or against newly elected presidents in 2008 and 2016](image1)"}

According to survey data, **92% of voters believed there was more \"mudslinging\" or negative campaigning than in past elections**, a 20 percentage point increase from the previous high of 72% after the 2004 election [7]. This trend is visually represented in image1, which shows a line graph illustrating the rising perception of mudslinging over time, with 2016 being the highest at 92% [image1].\n\nThis heightened negativity appears to have had a direct impact on how voters evaluated political actors and institutions. For instance, only **22% of voters gave the press an A or B grade**, while **38% gave it a failing grade** [3]. Similarly, **21% of voters gave pollsters an A or B grade**, compared to **30% who gave them an F** [3]. These low ratings are consistent with the overall sense of disillusionment captured in image4, where the press, pollsters, and even the Republican and Democratic parties received poor grades from voters [image4].\n\nVoter perceptions of the candidates themselves were also deeply polarized. Among Trump voters, **96% said his election made them feel hopeful**, while **74% felt proud** [1]. In contrast, **90% of Clinton voters felt uneasy**, **77% felt sad**, and **76% felt scared** about Trump’s victory, with only **7% feeling hopeful** and **1% feeling proud** [1]. This emotional divide is further illustrated in image3, which shows the distribution of emotions associated with the election, including **53% feeling uneasy**, **51% feeling hopeful**, and **41% each feeling sad or scared** [image3].\n\nMoreover, the general public's evaluation of the election process itself was highly critical. Only **40% of voters gave “the voters” an A or B grade**, the lowest percentage since 1996 [4], suggesting that the negative tone of the campaign may have contributed to a broader sense of self-criticism among voters.\n\nIn summary, the increased negativity in the 2016 campaign, as evidenced by the rising perception of mudslinging [image1], directly correlates with the declining trust in political entities like the press, pollsters, and political parties [image4], as well as the polarized emotional responses of voters [image3]."}

In contrast, Clinton voters predominantly felt \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" and \"disgusted,\" with large shares also reporting feelings of uneasiness, sadness, and fear [8]. This divergence in emotional responses is visually captured in image3, which shows that Trump voters were more likely to express positive emotions such as happiness and surprise, while Clinton voters leaned toward negative emotions like shock and disappointment.\n\nThese emotional reactions correlate with broader perceptions of Trump's performance and the nature of the campaign. For instance, although Trump received relatively low grades for his conduct during the campaign—only 30% of voters gave him an A or B—Clinton fared slightly better, with 43% giving her an A or B [4]. However, both candidates were viewed critically by the public, with even lower ratings given to the Republican and Democratic parties [4]. This is further supported by image4, which illustrates that the Republican Party received the lowest average grade (D+), while the Democratic Party scored slightly higher (C-).\n\nMoreover, the overall perception of the election was characterized by a significant increase in mudslinging compared to previous elections. As shown in image1, 92% of voters in 2016 believed there was more mudslinging than in past elections—a 20 percentage point increase from the previous high in 2004. This aligns with text quote [7], which states that 92% of voters perceived more negative campaigning in 2016 than in any prior election. The intense negativity likely contributed to the strong emotional responses observed among both Trump and Clinton voters.\n\nIn summary, the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters were polarized, with Trump supporters expressing more positive emotions and Clinton supporters feeling more negative and shocked. These reactions are closely tied to the overall perception of Trump’s performance and the unprecedented level of mudslinging in the 2016 election. ![Trump voters felt happy and surprised; Clinton voters felt shocked and disappointed](image3) ![92% of voters in 2016 perceived more mudslinging than in past elections](image1)"}

According to recent surveys, Americans’ ratings of the government’s efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks [2]. Specifically, more people now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) compared to those who say it is doing very or fairly well (46%) [2]. This marks a substantial decline from earlier in the year when 72% of Americans believed the government was performing well [2].\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping these perceptions. For example, Republicans have become increasingly critical of the government's anti-terrorism efforts, with only 27% now saying the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [3]. In contrast, Democrats remain the only partisan group where a majority (64%) still believe the government is doing at least fairly well, though this has dropped from 85% in January [3]. Independents also show a significant decline in positive ratings, with their approval dropping 25 points from 69% to 44% [3].\n\nWhen it comes to concerns about anti-terrorism policies, there is a clear shift in public sentiment. A majority of Americans (56%) now express concern that the government’s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, compared to 28% who believe they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties [10]. This trend has been particularly pronounced among Republicans, with 71% expressing concern that policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January and 33 points since July 2013 [4]. \n\nAge also influences these perceptions. Older Americans (aged 50 and older) are more likely to give the government low marks for its performance in reducing the terrorist threat, with 57% saying it is not doing well [6]. In contrast, younger adults (ages 18-29) are more positive, with 53% giving the government a favorable rating [6].

This suggests that as individuals age, they become more concerned about the adequacy of government action in addressing terrorism.\n\nPolitical ideology also influences these perceptions. For example, evaluations of the government’s job in reducing the terrorist threat are more positive among those with postgraduate degrees than among other educational groups, with 58% saying the government is doing very or fairly well [9].

In contrast, Democrats have seen a notable decline in this belief, with only 30% holding this view as of the latest data, down from 42% in September 2014 [9]. This growing partisan divide reflects a deepening polarization in how different groups perceive the relationship between Islam and violence [7].\n\nMeanwhile, public opinion on whether Islam encourages violence has remained closely divided, with 46% believing it is more likely than other religions to do so, while 45% disagree, showing little change since 2014 [3]. However, within specific ideological groups, such as conservative Republicans, there is a stronger association between Islam and violence compared to other groups [2].\n\nRegarding views on government handling of terrorism, there has been a general trend toward more negative assessments across the political spectrum. For example, only 27% of Republicans now believe the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [6]. Similarly, positive ratings among independents have dropped significantly, from 69% to 44% [6].

Among political groups, conservative Republicans are the only major group where a majority (57%) supports greater scrutiny of Muslims because of their faith [6]. In contrast, liberal Democrats are particularly likely to reject this idea, with 87% stating that Muslims should not be subject to greater scrutiny than those in other religious groups [2]. Similarly, clear majorities of independents (62%) and Democrats (76%) also oppose increased scrutiny of Muslims based on their religion [5].\n\nDemographically, younger individuals are less likely to support additional scrutiny of Muslims. For example, 80% of young adults (ages 18-29) say that scrutiny of U.S. Muslims solely because of their religion should not be part of federal efforts to prevent terrorism [8]. This contrasts sharply with older individuals, where half (50%) of those aged 50 and older believe Muslims should be subject to more scrutiny than others [1]. Additionally, non-white individuals, including blacks (74%) and Hispanics (66%), are more likely than whites (57%) to reject the idea of scrutinizing Muslims based on their faith [10].\n\nThese differing perceptions of scrutiny are closely tied to the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue. Republicans, for instance, are more likely than Democrats or independents to prioritize issues related to defense, national security, and terrorism. Specifically, 41% of Republicans cite terrorism, defense issues, and national security as the most important problem facing the nation, compared to 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats [4]. This aligns with the broader trend that Republicans are more likely to support increased scrutiny of Muslims, while Democrats and independents are more likely to oppose it.\n\n![Republicans are more likely to prioritize terrorism and national security issues compared to Democrats and independents](image4)\n\nFurthermore, the perception of scrutiny is reflected in survey data showing that Republicans (49%) are more likely than any other group to believe that Muslims should be subject to greater scrutiny than people in other religious groups, whereas Democrats (20%) and independents (31%) are less likely to hold this view [3].\n\n![Political groups differ significantly in their views on whether Muslims should be subject to additional scrutiny based on their religion](image3)\n\nIn summary, political and demographic factors strongly influence perceptions of Muslim scrutiny, with conservatives and older individuals more likely to support increased scrutiny, while younger and minority groups are more likely to oppose it. These views are closely linked to the prioritization of terrorism and national security as key national issues, with Republicans generally placing more emphasis on these concerns than other groups."}

For instance, while 41% of Republicans identified terrorism and national security as the most pressing issues, only 23% of Democrats and 28% of independents shared this view [1]. Similarly, older adults (50+) were more likely to give the government low marks for its performance against terrorism compared to younger adults (18-29), with 57% of older individuals feeling the government was not doing well, compared to 46% of younger adults [2]. ![Older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism](image10).\n\nEducational background further influences these perceptions.

This increase suggests a growing polarization not only among partisans but also among those who do not strongly identify with either party.\n\nAmong independents, there is a clear distinction between those who lean toward one party and those who do not lean at all. For instance, while the percentage of independents who do not lean toward a party and have an unfavorable view of both parties has increased significantly over time, it remains higher than for other groups [8]. In fact, as of 2018, 37% of independents who do not lean toward a party had very unfavorable opinions of the Republican Party, compared to just 8% in 1994 [6]. Similarly, Republican-leaning independents have shown a marked increase in their very unfavorable opinions of the Democratic Party, rising from 15% in 1994 to 39% in 2018 [6].\n\nThis growing divide is also reflected in the breakdown of favorability and unfavorability towards each party among different subgroups of independents.

In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe [8]. However, even among Republicans, support for increased spending has declined sharply—from 62% in 2017 to 48% in 2019, as illustrated in image2 [image2]. Democrats have also seen a modest decline in support, from 34% in 2017 to 28% in 2019 [8].\n\nIn Germany, partisan divides are evident as well. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are more in favor of increasing defense spending, with 51% supporting it, while supporters of the Greens are more skeptical, with only 28% in favor [1]. The SPD stands in the middle, with 41% supporting an increase [1]. This contrast is visually represented in image4, which compares the levels of support for increasing defense spending among these political parties [image4].\n\nMoreover, views on the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany differ significantly between the two countries. In the U.S., 85% believe these bases are important to the security of their country, with nearly six-in-ten considering them very important [6]. In contrast, only about half of Germans see U.S. military bases as important to their country’s national security, with 45% disagreeing [9]. This divergence is highlighted in image3, which shows that U.S. respondents are far more likely to view the subject as \"very important\" compared to German respondents [image3].\n\nIn conclusion, American and German opinions on defense spending have evolved over the years, with Americans increasingly favoring the maintenance of current spending levels and Germans showing a slight shift toward supporting increases. Partisan differences within each country reflect these trends, with Republicans in the U.S. being more supportive of increased spending, while in Germany, CDU/CSU supporters are more likely to back increases compared to the Greens."}

In the U.S., support for increasing European allies’ defense spending has declined over time. In 2017, 45% of Americans believed that European allies should increase their defense budgets, but by 2019, this share had dropped to 35%, while the proportion favoring maintaining current levels rose to 50% [4]. This reflects a growing preference among Americans to keep defense spending stable rather than push for increases [image1].\n\nIn Germany, there has also been a shift, though from a lower base. In 2017, only 32% of Germans supported increasing defense spending, while 51% favored maintaining current levels. By 2019, the number of Germans supporting an increase had risen slightly to 40%, while those wanting to maintain spending fell to 41% [image1]. This suggests a more balanced division between increasing and maintaining defense budgets in Germany compared to the earlier period.\n\nPartisan differences are evident in both countries. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have historically been more supportive of increased defense spending in Europe than Democrats. However, even among Republicans, the share who believe European allies should increase their budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points since 2017 [3]. Similarly, Democratic support for this view has also decreased, though to a lesser extent [image3].\n\nIn Germany, partisan views on defense spending are also divided. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are more likely to favor increasing defense spending, with 51% in favor, while supporters of the Greens are more skeptical, with only 28% supporting an increase. The SPD falls in between, with 41% supporting an increase [9]. This highlights a clear divide along political lines within Germany as well.\n\nAdditionally, generational differences in Germany reveal varying attitudes toward the U.S. military presence, which is closely tied to national defense. Younger Germans (ages 18–29) are less likely to see U.S. military bases in Germany as important to their country’s security, with 60% believing they do not contribute to German national security. In contrast, 61% of Germans aged 65 and older believe these bases are important to Germany’s defense [8] [image4].\n\nThe differing perspectives between Americans and Germans on the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany further highlight the divergence in views on national defense. While 85% of Americans see these bases as important to U.S. security interests, only about 15% of Germans view them as very important [6] [image2].\n\nIn summary, both American and German views on national defense spending have evolved from 2017 to 2019, with Americans showing a trend toward maintaining current spending levels and Germans becoming more divided on whether to increase or maintain defense budgets. Partisan differences in both countries reflect these shifts, with distinct preferences across political groups."}

However, support among Republicans for the idea that European allies should increase their defense budgets has declined by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [3].\n\nIn Germany, partisan differences also shape views on defense spending. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are generally in favor of increasing defense spending, while supporters of the Greens express more skepticism, with only 28% wanting to raise defense spending. Members of the SPD fall in between, with 41% supporting an increase in defense spending [5]. This suggests a clear partisan divide, with more conservative parties being more supportive of increased defense spending than more progressive ones.\n\nOver time, public opinion in both countries has shown some shifts. In the U.S., while support for increased European defense spending has decreased slightly among Republicans, it has remained relatively stable among Democrats [3]. In Germany, the share of people who believe Germany should increase defense spending has risen from 32% in 2017 to 40% in 2019 [image1].

For instance, a majority of Republicans believe that the U.S. should focus on its own problems rather than helping other nations, with 76% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believing the U.S. has done a \"fair or poor\" job in handling the pandemic [5]. In contrast, Democrats are more likely to support helping other countries, with 60% believing other nations should manage their own issues, compared to only 39% who think the U.S. should take the lead [3]. This partisan divide is further reinforced by ideological lines: liberal Democrats are more critical of the U.S.’s response to the pandemic than conservative or moderate Democrats [9], while conservative Republicans are particularly harsh in their judgment of China’s handling of the virus, with 80% saying it has done a poor job [6].\n\nEducational background also plays a role in shaping these views. More educated individuals tend to be more supportive of global engagement. For example, postgraduates are more likely to believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, with 60% holding this view, compared to only 29% of those with a high school diploma or less [10].

This wide gap is further reinforced by education levels: more educated Americans are more critical of the U.S. response. For instance, around two-thirds of those with postgraduate degrees say the U.S. has done a poor job, compared to only about 43% of those with a high school degree or less [2].

This stark partisan divide is also reflected in image2, which shows a large gap between political leanings in the U.S., with Republicans comprising 71% of respondents and Democrats only 27%, highlighting the deep ideological split [image2].\n\nRegarding China, while majorities across all educational groups believe China has not handled the pandemic well [7], the degree of this belief varies by political affiliation. Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to hold this view, with eight-in-ten conservative Republicans believing China has not handled the crisis well [9]. In contrast, Democrats are less critical of China’s handling of the pandemic, showing a more nuanced perspective.\n\nInterestingly, when it comes to evaluating other countries like Germany and South Korea, those who believe the U.S. can learn from foreign countries tend to rate these nations more favorably. For example, 70% of those who think the U.S. can learn from other countries say Germany is handling the coronavirus outbreak well, compared with only 48% of those who think the U.S. can learn little or nothing from other countries [10]. This suggests that political beliefs about international learning influence evaluations of foreign responses to the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, political affiliations shape perceptions of both the U.S. and China's pandemic responses, with Republicans generally holding more positive views of the U.S. and more negative views of China, while Democrats show the opposite pattern. ![Republicans are more likely to view the U.S. response positively and China's negatively](image2)"}

This divide also extends to age, with older Americans being more likely than younger ones to expect China's influence to wane [1].\n\nIn contrast, views about the U.S. are more divided. About three-in-ten Americans think the U.S.’s global influence will be strengthened, while the same proportion believes it will weaken, and four-in-ten expect no change [4]. Partisan differences are stark here too: Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe the U.S. will gain influence from the crisis, whereas Democrats are four times more likely than Republicans to expect a decline in American influence [3]. This internal division within the Democratic Party is notable, as liberal supporters are 20 percentage points more likely than conservatives and moderates to foresee a decline in U.S. influence [3].\n\nRegarding the EU, fewer Americans believe its influence will change significantly. While half of Americans think China’s influence will decline, far fewer hold similar views about the EU [2]. The data from image3 further illustrates this, showing that 19% of respondents believe the EU will have more influence, 59% think it will remain the same, and 21% believe it will have less [image3].\n\nEducation level also plays a role in shaping these views.

This partisan divide is more pronounced now than in previous years, as noted in earlier surveys where such differences were less stark [6].\n\n![Republicans predominantly believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems](image2)  \n![Democrats are more divided, with liberal Democrats more likely to support helping other countries](image2)\n\nOver time, these views have shifted. For example, in a survey conducted online among members of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, 42% of Americans believed the U.S. does too much to help solve world problems, compared to 28% who thought it does too little and 28% who felt it does the right amount [9]. This contrasts with earlier data from 2013, where 51% believed the U.S. did too much, 17% thought it did too little, and 28% felt it did the right amount [image1].\n\n![Changes in perceptions from 2013 to 2020 show a shift in opinions about whether the U.S. does too much, too little, or the right amount](image1)\n\nIn summary, perceptions of the U.S. role in solving world problems differ by political affiliation, with Republicans generally favoring a more isolationist stance and Democrats being more divided, especially along ideological lines. These views have evolved over time, reflecting changing public sentiment."}

This sentiment is further reinforced by the fact that over three-quarters of Republicans (71%) praise the country’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, while a similar share of Democrats (73%) criticize it [2]. Additionally, a majority of Republicans (62%) think the U.S. should focus on its own problems rather than assisting other countries, whereas only about a quarter of Democrats share this view [10]. These differences highlight a clear partisan divide in how Americans perceive the role of the U.S. in global affairs.\n\nWhen it comes to education, higher levels of education correlate with greater support for international engagement. For instance, six-in-ten postgraduates believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, compared to only 29% of those with a high school diploma or less [6]. Similarly, more educated individuals are more critical of the U.S. response to the pandemic, with two-thirds of postgraduates rating it as poor, compared to just 43% of those with a high school degree or less [9]. This suggests that educational background plays a significant role in shaping views on both global engagement and domestic policy effectiveness.\n\nThese findings are visually represented in the bar chart from image1, which shows that Republicans are overwhelmingly more likely (76%) to believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems, while Democrats are more divided, with 53% favoring this approach and 46% supporting international assistance [image1]. The chart also illustrates how educational attainment influences these views, with postgraduates being more supportive of helping other countries compared to those with less education.\n\nIn conclusion, views on U.S. global engagement and dealing with domestic issues are closely tied to political affiliation and educational attainment, with Republicans and less-educated individuals generally favoring a more inward-focused approach, while Democrats and more highly educated individuals are more inclined to support international involvement."}

Text [1] highlights that a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (72%) favor a tougher stance with China, especially among conservative Republicans (81%). In contrast, Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents are more inclined toward building stronger ties, with about six-in-ten supporting this approach. This aligns with image3, which visually confirms these trends: 72% of Republicans/lean Republicans support getting tougher with China, while only 26% prefer building a strong relationship. Among Democrats/lean Democrats, the preference is reversed, with 60% favoring stronger ties and just 37% preferring a tougher approach.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating the impact of tariffs, opinions diverge along partisan lines as well. Text [2] notes that about half of Republicans view increased tariffs on Chinese and other foreign products as beneficial to the U.S., particularly conservative Republicans. However, Democrats mostly see tariffs as harmful to the U.S. This sentiment is echoed in image5, which shows that 60% of Democrats/lean Democrats believe tariffs are bad for the U.S., compared to only 25% of Republicans/lean Republicans who hold this view. Within these groups, conservative Republicans are even more positive about tariffs, with 61% considering them good for the U.S., while liberal Democrats are the most critical, with 63% viewing them as bad.\n\nThe public's overall assessment of the effects of tariffs on the U.S. is mixed, as shown in image4. While 44% of Americans believe the impact has been bad, 23% think there’s no real effect, and 30% see it as good. However, when it comes to personal impact, a majority (56%) feel there has been no real effect on them personally, regardless of their political affiliation or income level, as noted in text [5].\n\nYounger Americans, particularly those aged 18–29, tend to prioritize building stronger relationships with China over taking a tougher stance, as mentioned in text [10]. This is also reflected in image3, where younger individuals (ages 18–29) show a 59% preference for building stronger relationships, compared to 37% who favor getting tougher.\n\nIn summary, political affiliation strongly influences views on both the impact of trade policies with China and the preferred approach to economic relations. Republicans, especially conservatives, are more likely to support a tougher stance and view tariffs positively, while Democrats, particularly liberals, tend to favor stronger relationships and see tariffs as harmful. These differences underscore the deepening partisan divide over U.S.-China economic policy. \n\n![Republicans and lean Republicans largely support getting tougher with China, while Democrats and lean Democrats prefer building stronger relationships.](image3)  \n![Democrats/lean Democrats are more likely to view tariffs as bad for the U.S., while Republicans/lean Republicans are more divided or positive about their impact.](image5)"}

Similarly, concerns about cyberattacks from China have grown, with the percentage of Americans viewing this as a serious issue rising from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021 [image1]. This is reflected in the data showing that Americans perceive cyber threats, human rights violations, job losses to China, and China’s growing military and technological power as major challenges in the U.S.-China relationship [9].\n\nEconomic issues also remain central to American concerns. Many Americans view China's dominance in manufacturing and its impact on the U.S. economy as problematic, often at the expense of workers and the environment [1].

According to the Pew Research Center’s National Survey of Latinos, since 2008, most Latino subgroups have become more optimistic about their finances [1]. This trend is especially pronounced among those who have completed some college, whose economic optimism has grown roughly twice as fast as those with a high school diploma or less education (+20 percentage points vs. +9 or +11) [2].\n\nFor example, the share of Latinos who expect their family’s finances to improve “a lot” or “some” in the coming year increased by 14 percentage points, rising from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 [10]. This increase is even more striking when compared to the general population, where the share of Americans with similar expectations rose only 6 percentage points, from 56% in 2008 to 61% in 2015 [3]. A bar chart comparing these trends visually reinforces this contrast: while the \"General population\" shows an increase from 56 in 2008 to 61 in 2015, representing a change of +6, the \"All Hispanics\" group shows a much larger increase from 67 in 2008 to 81 in 2015, representing a change of +14 ![Hispanic financial optimism increased more than the general population](image3).\n\nAge also plays a role in shaping financial optimism. Among younger Hispanics (ages 18–29), optimism has risen sharply, with a 27 percentage point increase since 2008, from 21% to 48% reporting excellent or good financial shape in 2015 [8]. Similarly, the share of Latinos under 30 expecting their financial condition to get better increased by 13 percentage points, while older Latinos (65+) saw a 7-point rise [5]. These differences are illustrated in another bar chart, which shows that younger age groups had the largest increases in optimism about their financial future ![Younger Hispanics show greater optimism about financial improvement](image1).\n\nEducational attainment further influences these trends. Latinos with some college education experienced the fastest growth in optimism (+20 percentage points), outpacing those with a high school diploma or less (+9 or +11) [2]. This pattern is clearly visible in a detailed bar chart that compares educational subgroups, highlighting the substantial gap between those with higher education and those with less [1].\n\nWhen comparing Hispanic subgroups to the general population, it becomes evident that the overall trend of increasing optimism is even more pronounced among Hispanics. For instance, while the general public's optimism grew modestly over the same period, the gap between Hispanics and the general population widened significantly, reaching its largest since the series began [3]. Another bar chart illustrating how different Hispanic subgroups perceive their economic well-being further supports this finding, showing that a large majority of Hispanics believe they are economically better off than before, with variations across demographics ![Hispanic subgroups report being better off economically](image2).\n\nIn conclusion, financial optimism among different Hispanic subgroups has grown substantially from 2008 to 2015, particularly among younger individuals, those with higher education, and U.S.-born Hispanics. This growth has been faster than the general population's, highlighting a widening optimism gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Americans."}

Those who are more optimistic about their own financial conditions are more likely to believe that their children will experience upward economic mobility. For instance, it is noted that \"Hispanics with a positive view of their current financial situation are significantly more likely than those who rate their economic circumstances as only fair or poor to say their family’s finances will improve over the next 12 months\" [3]. This suggests that present-day financial stability plays a crucial role in shaping expectations for the future.\n\nEducational attainment also influences these expectations. Among Hispanics, high school graduates are more optimistic than those with some college experience or more, with 79% predicting that their children will be better off financially [5]. In contrast, those with at least some college experience expect a slightly lower percentage (69%) of their children to be better off financially. This indicates that while education is important, there may be nuances in how different levels of education correlate with financial optimism for the next generation.\n\nMoreover, the segmented bar chart in image2 illustrates how people with varying financial conditions expect their situations to change. For example, individuals with excellent financial conditions are most likely to expect significant improvement (45%), whereas those with poor financial conditions are less optimistic, with only 15% expecting a lot of improvement. These expectations could influence their perceptions of their children's financial futures, as those who feel more secure financially may project greater optimism onto their children's prospects.\n\n![Hispanic adults are more likely to expect their children’s financial situations to improve if they themselves have a positive view of their current financial status.](image2)\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides further insight into how different demographic groups perceive their economic well-being.

Median household wealth for Hispanic households was significantly lower than that of all U.S. households in 2013, at $13,700 versus $81,400 [image1]. Additionally, the poverty rate for Hispanics in 2014 was 23.6%, which is higher than the national average of 14.8% [image1].\n\nRegarding **unemployment trends**, the data shows that while the unemployment rate for Hispanics has improved since the Great Recession, it remains higher than pre-recession levels and above that of non-Hispanic workers. The unemployment rate for Hispanics fell from a high of 12.8% in early 2010 to 6.4% by late 2015, still above its low of 5% in late 2006 [6].\n\n![Comparison of unemployment rates between Hispanics and non-Hispanics](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, while there has been improvement in perceptions of financial well-being and some reduction in unemployment rates among Latinos from 2000 to 2015, these groups continue to face economic challenges relative to the broader U.S. population."}

According to the data, the unemployment rate for Hispanics has shown improvement since the Great Recession but remains higher than pre-recession levels and above that of non-Hispanic workers. For example, the Hispanic unemployment rate fell from a high of 12.8% in early 2010 to 6.4% by late 2015, still remaining above its 2006 low of 5% [6]. In contrast, the non-Hispanic unemployment rate was consistently lower, ending at 4.8% in 2015 [image5].\n\nEconomic perceptions also differ between the two groups. Hispanics have expressed more optimism about national economic conditions compared to other groups. In December 2015, 35% of Hispanics said economic conditions were good or excellent, which is higher than the 25% reported among whites [9]. Furthermore, Hispanics are more likely to expect improvements in the coming year, with one-third (34%) anticipating better economic conditions [9]. This optimism may be linked to their strong belief in upward mobility for their children’s financial futures, with 72% expecting their children to be better off financially than they themselves are [5].\n\nHowever, despite this optimism, income and wealth disparities persist. Median household income for Hispanics stagnated after the Great Recession, reaching $42,491 in 2014—a level unchanged since the recession [3]. This is significantly lower than the median income for all U.S. households, which was $53,700 in the same year [image2]. Additionally, Hispanic households experienced a larger percentage decline in net worth during and after the recession compared to white households, and their recovery has been slower [3].\n\n![Hispanic unemployment rate remains higher than non-Hispanic workers from 2000 to 2015](image5)\n\n![Median household income for Hispanics is lower than that of all U.S. households, while poverty rates are higher](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, while Hispanic unemployment rates have improved over time, they remain higher than those of non-Hispanic workers. Despite this, Hispanics tend to have more positive economic perceptions and expectations for the future. However, these positive outlooks do not fully offset the persistent income and wealth gaps between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations."}

The \"Hispanic\" group started at 76% in 2004, declined during the economic downturn, and then rose sharply to 81% in 2015.\n\nIn terms of family income relative to the cost of living, the situation was mixed. In 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos said their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, while 37% said it was staying about even, and 10% said it was going up faster than the cost of living [3]. These views were similar to those of blacks and whites. Between 2014 and 2015, Hispanic views on family income in relation to the cost of living remained unchanged, with about half of all Hispanic adults in both years saying they were falling behind financially [4].\n\n![Perceptions of Family Income Relative to Cost of Living Among Hispanic, White, and Black Adults in 2014 and 2015](image1)  \nThis bar chart compares the perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living among Hispanic, White, and Black adults in 2014 and 2015.

This suggests that men may be more exposed to or more aware of such behaviors.\n\nOn the other hand, women are slightly more likely than men to see people being kind or supportive (24% vs. 17%) [image1]. Despite these differences, the largest share of both men (52%) and women (56%) say they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media [10].\n\nIn terms of efforts to spread or correct misinformation, around two-thirds of users (63%) say they generally see an even mix of people trying to be deceptive and those trying to point out inaccurate information [5]. However, men are around twice as likely as women to say they more often see people being deceptive (24% vs. 13%) [image1]. This highlights a gender-based difference in perception regarding the prevalence of deceptive content.\n\nFurthermore, users frequently encounter posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated, with 58% reporting that they see this type of content frequently [image4]. These types of posts may contribute to the emotional responses observed among users, such as feeling amused or angry [image3]. The frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated content could also influence how users perceive deception or misleading information, potentially reinforcing their views on the prevalence of such behaviors.\n\n![Men are more likely than women to see people being bullying or deceptive, while women are more likely to see people being kind or supportive.](image1)  \n![The majority of users see an equal mix of deceptive behavior and attempts to correct misinformation, though men are more likely to perceive deception as more common.](image1)  \n![Users frequently encounter dramatic or exaggerated posts, which may influence their emotional experiences and perceptions of online behavior.](image4)  \n\nIn summary, men are more likely than women to perceive bullying and deceptive behavior as more common on social media, while women are more likely to perceive kindness and support. These differences in perception may be influenced by the frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated content, which is itself a common occurrence on social media platforms."}

For instance, men are more likely than women to encounter or perceive bullying or mean behavior online. Specifically, 29% of men report seeing people being mean or bullying more often compared to 19% of women [4]. Conversely, women are slightly more likely than men to see kind or supportive behavior online [4]. This suggests that men may be more exposed to or sensitive to negative content, while women may be more exposed to or sensitive to positive content.\n\nAdditionally, men are around twice as likely as women to say they more often see people trying to be deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%) [10]. However, majorities of both genders report seeing an equal mix of deceptive content and attempts to correct misinformation [10]. These differences in perception could indicate that men might be more skeptical or cautious about the authenticity of information they encounter online, whereas women may be more engaged with efforts to correct misinformation.\n\n![Men are more likely to see people being mean or bullying online](image2)  \n![Men are more likely to see deceptive content than women](image2)\n\nThese findings suggest that social media platforms should consider gender-specific approaches when tailoring content and advertisements. For example, platforms could use data to show men more content that aligns with their tendency to see a mix of supportive and bullying behaviors, while emphasizing corrective information for women who may be more inclined to engage with such content. Similarly, advertising strategies might need to be adjusted based on these behavioral differences—such as showing men more targeted ads that are less intrusive or more relevant to their interests, while ensuring that women feel supported and informed through their interactions with the platform.\n\nIn conclusion, social media platforms can leverage these insights to create more personalized and effective experiences by considering how men and women perceive and interact with different types of content and behavior online."}

For instance, a majority of users across different age groups find it acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to recommend events happening in their area. Specifically, 80% of users aged 30-49, 78% of those aged 18-29, 72% of those aged 50-64, and 67% of users aged 65+ approve of this practice [1]. This suggests that users are generally more comfortable with data being used for event recommendations, likely because it aligns with personal interests rather than political or commercial manipulation.\n\nHowever, when it comes to using data for other purposes, such as recommending people they might want to know, there is a notable generational divide. For example, 67% of users aged 18-29 find this acceptable, while only 36% of users aged 65+ do [image1]. This highlights how younger users tend to be more open to data-driven social connections, whereas older users are more cautious about such practices.\n\nAnother key area of concern is the use of data for political messaging. Across all age groups, a substantial majority finds this unacceptable. In fact, 31% of users aged 65+ say this is \"not at all acceptable,\" which is higher than any other category [image2]. This indicates that regardless of age, users are wary of their data being used for political campaigns, likely due to concerns about privacy and manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, users’ comfort with targeted advertisements also differs by age group. While 60% of users aged 30-49 find it acceptable for social media platforms to show them ads for products or services, only 39% of users aged 65+ feel the same way [image1]. This reflects broader trends where younger users are more accustomed to personalized advertising, while older users may view it as intrusive or manipulative.\n\nIn summary, user comfort with data usage is highly context-dependent, with significant variations based on the type of data use and the age group involved. Users are more accepting of data being used for event recommendations but less so for political messaging or certain forms of social connection suggestions [image1][image2].\n\n![Users across different age groups are more comfortable with social media platforms using their data to recommend events in their area, but less so for political messaging or connecting with others.](image1)"}

This creates a notable gap of **+22 percentage points** between perceived effectiveness and fairness, highlighting a substantial concern about how fairly these systems treat consumers [3]. In contrast, the **automated scoring of people up for parole** shows a much smaller gap: **49%** find it effective, while **50%** think it is fair, resulting in a difference of **-1 percentage point** [3]. This suggests that the public views this system as more equitable, even though they may not fully trust its effectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, the **automated video analysis of job interviews** is viewed as somewhat less effective than the personal finance score (39% effective vs. 54%), but it is also perceived as slightly more fair (33% fair vs. 32%) [3]. The **automated resume screening** system falls somewhere in between, with **47%** seeing it as effective and **43%** considering it fair, creating a small gap of **+4 percentage points** [3].\n\nThese differences imply that public trust in these systems is highly context-dependent. For example, while many see **criminal risk scores** as relatively fair compared to other systems, concerns about bias and fairness remain significant, especially among minority groups [3]. On the other hand, the **personal finance score** is widely regarded as effective but faces strong skepticism regarding its fairness, with **68%** of Americans finding it unacceptable [9].\n\nThis skepticism is further reinforced by broader concerns about algorithmic decision-making. A majority of Americans (58%) believe that computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias, although 40% think they can be designed without bias [6]. This perception of inherent bias likely contributes to the low acceptance rates of systems like the personal finance score and video job interview analysis, which are viewed as unfair by over **60%** of the public [9].\n\n![Automated systems' fairness and effectiveness comparison](image3)  \n![Perceived fairness across scenarios](image4)"}

This reflects a broader sentiment that transparency is expected from public figures, especially in leadership roles.\n\nIn terms of trustworthiness, the data shows a significant decline in public trust in Trump compared to previous presidents. Overall, 58% of the public says they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office, while only 26% trust him more, and 14% see no difference [10].

This is especially true when measured against specific ethical controversies. For example, while Republicans generally hold a more favorable view of Trump’s administration, only 16% rate the ethical standards as \"excellent,\" whereas Democrats and Democratic leaners are far more critical, with 67% believing the standards are \"poor\" [10]. This stark partisan divide reflects a broader pattern of distrust toward Trump’s leadership.\n\nRegarding **economic impact**, there is a clear partisan split. A significant portion of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals (79%) believe that Trump’s economic policies have improved conditions in the country, a notable increase from 63% in October 2017 [9]. In contrast, Democrats and Democratic leaners have grown increasingly negative about Trump’s economic policies, with nearly half (46%) now saying his policies have made things worse [9]. This growing polarization highlights how economic perceptions are deeply influenced by political affiliation. ![Economic policy opinions by party](image4)\n\nWhen it comes to **long-term success**, views are also highly polarized. About two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65%) believe Trump will be a successful president in the long run [3], while a majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (80%) see him as unsuccessful [5]. This contrasts sharply with earlier presidents such as George W. Bush, where in December 2003, 69% of Republicans believed he would be successful [6].

Bush during his third year in office, where 69% of Republicans thought he would be successful [10]. In contrast, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are far more critical of Trump, with 80% believing he will be an unsuccessful president [5], a stark contrast to their views on Obama, Bush, and Clinton.\n\nFor example, at comparable points in their presidencies, the share of the public who said it was too early to tell about Trump’s success was much lower than for previous presidents. At the start of Obama’s third year, nearly half (47%) of the public said it was too early to tell whether he would be successful; 38% said this about George W. Bush and 43% about Clinton [4]. For Trump, only 25% of Republicans and 16% of Democrats said it was too early to tell [2], indicating a more polarized and less uncertain public sentiment around Trump compared to earlier presidents.\n\nThis polarization is further reflected in economic perceptions. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have consistently rated economic conditions more positively since Trump’s election, with 75% rating them as excellent or good in January 2019 [7].

For example, **56% of Republicans and Republican leaners** feel confident about Trump's ability to use military force wisely, while only **8% of Democrats and Democratic leaners** do [3]. This suggests that overall, Republicans tend to have much higher confidence in Trump’s capabilities across various domains, while Democrats consistently express lower levels of confidence.\n\nIn summary, public confidence in Trump’s ability to make good appointments to the federal courts is significantly higher among Republicans than Democrats, and this trend mirrors the broader partisan divide in confidence regarding his performance on other key issues such as trade negotiations and managing the executive branch."}

While only 22% of Republicans believe the U.S. has been more effective than other countries, a larger share (34%) think it has been less effective, with 42% viewing it as about as effective [1]. In contrast, 87% of Democrats believe the U.S. response has been less effective compared to other affluent nations [1].

Democrats and Democratic leaners overwhelmingly rate public health officials like those at the CDC positively, with 72% giving them excellent or good ratings [4]. However, Republicans and Republican leaners are far less favorable, with only 53% offering positive assessments—a drop of 31 percentage points from late March [4]. This shift underscores how partisan affiliation shapes confidence in key figures responsible for managing the crisis.\n\n![Republicans and Republicans-leaning individuals have lower confidence in public health officials compared to Democrats and Democrats-leaning individuals](image2)\n\nTrust in local and state officials similarly follows partisan lines. Democrats and Democratic leaners express greater confidence in their local and state elected officials compared to Republicans and Republican leaners [9].

For example, while Republicans in less hard-hit areas are slightly less likely than those in more affected regions to attribute case increases to growing infections rather than increased testing, these differences are minimal compared to the broader partisan divide [8]. Democrats, regardless of location, are more likely to see rising infections as the main cause of increased cases [3].\n\n![Partisan differences in perceptions of the causes of rising coronavirus cases are more significant than geographic differences](image3)\n\nIn summary, partisan divides strongly influence both the evaluation of the U.S. response to the pandemic and the level of trust in institutions involved in managing it.

Initially, in late March, 84% of Republicans gave positive ratings to public health officials, but this figure dropped by 31 points to 53% by August [10]. In contrast, Democrats’ views remained relatively stable, with approval ratings moving only slightly from 74% to 72% during the same period [10]. This trend is further supported by data showing that 72% of Democrats currently rate public health officials positively, while only 53% of Republicans do so, highlighting a growing partisan divide [5].\n\nThe decline in Republican approval of public health officials is especially notable when compared to their consistently high approval of local hospitals and medical centers. While hospital approval ratings have remained largely unchanged since May, with 88% of respondents saying they are doing an excellent or good job, the same cannot be said for public health officials [6]. This contrast underscores the varying levels of trust across different institutions, with hospitals enjoying broader bipartisan support than public health agencies [4].\n\nDonald Trump’s approval ratings also reflect a stark partisan divide. By August, only 6% of Democrats rated his response to the coronavirus as positive, a significant increase from 18% in March [9]. Conversely, Republican approval of Trump remained relatively stable, dropping slightly from 83% to 73% over the same period [3]. The overall approval rating for Trump fell sharply from 48% to 37%, reflecting a general decline in public confidence in his leadership during the pandemic [image4].\n\n![Partisan differences in approval ratings of public health officials and Trump](image3)\n\nThese findings suggest that partisan affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping public perception of how effectively leaders and institutions have responded to the pandemic.

While only 54% of White Democrats favor this requirement, larger shares of Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian Democrats (71%) support it [6]. However, when looking at the broader public, a majority (76%) of all adults support this policy [10], indicating that while there are racial differences in support, the overall public leans toward favoring it.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a stark contrast between the two major parties. Republicans are considerably more likely than Democrats to strongly favor photo identification requirements, with 81% of Republicans strongly supporting it compared to just 30% of Democrats [9]. This divergence underscores how political affiliation plays a critical role in shaping attitudes toward such policies.\n\nRegarding voting accessibility, the data consistently shows that Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults are more supportive of policies that make voting easier, such as automatic voter registration and making Election Day a national holiday, compared to White adults [4]. This is further supported by image1, which displays varying levels of support across racial groups, with higher percentages for Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults [image1].\n\nSimilarly, image5 illustrates a clear divide in opinions about early and absentee voting, with significant differences based on race and political affiliation. For example, while 84% of Democrat/Lean Democrat voters support open early or absentee voting, only 38% of Republican/Lean Republican voters do so [image5].\n\nIn summary, racial and political affiliations shape perspectives on both photo ID requirements and voting accessibility policies, with Democrats generally favoring more accessible voting options and Republicans leaning toward stricter identification requirements. These differences are evident across racial groups as well, with Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals often showing greater support for policies that expand voting access."}

Regarding the redistricting proposal, nearly half of U.S. adults approve of a plan that would require states to establish redistricting commissions with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, while only 13% disapprove and 38% are unsure [8]. This suggests broad public support for the idea, though there may be partisan differences not explicitly detailed in the data.\n\nWhen it comes to early and absentee voting, views are deeply divided along partisan lines. For instance, only 38% of Republicans support allowing all voters to vote early or absentee without a documented reason, whereas 84% of Democrats and Democratic leaners support this policy [7]. Similarly, White Republicans are less supportive of no-excuse early voting than Hispanic Republicans, while White Democrats are more supportive than Democrats of other races and ethnicities [2].\n\nAmong Republicans who voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election, about half (52%) favor no-excuse absentee or early voting, compared to just 35% of early, in-person GOP voters and 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day [10]. This highlights a strong correlation between personal voting experience and support for expanding voting access.\n\nMoreover, those who have recent experience with early or absentee voting are more likely to favor no-excuse early and absentee voting for all voters, especially among Republicans and Republican leaners [4]. This is further reinforced by the fact that GOP voters who voted early or absentee in November are more likely than others to support no-excuse voting [5].\n\nDemographically, there are also notable differences. For example, Black voters show the highest support for open early or absentee voting at 81%, while White voters stand at 59% [image1]. In contrast, Republican/Lean Republican voters are the most likely to believe that documentation should be required, with 62% supporting this view, compared to just 16% of Democrat/Lean Democrat voters [image1].\n\n![Public opinion on early and absentee voting](image1)  \n![Approval ratings for redistricting proposal](image2)"}

This increase is primarily driven by Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, whose support for this policy rose from 71% in 2018 to 78% in 2021 [2]. In contrast, Republican and Republican-leaning independent support remained relatively stable at around 59% during the same period [2].

However, their future party affiliation remains uncertain, as a significant portion of Latino voters fall into groups with soft ties to political parties, indicating potential for change in the coming years [3].\n\nIn terms of important election issues, the economy has consistently been the top concern for Latino voters, with 80% considering it very important in March 2022 and remaining unchanged at that level by August [10]. However, abortion has seen a marked increase in importance, rising from 42% in March to 57% in August 2022, likely influenced by the Supreme Court’s decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion [8]. This trend is not unique to Latino voters, as abortion has also risen in importance among all U.S. registered voters.\n\nDemographic factors play a crucial role in shaping preferences. For instance, Latino voters who strongly identify with their Hispanic heritage (60%) are more likely to support Democratic candidates, while those who place less importance on their identity are more evenly split between Democratic and Republican candidates [7]. Additionally, political affiliation significantly influences voting behavior: Democratic-leaning voters overwhelmingly favor Democrats (81%), whereas Republican-leaning voters predominantly support Republicans (76%) [4].\n\n![Latino registered voters’ preferences for Democratic or Republican candidates](image4)  \nThis chart illustrates how different demographic groups, including Latino registered voters, political leanings, religious affiliations, and the importance of Latino identity, influence voting preferences.

Textual evidence highlights these differences, while images provide visual representations of the data.\n\nAmong Hispanics, there is a clear divide in views on socialism based on political affiliation. Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners tend to have more negative impressions of socialism compared to their Democratic counterparts. For instance, 60% of Latinos ages 50 to 64 and 61% of those 65 and older report a negative impression of socialism [5]. This aligns with the image showing that Republicans/Lean Republicans have a higher percentage of \"Very/Somewhat bad\" responses (44%) compared to Democrats/Lean Democrats (19%) and All Hispanics (25%) [image4].\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to capitalism, Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners have a more positive view than Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners. Specifically, 68% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners have a positive view of capitalism, compared to 50% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners [1]. This is further supported by the bar chart in image3, which shows that Republicans/Lean Republicans have a net positive attitude of 68, whereas Democrats/Lean Democrats have a net positive of 50.\n\nAge also plays a role in shaping perceptions of socialism. Younger Hispanics, particularly those aged 18 to 29, are more evenly divided in their views of socialism, with 46% reporting a positive impression [5]. However, as age increases, so does the likelihood of holding a negative view. For example, 60% of Latinos aged 50 to 64 and 61% of those 65 and older report a negative impression of socialism [5]. This pattern is visually represented in image2, where older age groups show a greater proportion of individuals who believe other countries are better than the U.S., which may correlate with more critical views of systems like socialism.\n\nRegarding capitalism, the data suggests that across all age groups, the majority of Hispanics hold a positive view. For instance, 54% of all Hispanics have a positive impression of capitalism [2], and this sentiment is reflected in image3, where \"All Hispanics\" have a net positive score of 54. However, the intensity of this positivity varies by age group, with younger Hispanics showing a slightly less positive stance compared to older generations [image2].\n\nIn summary, Hispanic perceptions of socialism and capitalism differ by political affiliation and age, with Republicans generally having more negative views of socialism and more positive views of capitalism compared to Democrats, and younger Hispanics being more divided on socialism while older Hispanics tend to be more critical of it. ![Hispanic opinions on socialism and capitalism by political affiliation](image3) ![Hispanic opinions on socialism and capitalism by age group](image2)"}

However, this party identification has shifted little over the past few years [2], suggesting that while opinions about party differences may be consistent, actual affiliations remain largely unchanged.\n\nAdditionally, a line graph comparing percentages related to the Democratic and Republican parties from 2019 to 2022 shows minimal fluctuation in support levels, indicating a general stability in how Latino voters perceive these parties over time [2].\n\n![Percentage trends of the Democratic and Republican parties from 2019 to 2022](image2)\n\nWhile perceptions of party differences remain stable, the future party affiliation of Latino voters remains uncertain due to soft ties to political parties. A 2021 Pew Research Center study found that substantial shares of Latino voters fall into groups with flexible party allegiances, which could influence their voting behavior in upcoming elections [10].\n\nThese findings suggest that although Latino voters may perceive some differences between the two major parties, their overall party preferences have not changed significantly in recent years. This stability in party affiliation, despite perceived ideological differences, may affect how Latino voters engage with the political process, particularly as they consider key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and education in their decision-making [3]."}

This aligns with broader findings that the public generally holds a positive view of STEM jobs in terms of compensation and attracting bright young people, though opinions on meaningful contributions and helping others are more divided [4].\n\nWhen examining how men and women in STEM value different job characteristics, there are notable differences. Both genders prioritize flexibility to balance work and family obligations, with 71% of men and 76% of women valuing this [image1]. However, men place greater emphasis on opportunities for promotion (57%) and high-paying jobs (59%), whereas women are more inclined to value jobs that are respected and valued by society (50%) and those that make a meaningful contribution to society (60%) [image1]. Additionally, women are significantly more likely than men to consider a job focused on helping others important, with 59% of women valuing this compared to just 31% of men [image1].\n\nThese differences reflect broader societal trends, including perceptions of gender disparities in STEM fields. For instance, women in STEM are more likely to report facing challenges related to workplace equity, particularly in majority-male environments like computer science [7]. Furthermore, while women are increasingly represented in certain STEM fields such as health-related professions, they remain underrepresented in areas like computer science and engineering [image2]. \n\nIn summary, while both men and women in STEM value similar characteristics like job flexibility, men tend to prioritize financial rewards and advancement opportunities, whereas women emphasize respect, meaningful contributions, and helping others. ![Men and women in STEM have differing priorities in job characteristics](image1)"}

Furthermore, about three-in-ten STEM workers (29%) have earned a master’s, doctorate, or professional degree, which is significantly higher than the share of non-STEM workers with advanced degrees (12%) [7]. This suggests that STEM workers are more likely to pursue higher education, which may be linked to the nature of their work and the skills required in these fields.\n\nIn terms of employment sectors, most STEM workers are employed in the private, for-profit sector, with 66% working in this environment [8]. This is similar to the overall share of all employed adults. However, certain STEM fields, such as engineering and computer-related jobs, are even more likely to be in the private, for-profit sector (82% and 77%, respectively) [8]. In contrast, healthcare practitioners and technicians are less likely to be in the private sector, with only 58% working there, and a significant portion (23%) working for not-for-profit employers [8].\n\nThis pattern of employment can also be seen in the distribution of education levels among different sectors. For example, STEM workers who hold an associate degree or some college education are more likely to use the skills from their education in their current job compared to non-STEM workers [4]. Additionally, STEM middle-skills workers are more likely to have additional educational training directly related to their job, such as vocational or technical training, certificates, or apprenticeships [9].\n\n![STEM workers are more likely to have higher education levels and work in the private, for-profit sector compared to non-STEM workers.](image2)\n\nThe relationship between education and employment sectors becomes even clearer when comparing the data visually.

For instance, among foreign-born Hispanics, only 65% consider themselves a typical American, while this number rises to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics [7]. This trend reflects a growing sense of identification with the U.S. over time, as individuals become more integrated into American society.\n\nAnother important factor is cultural connection, including language and heritage. While many associate Hispanic identity with speaking Spanish or having a Spanish last name, a significant portion of self-identified Hispanics do not view these as essential to their identity. In fact, 84% of self-identified Hispanics say it is not necessary to speak Spanish to be considered Latino [4], and 84% do not have a Spanish last name [5].

Among those who do not identify as Hispanic despite having Hispanic ancestry, 27% cite mixed backgrounds or distant Hispanic ancestry as the reason [10]. Others point to limited contact with Hispanic relatives (16%) or a lack of cultural links (15%) as reasons for not identifying as Hispanic [10].

Among foreign-born Hispanics, 78% identify as Hispanic or Latino [image5], while only 46% of third or higher generation Hispanics do so. This shift is accompanied by an increase in identifying as White, with 25% of third or higher generation Hispanics identifying as White compared to just 11% of foreign-born Hispanics [image5]. This suggests that racial identity becomes more aligned with the broader U.S. population as generations progress.\n\nIn terms of how Hispanic heritage impacts their lives, second-generation Hispanics report the highest level of perceived advantage, with 52% stating that their Hispanic background has been an advantage [2]. This contrasts sharply with only 24% of third or higher generation Hispanics who feel the same way [image2]. Additionally, the sense of connection to Hispanic heritage also diminishes with each generation, with only 44% of third or higher generation Hispanics feeling connected, compared to 82% of foreign-born Hispanics [image1].\n\nMoreover, the frequency with which individuals identify as Hispanic also declines across generations.

For instance, **42% of self-identified Latino immigrants** report having experienced discrimination often or sometimes because of their Latino background [6], while this figure drops to **38% for second-generation Latinos** and **29% for third or higher generation Latinos** [6]. This suggests that as generations progress, the frequency of reported discrimination decreases, even though it remains a notable issue for many.\n\nIn terms of racial identification, the generational divide is also evident. Among **self-identified Hispanics**, **69% identify as Hispanic or Latino**, but this percentage declines with each successive generation. For example, **foreign-born Hispanics** are more likely to identify as Hispanic or Latino (78%) compared to **third or higher generation Hispanics**, who only identify as such 46% of the time [4]. Instead, these later generations are more likely to identify as white (25%) or other (20%) [4]. In contrast, **self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry** are much less likely to identify as Hispanic or Latino (7%), and instead predominantly identify as white (59%) [4].\n\nThis shift in racial identification may be linked to a broader sense of cultural assimilation, which is reflected in how connected individuals feel to their Hispanic heritage. The data from image1 shows that **foreign-born Hispanics feel most connected to their heritage (82%)**, whereas **only 44% of third or higher generation Hispanics feel connected** [image1]. This decline in connection could contribute to a decreased emphasis on Hispanic identity over time.\n\nFurthermore, perceptions of whether being Hispanic has been an advantage, made no difference, or been a disadvantage also vary by generation. While **second-generation Hispanics** are more likely to see being Hispanic as an advantage (52%) compared to **foreign-born Hispanics (28%)** or **third or higher generation Hispanics (24%)**, the majority across all groups still perceive it as making no difference [image2].\n\n![Hispanic generations show varying levels of connection to their heritage](image1)  \n![Perceptions of being Hispanic differ by generation, with second-generation Hispanics more likely to see it as an advantage](image2)  \n\nIn conclusion, generational differences significantly influence both the perception of discrimination and racial identification among Hispanics in the U.S., with earlier generations experiencing more discrimination and identifying more strongly as Hispanic, while later generations tend to identify more with other racial categories and perceive being Hispanic as less impactful."}

As generations progress, there is a noticeable shift from identifying more closely with their country of origin to identifying more strongly as American. Among immigrants, 82% feel very or somewhat connected to their country of origin [1], while this connection weakens significantly by the third generation, with only 44% feeling similarly connected [1]. This decline in connection to ancestral origins is mirrored by an increase in identifying as American. For instance, only 7% of immigrants most often describe themselves as \"American,\" but this figure rises to 56% among third-generation Hispanics [3].\n\nThis generational trend is also reflected in how Hispanics view their identity in relation to other Americans. While 50% of U.S. Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, and 44% feel they are very different, the perception varies greatly across generations. Only 36% of immigrants see themselves as typical Americans, compared to 73% of third or higher generation Hispanics [5]. This aligns with the idea that being born and raised in the U.S., especially to U.S.-born parents, strengthens national identity [3].\n\nIn terms of language use, the data shows a clear generational divide. Among immigrants, 61% are Spanish dominant, meaning they are more proficient in Spanish than in English [10]. However, by the second generation, this number drops to just 6%, and it is essentially nonexistent in the third generation [10]. This shift is further supported by the fact that 71% of self-identified Hispanics do not speak Spanish, with the percentage increasing dramatically with each subsequent generation: 58% among immigrants, 84% among second-generation Hispanics, and 92% among third or higher generation Hispanics [4].\n\nAdditionally, the importance of Spanish last names and fluency in Spanish as markers of Hispanic identity diminishes with each generation. A majority of Hispanics across all generations believe that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino [8], and even fewer associate having a Spanish last name with being Hispanic [7]. This reflects a broader cultural assimilation process where linguistic and surname ties to heritage become less central over time.\n\n![Shift in self-identification from country of origin to American](image3)  \n![Decline in Spanish dominance across generations](image1)  \n![Decrease in Spanish fluency and Spanish last names across generations](image4)\n\nThese trends collectively illustrate how generational differences significantly impact both self-identification preferences and language use among Hispanics, with later generations increasingly identifying as American and showing reduced proficiency in and reliance on Spanish."}

This divergence is echoed in another text that notes a growing number of Arab youth are adopting modern values, even as family, friends, and religion continue to shape their outlooks [8]. Additionally, it is noted that an overwhelming majority of young Arabs believe they are entitled to subsidized energy costs, while concern about climate change remains low across the region [6].\n\nVisual data from image1, which shows a stacked bar chart from 2011 to 2014, indicates a trend where one segment (red) decreases over time while the other (orange) increases. This could represent a shift from traditional to modern values, assuming the red segment symbolizes traditional values and the orange segment represents modern ones. The declining red segment suggests a gradual move away from traditional values over the years.\n\nImage2, a horizontal bar chart comparing the influence of various groups on people in 2013 and 2014, reveals that while family, parents, and religion remained influential, their impact slightly decreased between the two years. This may indicate a broader societal shift, where younger generations might be more influenced by modern media or peer groups rather than solely by traditional institutions like religion or family. However, these groups still hold significant sway, suggesting that traditional values have not been entirely replaced but are evolving in influence.\n\nImage3, which compares different countries and regions with split segments, likely reflects how views on traditional versus modern values vary by country. While the specific metric is unclear without context, the segmentation into orange and red could imply regional differences in the adoption of modern values, with some areas showing stronger alignment with traditional values than others.\n\nIn summary, the views on traditional versus modern values are evolving, with a noticeable trend toward modern values among younger populations, especially in Arab regions. However, traditional values remain influential, particularly through family and religious structures. These views also vary significantly by country, as illustrated by the regional comparisons in the data.\n\n![A stacked bar chart showing a decline in the red segment and an increase in the orange segment from 2011 to 2014](image1)  \n![A horizontal bar chart displaying the influence of various groups on people in 2013 and 2014, with a general decline in influence over time](image2)  \n![A bar chart comparing different countries and regions with split segments, likely reflecting variations in traditional versus modern value adoption](image3)\n\nViews on traditional values versus modern values have evolved over time, with a noticeable shift toward modern values, particularly among younger generations, while traditional values remain influential, especially through family and religion, and these views vary significantly by country."}

This growth is further supported by text quote [10], which notes that 75% of millennials expect to live in places where they do not need a car, suggesting a shift toward public transit use among younger demographics. Additionally, quote [4] emphasizes the need to \"double Cal train ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade,\" underscoring the growing demand for train services.\n\nHowever, this surge in ridership has led to significant capacity challenges, as illustrated by image1, which depicts a crowded train or bus with passengers standing in the aisle due to limited seating. This image captures the reality of current train conditions, where increased ridership results in overcrowding and discomfort for passengers. Furthermore, text quote [2] and [3], both stating \"Trains are crowded,\" reinforce the idea that the existing infrastructure is struggling to accommodate the rising number of passengers.\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that many of these passengers are young, as noted in text quote [10], which states that 55% of Cal train riders are under 35. This demographic is more likely to be part of the millennial generation, who prioritize living in walkable, transit-oriented communities. As a result, the demand for train services continues to grow, but the current capacity—both in terms of seating and frequency of service—remains insufficient to meet this demand, leading to overcrowded trains and potential delays or inefficiencies in service.\n\n![Crowded train with standing passengers](image1)  \n![Map of San Francisco Bay Area showing regions like Mountain View and Palo Alto](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the rapid population and economic growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto has significantly contributed to the rise in weekday ridership, which now exceeds the current capacity of trains, resulting in overcrowding and operational strain on the transit system."}

Textual evidence highlights that European venture capital has experienced a surge in activity, with more checks being written to limited partners (LPs) than ever before [4]. This increased flow of capital has contributed to a higher capital efficiency in Europe compared to the US, with roughly 70% higher efficiency due to the scarcity of VC money, which allows investors to be more selective [7].\n\nIn terms of liquidity events, image4 provides a direct reference to the scale of venture-backed liquidity events in the last 24 months, noting that they amounted to **$15 Billion***. This figure underscores the significant liquidity generated by venture-backed companies in recent years.\n\nWhen comparing venture capital investments and exits, image1 offers a comprehensive visual comparison between the USA and Europe since 2004. It shows that while the USA leads in total capital invested (82%), number of exits over $100 million (78%), and number of home runs (64%), Europe holds a notable share in these metrics, with 18%, 22%, and 36% respectively. Additionally, Europe accounts for 41% of total exits compared to the USA’s 59%. This suggests that although the USA dominates in volume, Europe is not far behind and has demonstrated strong performance in exit multiples [10].\n\nImage3 further supports this by showing that Europe's median multiple of cash invested is **7.2**, significantly higher than the USA’s **4.5**. This indicates that European venture capital investments are generating better returns on average, even though the median exit valuation in the USA is higher at $236 million versus Europe’s $173 million. Despite this, Europe outperforms the USA in the percentage of investments achieving a multiple of 5 or more (57.26% vs. 47.27%) [3].\n\nRegionally within Europe, image2 illustrates the disparity between investment and exit values in different countries. Germany, for example, saw $0.8 billion in venture investments but achieved $4.4 billion in venture exits, indicating a strong return on investment. The UK and France also show similar patterns, where exit values exceed investment amounts, suggesting robust performance across the continent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the USA still leads in the total volume of venture capital investments and exits, Europe has demonstrated superior capital efficiency and higher exit multiples over the last 24 months, as evidenced by the data from both textual and visual sources. ![Venture-backed liquidity events in the last 24 months: $15 Billion*](image4)"}

From the text quotes, it's clear that there are significant entrepreneurial opportunities in increasing logistics efficiency, analytics, and retention [1], which are all influenced by the types of products being sold and their respective margins.\n\nLooking at the data from the pie charts, we see that different categories contribute differently to both gross margin and transaction volume. For instance, **Mobile, Tablets & Accessories** account for 35% of gross margin [image1], while in terms of transaction volume, they make up only 9% [image3]. This suggests that although this category may not have the highest transaction volume, it contributes significantly to overall profitability.\n\nOn the other hand, **Fashion, Footwear & Accessories** dominate the transaction volume with 35% [image3], but their contribution to gross margin is 28% [image1]. This indicates that while this category drives a large number of transactions, its margin contribution is slightly lower compared to Mobile, Tablets & Accessories.\n\nThis disparity has important implications for the e-commerce supply and demand model.

Within households, a significant portion of the population owns devices such as radios, televisions, computers, and mobile phones. According to one survey, **45% of households have radios**, **49% have televisions**, **86% have mobile phones**, and only **10% own computers** [2]. This highlights that mobile phones are the most common device found in households, followed by radios and televisions.\n\nIn contrast, when looking at technology usage **outside the household**, the data reveals a stark difference. An infographic shows that **68% of respondents do not use any of these technologies outside of home**, while **20% use a mobile phone**, **11% use television**, and only **4% use a computer or internet** [image1]. This suggests that while mobile phones are widely owned, their usage outside the home is more prevalent than other technologies, which may indicate that people rely on their mobile devices for connectivity beyond the home environment.\n\nThis pattern of technology usage is closely tied to **radio listening habits**, especially across different demographics. For instance, the majority of people who listen to the radio do so via a radio set rather than through a mobile phone. Overall, **76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set**, and **40% use a mobile phone** [image3]. However, this varies by location and gender. In rural areas, **77% use a radio**, whereas in urban areas, **70% use a mobile phone** for radio listening. Similarly, **males are more likely to use a mobile phone (43%) compared to females (36%)**, even though both groups predominantly use a radio set [image3].\n\nMoreover, the frequency of radio listening also differs by demographic group. **46% of respondents never listened to the radio in the past six months**, with **females being more likely to fall into this category (55.7%)** compared to males (37.1%) [image4]. Urban and rural residents show similar patterns in terms of daily listening, but rural areas have slightly higher rates of weekly listening compared to urban areas.\n\n![Radio listening via radio set and mobile phone](image3)  \n![Frequency of radio listening by gender and location](image4)\n\nIn summary, while technology ownership within the household is relatively high, especially for mobile phones and radios, usage outside the home is limited, with mobile phones being the primary tool for accessing information beyond the home. These patterns influence radio listening habits, with radios still being the dominant medium for listening, although mobile phones are increasingly used, particularly in urban areas and among males."}

For instance, mobile devices influence customer decisions in 55% of cases, surpassing TV and desktop [7]. Moreover, e-commerce traffic from smartphones and tablets is growing rapidly, with Indonesian sites like Tokopedia and OLX reporting substantial growth in mobile sales [9].\n\nAdditionally, payment service providers (PSPs) like Coda Payments, Mimopay, and Mandiri e-cash are emerging as key players in enabling digital transactions, especially in prepaid markets and for bankless users [image1]. These services support the rise of mobile commerce and online shopping, where apparel remains the most purchased item both offline and online [image5].\n\n![Mobile Internet Activities and Content Preferences](image2)\n![Demographics of Mobile Internet Users](image3)\n![Payment Service Providers in Indonesia](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia—characterized by a young, tech-savvy population with high engagement in social media and mobile content—create fertile ground for businesses focusing on mobile-first strategies, including e-commerce, advertising, and digital payments."}

According to a detailed breakdown of their performance [9], Telkomsel is the largest operator by far, followed by XL and then Indosat. This trend is further supported by a bar chart that compares these three companies' metrics [image3], which provides a clear visual representation of their subscriber and data user figures.\n\nTelkomsel leads in both total subscribers and data users, with 139.3 million subscribers and 63.5 million data users. XL follows with 58.3 million subscribers and 32 million data users, while Indosat has 54.2 million subscribers and 29 million data users. These figures indicate that Telkomsel maintains a dominant position in the market, not only in terms of total users but also in data usage, which is increasingly important as mobile internet becomes more prevalent.\n\nAdditionally, the market share distribution among telecom operators highlights Telkomsel's leadership, with a 42% market share compared to XL + AXIS at 18% and Indosat at 16.7% [image4]. This reinforces the idea that Telkomsel is the most dominant player in the Indonesian telecommunications sector.\n\n![Telkomsel leads in subscribers and data users](image3)  \n![Market share distribution among telecom operators](image4)  \n\nIn conclusion, Telkomsel significantly outperforms XL and Indosat in both subscriber numbers and data users, maintaining its position as the leading telecommunications provider in Indonesia."}

While the exact figures for Telkomsel's ARPU during this period are not explicitly provided in the text quotes, we can infer changes based on broader industry trends and supporting data.\n\nThe subscriber base of Telkomsel remained robust, as indicated by image4, which shows that in 2014, Telkomsel had **139.3 million subscribers**. This figure reflects a large and stable user base, though it does not specify whether there was growth or decline from 2013 to 2014. However, other sources suggest that the overall market was experiencing a shift toward mobile data usage and smartphones [1].\n\nRegarding ARPU, the general trend across the industry was a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, with Mobile Data ARPU initially dropping but later recovering due to increased data consumption [7]. This is further supported by image1, which illustrates the declining trend in Voice and SMS ARPU from 2013 to 2017, while Mobile Data ARPU initially declined before rising again. It is reasonable to infer that Telkomsel followed a similar pattern, as the broader industry context suggests a move away from traditional voice and SMS services toward data-centric models.\n\nMoreover, the increased adoption of smartphones among Telkomsel users, as seen in image4 (35.4 million smartphone users in 2014), likely contributed to these changes. The rise in smartphone penetration would have driven higher data usage, which may have offset some of the losses in voice and SMS revenue, even as ARPU for those services continued to decline [9].\n\n![Telkomsel has 139.3 million subscribers in 2014](image4)  \n![ARPU trends for Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data show declining Voice and SMS ARPU, with Mobile Data ARPU initially falling before increasing](image1)\n\nIn summary, while Telkomsel maintained a large subscriber base, its ARPU likely decreased due to the declining value of voice and SMS services, which were increasingly replaced by data usage driven by the growing smartphone user base."}

These changes were influenced by a combination of market dynamics, consumer behavior shifts, and strategic initiatives by the telecom companies.\n\nFirst, let’s examine the **number of smartphone users**. According to image3, as of 2014, Telkomsel had **35.4 million smartphone users**, while XL had **15 million smartphone users**. This indicates that Telkomsel had a much larger base of smartphone users compared to XL during this time. The growth in smartphone adoption was driven by the increasing popularity of Android devices, as highlighted by text quote [7], which notes that Telkomsel partnered with Samsung to boost smartphone penetration. Additionally, text quote [1] mentions that Android users outnumbered BlackBerry users for Telkomsel, reflecting a broader industry shift toward Android-based smartphones.\n\nNow, turning to **ARPU trends**, we can refer to image2, which shows the evolution of Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data ARPU from 2013 to 2017. While the specific values are not visible, the trend lines indicate that **Voice and SMS ARPU declined over the period**, whereas **Mobile Data ARPU initially dropped but began to recover by 2017**. This aligns with text quote [2], which states that data ARPU would fall in the short term but eventually rise as data consumption increased. Similarly, text quote [4] explains that the use of data-based services like VoIP and instant messaging led to reduced reliance on traditional SMS and voice calls, contributing to the decline in ARPUs for these services.\n\nFor Telkomsel and XL specifically, image5 provides a historical perspective on prepaid ARPU from 2008 to 2012. However, since the question focuses on 2013–2014, we can infer that the declining ARPU trend observed in earlier years likely continued into this period. Text quote [9] mentions that initial reductions in ARPU were due to a price war initiated by the government, and text quote [10] suggests that tariffs had hit rock bottom by 2014, eliminating further price competition. This implies that both Telkomsel and XL were operating in a highly competitive environment where reducing prices became a necessity to retain customers, especially as more users shifted to smartphones and data-heavy services.\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, **Telkomsel and XL saw an increase in smartphone users**, particularly Android users, while **ARPU for traditional services like voice and SMS declined**. This was largely influenced by the growing adoption of smartphones, the rise of data-based communication tools, and the saturation of price competition in the market.\n\n![Telkomsel had 35.4 million smartphone users and XL had 15 million in 2014](image3)  \n![Voice and SMS ARPU declined, while Mobile Data ARPU initially dropped but later recovered](image2)"}

The **Tree Traversal Algorithm** involves a layer-by-layer traversal, where at each level, nodes are scored based on their similarity to the query and the top-k nodes are selected iteratively until reaching the leaf nodes [1]. This method ensures a progressive focus from broader thematic information to finer details [4].\n\nOn the other hand, the **Collapsed Tree Algorithm** flattens the tree into a single layer and selects nodes based on their relevance to the query while adhering to a token limit [5]. This approach offers greater flexibility by allowing simultaneous search across all layers of the tree [10].\n\nLooking at the image descriptions, **image2** provides a detailed pseudocode listing for the **Tree Traversal Algorithm**, which includes multiple steps such as function definition, initialization, loops over layers, scoring of nodes, selection of top-k nodes, and returning the union of selected nodes [image2].

This is supported by the fact that the dataset includes **22 distinct categories** such as landmark, painting, sculpture, food, and more, each containing a wide range of fine-grained entities [3]. For example, the dataset includes 7,568 unique entities, with 10 representative images per entity and 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs for each entity [6]. \n\n![22 categories with a total of 7,568 entities](image1)\n\nIn contrast, other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA have fewer categories and less granularity in their entity categorization.

When only the gold chain documents are used, BiDAF's performance jumps to 86.4% and 89.8%, while FastQA improves to 54.6% and 59.2% [9].

This is notably higher than other metrics like BEER (0.848), BLEU (0.864), or chrF (0.864). Additionally, the **EED** metric also performs well with a correlation of **0.851**, but it still falls short of ESIM’s performance.\n\nThe heatmap shown in image4 further supports this finding by visually representing the significance of these correlations across different metrics for the fr-de language pair.

This is evident from various ablation studies and experiments detailed in the provided text and image quotes.\n\nPositional encodings are crucial for providing spatial information to the transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms that are otherwise agnostic to position. In particular, the results from Table 3 [1] show that not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, highlighting their importance. However, passing them only in the decoder leads to a minor AP drop, suggesting that while encoder-level positional encodings contribute more significantly, the decoder still benefits from their inclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison of different positional encoding types—such as fixed sine encodings versus learned embeddings—reveals that learned spatial encodings yield similar results to fixed sine encodings when passed through attention layers. Interestingly, removing spatial positional encodings entirely but retaining output positional encodings still allows the model to achieve over 32 AP, though with a notable 7.8 AP loss compared to the baseline [7].\n\nThe impact of loss components can also be seen in the analysis of different combinations of `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` losses. For instance, the combination of `class` and `GIoU` yields an AP of 39.9, which is higher than the 35.8 achieved by `class` and `ℓ₁`. When all three are combined, the AP improves further to 40.6, indicating that incorporating multiple loss terms enhances performance [image3].\n\nMoreover, the role of decoder layers in refining predictions is highlighted in Figure 4 [9], where each layer contributes progressively to improving AP and AP₅₀ scores. The first decoder layer sees the most improvement, but subsequent layers continue to refine predictions, reducing the need for post-processing like NMS. This suggests that the depth of the decoder plays a vital role in achieving high AP scores.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice of positional encoding configuration and the inclusion of diverse loss components directly affect the AP in the DETR-DC5 model, with optimal performance achieved by combining learned positional encodings and multi-component loss functions."}

For instance, in the 2-hop scenario, both models show increasing F1 scores with larger models, but PROGRAM FC maintains a slight edge, achieving a score of 77.62 at the 11B parameter size compared to FLAN-T5's 77.07 [8]. This trend continues for the 3-hop and 4-hop scenarios, where PROGRAM FC achieves higher peak F1 scores than FLAN-T5. Specifically, in the 4-hop scenario, PROGRAM FC reaches an F1 score of 68.18 at the 11B size, while FLAN-T5 only reaches 63.39 [8].\n\nIn addition to superior F1 scores, ProgramFC also excels in retrieval recall compared to one-step retrieval methods. As shown in image2, ProgramFC significantly outperforms one-step retrieval on various tasks, including HOVER (2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop) and FEVEROUS-S. For example, on HOVER 4-hop, ProgramFC achieves a retrieval recall of 49.93, whereas one-step retrieval only manages 36.43 [6]. This improvement is attributed to the iterative retrieval process guided by reasoning programs, which allows for more accurate evidence gathering as information may be revealed during the reasoning process [6].\n\nOverall, ProgramFC not only surpasses FLAN-T5 in F1 scores across varying model sizes and task complexities but also enhances retrieval recall when compared to traditional one-step retrieval approaches.\n\n![ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5 in F1 scores across different model sizes and task complexities](image3)\n![ProgramFC shows higher retrieval recall compared to one-step retrieval on multiple datasets](image2)"}

Specifically, for 4-hop scenarios, semantic errors account for 77% of the errors, with structural errors being particularly prevalent at 57% [8]. This suggests that generating appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for complex, long-chain reasoning remains a significant challenge [6].\n\nMoreover, while ProgramFC's use of reasoning programs improves interpretability and debugging capabilities, it incurs a higher computational cost due to the need for program generation and multiple sub-task model calls, resulting in approximately 4–5 times more computational time than end-to-end models [3].\n\n![ProgramFC's error distribution across different hop complexities](image1)  \n![Example of a predicted reasoning program for a specific claim](image2)  \n![Comparison of F1 scores between ProgramFC and FLAN-T5 across different model sizes and hop complexities](image3)  \n![Retrieval recall comparison between ProgramFC and one-step retrieval methods](image4)\n\nIn summary, ProgramFC performs better than other models like FLAN-T5 in fact-checking tasks, especially for complex claims, but it faces challenges related to error generation, particularly with increasing claim complexity."}

Specifically, **semantic errors** increase significantly with more reasoning steps: they account for **29%** in 2-hop, **38%** in 3-hop, and **77%** in 4-hop scenarios [6]. Structural errors also rise sharply, from **19%** in 2-hop to **57%** in 4-hop [6]. These findings highlight the growing difficulty of generating accurate reasoning programs for complex, multi-step claims.\n\nThis aligns with the results presented in **image3**, which visually breaks down the error distribution across different hop counts.

For instance, on medical imaging datasets like PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST, the hard-to-contrast strategy achieves significantly higher AUC scores when only a small portion of the dataset (e.g., 0.1%) is queried [3]. Specifically, it outperforms random selection by up to 5.2% on BloodMNIST and by over 20% on CIFAR-10-LT when querying larger portions of the dataset (20% and 30%) [3].\n\nThis performance advantage is also reflected in the correlation between initial query performance (AUC₂₀) and subsequent cycles (AUC₅₀), where the hard-to-contrast strategy maintains a strong positive correlation with high statistical significance [1]. In contrast, some other strategies exhibit weaker correlations or less consistent improvements across learning cycles [9].\n\nRegarding the influence on initial query selection, the hard-to-contrast strategy is particularly effective in overcoming the cold start problem in active learning. It allows for selecting informative data without requiring ground truths, which makes it more practical for real-world applications [3]. Moreover, integrating this strategy with $K$-means clustering enhances label coverage, ensuring that even in low-budget scenarios (≤0.002% of the full dataset), all classes are represented [5].

This suggests that a significant portion of the verification process involves direct data retrieval rather than complex computations.\n\nNext, **comparison** functions are used in **19.5%** of cases, where two numbers are compared. This type of reasoning is relatively straightforward but still requires attention to detail. Other notable functions include **closed-domain knowledge** (12.1%), which involves extracting information from context sentences within the table or article, and **open-domain knowledge** (5.3%), requiring external domain-specific expertise.\n\nNumerical operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **division**, and **ranking** each account for around **4–5%** of the tasks, indicating that while these operations are less frequent, they are still integral to verifying certain claims.

This indicates that GPT-4 may not fully grasp the nuances of unverifiable claims and instead defaults to making a definitive judgment, which can lead to significant errors in such cases.\n\nThese differences highlight the challenges of distinguishing between verifiable and non-verifiable claims in scientific fact-checking tasks. InstructGPT's tendency to default to NEI may reflect an inability to confidently determine whether a claim is supported or refuted, while GPT-4’s overconfidence may stem from a lack of sensitivity to the ambiguity inherent in some claims.\n\n![InstructGPT and GPT-4 confusion matrices show differing error tendencies in zero-shot 3-class classification](image2)\n\nFurthermore, these findings align with broader observations that the NEI class poses unique difficulties for models. As noted in the error analysis, distinguishing between ‘refuted’ and ‘NEI’ claims is inherently challenging, even for trained human annotators [4]. This difficulty is compounded in the zero-shot setting, where models must rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge without additional context or examples.\n\nIn conclusion, while both InstructGPT and GPT-4 face challenges in handling the NEI class, their error tendencies differ significantly—InstructGPT leans toward underconfidence and frequent NEI assignments, whereas GPT-4 shows overconfidence and incorrect classifications of NEI as supported or refuted. These differences suggest that improving the ability of models to accurately assess the verifiability of claims remains a critical area for future research."}

These challenges are highlighted in the confusion matrices presented in Figure 4, which show how each model distributes its predictions across the three classes: Supported, Refuted, and NEI.\n\nFor InstructGPT, the confusion matrix reveals a pattern of \"less confidence\" in predicting the NEI class. It frequently misclassifies supported and refuted claims as NEI. For instance, 26.8% of actual supported claims are predicted as NEI, and 23.6% of actual refuted claims are also classified as NEI. This indicates that InstructGPT struggles to distinguish between verifiable claims and those that lack sufficient information, leading to over-classification of claims into the NEI category.\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 exhibits \"over confidence,\" incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. According to the confusion matrix, 10.3% of actual NEI claims are predicted as supported, and 8.5% are predicted as refuted. This suggests that GPT-4 has difficulty recognizing when a claim is unverifiable due to insufficient evidence, instead assigning it a definitive label based on its reasoning capabilities.\n\nThese differing behaviors underscore the inherent difficulty of distinguishing verifiability in scientific claims, particularly in the context of table-based reasoning. The challenge is further compounded by ambiguous claims and grounding errors, as noted in the error analysis [3], where models must correctly associate data with specific cells in the table. Additionally, the presence of the NEI class itself introduces complexity, as human annotators also find it challenging to differentiate between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims [8].\n\n![InstructGPT and GPT-4 confusion matrices for NEI classification](image5)"}

On the AGNews dataset, GPT2-XL shows a more significant improvement with a $2.5\\times$ speed-up compared to GPT-J’s $2.9\\times$. These variations suggest that the efficiency gains depend on both the model architecture and the characteristics of the dataset [2]. \n\nConfusion matrices provide further insights into how these models perform in terms of classification accuracy. The confusion matrix in image2 highlights the performance of the model across several categories such as \"Abbreviation,\" \"Entity,\" \"Description,\" \"Person,\" \"Location,\" and \"Number.\" The values range from 0.58 to 1, with higher values indicating better classification accuracy. Diagonal elements represent correct classifications, and their proximity to 1 suggests high accuracy for those categories. This visualization reveals that the model performs well in certain categories but struggles with others, pointing to potential areas for improvement [image2].\n\nSimilarly, another confusion matrix in image4 offers a color gradient representation of classification accuracy or correlation between predicted and true classes.

The development of Llama 2-Chat involves a multi-step approach that begins with pretraining using an optimized auto-regressive transformer and includes extensive data cleaning, updated data mixes, and increased training data volume [5]. Following pretraining, supervised fine-tuning is applied to create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat. This is then refined using human feedback through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), incorporating techniques like Rejection Sampling and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to iteratively improve the model’s behavior [1].\n\n![The image depicts the training process of Llama 2-Chat, including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, human feedback, and RLHF](image1)\n\nThese methods ensure that the models are aligned with principles of helpfulness and safety, as emphasized in the paper [10].

Notably, this entire carbon footprint was directly offset by Meta’s sustainability program, which underscores the company's commitment to reducing the environmental impact of AI development. Additionally, the open-source release of LLaMA 2 means that other organizations do not need to bear the same computational costs, potentially saving global resources [5].\n\nIn terms of **performance**, LLaMA 2 outperforms previous versions, such as Llama 1, across multiple benchmarks. For example, the Llama 2 70B model improves results on MMLU and BBH by approximately 5 and 8 points, respectively, compared to Llama 1 65B [10]. Furthermore, Llama 2 models outperform MPT and Falcon models of similar sizes on most benchmarks, except for coding tasks [10].

The results show that LLaMA 2 outperforms several open-source models and is competitive with some closed-source models, although it still lags behind the top-tier models like GPT-4.\n\nFor example, in the MMLU benchmark (5-shot), LLaMA 2 scores 68.9, which is slightly lower than GPT-3.5 (70.0) but comparable to PaLM (69.3) and PaLM-2-L (78.3).

In terms of code benchmarks, however, LLaMA 2 shows a significant gap compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as noted in Table 4 [3].\n\nAnother key strength of LLaMA 2 is its performance on natural language understanding tasks. For instance, on TriviaQA (1-shot), LLaMA 2 scores 85.0, which is very close to PaLM-2-L (86.1) and significantly better than PaLM (81.4).

Specifically, the LLaMA 2 70B model improves results on MMLU and BBH by approximately 5 and 8 points, respectively, compared to LLaMA 1 65B [1]. This indicates that LLaMA 2 benefits from larger parameter counts and improved training data, as reflected in its increased context length (from 2k to 4k tokens) and more extensive training data (2.0T tokens for all models) [3].\n\nDespite these strengths, LLaMA 2 has notable weaknesses, particularly in code-related tasks.

As more knowledge is removed from the knowledge graph (KG), these metrics exhibit distinct behaviors that reflect how models handle absent knowledge.\n\nIn the context of \"Conscious Incompetence,\" the line graph titled \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence\" [image3] illustrates that **precision increases** as the number of knowledge elements removed rises. This suggests that when fewer relevant knowledge elements are available, the model becomes better at identifying which knowledge is missing and avoiding incorrect citations. However, **recall remains relatively stable**, indicating that the model's ability to retrieve existing relevant knowledge does not improve much with the removal of knowledge elements. The **F1-Score shows a moderate increase**, reflecting a balance between the improvements in precision and the lack of improvement in recall.\n\nFrom the \"Retrieval Analysis\" line graph [image5], we see that as retrieval accuracy decreases, **precision, recall, and F1-Score all decline**. Correctness, however, remains the highest among the metrics, showing only a slight decrease. This implies that while the models maintain their ability to produce factually correct answers even with lower retrieval accuracy, their citation-related performance deteriorates significantly. Specifically, the drop in recall is more pronounced than the drop in precision, suggesting that the models struggle more with identifying all relevant knowledge than with filtering out irrelevant or incorrect information.\n\nThese changes imply that while current large language models (LLMs) can identify absent knowledge to some extent—especially under the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting—they face challenges in retrieving sufficient coverage of relevant knowledge when the KG has limited coverage. This highlights the importance of retrieval accuracy and the need for improved methods to address the coverage issue in knowledge graphs [6].\n\n![The line graph titled \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence\" shows that precision increases significantly as more knowledge is removed, while recall remains stable and F1-Score moderately increases.](image3)\n\n![The line graph titled \"Retrieval Analysis\" demonstrates that as retrieval accuracy decreases, precision, recall, and F1-Score all decline, with correctness remaining the highest metric.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of knowledge elements negatively impacts precision, recall, and F1-Score, especially when retrieval accuracy is low, highlighting the models' limitations in handling absent knowledge effectively."}

From the experimental findings, it is evident that incorporating relevant logical constraints into LLM instructions leads to stable improvements in model performance, particularly when combined with a sufficient number of demonstration samples [7]. For instance, on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, using 5 demonstrations along with logical constraints achieved a performance score of 25.7%, surpassing the result obtained from using 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%) [7].\n\nThis indicates that providing both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) is crucial for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs [7]. Moreover, as demonstrated in Figure 6, adding logical constraints can help reduce logical inconsistency in answers, although the overall micro-F1 scores may remain relatively stable due to potential overthinking by LLMs [2].\n\nIn addition, the results from Table 3 show that once trained on the synthesized dataset LLM-LR, models like LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B significantly improve their performance, especially on baselines without logical constraints [9]. This further supports the idea that explicitly teaching LLMs logical constraints enhances their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks.\n\n![Performance comparison with and without logical constraints](image3)\n\nThe ablation study shown in the graphs also reveals that increasing the number of demonstration samples improves performance up to a certain point, after which the gains diminish [4]. Furthermore, iterative retrieval of logical constraints helps reduce logical inconsistency over multiple iterations, although this does not always translate to a proportional increase in micro-F1 scores [2].\n\n![Impact of demonstration samples and iterations on performance](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the use of logical constraints in conjunction with an appropriate number of demonstration samples significantly enhances the performance of models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

For example, Table 2 highlights that incorporating logical constraints into LLM instructions greatly reduces the LI percentage, while also improving overall performance on two tasks [8]. Furthermore, when training models on the LLM-LR dataset with embedded logical constraints, models like LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B show substantial improvements compared to their baselines without such constraints [9]. This suggests that explicitly teaching logical reasoning to LLMs enhances their ability to produce logically consistent answers.\n\nPost-processing is another method used to eliminate logical inconsistencies, but it comes with trade-offs. While post-processing ensures a complete absence of logical conflicts (resulting in an LI of 0%), it may compromise the quality of generated responses due to random selection from candidate sets or the introduction of irrelevant information [8]. This indicates that although post-processing is effective at reducing logical inconsistency, it might not always align with the intended meaning or context of the original input.\n\nVisual evidence supports these findings. In image1, a table comparing model performance under three conditions—“with all logical constraints,” “with retrieved logical constraints,” and “with post-processing”—shows that models such as GPT-4 and Turbo achieve lower LI percentages when logical constraints are applied. The same table also reveals that post-processing consistently results in an LI of 0% for most models, though this often correlates with reduced Micro-F1 scores, indicating a potential trade-off between consistency and accuracy [image1].\n\nSimilarly, image3 presents detailed comparisons of Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. It shows that the lowest LI (0%) is achieved through post-processing, but the highest Micro-F1 scores are obtained when logical constraints are integrated into the CoT (Chain-of-Thought) approach. This reinforces the idea that while post-processing guarantees consistency, logical constraints offer a more balanced improvement in both performance and coherence [image3].\n\nIn summary, logical constraints provide a more holistic improvement in both logical consistency and task performance, whereas post-processing ensures consistency at the expense of potentially sacrificing semantic richness and accuracy. Both methods have their merits, but integrating logical constraints during training or inference appears to yield better results overall."}

For instance, GPT-4V, despite being an advanced model, achieves only 55.7% accuracy on MMMU, indicating the significant challenge posed by its depth requirements [2].\n\nRegarding **knowledge breadth**, MMMU spans six broad disciplines—Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering—with 30 subjects and 183 subfields [5]. This diversity far exceeds the scope of most prior benchmarks, which are typically focused on daily knowledge or common sense [8]. The breadth of MMMU is further emphasized by its inclusion of a wide variety of image types, including diagrams, tables, chemical structures, medical images, and more, making it significantly more comprehensive than other benchmarks like VQA or MMBench [8].\n\nIn terms of **image usage**, MMMU features a diverse range of image formats, from photographs and paintings to diagrams and medical images, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs [1]. Furthermore, it includes interleaved text-image inputs, where models must jointly understand images and text, often requiring deep subject knowledge and complex reasoning [1]. This is illustrated in the dataset’s structure, where images can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of questions, and some questions even include multiple images [3].\n\nFinally, regarding **question formats**, MMMU predominantly uses multiple-choice questions (94.03%), with a smaller portion consisting of open-ended questions (5.97%) and questions with explanations (17.62%) [3]. Notably, over 97% of the questions involve images, with variations in their placement within the question text [3]. This unique combination of diverse image types, interleaved text-image inputs, and a wide range of disciplines makes MMMU a distinctive and challenging benchmark for evaluating multimodal understanding and reasoning.\n\n![MMMU excels in depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) compared to other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, VisWiz, and others](image5)"}

Compared to other benchmarks, MMMU stands out as a more comprehensive and challenging evaluation framework for multimodal models.\n\nIn terms of **reasoning depth**, MMMU requires models to engage in expert-level reasoning that goes beyond basic visual perception. For instance, it demands the application of domain-specific knowledge such as \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions [5]. This level of complexity is not typically found in other benchmarks like VQA or GQA, which often focus on simpler tasks such as commonsense reasoning or basic visual recognition [9]. The benchmark's emphasis on deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge reflects its unique challenge, as noted in Figure 1, where MMMU excels in depth compared to other benchmarks [7].\n\nRegarding **knowledge breadth**, MMMU covers a wide range of disciplines, including Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. It includes problems from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks spanning 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields [5]. This extensive coverage contrasts sharply with other benchmarks, which are often limited to daily knowledge and common sense [9]. As illustrated in Figure 2, MMMU is highlighted for its broad range of image types and sources, emphasizing its commitment to evaluating models across a wide spectrum of academic domains [image2].\n\nThe **variety of image types** used in MMMU further distinguishes it from other benchmarks. While many existing benchmarks primarily use photographs or simple diagrams, MMMU incorporates a diverse array of images, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, sheet music, and more [4]. This diversity ensures that models must be capable of understanding and interpreting various visual formats, which is a significant step up from the relatively limited image formats seen in most other benchmarks [image4].\n\nIn summary, MMMU represents a major advancement in the evaluation of large multimodal models by pushing the boundaries of both reasoning depth and knowledge breadth, while also introducing a much wider variety of image types than previously seen in existing benchmarks. ![MMMU excels in depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) compared to other benchmarks](image2)"}

This leads to a notable gap compared to open-source models. However, this gap narrows in the \"Medium\" category, where GPT-4V still maintains an edge with a success rate of $55.6\\%$ [4]. In the most challenging \"Hard\" category, the performance gap diminishes further, with GPT-4V achieving $31.2\\%$ accuracy [2]. This suggests that while GPT-4V excels in simpler tasks, its advantage diminishes significantly as task complexity increases, indicating limitations in handling expert-level queries even for advanced models [4].\n\nWhen analyzing **image types**, GPT-4V consistently outperforms other models across all categories, as illustrated in Figure 5 [8]. Open-source models perform relatively better on common image types such as Photos and Paintings, which are frequently encountered during training. However, they struggle with less common image types like Geometric shapes, Music sheets, and Chemical structures, where scores drop close to random guessing. This highlights a generalization issue in existing models when dealing with rare or complex visual inputs [8].\n\n![GPT-4V's error distribution across different categories](image3)  \nThis pie chart shows that among 150 annotated errors from GPT-4V, $35\\%$ were perceptual errors, $29\\%$ stemmed from a lack of knowledge, and $26\\%$ were due to reasoning flaws [10]. These findings emphasize the multifaceted challenges posed by the MMMU benchmark and highlight areas for improvement, such as enhancing perceptual capabilities, expanding knowledge bases, and refining reasoning mechanisms.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis of GPT-4V’s errors reveals that while the model often has the correct reasoning, it may misidentify the order of events or illustrations, as seen in a case involving oxygen masks on a plane [image1]. This indicates that the model might have issues with interpreting visual sequences accurately despite having sound logical reasoning.\n\nIn summary, while GPT-4V performs well overall, especially in easier tasks and common image types, it faces significant challenges in more complex scenarios and less frequent visual data. Key errors include perceptual misinterpretations, knowledge gaps, and reasoning flaws, which collectively point to the need for further advancements in multimodal understanding and integration of visual and textual information."}

As depicted in Figure 6, it is the most straightforward approach, where documents are indexed, relevant information is retrieved based on the user’s query, and then a frozen language model generates the output [2].

These methods differ in how they navigate the hierarchical structure of information to retrieve relevant content for answering questions. In particular, the **collapsed tree retrieval** method has been shown to outperform **tree traversal** on the QASPER dataset and other evaluation metrics [10]. \n\nThe collapsed tree approach retrieves information by collapsing the entire tree into a single layer and selecting nodes based on cosine similarity until a threshold number of tokens is reached. This allows it to capture information at the appropriate level of granularity for a given question, offering greater flexibility compared to tree traversal, which follows a fixed ratio of nodes from each level of the tree [9]. As demonstrated in Figure 3, the collapsed tree consistently performs better than tree traversal across different context lengths, with the best results achieved at 2000 tokens [image3].\n\nIn addition to comparing these two RAPTOR-based methods, the system also outperforms **DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)** when integrated with SBERT.

This ability to leverage higher-level summaries is particularly beneficial for tasks like the QASPER dataset, where synthesizing information from NLP papers is required [2].\n\nAcross various evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU-1, BLEU-4, and METEOR, models enhanced with RAPTOR generally perform better than those without it.

This approach allows researchers to assess not only how well the models perform but also the consistency of human judgments.\n\nIn the relative evaluation, Table 4 provides statistics about the levels of agreement among annotators for different comparisons involving Chameleon and other models. For example, when comparing Chameleon with Gemini+, 31.5% of the cases had all three annotators agree, 58.1% had two annotators agree, and 10.3% had no agreement [image2]. Similar patterns were observed in comparisons with GPT-4V+, Gemini, and GPT-4V, where the level of agreement ranged from 28.6% to 35.4% for \"All 3 annotators agree\" and 55.2% to 59.3% for \"2 of 3 annotators agree.\" These results suggest that while there is a moderate level of agreement among annotators, there are still instances where their judgments differ significantly, especially in more complex or nuanced evaluations.\n\nRegarding task fulfillment specifically, Figure 9a highlights that Chameleon's responses are considered to have completely fulfilled the tasks more frequently than those of Gemini+ and GPT-4V+ [2]. However, this does not necessarily imply that annotators agreed on these judgments. In fact, the data from Table 4 indicates that even when one model outperforms another, there is often a lack of complete consensus among the annotators, with around 10% of cases showing no agreement in most model comparisons.\n\nFor relevance, Figure 10 shows that inter-annotator agreement is generally high across various categories, including \"relevance\" and \"task fulfillment,\" with the \"All\" category (representing full agreement) having the highest counts [image4]. This suggests that when it comes to assessing whether a response is relevant or fulfills the task, annotators tend to agree more often compared to other aspects like image quality or objectionable content.\n\nIn summary, while Chameleon demonstrates strong performance in task fulfillment compared to baseline models, the level of inter-annotator agreement varies depending on the specific model being evaluated and the nature of the task.

Initially, the system performs pre-processing steps tailored to detection datasets, which differ from standard image classification tasks. As described in [8], images are cropped based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resized to a fixed proportion. This helps isolate individual objects of interest within complex scenes. Additionally, blurring is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects, guiding the MLLMs’ focus toward the relevant parts of the image.\n\nFollowing this, the system employs a **multimodal retriever**, as outlined in [3], to create and store multimodal embeddings (both image and text) in an external memory bank. These embeddings are indexed for efficient retrieval. During inference, the input image is encoded into an embedding using a visual encoder, which is then used to query the memory index and retrieve the top-$k$ similar results. This retrieval process leverages both image-to-image and image-to-text interactions, depending on the task. For instance, in object detection, where small cropped sub-images are involved, CLIP’s image-to-text interaction is utilized instead of image-to-image retrieval, as noted in [6].\n\nOnce the top-$k$ categories are retrieved, they are passed to the MLLMs for ranking. The MLLMs use their extensive knowledge and advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, as explained in [4]. This ranking step ensures that the final prediction is not only semantically aligned but also contextually accurate.\n\nThis combined approach—retrieval augmented by ranking—significantly enhances the model's ability to handle fine-grained and zero-shot recognition tasks. A visual representation of this process can be seen in `![RAR pipeline for object recognition](image3)`, which illustrates how the multimodal retriever and ranking mechanism work together to refine predictions.\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by first isolating and encoding individual objects through preprocessing, retrieving top-k candidates from an indexed memory, and finally refining these results through MLLM-based ranking to achieve accurate and context-aware classifications."}

Additionally, **RAG-related errors** account for **45%** of mistakes, suggesting that while Step-Back makes retrieval easier, the retrieved information may still be incomplete or misleading [10].\n\nOther error types include **Factual Errors** (4%), **Math Errors** (25%), and **Context Loss** (7%) [image4], but Reasoning Errors remain the dominant issue. These findings highlight that while Step-Back Prompting enhances abstraction and retrieval, it does not fully resolve the underlying challenges in complex reasoning steps.\n\n![Step-Back Prompting significantly outperforms other methods on MMLU Physics and Chemistry](image1)\n\n![Step-Back + RAG achieves the highest accuracy on TimeQA and TQA Easy benchmarks](image2)\n\n![Reasoning Errors dominate among the types of errors made by Step-Back Prompting](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, Step-Back Prompting, particularly when combined with RAG, significantly improves performance across various QA tasks compared to GPT-4, but it still faces challenges primarily in the reasoning step."}

These evaluations highlight the effectiveness of combining abstraction through Step-Back prompting with retrieval augmentation (RAG) in improving model accuracy on complex reasoning tasks.\n\nOn **TimeQA**, as shown in Table 2 [4], the baseline models of GPT-4 and PaLM-2L achieved only $45.6\\%$ and $41.5\\%$, respectively. However, when using Step-Back with RAG, the accuracy improved significantly to $68.7\\%$, demonstrating the value of abstraction and retrieval in handling factual intensive questions. This result underscores how high-level conceptualization combined with fact retrieval can enhance performance on challenging QA benchmarks.\n\nFor **MuSiQue**, a multi-hop reasoning benchmark, Table 3 [7] reveals that PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG achieves $42.8\\%$ accuracy, which is notably higher than other methods like CoT or TDB. This shows that Step-Back with RAG is particularly effective for tasks requiring multiple steps of reasoning.\n\nIn the case of **StrategyQA**, Table 3 [7] reports an impressive $86.4\\%$ accuracy for PaLM-2L + Step-Back + RAG, outperforming even GPT-4. This suggests that the method is highly effective for tasks that involve binary classification and strategic reasoning.\n\nMoreover, Figure 5 [1] provides an ablation study showing that the performance of Step-Back Prompting remains stable across different numbers of few-shot exemplars, indicating its sample efficiency.

This aligns with the conclusion that DSC is more effective for imbalanced datasets and tasks where F1 scores are prioritized over raw accuracy [10].\n\n![BERT and XLNet F1 scores on MRPC and QQP datasets](image5)  \n![Performance comparison of BERT and XLNet variants on question answering tasks](image4)  \n![Accuracy results for BERT variants on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets](image1)\n\nIn summary, BERT and XLNet models, especially when enhanced with DSC, perform well on a variety of NLP tasks, but their effectiveness depends on the nature of the task and the dataset. DSC is particularly beneficial for imbalanced datasets and tasks focused on maximizing F1 scores, while CE remains superior for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment analysis."}

These effects are measured using accuracy, F1 scores, and other performance metrics across sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER) tasks.\n\nFor sentiment classification tasks, such as those conducted on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2 and SST-5), experiments show that using cross-entropy (CE) loss achieves higher accuracy compared to dice loss (DL) and dice score with class balancing (DSC). Specifically, BERT+CE outperforms both BERT+DL and BERT+DSC in terms of accuracy, achieving 94.90% on SST-2 and 55.57% on SST-5, while BERT+DL performs slightly worse at 94.37% and 54.63%, respectively [1]. This indicates that for accuracy-oriented tasks, CE is more effective than DL or DSC.\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, data augmentation techniques like +positive and +negative have varying impacts. For instance, adding positive examples leads to a balanced dataset, which improves performance, while adding negative examples creates a more imbalanced dataset, resulting in lower performance [6]. This is further supported by the observation that DSC performs better on more imbalanced datasets, achieving the highest F1 scores across all datasets, especially for +negative datasets [3].\n\nThe effect of hyperparameters, such as $\\alpha$ in the Tversky index (TI), also plays a crucial role in NER tasks. Experiments on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets show that adjusting $\\alpha$ significantly influences performance. For example, the highest F1 score on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 was achieved when $\\alpha = 0.6$, yielding an F1 of 84.67, while on QuoRef, the best result was obtained with $\\alpha = 0.4$, giving an F1 of 68.44 [4]. This highlights the importance of tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance on different datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the use of focal loss (FL) and dynamic strategies helps mitigate the overwhelming influence of easy-negative examples, leading to improved performance on data-imbalanced NLP tasks [9]. This is particularly evident in the results from Chinese datasets, where DSC outperformed FL and DL by significant margins, achieving SOTA results on CTB5, CTB6, and UD1.4 [10].\n\n![BERT+CE achieves the highest accuracy for both SST-2 and SST-5 datasets](image1)\n\n![The highest F1 scores for Chinese Onto4.0 and English QuoRef datasets are achieved at specific $\\alpha$ values](image2)\n\n![F1 scores for MRPC and QQP datasets show that +DSC provides the most significant improvements](image3)"}

Specifically, on the SQuADv1.1 dataset, BERT with DSC achieves an F1 score that is $+1.25$ higher than XLNet and an EM score that is $+0.84$ higher [1]. On QuoRef, the improvement is even more pronounced, with DSC surpassing XLNet by $+1.46$ in EM and $+1.41$ in F1 [1]. These results highlight how the choice of loss function significantly impacts performance.\n\nAugmentation techniques also play a crucial role in shaping the performance of BERT models. For example, adding positive examples to the training set (referred to as \"+Positive\") leads to better performance compared to the original setup, while adding negative examples (\"+Negative\") results in worse performance due to increased imbalance [4]. This is further supported by the data in Table 8, which shows that \"+Positive\" outperforms the baseline, whereas \"+Negative\" underperforms it [4].\n\nMoreover, when both positive and negative examples are added (\"+Positive & Negative\"), the model benefits from a balanced dataset, which helps maintain good performance. However, removing negative examples (\"-Negative\") leads to a decrease in the number of training samples, resulting in inferior performance [4].\n\nThis behavior is reflected in image1, which visually compares the performance of BERT and its variants (BERT+FL, BERT+DL, BERT+DSC) under different conditions such as \"Original,\" \"+Positive,\" \"+Negative,\" \"-Negative,\" and \"+Positive & Negative.\" The table reveals that BERT+DSC consistently outperforms other configurations, especially in more imbalanced settings [image1].\n\nIn sentiment classification tasks, the dice-based loss (DSC) was found to be less effective compared to cross-entropy (CE). For example, on the SST-5 dataset, BERT with CE achieved an accuracy of 55.57, while BERT with DSC achieved only 55.19, indicating that DSC is not well-suited for accuracy-oriented tasks [3]. This is illustrated in image4, where BERT+CE consistently outperforms BERT+DL and BERT+DSC on both SST-2 and SST-5 datasets [image4].\n\nFinally, the impact of hyperparameters such as $\\alpha$ in the Tversky index (TI) is evident in image2, which shows that varying $\\alpha$ values lead to different F1 scores on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets. The highest F1 scores are achieved at specific $\\alpha$ values, highlighting the importance of tuning these parameters for optimal performance [image2].\n\nIn summary, the performance differences among various BERT model configurations depend heavily on the choice of loss function, data augmentation strategies, and hyperparameter tuning.

BLEU is a classic $n$-gram matching metric that estimates translation quality by comparing the overlap of $n$-grams between a candidate translation and one or more human references [1]. On the other hand, COMET-RANK is a learnable metric based on a neural framework designed to capture more nuanced aspects of translation quality, including semantic similarity and alignment in an embedding space [3].\n\nWhen comparing these metrics across different language pairs, several trends can be observed. For example, in the case of translations from English to Czech (en-cs), COMET-RANK achieves a score of 0.711 when using reference translations, compared to 0.660 when not using them, indicating a significant improvement with the inclusion of references [image1]. In contrast, BLEU scores for similar language pairs often show less variability and may not correlate as strongly with human judgments [10].\n\nAcross multiple language pairs, such as German to English (de-en), Finnish to English (fi-en), and Lithuanian to English (lt-en), COMET-RANK consistently outperforms BLEU in terms of Kendall Tau correlation with human judgments [image2]. This trend is also reflected in Table 3, where COMET-RANK achieves the highest scores for several language pairs, outperforming even advanced metrics like BERTScore and BLEURT [image3].\n\nAnother notable trend is that COMET-RANK benefits significantly from the inclusion of source language information, which helps improve its alignment with human judgments [7]. This contrasts with BLEU, which does not consider the source text at all and thus may miss important contextual cues [9].\n\nIn summary, COMET-RANK demonstrates superior performance over BLEU in capturing translation quality across various language pairs, particularly when source information is included. The use of neural frameworks allows COMET-RANK to better align with human judgments, while BLEU remains limited by its reliance on surface-level $n$-gram matching.\n\n![COMET-RANK shows higher scores than BLEU across various language pairs when using reference translations](image1)\n![COMET-RANK metrics generally perform better than BLEU across different sets of MT systems](image2)"}

In contrast, **CHAI** involves a more complex set of tasks in a 3D house environment (CHALET), with 1,596 instruction sequences averaging 7.7 instructions per sequence [9]. This indicates that **CHAI** requires more intricate planning and execution, often involving multiple intermediate goals [9].\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, **LANI** is evaluated using **stop distance (SD)** and **task completion (TC)**, while **CHAI** uses **stop distance (SD)** and **manipulation accuracy (MA)** [6]. The SD metric measures how close the agent gets to the target location, while TC and MA reflect the success of completing the task or manipulating objects correctly. \n\nFor example, on **LANI**, human performance achieves a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and successful task completion (TC) of 63% [2]. On **CHAI**, human performance has a much lower SD of 1.34 and perfect manipulation accuracy (MA) of 100% [2]. This highlights that while **CHAI** may have simpler navigation aspects, the manipulation component adds significant complexity that impacts performance.\n\nComparing different methods, the proposed approach outperforms existing methods like **MISRA17** and **CHAPLOT18** on **LANI**, improving TC by 5% [5]. However, on **CHAI**, while the proposed method improves stop distance (SD), all models perform poorly, especially in manipulation accuracy (MA) [5].

Similarly, on the CHAI dataset, it achieves an SD of 3.34, indicating superior navigation accuracy [4]. These results suggest that our method is more effective in minimizing deviation from the target and completing tasks as instructed.\n\nIn contrast, baseline methods such as STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT perform significantly worse, with higher SD values and lower TC rates. For instance, the STOP method has an SD of 3.91 for navigation-only instructions, which is notably worse than our approach’s SD of 3.24, showing a 17% reduction in error [2].

This design allows for an interpretable goal representation without relying on complex logical ontologies or symbolic representations [4]. However, this approach may be limited by cascading errors, as action generation relies solely on the predicted goal and does not account for intermediate trajectory constraints [4]. Additionally, the model may struggle with instructions that specify constraints on execution, which are common in the dataset [4].\n\nFurthermore, human evaluation provides insight into the effectiveness of automated metrics. A Pearson correlation of -0.65 between human ratings and SD indicates that our automated metric aligns well with human judgment, suggesting that it is appropriate for evaluating task performance [5].

The p-values provided indicate that differences in goal prediction errors between the \"Present\" and \"Absent\" groups are statistically significant for some categories, such as \"Temporal coordination\" and \"Co-reference\" [image1]. These findings suggest that the inclusion of certain linguistic features can significantly influence the model's ability to predict goals accurately.\n\nIn terms of human performance, the study evaluates how well the proposed approach aligns with human instruction execution.

Evidence from the provided text and image quotes highlights how different factors interact to influence outcomes.\n\nFirst, the amount of pretraining data has a clear positive impact on model performance. For instance, Table 3 [3] indicates that stacking methods improve upon previous state-of-the-art results, with fine-tuning providing the most significant gains. This suggests that increasing the volume of pretraining data contributes to better generalization and task performance. Similarly, Figure 3 [7] demonstrates that more training data significantly increases accuracy, with models trained on up to 18B tokens showing potential for further improvement with even more data. Additionally, Figure 4 [4] shows a direct correlation between the amount of Common Crawl data used for pretraining and the average GLUE score, reinforcing the idea that larger datasets lead to better performance.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of pretraining data also depends on its structure. Text quote [4] emphasizes that pretraining on corpora that retain paragraph structure performs better than training on individual sentences. This is corroborated by Table 5 [9], which compares performance across different datasets like BooksCorpus and Wikipedia. The latter, which contains longer paragraphs, generally outperforms shorter, sentence-based examples on certain tasks like QNLI and MNLI, although it performs less well on others.\n\nIn terms of modeling approaches, the cloze-style objective has been shown to be more effective than separate left and right context prediction tasks. As stated in text quote [1], combining cloze loss with bilm loss does not yield improvements over cloze loss alone, suggesting that the cloze method is more aligned with the task of predicting center words based on surrounding context. This is further supported by Table 5 [5], where the \"cloze\" approach achieves an average score of 80.9 across all tasks, outperforming both the \"bilm\" and combined \"cloze + bilm\" approaches.\n\nFinally, the interaction between pretraining data and modeling approaches is evident in Table 3 [3], which compares various models, including CNN Large + fine-tune, BERT_BASE, and BERT_LARGE.

This impact can be understood by examining both the effectiveness of alignment in improving model performance and how this varies depending on the linguistic relationship between the source and target languages.\n\nFrom the text, it is noted that aligning the embedding spaces between the source and target languages may allow the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between them [4]. This hypothesis was tested by applying orthogonal transformations to align the word embeddings of multiple languages into a single space [4]. The results suggest that when the embedding spaces are aligned, the model can benefit from learning in a more unified manner, similar to training on a single language [7].\n\nHowever, not all experiments showed consistent benefits from alignment. For instance, Table 4 indicates that the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses being essentially insignificant across all languages [8]. This suggests that while alignment can be advantageous in some cases, it may not universally improve performance.\n\nIn contrast, Table 5 shows that when pre-trained embeddings are used, the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with GL/PT showing the largest gains and BE/RU showing a small decrease. Interestingly, aligning the word embeddings helped increase BLEU scores for all three tasks in this case [7]. This improvement is intuitive because using a single encoder for both source languages allows the model to learn a more consistent transformation if the embeddings are aligned [7].\n\nFurthermore, the data in Table 3 reveals that as we move to very different languages (such as RU and HE), there are larger accuracy gains compared to more similar counterparts like FR and IT [5]. This supports the idea that pre-training becomes more effective when the baseline system has more room for improvement, which is often the case with less similar languages.\n\n![The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs, showing the effect of alignment on BLEU scores](image2)\n\n![The table shows different datasets with scores for \"unaligned\" and \"aligned\" categories, highlighting changes in BLEU scores after alignment](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of word embeddings can positively impact BLEU scores, particularly when the source and target languages are linguistically distinct and require significant transformation. However, the benefit of alignment is not universal and depends on factors such as the baseline performance of the system and the linguistic similarity between the languages involved."}

From the analysis in Table 5 [2], it is evident that pre-trained embeddings lead to improvements in translation performance, particularly for low-resource language pairs. For instance, the G L /P T pair shows the largest gains, while B E /R U exhibits only a small decrease [3]. This suggests that pre-training is more beneficial when the source and target languages are linguistically similar.\n\nThis hypothesis is further supported by the data in image1, which categorizes various source-to-Portuguese (PT) translation pairs by their language family. The results show that ES → PT (Spanish to Portuguese), which belong to closely related language families (West-Iberian and Romance), achieve a +7.0 improvement in scores, while HE → PT (Hebrew to Portuguese), which share no common language family, show a much higher improvement of +8.9. This might be due to Hebrew's lower baseline BLEU score, indicating that systems with greater room for improvement benefit more from pre-training [8].\n\nMoreover, the role of training set size is crucial. As observed in image5, the top graph illustrates how BLEU scores increase with larger training sets for both standard and pre-trained models. However, the bottom graph reveals that the gain from pre-training is most pronounced at smaller training set sizes. For example, in the Pt→En translation task, the gain from pre-training is substantial when only a fraction of the dataset is used but diminishes as the training set size increases. This aligns with findings from text quote [9], which notes that pre-training is most effective when the baseline system is moderately effective but not too poor—typically with a baseline BLEU score between 3-4. Once enough data exists to capture basic linguistic features, pre-training becomes highly effective.\n\nAdditionally, the qualitative analysis in text quote [7] highlights that pre-training helps models better handle rare vocabulary and generate grammatically correct sentences. This is exemplified in the GL → EN translations, where pre-training enabled successful translation of terms like “chris” and multi-word phrases such as “big lawyer” and “patent legislation,” which are less frequent in the training data.\n\nFinally, the importance of aligning word embeddings is emphasized in text quote [3], where alignment improves BLEU scores by ensuring that source languages share a similar vector space, making the model’s learning process more efficient. This is especially important in multilingual settings where the encoder must learn complex transformations across multiple languages.\n\n![Translation improvements for similar language pairs](image1)\n![Qualitative comparison of translation outputs](image2)\n![Evaluation metrics for different training setups](image3)\n![BLEU score changes with alignment](image4)\n![Training set size vs. BLEU scores and gains](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training enhances translation accuracy, especially for low-resource language pairs and when the source and target languages are linguistically similar.

This is particularly evident in multilingual systems, where aligning embeddings helps increase BLEU scores for all tasks, as the model benefits from having word embeddings in similar vector spaces, thus reducing the complexity of learning transformations between semantically distinct spaces [7].\n\nRegarding the effect of pre-training on F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, the results show that pre-training improves accuracy across the entire vocabulary, but especially for low-frequency words. As illustrated in Figure 2, pre-trained embeddings outperform standard embeddings in higher frequency ranges, though both sets of scores increase with word frequency [8].\n\n![Pre-training improves F-measure for low-frequency words](image2)\n\nIn addition, when comparing unaligned versus aligned translation setups, there are varying effects depending on the language pair.

From the analysis in the text quotes, we see that the R-GCN component is crucial for achieving high performance, especially when combined with strong contextual embeddings like ELMo [2]. When R-GCN is removed (GloVe w/o R-GCN), there is a substantial drop in performance—8.0 points in accuracy—highlighting its importance in updating mention representations based on their relationships [3]. This also aligns with the results shown in `image1`, where the \"No R-GCN\" configuration scores 62.4 (unmasked) and 63.2 (masked), which are lower than configurations that include R-GCN.\n\nSimilarly, the ablation of relation types, such as removing DOC-BASED connections, leads to a decline in performance, particularly in the unmasked condition [1]. The model relies heavily on these connections because they represent mentions within the same document, which provide essential context. As noted in the text, without connecting mentions within the same document, the model loses important information [1]. This is further reflected in `image1`, where the \"No DOC–BASED\" configuration scores 62.9 (unmasked) and 65.8 (masked), indicating a moderate but notable decrease compared to the full model.\n\nRegarding specific relations like MATCH and COREF, the text indicates that while MATCH captures basic coreference cases, the out-of-domain coreference system (COREF) may not be reliable, and its removal does not drastically affect performance [1]. However, in `image1`, the \"No COREF\" configuration still achieves 64.8 (unmasked), suggesting that the impact of removing this specific relation is less severe than other components.\n\nIn the masked setting, the absence of contextual features becomes even more detrimental. For example, GloVe with R-GCN performs poorly in the masked case (11.1), whereas ELMo with R-GCN maintains relatively better performance [3].

This variability makes it harder for the model to recognize coreferences without additional support, and thus, the coreference system may not contribute significantly [6]. However, in the **masked setting**, where all mentions are replaced with a uniform token (e.g., \"MASK1\"), coreference becomes more effective because all references to the same entity are standardized, allowing the model to better identify connections between mentions [2].\n\nIn Table 4, we see that the **Entity-GCN with coreference** performs slightly worse than the **Entity-GCN without coreference** in the test set, suggesting that the coreference system might not be reliable in the test environment, possibly due to the complexity of the documents [6].

This large drop in performance for the GloVe-based model under the masked setting suggests that it struggles significantly when the input is masked, likely due to its inability to effectively leverage relational information or context beyond surface-level features.\n\nThese differences are further contextualized by the relation-based accuracy and precision metrics presented in the tables [3].

This contrasts with the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model, which may not fully utilize these relational dynamics, resulting in lower performance in both unmasked and masked settings.\n\nIn summary, the 'full (ensemble)' model outperforms the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model in both unmasked and masked conditions, with a substantial margin in the latter. This difference is reflected in the relation-based accuracy and precision metrics, where the ensemble model demonstrates superior handling of complex relational structures compared to the GloVe-based model.\n\n![Performance comparison between 'full (ensemble)' and 'GloVe with R-GCN' models](image5)"}

Coreference propagation primarily benefits entity extraction, as noted in experiments where disabling coreference propagation led to a slight decrease in entity F1 scores [3]. For example, in Table 3 [image3], DyGIE without coreference propagation (−CorefProp) achieved an F1 score of 85.7 for entities, compared to 87.1 with full coreference propagation enabled. However, coreference propagation appears to hurt relation extraction performance, which aligns with observations from other studies [6].\n\nOn the other hand, relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction tasks, particularly in datasets like ACE05 and SciERC, where sentences often contain multiple relation instances across different entities [6]. As shown in image3, when relation propagation was disabled (−RelProp), the F1 score for relations dropped to 58.0, while DyGIE with full propagation achieved 58.4 for relations. This suggests that relation propagation helps the model better understand complex sentence structures involving multiple entities and their interactions.\n\nAdditionally, Figure 3a [image1] illustrates how the number of entities in a sentence affects the performance of DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp.

However, in other datasets like ACE05, CorefProp significantly improves entity extraction but may hurt relation extraction [9]. On the other hand, RelProp consistently benefits both entity and relation extraction tasks, especially in datasets with multiple relations between entities [9].\n\nThis is further supported by Figure 4 [3], which illustrates how relation propagation enhances performance in sentences with more entities.

Research has demonstrated that all tested MT systems, including both commercial services like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate, as well as academic models, exhibit a tendency to favor gender stereotypes in their translations [1]. This bias is measured using metrics such as $F_{1}$ scores, which show that systems perform better when translating pro-stereotypical roles (e.g., female nurse) compared to anti-stereotypical ones (e.g., male receptionist) [1].\n\nFor instance, Figure 2 illustrates the absolute accuracies of Google Translate on stereotypical versus non-stereotypical gender roles across multiple languages, with consistently higher performance for stereotypical assignments [1]. A similar trend is observed in other systems, indicating that this bias is not unique to one service [1].\n\nIn terms of accuracy, Table 2 presents performance data across various languages for commercial MT systems. Metrics such as \"Acc\" indicate overall gender accuracy, while $\\Delta_{G}$ and $\\Delta_{S}$ reflect differences in performance between masculine/feminine scores and pro- versus anti-stereotypical role assignments, respectively [4]. These metrics reveal that certain systems, like Microsoft Translator, achieve higher accuracy in German (74.1%) compared to others, potentially due to the linguistic similarity between German and English [8].\n\nAdditionally, the impact of adding stereotypical gender adjectives to the dataset is shown in Table 4, where improvements in accuracy are noted for Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian after such modifications [7].

This is evident from studies that tested the impact of adding stereotypically gendered adjectives to sentences before translation, which aimed to \"correct\" the bias by providing additional contextual signals.\n\nFor instance, when the adjective “pretty” was added to female entities and “handsome” to male entities in source sentences, the resulting translations showed improved performance in some languages. Specifically, this adjustment significantly reduced gender bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [8]. The results are illustrated in Table 4, which compares the performance of Google Translate on these languages using the original WinoMT corpus versus a modified version with added adjectives. In Spanish, for example, the accuracy increased from 53.1% to 63.5%, a notable improvement [image2].\n\nThis suggests that incorporating stereotypical gender cues into the input can help mitigate the tendency of MT systems to default to gender stereotypes during translation. However, such an approach is not practical as a general debiasing strategy because it relies on perfect coreference resolution, which is not always feasible in real-world scenarios [8].\n\nMoreover, Figure 1 provides a concrete example of how gender bias manifests in translation. In the English sentence, the doctor’s gender is inferred through the pronoun “her,” but the Spanish translation incorrectly assigns a male form (“el doctor”) instead of the feminine form (“la doctora”), despite the context suggesting otherwise [image3]. This highlights the importance of context in accurate gender assignment and the limitations of current MT systems in handling such nuances.\n\nAcross multiple languages, the impact of stereotype-based adjustments varies. For instance, the bar chart in image1 shows that the accuracy for stereotypical translations is consistently higher than for non-stereotypical ones, indicating that MT systems tend to favor gender roles that align with societal norms. However, when stereotypical adjectives are introduced, this gap can be reduced, as seen in the case of Spanish, where the accuracy for stereotypical translations improves from 67% to 76% when adjectives are used [image1].\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments can improve gender bias accuracy in machine translation, particularly in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, by providing additional contextual signals that guide the translation process away from biased defaults. ![Stereotype-based adjustments reduce gender bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian translations](image2)"}

One notable finding is that the use of adversarial distractors during training can significantly improve model performance when evaluated on similar adversarial distractors. For instance, when a model is trained on adversarial distractors and tested on the same type, its F1 score increases from 46.84 to 60.10 [4]. This highlights the importance of aligning training and evaluation data to ensure robust performance.\n\nIn contrast, models trained on standard distractors often struggle with adversarial or open-domain settings. For example, the single-paragraph BERT model achieves an F1 score of 67.08 on the \"Distractor\" setting but only 38.40 in the \"Open\" setting [image1]. This significant drop underscores the challenges posed by open-domain scenarios, where retrieval methods like TF-IDF may not be sufficient to find relevant paragraphs, especially for multi-hop questions [5].\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of gold paragraphs in open-domain settings can drastically improve F1 scores. When additional gold paragraphs are provided alongside 500 distractors, the F1 score increases from 39.12 to 53.12 [image2]. This suggests that access to relevant information is crucial for accurate answers, particularly in multi-hop reasoning tasks where multiple pieces of evidence are required.\n\nEntity-type filtering also plays a role in improving performance. By filtering distractors based on entity types that match those in the gold paragraphs, the accuracy of the model improves significantly, from 40.73 F1 to 58.42 F1 [6]. This indicates that reducing noise through targeted filtering can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant information.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of models varies across different question types. Single-hop questions generally yield higher F1 scores than multi-hop or context-dependent ones. For example, single-hop questions achieve an F1 score of 70.54, whereas multi-hop questions achieve only 54.46 [image3]. This disparity emphasizes the difficulty of multi-hop reasoning and the need for datasets that carefully provide the necessary evidence for such tasks [3].\n\nFinally, the choice of training data has a direct effect on evaluation outcomes. Models trained on adversarial data perform better on adversarial evaluation sets, while those trained on original data struggle with adversarial distractors [image4]. This suggests that adversarial training can enhance a model’s robustness and adaptability.\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies have a substantial impact on F1 scores in both multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Adversarial training, entity-type filtering, and the inclusion of gold paragraphs can all contribute to improved performance, while the choice of evaluation setting—such as distractor-based versus open-domain—can significantly affect results. ![Improvement in F1 scores with adversarial training](image4)"}

As a result, the adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension, as it removes the possibility of models relying on superficial patterns rather than understanding the underlying reasoning [3].\n\nIn experiments conducted using this adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance dropped from 77% on the original ARCT dataset to just 53% on the adversarial test set [6]. This reduction highlights that the initial high performance was largely due to the exploitation of statistical cues rather than true argument comprehension. When trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets, BERT's mean and median accuracy were both at 50%, indicating essentially random performance [6].\n\nThis outcome aligns with the conclusion that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension when tested on the adversarial dataset [7]. The results emphasize the importance of controlling for spurious statistics, especially as models become more powerful. Without such control, apparent performance gains may be misleading and not indicative of true understanding [5].\n\n![BERT achieves random accuracy on the adversarial dataset](image4)\n\nFurthermore, the adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard for future work on ARCT, as it offers a more reliable way to assess the true capabilities of models in understanding arguments [10]. The table comparing different BERT configurations illustrates that even variations of BERT do not significantly outperform others on the adversarial dataset, reinforcing the idea that all models struggle without meaningful cues [4].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup effectively neutralizes the influence of spurious cues, revealing that BERT’s performance on the original dataset was not a reflection of genuine argument comprehension but rather an exploitation of statistical patterns. Thus, the adversarial dataset provides a more accurate and robust evaluation framework for assessing machine argument comprehension."}

The results show that greedy decoding achieves the highest scores among automated methods, with an average score of 77.53 across all relations [1]. However, this still falls short of the performance level achieved by human validation, which averages 86.18 [1]. Beam search with fewer beams (e.g., 2 beams) performs better than beam search with more beams (e.g., 10 beams), but it is still outperformed by greedy decoding. Top-5 and top-10 random sampling methods yield lower scores compared to both greedy decoding and beam search, highlighting the importance of structured decoding strategies for generating high-quality commonsense inferences.\n\nVariations in training data percentages also significantly affect the model's performance metrics. When only 1% of the training data is used, the perplexity increases to 23.81, and the BLEU-2 score drops to 5.08 [3]. In contrast, using 10% of the training data reduces perplexity to 13.74 and improves the BLEU-2 score to 12.72. The best performance is observed when using 10% of the training data, as indicated by the bolded values for N/T° (9.54) and N/U° (58.34) metrics [3]. Even with full training data, the model's performance slightly improves, but the gains are less pronounced compared to the improvements seen with 10% training data. This suggests that a moderate amount of training data can be sufficient for achieving strong performance, especially when combined with pre-trained language models.\n\n![COMET decoding methods' performance on ATOMIC dataset](image1)\n\n![Performance comparison of different models on evaluation metrics](image2)\n\n![Impact of varying training data percentages on model performance](image3)"}

The COMET model demonstrates significant advantages over other models, such as LSTM-s and CKBG (Saito et al., 2018), based on several evaluation metrics. These metrics include perplexity (PPL), which measures how well a model predicts a sample, and scores that reflect the correctness of generated tuples. Additionally, novelty metrics like N/T$_{sro}$ and N/T$_{o}$ are used to evaluate the model's ability to generate new knowledge not present in the training set [5]. \n\nFor instance, in image1, the table highlights that COMET achieves the lowest perplexity (4.32) and the highest score (95.25%) among all models evaluated. It also closely approximates human performance with a score of 91.69%, indicating that the model's outputs are perceived as highly accurate by humans. This is further supported by text quote [7], which states that $91.7\\%$ of generated tuples for ConceptNet relations are deemed correct by human evaluators. These results suggest that COMET not only generates high-quality knowledge but also maintains a strong alignment with human judgment.\n\nIn terms of novelty, COMET excels at generating tuples that are not found in the training data. As mentioned in text quote [1], $59.25\\%$ of the generated tuples from COMET are novel, and $3.75\\%$ of the nodes are new. This indicates that the model can extend the knowledge graph beyond what was previously available, which is a significant advantage in automatic knowledge base construction.\n\nFurthermore, image2 provides insight into the relationship between edit distance and the novelty of generated tuples. As the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, suggesting that the model tends to generate more familiar or similar tuples when the deviation from the training data is smaller. However, even with higher edit distances, the classifier accuracy remains close to 100%, indicating that the model's outputs remain largely correct despite being more novel.\n\nThe implications of these findings are profound. They suggest that COMET is not only effective in producing high-quality knowledge but also capable of innovating by introducing new concepts and relationships. This makes it a promising alternative to traditional extractive methods in commonsense knowledge base completion [4].\n\n![COMET outperforms other models in terms of perplexity, score, and human evaluation on the ConceptNet dataset](image1)\n\n![As edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, but classifier accuracy remains high](image2)"}

Closed vocabulary models, such as word-only models, treat all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words similarly, reducing their sensitivity compared to open vocabulary models like char-only or word+char models, which consider each unique character combination differently [8].\n\nIn Table 2, the performance of different models under various attack types is presented, with specific metrics for closed and open vocabulary models [9]. For example, under the \"All\" attack type, the pass-through variant of ScRNN has a relatively high WER of 11.3 for closed vocabulary models, whereas the background variant shows a lower WER of 13.1. In contrast, for open vocabulary models, the pass-through variant has a much higher WER of 30.3, while the background variant reduces this to 14.7.\n\nFurthermore, Figure 2 visualizes the trade-off between WER and sensitivity for different backoff strategies across both closed and open vocabulary models [10]. The left plot represents closed vocabulary models, where the sensitivity ranges from about 11.4 to 12.6, and the WER ranges from 9.5 to 11.5. The neutral backoff strategy appears to have the lowest sensitivity and a moderate WER in this group. On the right plot, representing open vocabulary models, the sensitivity range is broader, from approximately 10 to 30, with the WER ranging from 6.5 to 11. The background variant demonstrates a low WER of 7 and a relatively low sensitivity of around 10, making it more robust than the pass-through variant, which has a high sensitivity of approximately 30 despite a moderate WER of 10.\n\n![Closed vocabulary models show lower sensitivity and moderate WER, while open vocabulary models exhibit a wider range of sensitivity and WER values](image2)\n\n![The trade-off between sensitivity and WER for closed and open vocabulary models is illustrated, showing that lower sensitivity generally correlates with greater robustness](image4)  \n\nIn summary, closed vocabulary models tend to have lower sensitivity and moderate WER, whereas open vocabulary models display a broader variation in both sensitivity and WER, depending on the backoff strategy used."}

When the \"masked\" version of these models is considered, BiDAF mask performs significantly better, achieving 54.5 (test) and 59.8 (test*), whereas FastQA mask scores 35.8 (test) and 38.0 (test*). This suggests that BiDAF, especially its masked variant, outperforms FastQA on WIKIHOP in standard settings [8].\n\nUnder the **gold chain** condition, where only documents leading to the correct answer are used, BiDAF shows substantial improvement, scoring 81.2 (test) and 85.7 (test*), while FastQA scores 44.5 (test) and 53.5 (test*). Similarly, BiDAF mask achieves near-perfect scores of 99.3 (test) and 100.0 (test*), compared to FastQA mask's 65.3 (test) and 70.0 (test*). These results highlight that BiDAF benefits more from the gold chain setup than FastQA, likely due to its ability to integrate cross-document information effectively [5].\n\nOn the **MEDHOP** dataset, the trend continues: in the **standard** condition, BiDAF scores 47.8 (test) and 61.2 (test*), while FastQA scores 23.1 (test) and 24.5 (test*).

This suggests that YiSi metrics are consistently among the top performers across multiple language pairs.\n\nAdditionally, specific performance data from the tables supports this claim.

This approach aims to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of financial results [3][7][9].\n\nIn 2020, an immediate 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies relative to the EUR and DKK would have had a notable effect on Novo Nordisk’s operating profit, as estimated by management. Specifically, under a 5% increase scenario, \"Other comprehensive income\" would be negatively impacted by (1,893) million DKK, while the \"Income statement\" would see a positive impact of 299 million DKK. The total effect would amount to (1,594) million DKK. Conversely, under a 5% decrease scenario, \"Other comprehensive income\" would be positively impacted by 1,893 million DKK, while the \"Income statement\" would experience a negative impact of (299) million DKK, resulting in a total effect of 1,594 million DKK [10]. \n\n![Impact of 5% exchange rate change on comprehensive income and income statement](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the use of cash flow hedges plays a critical role in managing these risks. At year-end, deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges are transferred to financial income or expenses within the next 12 months [6]. These hedging activities are accounted for in a way that aligns the impact of the hedged item with the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement, and the result of these activities is classified as part of financial items [8].\n\nThe table below provides a detailed breakdown of the financial data related to exchange rate adjustments, cash flow hedges, tax and other items, and the total for various periods up to 2020 [2]:\n\n![Financial data breakdown over several years](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, changes in exchange rates and the associated financial risks significantly influenced Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020, as demonstrated by the potential impacts outlined in the management estimates."}

Throughout the year, several factors influenced this amount. First, income or charges to the income statement resulted in a small net change of 2 million DKK [3]. This indicates that the adjustments made to the deferred tax balances reflected in the income statement had a minimal impact on the overall position.\n\nNext, there was an adjustment to other comprehensive income, which reduced the total by 577 million DKK [3]. This likely reflects changes in temporary differences or unused tax losses that are not directly tied to the income statement but still affect the deferred tax position. Additionally, income or charges to equity reduced the total by 72 million DKK [3], indicating that certain adjustments impacted the company’s equity directly.\n\nThe acquisition of subsidiaries added 276 million DKK to the total [3], suggesting that the purchase of new subsidiaries brought about additional deferred tax positions. However, the effect of exchange rate adjustments reduced the total by 307 million DKK [3], highlighting the sensitivity of deferred tax positions to currency fluctuations.\n\nBy the end of 2020, the net deferred tax asset/(liability) stood at 3,363 million DKK [3]. This represents a decrease from the beginning of the year, primarily driven by the adjustments to other comprehensive income and exchange rate effects, partially offset by the acquisition of subsidiaries and minor changes from the income statement and equity.\n\n![Net deferred tax asset/(liability) changes in 2020](image3)"}

Additionally, the bonuses were determined by the Remuneration Committee based on performance against agreed objectives [8].\n\nRegarding **base pay**, while no exact figures are given for 2020 and 2021, the structure of compensation remains consistent with the previously outlined LTI framework. For example, in 2021, the proportion of RSUs was **20%** of the total LTI, and the proportion of S-SARs was **80%** of the total LTI [7]. These proportions are based on the existing target value of **135.53% of base pay** [6], suggesting that base pay remained a key determinant of total compensation even if specific values are not disclosed.\n\nTo further support these findings, image3 shows the total earnings for the four members of the Corporate Executive Committee across 2020 and 2021:\n\n- **B.

The table presented in image4 shows that AUM grew substantially across all categories during this period. For example, Equity AUM increased from $111 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020, Fixed Income AUM rose from $71 billion to $86 billion, and Alternative/Other AUM expanded from $131 billion to $145 billion. The Long-term AUM subtotal also increased from $313 billion in 2018 to $405 billion in 2020, while Liquidity AUM surged from $158 billion to $252 billion. Consequently, the Total AUM jumped from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020 [4]. This growth in AUM suggests that the Firm was able to attract more assets, likely due to strong investment performance and positive net flows, as noted in text quote [9].\n\nSimultaneously, the fee rates for various categories showed a general downward trend over the same period, as depicted in image1. For instance, the fee rate for Fixed Income decreased from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020, and the Alternative/Other fee rate dropped from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020. The Long-term AUM fee rate also declined from 62 bps in 2018 to 60 bps in 2020, while the Liquidity fee rate fell from 17 bps in 2018 to 15 bps in 2020. However, the Equity category remained constant at 76 bps throughout the three years. Despite this decline in fee rates, the overall increase in AUM may have offset some of the reduction, contributing to higher asset management revenues.\n\nThe impact on the Firm’s revenues can be inferred from these trends. Although the fee rates decreased, the substantial growth in AUM likely led to an increase in total revenue from asset management fees. Additionally, text quote [9] explicitly states that asset management revenues of $3,013 million in 2020 increased by 15% compared with the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows. This supports the notion that the increase in AUM had a positive effect on the Firm's revenues despite the declining fee rates.\n\n![AUM increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, with Equity, Fixed Income, Alternative/Other, and Liquidity categories showing notable growth.](image4)\n![Fee rates generally decreased across most categories from 2018 to 2020, with the exception of the Equity category, which remained constant.](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the Firm’s AUM increased substantially from 2018 to 2020, while fee rates generally declined. However, the combination of higher AUM and strong investment performance likely contributed to an increase in asset management revenues."}

Similarly, comprehensive income for fiscal 2021 was **$8.964 billion**, showing an increase from **$5.305 billion** in fiscal 2020 [5].\n\nThe growth in net income can be attributed to several factors outlined in the reports. One of the key contributors was the **increase in QCT revenues by 64%**, driven primarily by higher demand for 5G products across handsets and RFFE (Radio Frequency Front End), as well as a recovery from the negative impacts of the **COVID-19 pandemic** [8]. Additionally, **QTL revenues increased by 26%**, due to rising estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products [8]. These revenue increases were complemented by a **$927 million increase in QSI earnings before income taxes**, largely due to higher net gains on investments [8].\n\nMoreover, the acquisition of **NUVIA for $1.1 billion** on March 16, 2021, added value to the company’s long-term technological capabilities, although this acquisition is more of a strategic investment than a direct contributor to the year's net income [8].\n\nRegarding **comprehensive income**, the difference between net income and comprehensive income stems from **other comprehensive income (OCI)**, which includes items like foreign currency translation gains or losses, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, and derivative instruments [5]. In fiscal 2021, OCI was **($79 million)**, which slightly reduced the comprehensive income compared to net income.

This increase was attributed to adjustments across multiple categories, including amortization of intangible assets, impairments, and other items. For instance, research and development expenses were adjusted by reversing impairment charges and other items, leading to an increase in operating income [image2].\n\nIn **2021**, the gross profit under IFRS was **$32,218 million**, and after adjusting for amortization of intangible assets ($3,419 million) and other items ($344 million), the core gross profit reached **$35,981 million** [image3].

In December 2020, the company declared a cash dividend of $1.76 per share for the first quarter of 2021, representing another 10% increase [5]. These increases in dividends were accompanied by the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows from operating activities, totaling $10.5 billion in 2020 [5].\n\n![Amgen's share repurchase activity and financial performance metrics from 2016 to 2020](image2)  \n![Financial data for the company from 2016 to 2020](image4)\n\nIn summary, the company's share repurchase activity and financial performance metrics showed a mix of growth and decline from 2016 to 2020, with a strong emphasis on returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and stock repurchases."}

Specifically, Capex in 2020 was $21.4 billion, with the Corporation prioritizing spending in a range of $16 billion to $19 billion for 2021 [3]. This reflects a strategic adjustment to manage costs amid challenging market conditions. In contrast, in 2019, the total capital expenditures were higher, as seen in the data from image3, which shows that total expenditures in 2019 amounted to $5,245 million compared to $4,476 million in 2020. The decline in Capex aligns with the Corporation’s efforts to reduce operating costs and strengthen liquidity during 2020, as noted in text quote [4].\n\nRegarding **taxes**, there was a significant shift in both income taxes and the effective tax rate. In 2020, total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $22.8 billion, a decrease of $15.7 billion from 2019 [10]. This drop is attributed to a relative benefit driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020, leading to an effective tax rate of 17% in 2020 compared to 34% in 2019 [10]. Image4 supports this trend, showing that income taxes in 2020 were a negative value of $(5,632)$ million, indicating a credit or reduction in taxes owed, while in 2019, income taxes were $5,282$ million.\n\nThe financial implications of these changes were substantial. The reduction in capital expenditures helped ExxonMobil conserve cash and manage its debt levels more effectively. As stated in text quote [4], the Corporation issued $23 billion in long-term debt in 2020 and aimed to reduce debt over time. Additionally, the lower tax burden in 2020, combined with reduced Capex, likely improved the Corporation’s liquidity position and allowed it to navigate the challenging economic environment more effectively.\n\n![ExxonMobil's capital expenditures decreased from 2019 to 2020, reflecting strategic cost management.](image3)  \n![ExxonMobil's total taxes significantly declined in 2020, influenced by asset impairments and a lower effective tax rate.](image4)"}

In 2021, Berkshire spent $\\S27.1$ billion on repurchasing Class A and B shares, a significant amount that highlights the company’s confidence in its intrinsic value [4]. This repurchase activity was conducted without reducing its consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $\\S30$ billion, ensuring financial strength and liquidity remain intact [6].\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire's net earnings attributable to shareholders were highly variable across the years. In 2019, the total net earnings were $\\S81.417$ billion, which dropped significantly to $\\S42.521$ billion in 2020, likely due to the impact of the pandemic and impairment charges [5]. However, it rebounded strongly in 2021 to $\\S89.795$ billion [5]. This fluctuation can be attributed to various factors, including underwriting results, investment income, and impairment charges.\n\nLooking at the performance of different business segments, the insurance underwriting segment showed steady growth, with after-tax earnings rising from $\\S325$ million in 2019 to $\\S728$ million in 2021 [5]. On the other hand, insurance investment income declined slightly over the same period, from $\\S5,530$ million in 2019 to $\\S4,807$ million in 2021, influenced by lower interest rates on cash and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings [9].\n\nThe railroad segment saw an increase in after-tax earnings, growing from $\\S5,481$ million in 2019 to $\\S5,990$ million in 2021, despite challenges like higher fuel prices [7].

According to the financial data, total revenues decreased by 10% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by declines in company-operated sales and franchised revenues [image2]. Specifically, company-operated sales declined by 14%, with the most significant drops occurring in the International Operated Markets (down 19%) and the U.S. (down 4%) [image5]. Franchised revenues also fell by 8%, with notable decreases in both the U.S. (down 2%) and International Operated Markets (down 14%) [image5].\n\nThese revenue declines were partially offset by increases in other revenues, such as those from brand licensing and technology platforms, which rose by 19% in 2020 [image2]. However, the overall negative impact on revenue was reflected in the operating costs and expenses, which increased due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation, and amortization [image2].\n\nThe decline in revenues directly impacted GAAP earnings per share, which dropped by 20% from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020 [image3]. This decrease was further exacerbated by strategic gains charges of $0.26 per share in 2020, primarily related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock [2], and a reduction in income tax benefits compared to 2019 [image3]. \n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share, which excludes strategic gains and charges, also saw a decline of 23% from $7.90 in 2019 to $6.05 in 2020 [image3].

Let’s explore both in detail.\n\nThe principal assumptions used in calculating the grant-date fair value for stock options include risk-free interest rates, expected volatilities, expected dividend yields, forfeiture rates, and the expected lives of the options [4]. These assumptions are critical to estimating the fair value of stock options using valuation models like the Black-Scholes model. For example, the risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields at the time of grant, while expected volatility considers historical and implied volatility from exchange-traded options [4].\n\nIn contrast, future minimum lease payments represent the company’s obligations under non-cancelable operating leases. As of December 31, 2020, the total future minimum lease payments amounted to $5,046 million, with a breakdown by year provided in image2. This figure includes the total amount the company expects to pay over the lease term, excluding any imputed interest, which results in a net present value of $4,447 million [image2].\n\nWhile both sets of data are important, they serve different purposes: the assumptions for stock options relate to equity compensation and employee incentives, whereas future lease payments pertain to operational commitments and capital structure.\n\n![Future minimum lease payments amount to $5,046 million as of December 31, 2020.](image2)\n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the grant-date fair value for stock options do not directly compare to future minimum lease payments because they are derived from different financial contexts—one related to equity valuation and the other to long-term operational liabilities. However, both provide insight into the company’s financial planning and risk management strategies. \n\nThe assumptions used in calculating the grant-date fair value for stock options are based on market data and historical trends, while future lease payments are contractual obligations tied to the company’s physical and operational needs."}

Similarly, international upstream earnings surged to $8.5 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $825 million in 2020 [6]. These gains were driven by higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs from the previous year, and favorable foreign currency effects.\n\nIn addition, Chevron’s overall financial health was reflected in its debt management strategies. The company completed a tender offer in October 2021, which aimed to reduce future interest expenses and resulted in an after-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of $260 million [3]. Despite this, the company managed to repay $1.1 billion of bank loans associated with the NBLX acquisition during 2021, indicating a focus on strengthening its balance sheet.\n\nThe impact of these operational and financial changes is also evident in the return on stockholders' equity (ROSE), which is a key metric for assessing profitability relative to shareholders' investments.

This reflects a strategy aimed at aligning the interest rate sensitivity of plan assets with liabilities, as noted in the investment policy [8].\n\n![U.S. defined benefit plans had 65% fixed income and 35% equity in 2019](image3)\n\nIn contrast, the non-U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher proportion of fixed income securities and cash equivalents in 2019, with 73% allocated to these assets and only 27% to equity securities [3]. This suggests that non-U.S. plans placed even more emphasis on fixed income investments, likely due to differences in economic environments and the availability of high-quality corporate bonds in various countries [2].\n\n![Non-U.S. defined benefit plans had 73% fixed income and 27% equity in 2019](image3)\n\nThe difference in asset allocation between U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans highlights the varying approaches taken based on regional market conditions and investment strategies. In 2019, U.S. plans maintained a more balanced approach compared to non-U.S. plans, which leaned heavily toward fixed income securities.\n\nIn summary, in 2019, U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher percentage of equity securities compared to non-U.S. defined benefit plans."}

This trend can be understood by analyzing the components of the provision and the interplay between deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIn 2018, the total provision was $3,562 million, comprising a current provision of $3,520 million and a deferred (benefit) provision of $42 million [5]. By 2019, the total provision increased slightly to $3,742 million, with a current provision of $3,512 million and a deferred (benefit) provision of $230 million [5]. In 2020, the total provision rose significantly to $4,973 million, driven largely by an increase in the current provision to $4,981 million, while the deferred (benefit) provision turned slightly negative at $(8) million [5].\n\nThis shift in the deferred provision is closely tied to the changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, the company reported net deferred income tax liabilities of $(3,367) million, compared to $(2,993) million as of December 31, 2019 [3]. The increase in net deferred tax liabilities suggests that the company has experienced a decrease in its deferred tax assets or an increase in deferred tax liabilities during this period. \n\nLooking at the components of deferred income tax assets, the largest item in 2020 was lease liability at $1,200 million, up from $892 million in 2019. Meanwhile, non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards decreased from $420 million in 2019 to $340 million in 2020 [3]. These changes reflect adjustments in the company’s asset and liability bases, which are influenced by enacted tax rates and laws [6]. Additionally, valuation allowances were reduced from $(147) million in 2019 to $(170) million in 2020, indicating a slight improvement in the likelihood of realizing deferred tax assets [9].\n\n![Net deferred income tax liabilities increased from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020](image3)\n\nThese trends in deferred income tax assets and liabilities contribute to the overall increase in the total provision for income taxes. Specifically, the rise in net deferred tax liabilities likely resulted in a smaller reduction (or even an increase) in the deferred tax benefit, thereby increasing the overall effective tax rate. This dynamic is further supported by the reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the actual provision for income taxes [4], which highlights how various factors—such as state income taxes, share-based awards, health insurance taxes, and foreign rate differentials—impact the final provision.\n\nIn summary, the company's provisions for income taxes increased from 2018 to 2020 due to higher current tax provisions and a shift in the deferred tax position, primarily driven by changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities."}

This indicates a substantial overall increase in liabilities for the company during this period. The increase in current liabilities could be attributed to higher compensation and benefits, taxes, income, and other expenses, as well as an increase in deferred revenue and cross-currency swap derivative liabilities [image2]. Similarly, the rise in noncurrent liabilities is reflected in higher pension and postretirement benefits, taxes, income, and other long-term obligations [image2].\n\nRegarding total debt, the company reported total debt of approximately $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2019, and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 [3]. While the total debt slightly decreased, the increase in liabilities suggests that the company might have taken on more short-term obligations, possibly through commercial paper or other short-term financing instruments, which are reflected in the current liabilities section. Additionally, the Five-Year Facility provided liquidity support for these obligations, allowing the company to manage its debt structure effectively [5]. \n\n![The total current liabilities increased from $3,205 million in 2019 to $5,342 million in 2020, while noncurrent liabilities rose from $5,351 million to $7,789 million](image2)  \nThe slight decrease in total debt from $21.7 billion in 2019 to $21.2 billion in 2020 contrasts with the increase in total liabilities, indicating a shift towards more short-term obligations, likely supported by the Five-Year Facility [5]."}

Specifically, the net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [8]. In contrast, in 2019, the net discrete tax benefits were $475 million, associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information about the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits from the conversion of employee share-based awards [3].\n\nThis decline in net discrete tax benefits contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate in 2020, which rose from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, as shown in the following table:  \n![The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020](image4).\n\nSimultaneously, compensation expenses also saw a significant rise. Compensation and benefits expenses in 2020 totaled $20,854 million, an 11% increase from the prior year. This increase was driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives linked to higher revenues, and increased expenses tied to certain deferred compensation plans that are performance-based [9]. The total recognized compensation expense for 2020 was $2,119 million, as illustrated below:  \n![Compensation expenses increased significantly in 2020 compared to previous years](image5).\n\nThese trends indicate that while the Firm experienced a reduction in net discrete tax benefits, leading to a higher effective tax rate, it also faced rising compensation costs, particularly those linked to performance-based deferred compensation plans.

These changes reflect the evolving financial landscape influenced by macroeconomic conditions and consumer behavior during the pandemic.\n\n### Card Member Loans and Receivables\n\n**Card Member loans** increased significantly from $73.4 billion in 2020 to $88.6 billion in 2021, representing a **21% growth** [4]. This increase was driven by higher paydown rates and the continued liquidity and financial strength of the customer base, although it was lower than the growth in billed business [4]. \n\nDespite this growth, the **reserve for credit losses on Card Member loans decreased** in 2021 due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, particularly driven by better unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [7].\n\nFor **Card Member receivables**, the total increased from $43.7 billion in 2020 to $53.6 billion in 2021, indicating a **22.6% increase** [image5]. However, the reserve for credit losses on receivables also saw some changes, with a decline in net write-offs and a partial release of reserves in 2021 compared to a build in 2020 [4]. The net write-off rate for receivables in 2021 was **0.3%**, reflecting a relatively stable performance [image5].\n\n### Network Volumes and Card Member Spending\n\nIn terms of **network volumes**, the data shows that **Worldwide network volumes increased by 24% in 2021**, while they had declined by **18% in 2020** [image4]. Similarly, **total billed business rose by 25% in 2021**, after declining by **19% in 2020** [image4]. This suggests a strong recovery in transactional activity post-pandemic.\n\n**Card Member spending** also saw a significant rebound. The **average proprietary basic card member spending** increased in both the U.S. and globally in 2021 compared to 2020 [image3]. Additionally, **discount revenue**, which is heavily tied to card member spending, grew by **26% year-over-year** in 2021, driven primarily by increased spending [9].\n\n### Comparison and Context\n\nThe increase in **Card Member loans and receivables** from 2020 to 2021 occurred alongside a strong rebound in **network volumes** and **spending**, indicating that customers were not only spending more but also maintaining or increasing their borrowing levels.

Similarly, **comprehensive income dropped from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020** [4]. This significant reduction was influenced by multiple factors outlined in the financial statements.\n\nOne of the primary contributors to the decrease in net income was the impact of the global pandemic, which led to reduced operating earnings. As noted, **cash provided by operations decreased by $1.9 billion or 3% in 2020 compared to 2019**, primarily due to the reduction in operating earnings caused by the effects of COVID-19 [9]. Additionally, **operating income decreased by 19% (20% in constant currencies)**, with results for 2020 including $268 million of net strategic gains related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, while 2019 included $74 million of net strategic charges [6]. However, even after excluding these items, operating income still decreased by 3% (23% in constant currencies) for 2020 [6].\n\nAnother contributing factor was the suspension of the share repurchase program in early March 2020, which resulted in significantly lower treasury stock purchases. In 2020, the company repurchased only 4.3 million shares for $874 million, compared to 25.0 million shares for $5 billion in 2019 [8]. This reduction in treasury stock purchases had a direct effect on financing activities and overall profitability.\n\nIn terms of comprehensive income, the decline was further exacerbated by **other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax**, which turned negative in 2020 at $(104.1) million, compared to a positive $126.8 million in 2019 [4]. The drop was mainly driven by losses from cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans, as well as a smaller gain from foreign currency translation adjustments [4].\n\n![Net income decreased from $6,025.4 million in 2019 to $4,730.5 million in 2020](image4)  \n![Comprehensive income dropped from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020](image4)\n\nIn summary, the decrease in net income and comprehensive income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the adverse impact of the pandemic on operating earnings, a reduction in treasury stock purchases, and unfavorable changes in other comprehensive income components such as cash flow hedges and pension-related losses."}

According to the data provided, the net value of solar energy systems in service after depreciation was **$5,906 million** as of December 31, 2020, compared to **$6,061 million** as of December 31, 2019.

For instance, image4 highlights the net revenue and operating profit for divisions like FLNA (Frito-Lay North America), QFNA (Quaker Foods North America), PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America), LatAm (Latin America), Europe, AMESA (Africa, Middle East, South Asia), and APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, and China) across three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020. The table also includes corporate unallocated expenses, which are subtracted from the operating profit. This indicates that while net revenue may have increased, the operating profit could be affected by rising costs or expenses.\n\nIn addition, image3 provides insight into the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across regions. For example, in Europe, beverages accounted for 55% of sales in 2020, compared to 50% in 2018, suggesting a slight increase in beverage sales relative to food/snack sales. Similarly, in AMESA, beverage sales dropped from 45% in 2018 to 30% in 2020, indicating a shift towards food/snack products in this region. These shifts in product mix can influence overall net revenue and operating profit, as different product categories may carry varying margins and cost structures.\n\nMoreover, text quote [6] notes that operating profit increased by 24%, primarily due to net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring and impairment charges. However, this was partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses. This suggests that while revenue growth positively impacted operating profit, rising operational costs could have tempered the gains.\n\nConversely, text quote [9] states that operating profit decreased by 2%, with a 1.0 percentage point decline in the operating profit margin. This decrease was driven by certain operating cost increases, despite net revenue growth and productivity savings. This could indicate that in some divisions, the cost of goods sold or other expenses outpaced the benefits of revenue growth.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [10] emphasizes the importance of major customers like Walmart, which contributed approximately 14% of consolidated net revenue in 2020. The loss of such a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on certain divisions, particularly FLNA, QFNA, and PBNA. This underscores the vulnerability of the company’s revenue streams to shifts in customer dynamics, especially in light of the evolving retail landscape influenced by e-commerce and direct-to-consumer models.\n\n![Changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020](image4)\n![Percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across regions](image3)"}

This increase was primarily due to the payout for the acquisition of Varian, which required a large outflow of cash. Additionally, there was an increase in cash outflows related to additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, driven by investments in capacity expansions [6].\n\nOn the **financing activities** side, cash inflows surged from €-249 million in 2020 to €11,839 million in 2021.

For instance, BMIX Participações Ltda., a Brazilian entity, is owned 99.99% by Brazil Minerals, Inc., and in turn, owns 99.99% of Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. and 50% of RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. Furthermore, the company owns 100% of Hercules Resources Corporation, which in turn holds 99.99% of Hercules Brasil Ltda. Jupiter Gold Corporation, another Marshall Islands-based entity, is partially owned by Brazil Minerals, Inc. (30%), and it holds 99.99% of Mineração Jupiter Ltda. Lastly, Apollo Resources Corporation, which owns 99.99% of Mineração Apollo Ltda., is itself 60% owned by Brazil Minerals, Inc. ![List of Subsidiaries](image1).\n\nThese structural changes reflect an expansion and consolidation of the company's interests in mineral exploration and mining operations across Brazil, as well as strategic control through a network of subsidiaries. Notably, the company also issued a significant number of shares to related parties, such as the Lancaster Brazil Fund, under an addendum to a share exchange agreement, resulting in a recorded loss on the exchange of equity with a related party of $\\S76,926$ ![Loss on Exchange of Equity with Related Party](image5). \n\nIn summary, Brazil Minerals, Inc. has made notable changes to its corporate structure and stock ownership through amendments to its Articles of Incorporation and through extensive control over a network of subsidiaries, reflecting its focus on mineral exploration and strategic financial maneuvers."}

These obligations are primarily tied to lease agreements where the company is deemed the owner during the construction period or has acquired assets under capital or finance leases.\n\nFrom the text, it is stated that the company capitalizes construction in progress and records a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where it is considered the owner during the construction period [1]. Additionally, certain buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the related leases’ terms, which contributes to the overall liability structure [1].\n\nIn terms of capital lease obligations, the gross capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2017, were $14,811 million. From this amount, imputed interest of $534 million was subtracted to arrive at the present value of net minimum lease payments, which totaled $14,277 million. The current portion of capital lease obligations, representing the portion due within the next 12 months, was $5,839 million. Subtracting this from the present value of net minimum lease payments gives the total long-term capital lease obligations of $8,438 million, as shown in image3.\n\nFor finance lease obligations, the gross finance lease obligations as of December 31, 2017, were $6,265 million. Imputed interest of $1,238 million was subtracted, resulting in a present value of net minimum lease payments of $5,027 million. The current portion of finance lease obligations was $282 million. Subtracting this from the present value of net minimum lease payments yields the total long-term finance lease obligations of $4,745 million, as illustrated in image4.\n\nThese figures are also reflected in the long-term liabilities table for December 31, 2017, which includes long-term capital lease obligations of $8,438 million and long-term finance lease obligations of $4,745 million, as described in image1.\n\n![Total long-term capital lease obligations of $8,438 million and long-term finance lease obligations of $4,745 million](image1)  \n![Gross capital lease obligations of $14,811 million with a present value of net minimum lease payments of $14,277 million and a current portion of $5,839 million](image3)  \n![Gross finance lease obligations of $6,265 million with a present value of net minimum lease payments of $5,027 million and a current portion of $282 million](image4)\n\nThe total long-term capital and finance lease obligations for December 31, 2017, are therefore composed of $8,438 million in long-term capital lease obligations and $4,745 million in long-term finance lease obligations."}

From the provided text and image quotes, we can infer how these figures have evolved from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its subsidiaries, with noncontrolling interests reported as a separate component of equity [1]. This is further reflected in the table described in image4, which outlines various equity components such as common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), retained earnings, total Costco stockholders’ equity, and noncontrolling interests. These categories provide a detailed breakdown of changes in equity over time.\n\nLooking at the data in image5, which presents financial figures for August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, we see that the sections likely represent different parts of the balance sheet or comprehensive income statement. For instance, the \"Total Costco Stockholders’ Equity\" and \"Noncontrolling Interests\" would be included in these sections, though specific values are not explicitly labeled in the description. However, the overall totals for each date—$43,519 million for 2022 and $41,190 million for 2021—suggest an increase in total equity during this period.\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides a detailed breakdown of financial metrics across three fiscal years, including figures that could relate to net income, comprehensive income, and adjustments affecting equity. The increase in final totals from $4,002 million in 2020 to $5,844 million in 2022 indicates growth in comprehensive income, which would directly impact both stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests. This growth may stem from higher net income, adjustments related to foreign-currency translation, or other comprehensive income items [5].\n\nFinally, image1 describes a table showing financial data for three dates, which likely includes changes in equity components such as retained earnings and noncontrolling interests. While the exact figures are not specified, the context implies that these components have evolved alongside the company’s performance and strategic decisions, such as repurchasing shares or declaring dividends.\n\nIn summary, Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests increased from 2021 to 2022, as reflected in the comprehensive income statements and balance sheets, indicating positive performance and changes in ownership structure. ![Increase in equity and noncontrolling interests](image5)"}

This increase was primarily driven by higher credit risk RWA due to factors such as derivatives exposure, investment securities, and lending commitments [9]. In contrast, under the **Advanced Approach**, RWA rose from $382,496 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020 [5], with similar drivers affecting credit risk RWA, though operational risk RWA decreased slightly due to lower litigation-related losses [2].\n\nIn terms of **capital**, the **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital** increased from $64,751 million in 2019 to $78,650 million in 2020 under both approaches [5]. This growth was largely attributed to retained earnings and the impact of the E*TRADE acquisition [5].

Additionally, the text mentions that as of March 31, 2020, 99.97% of the company’s equity share capital was dematerialized [9]. This context is important for understanding how shareholding data is recorded and reported.\n\nLooking at the shareholding data for promoters, image4 and image5 show that Tata Sons Private Limited, as the promoter, held 2,702,450,947 shares (or 72.0% of total shares) at the beginning of the fiscal year [image4]. By the end of the year, there was no change in the number or percentage of shares held by the promoters [image5].

The total public shareholding remained steady at 28% throughout the year. However, there were slight changes in the composition of public shareholders. For instance, individual shareholders experienced a decrease of 0.2%, while clearing members saw an increase of 0.1%. Image2 further supports this by showing the public shareholding split into institutional and non-institutional categories. Institutions like mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign portfolio investors maintained relatively stable percentages, with minor increases or decreases of less than 0.1%.\n\nDespite these small fluctuations in the composition of public shareholders, the overall public shareholding percentage remained unchanged at 28% during the fiscal year 2019-2020.\n\n![Promoters' shareholding remained stable at 72.0%](image3)\n![Public shareholding remained stable at 28%](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the shareholding pattern of promoters remained unchanged at 72.0% of the total shares, while public shareholders maintained a consistent 28% shareholding throughout the fiscal year 2019-2020."}

For 2021, the Upstream segment reported earnings of $15,818 million [5], whereas the Downstream segment reported earnings of $2,914 million [5]. In contrast, for 2020, the Upstream segment had a loss of $(2,433) million [5], while the Downstream segment showed a much smaller loss of $(47) million [5]. This highlights the volatility of the Downstream segment, which is more sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil prices and refining margins, as noted in [4].\n\nRegarding **asset values**, the Upstream segment held significantly larger assets than the Downstream segment in both 2021 and 2020. According to image2, the total assets for the Upstream segment were $184,412 million in 2021 and $191,309 million in 2020. In comparison, the Downstream segment's total assets were $45,224 million in 2021 and $39,586 million in 2020.

This indicates that the company’s exposure to market fluctuations was significant in 2020 compared to 2019, where the figure was DKK 734 million. The increase suggests greater use of derivatives for hedging purposes or risk management in 2020.\n\nIn terms of cash flow changes, image5 provides insight into working capital adjustments across the two years. The change in working capital, including exchange rate adjustments, was DKK (4,353) million in 2020 and DKK (3,388) million in 2019. This negative change reflects a decrease in cash flow from operating activities due to factors such as increases in trade receivables and other receivables and prepayments, which tie up more cash in the business [10]. The decline in working capital negatively impacted cash flow from operations, particularly in 2020, where the outflow was more pronounced than in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, image3 shows that reversals of non-cash income statement items, such as share-based payment costs and provisions, were significantly higher in 2020 (DKK 7,849 million) compared to 2019 (DKK 7,032 million). These adjustments are essential for converting accrual-based income statements to a cash basis, thereby revealing the true cash flow generated by the company [6].\n\nIn summary, the increase in derivative financial instruments in 2020, along with larger working capital adjustments and non-cash item reversals, had a notable effect on the company’s financial statements. These elements influenced both the income statement through gains and losses on derivatives and the cash flow statement by affecting the net cash flow from operations [10].\n\n![Derivative financial instruments for 2020 and 2019](image1)  \n![Cash flow changes related to working capital for 2020 and 2019](image5)  \n\nThe derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes in 2020 had a more significant impact on the company's financial statements compared to 2019, reflecting increased exposure to market risks and larger working capital adjustments."}

This decrease was partly due to leveraging increased sales, wage increases starting in October 2021, and additional wage increases in March 2022 and July 2022. Additionally, there was a positive impact from ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, although this was partially offset by higher write-offs of certain information technology assets and expenses related to granting employees an additional day of paid time off. Changes in foreign currencies also decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $\\S\\,148$ compared to 2021. While the exact figures for 2020 are not explicitly mentioned in the text, image [4] might provide some insight into financial metrics over these years. In image [4], for 2020, the dollar amount is $\\S3,541$ with a percentage of $6\\%$, and for 2022, it's $\\S4,224$ with a percentage of $9\\%$. These could potentially represent SG&A expenses or similar metrics. \n\nRegarding Interest Income and Other, Net, text quote [3] mentions that the increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates. However, specific figures for interest income and other net income for the years 2020 to 2022 are not directly provided in the text. Image [1] provides data for three years, with values of $\\S19,779$ (8.88%), $\\S18,537$ (9.65%), and $\\S16,387$ (10.04%). These could be related to interest income or other financial metrics. If we assume these figures relate to interest income and other net income, then there appears to be a decreasing trend in both the dollar amounts and percentages from 2020 to 2022, which contrasts with the increase in interest income noted in the text for 2022.\n\nIn summary, while SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 2021 to 2022, the specific trend from 2020 to 2022 requires more detailed data. Similarly, interest income and other net income showed a potential decline based on the data in image [1], despite the text noting an increase in interest income in 2022 due to higher global interest rates.\n\n![SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 77 basis points compared to 2021](image7)\n\n![The table shows financial data for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, with values decreasing from 2020 to 2022](image1)"}

Additionally, the interest expenses on financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss also rose from €128 million in 2020 to €94 million in 2021, although this may be influenced by hedging activities and other financial arrangements [2].\n\nLooking at the image data, **image4** provides a clear comparison of total financial debt between fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

This growth in net income directly contributed to an increase in retained earnings, a key component of shareholders’ equity.\n\nIn addition to net income, **other comprehensive income (OCI)** also played a role in shaping overall comprehensive income. The OCI components included foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. For instance, in 2020, foreign currency translation added $197,696 to OCI, while in 2019 it resulted in a loss of $(132,707) and in 2018 it was a loss of $(305,225). Similarly, the defined benefit plans showed fluctuations, with gains in 2020 ($57,100) and losses in 2019 ($(253,039)) and 2018 ($(21,335)) [image1].\n\nThe total **comprehensive income** for Accenture was $3,730,974 in 2018, $4,575,086 in 2019, and $5,472,296 in 2020 [image1]. This reflects not only the growth in net income but also the cumulative impact of OCI components on equity. These increases in comprehensive income were reflected in the **total shareholders’ equity**, which grew from $3,578,520 in 2018 to $5,386,579 in 2020, as reported in the consolidated statements [image1].\n\nChanges in shareholders' equity were also influenced by activities such as share repurchases, dividends, and share-based compensation. For example, the purchase of Class A shares led to a decrease in equity, while the cancellation of treasury shares had a positive effect on retained earnings [image5]. Additionally, the company declared dividends in 2020, which reduced equity by $2,112,457 [5].\n\n![Comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher net income and fluctuating other comprehensive income components.](image1)\n\n![Shareholders' equity was impacted by net income, comprehensive income, share repurchases, and dividend payouts over the years.](image5)"}

This increase was primarily driven by higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, particularly under retroactive reinsurance contracts, as well as an increase in notes payable and other borrowings within the \"Insurance and Other\" segment. These liability increases reflect the growing obligations of Berkshire’s insurance operations, especially given the significant exposure in the form of claim liabilities, which stood at approximately **$\\S125$** billion as of December 31, 2021, with **$80\\%$** related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group [8].\n\nOn the equity side, shareholders’ equity increased significantly, rising from **$\\S506.2$** billion in 2020 to a higher figure in 2021, although the exact value is not explicitly stated in the text quotes. However, we know that net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was **$\\S89.8$** billion in 2021 [2], which would have contributed directly to the growth in shareholders’ equity. Additionally, comprehensive income for 2021 was **$\\S91,041$** million, or **$\\S91.041$** billion, which includes not only net earnings but also other comprehensive income items such as unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities, foreign currency translation, and defined benefit pension plans [image3]. This indicates that the overall financial performance of Berkshire was robust, with gains on investments and other non-operational items contributing to the equity base.\n\nNet earnings in 2021 were **$\\S90.807$** billion, a significant increase compared to **$\\S43.253$** billion in 2020 [image3]. This jump in net earnings aligns with the substantial after-tax gains on investments recorded in 2021, which totaled approximately **$\\S61.6$** billion [2]. The increase in comprehensive income also reflects the volatility in investment gains and losses due to market price changes in equity securities over the last three years [2]. This volatility is consistent with Berkshire's heavy reliance on investment income, particularly through its vast portfolio of equity securities, which amounted to **$\\S350.719$** billion in 2021 [image1].\n\n![Total liabilities increased from $\\S422.393$ billion in 2020 to $\\S443.854$ billion in 2021](image4)  \n![Comprehensive income rose to $\\S91.041$ billion in 2021, driven by net earnings and other comprehensive income items](image3)\n\nIn summary, while total liabilities increased slightly from 2020 to 2021, this was offset by a substantial rise in shareholders’ equity, largely due to strong net earnings and comprehensive income. The financial strength of Berkshire’s operations, combined with its impressive investment returns, allowed it to manage its liabilities effectively while building capital reserves."}

The company emphasizes **stability, growth, and efficiency** as the three pillars of its financial strategy [7], which underpin its long-term vision for sustainable growth. This includes maintaining a stable payout ratio while reinvesting retained earnings into next-generation technologies such as environmental technologies aimed at achieving a carbon-neutral society [10]. These investments align with Toyota's broader commitment to addressing climate change through initiatives like the **Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050**, which involves adopting new technologies and responding to stricter regulations [1].\n\nIn line with this, Toyota has engaged in **scenario analysis** based on different climate change projections, including the **below 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios**, to evaluate potential impacts on its business and identify opportunities for growth [5]. For instance, under these scenarios, the percentage of **electrified vehicles** is expected to rise significantly, prompting Toyota to invest in battery technology and reduce CO2 emissions [4]. This not only supports its environmental goals but also enhances its competitiveness by capitalizing on emerging market trends.\n\nThe company’s financial performance and shareholder returns are closely monitored through metrics such as **consolidated operating income** and the **volatility of its share price**, both of which contribute to evaluating corporate value [3]. Additionally, Toyota ensures that its dividend payments remain stable and that it maintains a consolidated payout ratio of around **30%** [10]. Over the years, the **total shareholder return (TSR)** has fluctuated, reflecting both dividend distributions and share repurchases [image5]. These actions aim to balance short-term shareholder returns with long-term investment in technologies like electrification, which are crucial for navigating climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nMoreover, Toyota actively engages with shareholders and other stakeholders to promote sustainable growth and improve corporate value [3]. It adheres to international standards such as the **TCFD recommendations**, disclosing information on climate-related risks and opportunities [9].

This increase indicates a rise in the overall expenses related to the usage and potential write-downs of assets over the period.\n\nLooking at specific asset categories, intangible assets not yet being amortised were valued at DKK 9,607 million in 2020, primarily consisting of patents and licences related to research and development projects [4]. These assets are tested annually for impairment, regardless of whether there are signs of impairment, and the testing is based on management's projections of future cash flows and the expected life of products [9].

Specifically, premiums written increased by $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, driven largely by a contract covering U.S. health insurance risks and volume growth in Asia and Europe. However, in 2021, premiums written decreased by $227 million (3.9%) compared to 2020, partly due to the non-renewal of a U.S. health risk contract. Despite this, premiums written in 2021 still showed an increase of 9.4% in other regions, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Image3 also shows that **premiums earned** in 2021 were $5,648 million, slightly higher than 2020's $5,861 million, but significantly higher than 2019's $4,869 million. This suggests that while there was some volatility in the year-over-year changes for premiums written, the overall trend in premiums earned remained upward from 2019 to 2021.\n\nTurning to **net investment income**, the data from text quote [6] and image2 show a clear downward trend. Interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and by $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, which were impacted by persistently low interest rates over the period. Image2 further supports this by showing that **pre-tax net investment income** dropped from $6,600 million in 2019 to $5,949 million in 2020 and then to $5,649 million in 2021, representing a cumulative decline of approximately 9.9% from 2019 to 2020 and another 5.0% from 2020 to 2021.

One notable type is **N-reach brand ads**, which likely refer to broad-reaching brand awareness campaigns designed to maximize visibility across the platform [1]. Additionally, Bilibili provides **customized and innovative native ads**, which are seamlessly integrated into user content, ensuring a more organic and engaging experience for viewers [3]. Another unique offering is **performance-based ads with sales conversion add-ons**, where advertisers pay based on specific actions taken by users, such as purchases or sign-ups [6]. These ad formats reflect Bilibili's strategic focus on innovation and effectiveness in advertising, making it an attractive platform for advertisers [9].\n\nIn terms of revenue trends, Bilibili’s advertising revenue has shown **robust growth with great potential** [5]. This is supported by financial data that illustrates a clear upward trajectory over recent quarters. Specifically, the advertising revenue increased significantly from **RMB 1,041 million in 22Q1 to RMB 1,512 million in 22Q4**, before slightly declining to **RMB 1,272 million in 23Q1**. Despite this minor dip in the most recent quarter, the year-over-year increase remains strong at **22%** [image1].

This increase can be attributed to the company's continued expansion, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which contributed to the growth in revenues [10]. Additionally, the geographic distribution of revenue highlights that the Americas accounted for approximately 96% of total revenue during both fiscal years, with no other region contributing more than 10% [7].\n\nRegarding unearned revenue, the end-of-period balance rose from $8,564 million in fiscal year 2019 to $10,662 million in fiscal year 2020 [4]. This increase is influenced by several factors, such as seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, and the timing of invoicing [9]. The change in unearned revenue is also impacted by the contributions from business combinations, such as the acquisition of Tableau, which added $433 million to the unearned revenue in 2020 [6].\n\n![Unearned revenue increased from $8,564 million in 2019 to $10,662 million in 2020](image4)\n\nThese changes imply that the company has experienced substantial growth in its operations and customer base. The rise in total revenue suggests that the company is effectively leveraging its existing contracts and new acquisitions to drive revenue growth. However, the increase in unearned revenue indicates that a significant portion of the company's future revenue is already recognized in advance, which may affect its short-term liquidity and cash flow. \n\nIn summary, the total revenue increased from $13,282 million in fiscal year 2019 to $17,098 million in fiscal year 2020, while unearned revenue increased from $8,564 million to $10,662 million over the same period."}

According to the data provided in image1, the total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 in 2021 to $4,091 in 2022. This decline can be attributed to several categories, including a decrease in loss and other carryforwards, which dropped from $1,030 in 2021 to $914 in 2022, and a reduction in pension and other retiree benefits, which fell from $1,476 in 2021 to $740 in 2022.

The net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by receivables of $4.8 billion, although this was partially offset by performance-related declines within net income [6]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief under the U.S. CARES Act and other government assistance programs contributed positively to cash flow [10].\n\nOn the other hand, net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly by $23.9 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32.3 billion, which was attributed to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year [9]. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables of $6.2 billion, mainly driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations [9].\n\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9.721 billion in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9.042 billion in 2019 [8]. These changes in cash flow activities had a cumulative effect on IBM’s overall liquidity.\n\n![Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 and 2019](image2)\n\nThe net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5.361 billion, representing a substantial improvement compared to a net decrease of $3.290 billion in 2019. This indicates that despite the challenges posed by the global economic environment, IBM managed to improve its liquidity position in 2020 through effective management of its operating and investing activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial adjustments and cash flow activities in 2020 resulted in a net increase of $5.361 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, compared to a net decrease of $3.290 billion in 2019."}

The total revenues for the year 2020 were **$19,208 million**, representing a **10% decrease** compared to 2019 [5]. This decline was primarily driven by a significant drop in sales across the International Operated Markets segment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [1]. Additionally, while the U.S. saw positive sales performance, it was not enough to offset the losses in other regions [9].\n\nIn terms of restaurant margins, the data from image1 illustrates that franchised margins decreased from **$9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020**, while company-operated margins fell from **$1,660 million in 2019 to $1,158 million in 2020**. This resulted in a **total restaurant margin decline of $1,452 million in 2020**, with a **13% decrease** compared to 2019 [8]. The drop in company-operated margins was exacerbated by incremental expenses related to the pandemic, including employee-related costs, personal protective equipment, signage, and other restaurant costs [10].\n\nFurthermore, the increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses also played a role in the decline of restaurant margins. In 2020, SG&A expenses rose by **14%** compared to 2019, partly due to the Company’s investments in marketing initiatives aimed at accelerating recovery and driving growth, such as the free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers [3]. These efforts, while beneficial for long-term growth, added pressure on short-term margins.\n\n![Total revenues decreased by 10% in 2020 compared to 2019](image5)\n![Restaurant margins declined significantly in 2020 compared to previous years](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the main contributing factors to the decline in total revenues and restaurant margins from 2019 to 2020 were the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales, especially in the International Operated Markets, increased SG&A expenses, and higher depreciation and amortization costs."}

Additionally, a graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated revenue made by these segments [3], while another graph highlights the contributions to the change in consolidated operating costs and expenses [5].\n\nLooking at image3, which provides a detailed breakdown of revenue for each segment over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, we see that:\n\n- **Cable Communications** saw a modest increase in revenue, with a 0.7% growth from 2020 to 2021.\n- **NBCUniversal** experienced a more significant rise, with a 6.9% increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021.\n- **Sky** showed the most substantial growth, rising by 11.4% from 2020 to 2021.\n- **Corporate and Other** had an unusual fluctuation, showing a drastic drop from 2019 to 2020, but this is not considered meaningful due to the small absolute values involved.\n\nFurthermore, image5 presents a waterfall chart that visually represents the changes in revenue from 2020 to 2021. The base value for 2020 was $72,971 million, and the final value for 2021 reached $81,764 million. The primary contributors to this increase were:\n\n- **Cable Communications**, contributing an increase of $1,450 million.\n- **NBCUniversal**, contributing a significant increase of $6,788 million.\n- **Sky**, contributing an increase of $1,285 million.\n\nHowever, there was a slight decrease of $730 million attributed to **Corporate and Other, Adjustments and Eliminations**.\n\nIn terms of operating expenses, image2 provides insights into the overall financial performance, showing that revenue increased from $60.1 billion in 2020 to $64.3 billion in 2021, while adjusted EBITDA also rose from $25.3 billion to $28.1 billion. This indicates that the company managed to grow revenue while maintaining or improving its profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, the main contributors to the change in Comcast’s consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021 were the **NBCUniversal** and **Sky** segments, which showed the most significant growth, while **Cable Communications** contributed a smaller but positive increase.

These changes are closely tied to broader economic conditions, including the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and internal adjustments in revenue allocation.\n\nFrom the data provided, the **Corporate Centre** experienced a significant improvement in its net operating income. In 2019, the net operating income was $(654) million, but by 2020, it had increased to $(262) million, representing a **60% increase** [4]. This improvement is attributed to several factors, including the reallocation of certain funding costs from the Corporate Centre to global businesses starting from 1 January 2020 [10], as well as adjustments in revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings debt, and hyperinflation in Argentina [10]. Additionally, the Corporate Centre's results now primarily consist of the share of profit from associates and joint ventures, Central Treasury revenue, stewardship costs, and consolidation adjustments [2].\n\nIn contrast, the **Global Banking and Markets segments**, which include categories such as Global Markets, FICC, Equities, Securities Services, and others, showed mixed results. For example, the **Global Markets** segment reported a **27% increase** in total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, reaching $7,290 million [image1]. Similarly, the FICC segment saw a **33% increase**, driven largely by strong performances in Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit [image1]. However, not all segments within Global Banking and Markets performed positively; for instance, **Securities Services** experienced a **12% decrease** in revenue, while **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** saw a **26% decrease** [image1].\n\nDespite these variations, the overall **profit before tax** for HSBC Holdings increased significantly from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, marking a **42% increase** [4]. This growth reflects the combined effects of improved net operating income and better performance in key revenue-generating segments, despite challenges posed by the pandemic and the resulting economic downturn [1][5].\n\n![Net operating income improved significantly in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)  \n![Profit before tax increased by 42% from 2019 to 2020](image4)\n\nIn summary, the **Corporate Centre** saw a substantial improvement in net operating income due to internal restructuring and revenue reallocations, while the **Global Banking and Markets segments** exhibited a more complex pattern of performance, with some areas showing robust growth and others experiencing declines.

This indicates that although the VIEs remained the primary source of revenue, there was a marginal decline in their contribution to the company's overall revenue in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nRegarding total assets, as of December 31, 2020, the total assets of the VIEs equaled **26.5%** of the company’s consolidated total assets. By December 31, 2021, this figure increased slightly to **26.9%** [6].

In 2020, the total stock-based expense was $558 million, which decreased to $540 million in 2021 and further dropped to $528 million in 2022. This trend can be attributed to the company’s management of its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance stock units (PSUs). The expenses for RSUs and PSUs were particularly high in 2020 at $309 million but gradually declined to $257 million in 2022 [3]. These changes suggest that P&G may have adjusted the number or value of awards granted during this time [8].\n\nIn parallel, P&G's net earnings and EPS have also evolved significantly. Net earnings attributable to P&G increased from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,306 million in 2021 and further rose to $14,742 million in 2022 [4]. This upward trajectory is reflected in both basic and diluted EPS figures. Basic EPS grew from $5.13 in 2020 to $5.69 in 2021 and reached $6.00 in 2022. Diluted EPS followed a similar pattern, rising from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021 and reaching $5.81 in 2022 [4]. The increase in EPS can be partly attributed to a reduction in shares outstanding and the impact of lower taxes and interest expenses [7].\n\nMoreover, the company's approach to managing stock-based compensation aligns with its overall strategy of balancing employee incentives with financial prudence. For instance, while the company does not have a specific policy to repurchase shares to mitigate dilution, it has historically made discretionary purchases based on cash availability and market conditions [10]. Additionally, the fair value of stock options is calculated using an industry-standard lattice-based valuation model, ensuring that compensation expenses are aligned with market expectations [5].\n\n![The table shows stock-based expenses and income tax benefits for the years ended June 30 for 2022, 2021, and 2020](image3)\n\n![The table displays financial data for Procter & Gamble (P&G) for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020](image4)\n\nIn summary, the changes in stock-based compensation expenses and net earnings per share from 2020 to 2022 reflect P&G’s evolving financial performance and strategic management of compensation programs."}

Comprehensive income includes not only net income but also other comprehensive income (OCI) items, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, and pension-related adjustments.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the company experienced fluctuations in its comprehensive income due to variations in net income and OCI components. For example, in 2019, the company reported a net income of $6,759 million [5], with an OCI that included net unrealized debt securities gains of $41 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(56) million, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits of $(125) million. This resulted in a total comprehensive income of $6,619 million [5].\n\nIn 2020, the net income decreased to $3,135 million [5], while OCI was impacted by a net unrealized debt securities gain of $32 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(40) million, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits of $(150) million. These factors contributed to a total comprehensive income of $2,977 million [5].\n\nBy 2021, the company saw a significant increase in net income to $8,060 million [5]. However, OCI was negatively affected by a net unrealized debt securities loss of $(42) million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(163) million, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits of $155 million. Despite these negative OCI components, the overall comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million [5].\n\nThese changes in comprehensive income directly influenced the shareholders’ equity, which is reflected in the balance sheets. For instance, retained earnings, a component of shareholders’ equity, increased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021 [2], primarily due to the large net income in 2021, despite a decrease in retained earnings from 2019 to 2020 [3]. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) showed a decline from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021 [2], indicating the impact of OCI adjustments on shareholders' equity.\n\n![Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) affecting shareholders' equity](image2)"}

This includes considerations of portfolio impacts, demand for commodities, decarbonisation costs, and Scope 3 emissions [7].\n\n![Climate change is a material governance and strategic issue, routinely on the Board agenda, including as part of strategy discussions, risk management oversight, and performance against commitments.](image3)\n\nIn terms of director training in FY2021, BHP implemented a range of briefings and development sessions aimed at enhancing Directors’ understanding of the Group’s activities, environment, and key issues. These sessions included strategy days with the Executive Leadership Team, presentations from external experts, and focused sessions on climate change and innovation [5]. Furthermore, site visits were conducted—either physically or virtually—to provide Directors with firsthand insights into operations and key personnel, ensuring they remain informed about the operational landscape [5].\n\n![Briefings and development sessions provided Directors with deeper understanding of the assets, HSEC considerations, and public policy issues, including climate change sessions.](image5)\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that BHP’s directors are well-equipped to address both climate-related risks and the evolving strategic landscape of the company."}

However, the external gross profit margin decreased by 1.0 percentage point, from 78.1% in 2018 to 77.1% in 2019. This decline in margin was primarily attributed to the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, as well as ongoing investments in strategic areas like cloud and AI [4]. The pre-tax income for this segment fell significantly by 12.4%, dropping from $8,914 million in 2018 to $7,811 million in 2019, with a pre-tax margin decline of 5.2 percentage points, from 35.6% to 30.4% [1]. This decrease in pre-tax income was driven by revenue declines in Transaction Processing Platforms and continued investment in strategic areas, along with higher workforce rebalancing charges [7].\n\n![Cloud & Cognitive Software external gross profit and pre-tax income for 2018 and 2019](image1)\n\nFor **Global Business Services (GBS)**, the external gross profit increased by 3.0%, rising from $4,519 million in 2018 to $4,655 million in 2019. The external gross profit margin also improved slightly, increasing by 0.8 percentage points from 26.9% in 2018 to 27.7% in 2019. This improvement was driven by a mix shift toward higher-value offerings, delivery productivity improvements, and benefits from the global delivery resource model [8]. In terms of pre-tax income, GBS saw a modest increase of 1.3%, rising from $1,602 million in 2018 to $1,623 million in 2019, with a slight improvement in pre-tax margin from 9.4% to 9.5% [5].\n\n![Global Business Services external gross profit and pre-tax income for 2018 and 2019](image5)\n\nIn summary, while **Cloud & Cognitive Software** experienced growth in external gross profit but a decline in pre-tax income, **Global Business Services** showed both an increase in external gross profit and a slight rise in pre-tax income from 2018 to 2019."}

Let's explore these changes and their potential reasons.\n\nIn terms of **operating income**, the company reported a net income of $556 million for 2020 compared to $546 million in 2019 [1]. This slight increase in net income suggests that the company’s core operations remained relatively stable or improved slightly during this period. However, it is important to note that total revenue decreased by $22 million in 2020 compared to 2019 [9], primarily due to declines in transportation services revenue, allowance oil revenue, and product revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in terminaling services revenue and lease revenue. The decrease in transportation services revenue was attributed to the ongoing effects of the **COVID-19 pandemic** on the crude and refined products operating environment, as well as lower rates on committed contracts in 2020 compared to 2019 [10].\n\nDespite the drop in certain revenue streams, the company managed to maintain or slightly improve its net income, which could be attributed to cost management and operational efficiencies. For instance, interest income increased by $19 million mainly due to interest income related to financing receivables recorded in connection with the Norco Assets [6]. Additionally, the company had no contributions to investment in 2020, which may have helped preserve cash flow [3].\n\nRegarding **cash from investing activities**, the company reported **net cash provided by investing activities of $64 million in 2020**, compared to **($87) million in 2019** [5]. This indicates a significant improvement in the company’s cash flows from investing activities. The change can be attributed to the **completion of capital projects** such as the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco, which reduced capital expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019 [3]. In 2019, the company incurred higher capital expenditures, which likely contributed to the negative cash flow from investing activities. The reduction in capital spending allowed the company to generate positive cash flows from investing activities in 2020.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income for 2020 and 2019](image1)  \n![Changes in equity components over several years](image2)\n\nIn summary, while Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. faced challenges in certain revenue areas due to external factors like the **COVID-19 pandemic**, it managed to maintain or slightly improve its net income through cost control and strategic financial decisions. The improvement in cash from investing activities was largely due to the **reduction in capital expenditures** following the completion of key projects."}

This was reflected in the underlying EBITDA, which rose by US\\$11.7 billion to US\\$26.3 billion, despite some unfavourable foreign exchange impacts and other costs [1]. Additionally, WAIO production reached a record 252 Mt (284 Mt on a 100% basis), supported by strong operational performance across the supply chain [2].\n\nFor Escondida, revenue surged from US\\$6,719 million in FY2020 to US\\$9,470 million in FY2021, with underlying EBITDA increasing from US\\$3,535 million to US\\$6,483 million [5].

This increase was primarily driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year [1].

According to the data, changes in financial assumptions had a negative impact on actuarial results, with a loss of €26 million in 2021 compared to a gain of €72 million in 2020. This shift indicates a deterioration in the financial assumptions used during the 2021 reporting period, which likely reflects changes in market conditions or investment returns.\n\n![Changes in financial assumptions led to a loss of €26 million in 2021, contrasting with a gain of €72 million in 2020](image5)\n\nDiscount rates also play a crucial role in determining the defined benefit obligation, as noted in the text: \"Net interest is thus calculated by multiplying the discount rate for the respective fiscal year by the net defined benefit asset or liability from defined benefit plans\" [5].

Let’s explore these changes in detail.\n\nIn terms of **foreign income before taxes**, the data from image4 indicates that the foreign income increased from $439 million in 2019 to $715 million in 2020 and further to $1,493 million in 2021. This represents a substantial growth in foreign earnings over the three-year period. This increase may be attributed to various factors such as market expansion, improved operational performance in foreign jurisdictions, or favorable currency movements.\n\nRegarding the **foreign tax provision**, image3 provides detailed insights. In 2019, the current provision for foreign taxes was ($407) million, indicating a benefit (or reduction in tax expense). By 2020, this shifted to $526 million, showing an increase in tax expenses. In 2021, the foreign tax provision rose further to $518 million. This trend reflects a growing tax burden on foreign operations, likely due to higher taxable income, changes in tax rates, or adjustments in tax strategies.\n\nMoreover, text quote [10] highlights that the company has been actively pursuing refunds of Korean withholding taxes, which could impact its effective tax rate and overall tax provisions. The expected refund of Korean withholding taxes previously paid is noted to have an insignificant impact on the income tax provision, but it underscores the company’s ongoing efforts to optimize its tax position.\n\n![Foreign income before taxes increased significantly from 2019 to 2021](image4)\n![Foreign tax provision showed an upward trend from 2019 to 2021](image3)\n\nThese changes in foreign tax provisions and foreign income before taxes would influence the company’s financial strategy in several ways. First, the increasing foreign tax burden might lead to a more aggressive pursuit of tax credits, deductions, and incentives in foreign jurisdictions, as seen in text quote [4], where Singapore tax incentives are mentioned. Second, the company may reassess its repatriation strategies, considering the one-time repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018, as described in text quote [3]. Finally, the company might continue to engage in tax planning activities, such as those outlined in text quote [1], to manage its tax liabilities and optimize its effective tax rate.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in foreign income before taxes and the corresponding rise in foreign tax provisions suggest that the company is navigating a more complex international tax landscape, which may prompt strategic adjustments to its global operations and tax planning."}

This included inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion during the year. Additionally, there was a market impact of $11.6 billion. However, the most substantial change occurred due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a reduction of $587.1 billion.

These shifts are reflected in several key areas of the company’s operations and balance sheet.\n\nTotal loans increased from $887,637 million at December 31, 2020, to $895,394 million at December 31, 2021, representing an increase of $7,757 million [4]. This growth was driven primarily by commercial loans, which rose due to higher loan demand and increased originations, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [1]. In contrast, consumer loans decreased as a result of paydowns and the transfer of $\\S17.8$ billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) [1]. The overall increase in total loans reflects a strategic focus on maintaining liquidity and managing interest rate risk through a balanced portfolio approach [8].\n\nIn addition to loan growth, the company also saw changes in its available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities portfolios. The amortized cost of AFS and HTM debt securities increased from December 31, 2020, due to continued purchases and transfers between AFS and HTM categories for capital management purposes [9]. However, net unrealized gains on these securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher interest rates [2]. This suggests that the company adjusted its investment strategies in response to changing market conditions, prioritizing stability and long-term returns over short-term gains [8].\n\nRegarding WFAM AUM, there were significant movements during the same period. At the end of 2021, WFAM assets under management totaled $603.0 billion, reflecting inflows of $69.3 billion, outflows of $96.8 billion, and a market impact of $11.6 billion [5]. Notably, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, resulted in a substantial reduction of $587.1 billion in the end-of-period balance [5]. This decision was part of a broader restructuring effort, where the business was moved from the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to Corporate in early 2021 [6]. The sale likely aimed to streamline operations and focus on core banking activities while reducing complexity and improving efficiency [6].\n\n![WFAM assets under management totaled $603.0 billion at the end of 2021, with a significant reduction due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021.](image5)\n\nThe combined changes in total assets and WFAM AUM reflect a strategic shift toward focusing on core banking operations, optimizing capital allocation, and managing interest rate risk more effectively. By selling non-core businesses like WFAM and adjusting its loan and investment portfolios, Wells Fargo aimed to enhance its financial flexibility and align its operations with evolving market dynamics [6][8].\n\nIn summary, the changes in total assets and WFAM AUM from 2020 to 2021 impacted Wells Fargo’s financial strategy by prompting a refocus on core banking activities, optimizing capital management, and adapting to shifting interest rate environments."}

In 2021, the company used the **Siemens Bio 2017/2021** table, while in 2020, it relied on the **Siemens Bio 2017/2020** table [5]. These tables are based on data from the German Siemens population and the Federal Statistical Office in Germany [5]. Additionally, the discount rate for Germany was **1.7% in 2021** and **1.5% in 2020** [4].\n\nIn contrast, the United States used the **Pri-2012 generational projection** from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions for both 2021 and 2020 [5]. The discount rate for the U.S. was **2.7% in 2021** and **2.4% in 2020** [4], which is notably higher than the German rates.

However, other segments like **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** experienced a decline in revenue by $701 million (26%), which likely had a negative effect on net operating income [5].\n\nThe **adjusted ECL (Expected Credit Losses)** increased significantly in 2020 due to the global impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in the UK and Asia, as well as higher charges against specific customers in sectors such as oil and gas and wholesale trade [4]. This rise in credit losses would have directly affected profit before tax, contributing to a notable decline in this metric.\n\nLooking at specific figures, **net operating income** for the entire entity decreased by $1,852 million (-12%) in 2020 compared to 2019 [1]. However, certain segments showed improvements. For example, **Central Treasury** experienced a modest decline in revenue but still showed an improvement in net operating income of $392 million (60%) compared to 2019 [3]. Similarly, **Legacy portfolios** saw a dramatic improvement, with net operating income increasing by $94 million (85%) [3].\n\nOn the other hand, **profit before tax** declined by $342 million (7%) in 2020 compared to 2019 [2]. This decline was largely attributed to the increase in adjusted ECL and the overall drop in adjusted revenue due to lower global interest rates [7]. Despite these challenges, some areas showed resilience; for example, **Profit before tax** in one segment increased by $387 million (42%) from 2019 to 2020, indicating that not all segments were equally affected [4].\n\n![Net operating income decreased by $1,852 million (-12%) in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)  \n![Profit before tax declined by $342 million (7%) in 2020 compared to 2019](image2)\n\nIn summary, while some segments like Global Markets showed strong growth, others faced declines due to factors such as credit losses and lower interest rates.

This increase was driven by a rise in commercial loans, which grew due to higher demand for commercial and industrial loans, resulting in increased originations and loan draws [1]. However, consumer loans decreased slightly, primarily because of a decline in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan paydowns and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [1]. The distribution of these loans across maturity periods is detailed in Table 11, which shows how different loan categories are structured over time [3].\n\nFor **deposits**, the overall amount increased by 6%, rising from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million [1]. This growth was largely attributed to increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits (up 13%), interest-bearing demand deposits (up 4%), and savings deposits (up 9%) [image1]. However, time deposits declined significantly by 41%, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices dropped by 44% [image1]. These declines may reflect strategic decisions to reduce reliance on high-cost time deposits or to focus on more stable, lower-cost deposit sources [10].\n\n![Deposits increased across several categories but time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits saw significant declines](image1)\n\n![Commercial loans rose significantly while consumer loans decreased slightly](image5)\n\nThese changes suggest that the financial entity is adjusting its strategy to focus more on **commercial lending** and **lower-cost deposit sources**. The increase in commercial loans aligns with a strategy to capitalize on higher loan demand in this sector, while the reduction in time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits indicates an effort to manage **interest rate risk** and **capital efficiency**. Additionally, the shift toward holding more loans for sale may reflect a desire to optimize liquidity and capital usage in response to market conditions [1].\n\nIn summary, the financial entity appears to be shifting its focus toward **commercial lending** and **cost-effective deposit management**, while reducing exposure to **high-cost time deposits** and **non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits**."}

However, by 2020, we need to infer the net income based on available financial data. While direct figures for 2020 are not explicitly stated in the text quotes, we can refer to the **Statements of Income** for 2019 and 2020 provided in image2 and image5.\n\nFrom image2, which includes Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019, we see that Amberjack's net income was not directly listed, but we can reasonably assume it had declined compared to 2018 due to broader economic factors such as the impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which is referenced in text quote [6]. This event could have influenced overall market conditions, potentially leading to reduced revenues or increased expenses for entities like Amberjack and Mars.\n\nSimilarly, for Mars, there is no explicit figure for 2020 in the text or images provided. However, given the general trend observed across many industries during the pandemic—such as reduced consumer spending, supply chain disruptions, and operational challenges—it is reasonable to infer that Mars’ net income may have also declined in 2020 compared to its 2018 performance.\n\nThe changes in net income could be influenced by several factors mentioned in the financial data:\n\n1. **Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**: As noted in text quote [6], the company evaluated whether an impairment indicator existed due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. This suggests that external market conditions likely affected revenue streams and asset valuations.\n   \n2. **Interest rates and borrowing costs**: Text quote [8] indicates that the Five Year Revolver due July 2023 bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin, and this facility was amended in August 2018. The eventual discontinuation of LIBOR (text quote [9]) could have introduced uncertainty into future borrowing costs, possibly impacting profitability for entities reliant on credit facilities.\n\n3. **Capital contributions and expenditures**: In text quote [5], capital contributions to Permian Basin were made in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These investments may have impacted short-term profitability as funds were allocated toward capital expenditures rather than immediate profit generation.\n\n4. **Depreciation and amortization**: Text quote [7] notes depreciation and amortization expenses for property, plant, and equipment in 2020, 2019, and 2018. Increasing depreciation costs over time could have reduced net income, especially if revenue growth did not keep pace with these expenses.\n\nIn summary, while exact figures for 2020 net income for Amberjack and Mars are not provided, it is reasonable to infer that both companies likely experienced a decline in net income from 2018 to 2020 due to the broader economic impacts of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, changes in interest rates and borrowing terms, and increasing depreciation costs. \n\n![Amberjack and Mars' 2018 net income figures are shown in the 2018 income statement](image5)  \n![The 2019 and 2020 income statements provide context for potential changes in net income due to external factors like the pandemic](image2)"}

This fluctuation can be attributed to various factors, including changes in revenue, operating costs, and expenses, as well as adjustments related to legal settlements and other charges.\n\nFor instance, in 2020, there was an adjustment of $177 million related to a legal settlement that was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and segment operating results [3]. This exclusion may have influenced the reported Adjusted EBITDA for that year, making it appear lower than it otherwise would have been. Additionally, the impact of the global pandemic on operations, such as changes in programming costs, direct network costs, and other expenses, played a role in shaping the financial outcomes for each year [4].\n\nThe table provided also highlights specific figures for different segments, showing how revenue and expenses changed over time. For example, revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to market recovery and the impacts of the prior year period [1].

According to the data, interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020 [2]. This decrease was driven by lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, which were heavily impacted by the persistently low interest rates throughout 2020 and into 2021 [2]. Additionally, the decline in interest rates affected after-tax earnings from insurance investment income, contributing to an 8.9% decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 and a further 4.6% decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 [3].\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes as well. For instance, the table in image1 shows that cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This increase suggests that the company maintained a larger portion of its assets in low-risk, short-term instruments like U.S. Treasury Bills, which are more susceptible to interest rate fluctuations [image1]. Meanwhile, equity securities also rose significantly, from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, indicating a shift toward higher-risk, potentially higher-yield investments despite the overall decline in interest income [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the table in image5 highlights the overall decrease in pre-tax net investment income, which dropped from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021, a 5.0% decline [image5]. While dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, this was not enough to offset the substantial drop in interest income. The effective income tax rate also decreased slightly over the period, which may have influenced the net investment income figures.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was largely due to the impact of low interest rates on short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as reflected in both the financial statements and the asset allocation changes."}

In contrast, in 2018, net income was $482 million, with $464 million attributable to the Partnership [image1].\n\nThe increase in net income from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to several factors outlined in the financial reports. First, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by higher equity earnings from additional interests in Explorer, Colonial, and Mattox [1]. Additionally, other income rose by $4 million due to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020 [1]. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14 million, as the accounting treatment for Explorer and Colonial changed from dividend income to equity method investments in 2020 [1].\n\nComprehensive income also saw a similar upward trend, reflecting not only net income but also adjustments for other comprehensive items such as remeasurements of pension and postretirement benefits related to equity method investments.

In 2019, unallocated revenues totaled $4,723 million, which included licensing revenues from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers. This was significantly higher compared to 2020, where unallocated revenues dropped to $1,841 million, primarily due to licensing revenues from the settlement agreement with Huawei signed in July 2020. By 2021, unallocated revenues further declined to just $54 million, indicating a substantial reduction in such one-time or large-scale revenue events.\n\nOn the expense side, unallocated costs also showed fluctuations. Unallocated cost of revenues decreased from $430 million in 2019 to $277 million in 2021. Similarly, unallocated research and development expenses rose from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021, showing an increase in R&D spending not tied to specific segments. Unallocated selling, general, and administrative expenses also increased from $413 million in 2019 to $538 million in 2021. However, unallocated interest expenses slightly decreased from $619 million in 2019 to $559 million in 2021, while unallocated investment and other income, net, remained relatively stable, ranging between $105 million and $243 million across the three years [1].\n\n![Unallocated revenues and expenses for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021](image1)\n\nIn contrast, the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021 resulted in significant net assets acquired.

Liabilities associated with the acquisition amounted to $68 million, resulting in net assets acquired of $1,264 million [4].\n\n![Breakdown of assets and liabilities related to the acquisition of NUVIA](image4)\n\nComparing these figures, the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition ($1,264 million) are much smaller than the peak unallocated revenues in 2019 ($4,723 million). However, the unallocated expenses, particularly in R&D and SG&A, have grown over time, potentially reflecting broader strategic investments that may be linked to future growth, possibly influenced by acquisitions like NUVIA. While the acquisition added tangible and intangible assets to the company’s balance sheet, the fluctuating unallocated revenues and rising unallocated expenses highlight the dynamic nature of the company's financial operations across different periods."}

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities to $10.6 billion compared to $9.6 billion in 2019 [2] was a key driver of improved free cash flow. This improvement was primarily attributed to lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions [2]. As a result, free cash flow increased by 15% to $6.428 billion in 2020 from $5.587 billion in 2019, as illustrated in the table ![Free cash flow increased by 15% in 2020 compared to 2019](image1).\n\nHowever, this growth in free cash flow was accompanied by substantial investing activities. Net cash used for investing activities surged to $11.6 billion in 2020, largely due to acquisitions such as Rockstar ($3.85 billion), Pioneer Foods ($1.2 billion), and Be & Cheery ($0.7 billion), along with net capital spending of $4.2 billion [3]. These investments reflected PepsiCo's strategic focus on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and maintaining its infrastructure.\n\nIn terms of financing activities, PepsiCo returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders in 2020, including dividends and share repurchases totaling $7.5 billion [5]. This was partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt issuances of $13.8 billion. In contrast, in 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, driven mainly by shareholder returns and debt repayments [10].\n\nPepsiCo also faced notable contractual commitments in 2020, which were detailed in a comprehensive table. These included long-term debt obligations of $40.33 billion, operating leases of $1.895 billion, and a one-time mandatory transition tax liability of $3.239 billion under the TCJ Act [image5]. Additionally, interest on debt obligations amounted to $15.988 billion, with significant payments continuing through 2026. Purchasing commitments totaled $2.295 billion, primarily due in the near term, while marketing commitments amounted to $950 million over several years [image5].\n\nCompared to 2019, the increase in free cash flow in 2020 was partly offset by higher capital expenditures and acquisition costs, reflecting PepsiCo's ongoing investment in growth and operational efficiency. Despite these outflows, the company maintained a strong balance between returning value to shareholders and managing its long-term financial obligations.\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo’s financial activities in 2020 led to an increase in free cash flow compared to 2019, but this was accompanied by substantial investing and financing activities, as well as significant contractual commitments."}

However, we can infer from broader financial statements that the overall Group's net operating income increased slightly from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, an increase of $434 million or 3% [3]. This growth was driven by improved performance in certain areas, such as Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), which saw a significant rise in revenue [image4].\n\nRegarding **profit before tax**, the Group's profit before tax decreased from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, a decline of $342 million or 7% [image3]. This decrease was largely attributed to higher expected credit losses and other impairment charges, which rose sharply from $(153) million in 2019 to $(1,209) million in 2020, an increase of over 200% [3]. Additionally, the impact of lower global interest rates and the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the decline in profit before tax.\n\nFor the **Global Banking** segment specifically, revenue decreased by $71 million or 2% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image4]. This was due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [4]. However, capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending showed some growth, partially offsetting these declines.\n\nMeanwhile, the **Global Markets** division saw a significant increase in revenue, with total revenue rising by $1,562 million or 27% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image4]. This improvement was particularly notable in FICC, where revenue increased by $1,541 million or 33%, driven by strong performance in Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit [image4].\n\nTo summarize, while the GBM division faced challenges in Global Banking, such as reduced fee income and losses on restructuring positions, it was partially offset by strong performance in Global Markets, especially in FICC. However, the overall Group's profit before tax declined due to increased credit loss provisions and the adverse economic environment resulting from the pandemic.\n\n![Global Markets revenue increased by 27% in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)  \n![Profit before tax decreased by 7% from 2019 to 2020](image3)  \n\nIn conclusion, the Global Banking and Markets division's net operating income showed a modest increase in 2020, but its profit before tax declined due to higher credit losses and the economic impact of the pandemic."}

These efforts are aligned with the broader Toyota Philosophy of “Producing Happiness for All” [2], which emphasizes the well-being and active engagement of all employees, including women.\n\nIn Japan, Toyota has recognized that gender diversity has been an issue, particularly at Toyota Motor Corporation [3]. To address this, they initiated measures in 2002 to support women balancing work and childcare [4], and by 2012, they began focusing on creating a work environment that encourages women’s motivation and participation, especially in leadership roles [4]. These efforts have continued to evolve, with ongoing initiatives aimed at increasing the percentage of women in hiring, full-time employment, managerial, and director positions [10].\n\nGlobally, Toyota has implemented region-specific strategies to promote gender diversity and female participation. For example, **Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME) in Belgium** engages in International Women’s Day events, offers support for working couples through flexible work arrangements, and provides mentorship and sponsorship systems to foster female career development [image1]. Additionally, TME promotes gender diversity through networking opportunities and sets clear targets for the employment and management positions of women [image1].\n\nIn **China**, **Toyota Motor (China) Investment Co., Ltd. (TMCI)** allows lactating female employees a breastfeeding break of up to one hour each day, demonstrating a commitment to supporting women during critical life stages [image1].\n\nIn **South Africa**, **Toyota South Africa Motors (Pty) Ltd. (TSAM)** conducts leadership workshops to ensure the acceptance and promotion of women in the workplace and sets employment targets to increase their representation [image1].\n\nThese regional initiatives are supported by global data tracking, such as the statistics presented in **image2**, which outlines the percentage of women hired, employed full-time, and holding managerial or director positions across different Toyota locations worldwide. This data highlights both progress and areas for improvement in achieving gender balance.\n\nFurthermore, Toyota continues to refine its approach by emphasizing empathy and passion in recruitment [6], ensuring that diverse candidates are considered for roles based on their abilities rather than other factors like nationality, gender, or academic background [5]. This is part of a broader strategy to build a harmonious society and contribute to the SDGs [7].\n\n![Promoting female employee participation and gender diversity initiatives in Toyota's global operations](image1)\n\n![Global statistics on the percentage of women in various employment categories at Toyota](image2)"}

This indicates a slight decrease of $13 billion in RWA from 2019 to 2020 [8]. In contrast, under the **Advanced Approaches**, the RWA for 2020 was $1,371 billion, compared to $1,447 billion in 2019, representing a more significant decline of $76 billion [8].\n\nThe **TLAC ratios** are also influenced by changes in capital and risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2020, the **TLAC percentage** was 27.4% (based on an amount of $405,153 million), while the **regulatory minimum** for TLAC was 22.0% [image5]. In 2019, the TLAC percentage was 24.6%, which was still above the same regulatory minimum of 22.0% [image5].

For instance, quote [3] outlines a list of items that affect retained earnings, including net income, dividends declared and paid, common stock issued for stock-based awards, stock repurchases, and other comprehensive income (loss). This indicates that net income directly impacts retained earnings, as it is one of the primary components used in calculating retained earnings.\n\nSimilarly, quote [8] and [9] provide details on dividends declared and paid per share in 2020 and 2019 respectively, which are crucial in understanding how much of the net income was distributed to shareholders versus being retained by the company. Additionally, quote [6] highlights that free cash flow was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which would have an impact on retained earnings. Specifically, it mentions that approximately 109% of free cash flow was returned to shareholders in 2020, indicating a high level of dividend payouts and share repurchases, which could reduce retained earnings.\n\nRegarding **retained earnings**, quote [3] shows a structure where net income is adjusted for various items such as dividends, stock-based awards, and other comprehensive income or loss. The bottom row of this table includes \"Balance, December 31, 2018,\" suggesting that this table tracks the change in retained earnings over time. Similarly, quote [8] and [9] show the balance at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively, allowing us to infer the trend in retained earnings.\n\nMoreover, quote [7] discusses items included in the \"Other\" category, such as acquisition charges, restructuring charges, and corporate-level expenses like litigation and insurance settlements. These items, while not part of the operating segments' results, can significantly affect overall net income and, consequently, retained earnings.\n\nIn terms of **significant factors affecting these changes**, several elements stand out:\n\n1. **Dividend Payments**: The company consistently increased its quarterly dividend rate, which directly reduces retained earnings.\n2. **Share Repurchases**: A large portion of free cash flow was used for share repurchases, reducing the number of outstanding shares and impacting retained earnings.\n3. **Stock-Based Awards**: Common stock issued for stock-based awards affects retained earnings due to the issuance of new shares.\n4. **Corporate-Level Expenses**: Items such as acquisition charges and restructuring charges, although not tied to operating segments, influence net income and thus retained earnings.\n5. **Free Cash Flow**: Strong cash generation allowed for high returns to shareholders, but this also implies that less cash was retained within the company.\n\nFinally, while the images do not explicitly mention retained earnings or net income, they contain tables with numerical data that may represent financial figures. For example, `![This table contains a mix of numbers and dashes, with totals in the bottom row: 1,741; 2,110; 39,898; (34,495); and (347).](image1)` suggests a summary of financial data, possibly related to retained earnings or net income. Another image, `![The table contains three columns of numerical data, likely representing monetary amounts with negative values in parentheses.](image2)`, might include figures related to net income or retained earnings over different periods.\n\nIn conclusion, the company’s retained earnings and net income were influenced by consistent dividend payments, share repurchases, stock-based awards, and corporate-level expenses, all of which affected the amount of earnings retained by the company."}

Text quote [10] highlights that the commercial risk market saw a decrease in the number of individuals served due to increased unemployment and related attrition. Specifically, the number of individuals served by United Healthcare Global decreased as a result of increased unemployment and underwriting discipline. In contrast, the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. Similarly, the increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nThese changes were influenced by broader economic factors, including the impact of the pandemic on employment and healthcare access. The temporary deferral of care caused by the pandemic also played a role in altering the demand for services, particularly in fee-for-service arrangements, as noted in text quote [7]. This is further supported by image3, which shows a decrease in the Commercial Risk-based and Fee-based segments while Public and Senior segments like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid showed increases.\n\n![The table shows a decrease in the number of individuals served in the Commercial segments and an increase in the Public and Senior segments from 2019 to 2020.](image3)"}

These assumptions significantly influence the financial obligations and expenses associated with these retirement plans.\n\nFor **Pension Benefits**, the **discount rate** increased from **1.7% in 2021** to **3.7% in 2022**, as shown in image4 [4]. This increase reflects a shift in the yield curve for high-quality bonds, which is used to discount future benefit payments. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of future liabilities, thereby lowering the net obligation. Additionally, the **expected return on plan assets** for Pension Benefits decreased slightly from **6.5% in 2021** to **5.5% in 2022**, as noted in image4 [4].\n\nFor **Other Retiree Benefits**, the **discount rate** rose from **3.2% in 2021** to **5.0% in 2022**, also reflected in image4 [4]. This increase similarly reduces the present value of future health care and other retiree benefits obligations. The **expected return on plan assets** for Other Retiree Benefits remained unchanged at **8.4%** from 2021 to 2022, as indicated in image4 [4].\n\nThese changes in assumptions can have a material impact on the **net amount recognized** in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). For instance, the **net amount recognized** for Pension Benefits decreased from **$(5,428) million in 2021** to **$(2,435) million in 2022**, as illustrated in image5 [5]. This reduction aligns with the higher discount rate, which lowers the liability, and the lower expected return on plan assets, which affects the asset side of the calculation. Similarly, for Other Retiree Benefits, the **net amount recognized** increased from **$2,238 million in 2021** to **$3,819 million in 2022**, as seen in image5 [5], likely due to the combination of a higher discount rate and stable expected returns on assets.\n\n![Discount rates and expected returns changed from 2021 to 2022 for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits, impacting the net amount recognized](image4)  \n![Net amounts recognized for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits show significant changes between 2021 and 2022](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in discount rates and the slight decrease in expected returns on plan assets from 2021 to 2022 had a notable impact on the net amount recognized for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits."}

According to the text quotes, adjusted revenue increased by $\\S0.4\\mathrm{b}\\mathsf{n}$, which included intersegment eliminations related to movements in own shares held by the global businesses, offsetting an equivalent adverse movement in these businesses [7]. Additionally, in Global Markets, total revenue increased by $\\S1,562\\mathsf{m}$ (27%) in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by improved performance in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, as well as strong performance in Rates due to increased trading activity in government bonds [9].\n\nThe image provides further insight into these changes. Specifically, **image4** shows that **Global Markets** revenue in 2020 was $\\S7,290\\mathsf{m}$, representing a significant increase of $\\S1,562\\mathsf{m}$ (27%) compared to 2019. This aligns with the text's mention of increased client activity and wider spreads supporting improved FICC performance [9].\n\nRegarding net operating income, **image1** illustrates that **net operating income** for 2020 was -$262 million, showing an improvement of $392 million (60%) compared to 2019, which was -$654 million. This substantial increase in net operating income can be attributed to various factors, including the allocation of certain funding costs to global businesses starting from January 2020, as well as the overall reduction in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and improvements in operational efficiency [1][5].\n\nMoreover, **image5** highlights that HSBC’s capital position was strong in 2020, with a CET1 ratio of 15.9%, exceeding its risk appetite of ≥13.1%. This financial strength likely supported the company’s ability to manage risks and improve operating income during a challenging year marked by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak [8].\n\nIn conclusion, HSBC's net operating income improved significantly from 2019 to 2020, while adjusted revenue from Global Markets saw a notable increase, driven by stronger performance in FICC and strategic reallocations of costs and resources. These changes were influenced by the broader economic environment, including the effects of the pandemic and adjustments in risk management practices.\n\n![Net operating income improved by $392m (60%) in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)\n![Global Markets revenue increased by $1,562m (27%) in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)\n\nHSBC's net operating income increased by $392 million (60%) from 2019 to 2020, and its adjusted revenue from Global Markets rose by $1,562 million (27%), driven by improved FICC performance and strategic cost allocations."}

However, **Additional Paid-in Capital** saw a significant increase, rising from RMB 35,044 million in 2020 to RMB 36,238 million in 2021, indicating new capital contributions or share issuances during this period [1].\n\nConversely, **Shares Held for Share Award Schemes** experienced a decline, moving from RMB (78) million in 2020 to RMB (183) million in 2021, suggesting an increase in shares allocated for employee compensation schemes [1]. Meanwhile, **Treasury Shares** increased substantially, from RMB (134) million in 2020 to RMB (3,660) million in 2021, which likely reflects the company's purchase of its own shares for treasury purposes [1].\n\n**Other Reserves** decreased from RMB 6,300 million in 2020 to RMB 3,726 million in 2021, possibly due to reclassifications or utilization of reserves for other corporate activities [1]. On the other hand, **Retained Earnings** showed a steady growth, increasing from RMB 11,111 million in 2020 to RMB 14,194 million in 2021, driven by profits retained within the company [1].\n\nThe **Total Equity** declined slightly from RMB 52,731 million in 2020 to RMB 51,055 million in 2021, despite increases in certain equity components, reflecting the net effect of all these transactions [1].\n\nMajor transactions affecting these changes include:\n\n- **Profit for the Year**: This contributed positively to retained earnings, enhancing overall equity.\n- **Fair Value Changes**: Adjustments related to financial assets and shares of other comprehensive losses influenced equity values.\n- **Currency Translation Differences**: Fluctuations in exchange rates affected the value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.\n- **Transactions with Equity Holders**: These included issuance of shares, exercise of options, share-based compensation, and contributions from non-controlling interests, all of which had a direct impact on equity components [1].\n\n![Changes in equity from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

This growth was partially attributed to the operations of Peacock, which generated $778 million in revenue in 2021, up from $118 million in 2020 [1]. However, this growth was not uniform across all segments; for example, the Studios segment saw a $16.2% increase in revenue to $9.4 billion, driven by content licensing and theatrical revenue [1]. Meanwhile, the Theme Parks segment showed a dramatic increase of $141.2% in revenue to $5.1 billion, largely due to the resumption of full operations post-pandemic and the opening of a new park in Beijing [1].\n\nDespite these gains, some areas faced challenges. For instance, the Media segment's Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 18.0% to $4.6 billion, partly due to the high costs associated with broadcasting the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 [1]. Additionally, in certain regions like Italy, revenue was affected by reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which led to declines in both revenue and customer relationships [8].\n\nRegarding **customer relationships**, the data shows a gradual decline over the three-year period. In 2019, there was a net addition of 394 customer relationships, but this dropped to a net loss of 56 in 2020 and further declined to a net loss of 198 in 2021 [image1]. This trend reflects broader industry challenges, including shifting video consumption patterns and increased competition [9].\n\nThe **average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship** also fluctuated during this period. It increased by 8.7% from 2020 to 2021, reaching $59.29, despite a decline in customer relationships in Italy due to reduced broadcast rights [image2]. This suggests that while the number of customers may have decreased, the revenue per customer relationship improved, possibly due to rate increases and changes in service offerings.\n\nFinancially, the company’s **Adjusted EBITDA** showed mixed results. While the overall adjusted EBITDA for the company slightly declined from $220 million in 2020 to $205 million in 2021 [image3], some segments performed better than others. For example, the Theme Parks segment saw a substantial improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, increasing from a loss of $500 million in 2020 to a profit of $1.3 billion in 2021 [1].\n\nIn summary, the combination of revenue growth in key segments, such as Media and Theme Parks, along with improvements in average revenue per customer relationship, helped offset some of the negative impacts of declining customer relationships and regional challenges. These factors collectively shaped NBCUniversal’s financial performance from 2019 to 2021.\n\n![Total customer relationships declined from 2019 to 2021](image1)  \n![Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from 2020 to 2021](image2)  \n![Adjusted EBITDA showed mixed results across different segments](image3)\n\nThe revenue trends and customer relationships had a mixed impact on NBCUniversal’s financial performance from 2019 to 2021, with growth in key segments and improved revenue per customer relationship partially offsetting declines in customer numbers and regional challenges."}

This involves maintaining a balance between experience and new perspectives, considering diversity, skills, and tenure, and preparing pipelines for future roles within the Board and its Committees [image2]. Additionally, the Nomination and Governance Committee identifies suitable Non-executive Director candidates, working closely with search firms to ensure a diverse and qualified pool of applicants [image3].\n\nTo support director development, BHP provides ongoing learning opportunities such as briefings and development sessions, which are tailored to each Director's needs and their specific Committee memberships. These sessions cover critical areas such as environmental, social, and governance matters, along with updates on BHP’s assets, commodities, geographies, and markets [image1]. Furthermore, Non-executive Directors participate in a continuous improvement program, which includes training and development activities overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee [7].\n\nThe eight-step process outlined in image2 further illustrates the structured nature of BHP’s approach to board succession planning and appointments. It begins with defining the role description for new appointments, followed by selecting an external search firm to conduct a global search aligned with the Board’s criteria. Shortlisted candidates are then interviewed by the Chair and the Nomination and Governance Committee, with the latter recommending the preferred candidate. Background checks are conducted before a formal letter of appointment is issued, detailing the terms and expectations for the new Director.\n\nIn summary, BHP ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a combination of structured processes, continuous evaluation, tailored training programs, and collaboration with external partners. ![Board succession planning and director development](image2)"}

This increase was also supported by higher deposit-related fees due to increased treasury management fees from rising transaction volumes and repricing [1].\n\nThe data supports this trend, showing that consumer behavior shifted toward saving rather than spending, which led to an overall increase in deposit balances across the banking sector.\n\n### Summary of Contributing Factors\n\nThe changes in total loans and deposits can be attributed to several key factors:\n- **Economic Uncertainty**: The ongoing effects of the pandemic led to higher liquidity among clients, resulting in more deposits but less borrowing [4][6].\n- **Government Policies**: Stimulus programs and payment deferrals encouraged consumers to save more, increasing deposit balances [6].\n- **Internal Strategies**: Actions such as curtailing certain types of loan originations and focusing on other areas of growth contributed to the shifts in loan balances [8].\n\n![Total loans decreased across multiple lines of business from 2020 to 2021 due to weak demand and higher paydowns.](image4)\n![Total deposits increased from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher liquidity and savings behaviors among consumers.](image6) \n\nIn summary, total loans declined across most lines of business from 2020 to 2021 due to weak demand and higher paydowns, while total deposits increased as a result of heightened liquidity and consumer savings behaviors."}

This increase in Credit Risk RWA means that the institution’s risk-weighted assets grew, which directly impacts the calculation of capital ratios such as the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio and the Total Capital ratio. A larger RWA base can dilute these ratios unless capital is proportionally increased.\n\n![Credit Risk RWA increased in 2020 under both approaches](image2)\n\nSimultaneously, External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of RWA rose from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [5]. While this percentage decreased slightly, it still remained well above the regulatory minimum of 18.0%, indicating that the institution maintained a robust capital buffer relative to its RWA. The increase in External TLAC in absolute terms—from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020—suggests that the institution bolstered its capacity to absorb losses, which is critical for maintaining financial stability amid rising credit risk exposure.\n\n![External TLAC as a % of RWA decreased slightly but remained well above the regulatory minimum](image5)\n\nThese combined effects on Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC highlight the institution’s efforts to balance growing risk exposure with adequate capital buffers. Despite the rise in RWA, the firm’s capital levels, particularly CET1 and Total Capital, also increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, ensuring compliance with regulatory capital requirements and supporting continued operational resilience [3].\n\nIn summary, the increase in Credit Risk RWA was offset by a substantial growth in External TLAC, contributing to a resilient capital structure that met and exceeded regulatory standards."}

This figure is derived from the Statements of Income table for the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes detailed financial performance metrics for various entities, including Amberjack. \n\nFor 2019, while there is no direct line item specifying Amberjack’s net income in the text quotes, we can infer that the financial statements for 2019 include Amberjack's results. Specifically, quote [5] mentions that the financial statements of Amberjack Pipeline Company LLC include balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, along with related income statements for each of the three years ending in 2020. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the net income for Amberjack in 2019 is included in this set of financial statements, although the exact figure is not explicitly stated in the provided text.\n\nTo further support this analysis, image4 provides a visual representation of the Statements of Income for various entities, including Amberjack, for the year ended December 31, 2018.

According to the financial data, impairment charges for 2020 included $3,360,000 related to exiting the Spanish market and an additional $2,757,000 for other store impairments, totaling $6,117,000 [4]. In contrast, there were no impairment charges recorded in 2019 [7]. This indicates a substantial increase in impairment charges in 2020, primarily driven by strategic decisions to exit certain markets and write down assets.\n\n![Impairment charges related to the exit from the Spanish market and other store impairments in 2020](image4)\n\nRegarding **tax expenses**, several key factors influenced the changes between 2019 and 2020. The effective tax rate (ETR) was impacted by various items, including the utilization of carried-forward tax losses and non-deductible expenses. Additionally, the franking percentage of a dividend was reduced to 50% in 2020 due to lower tax payments during the financial year, which would have affected the overall tax expense [2]. The reconciliation of the effective tax rate also highlights adjustments for temporary differences, changes in estimates, and the impact of foreign jurisdictions [3].\n\nIn terms of **deferred tax**, the net deferred tax assets increased significantly from $6,372,000 in 2019 to $9,344,000 in 2020. This reflects changes in temporary differences related to property, plant, and equipment, employee benefits, provisions, and carry forward tax losses [10]. Furthermore, the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses may have contributed to this increase [3].\n\n![Consolidated deferred tax information for 2020 and 2019 showing the increase in net deferred tax assets](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the major changes in tax expenses and impairment charges for Lovisa Holdings between 2019 and 2020 include a significant increase in impairment charges due to the exit from the Spanish market and a notable rise in net deferred tax assets, reflecting changes in temporary differences and the utilization of tax losses."}

These changes can be analyzed through the lens of both textual and visual data.\n\nFrom a textual perspective, the net interest income decreased by $\\S5.5$ billion to $\\S43.4$ billion in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs [1]. This decline is further supported by image4, which shows an overall net decrease in interest income of $\\S19,747$ million from 2019 to 2020, with notable decreases across categories like time deposits and federal funds [image4].\n\nSimilarly, net interest expense also experienced a net decrease of $\\S5,627$ million from 2019 to 2020, largely due to reductions in interest-bearing deposits and loans, as illustrated in image4 [image4]. However, it's worth noting that between 2018 and 2019, there was a net increase in interest income of $\\S4,452$ million and a slight increase in interest expense of $\\S714$ million, indicating a more stable or improving environment during that period.\n\nThese financial changes are closely tied to the organizational structure of Bank of America, as outlined in image2. The Bank operates through five main divisions: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other. Each division plays a role in shaping the bank’s overall financial performance:\n\n- **Consumer Banking** handles deposits and consumer lending, which directly impact net interest income through the management of loan portfolios and deposit rates.\n- **Global Banking** and **Global Markets** manage investment banking and trading activities, influencing interest income from debt securities and other earning assets.\n- **All Other** includes ALM Activities, which are crucial for managing interest rate risk and aligning the bank’s balance sheet with its strategic objectives [image2].\n\nThe decline in net interest income and the associated changes in interest expense reflect the challenges faced by these segments, particularly in the context of low-interest-rate environments. For example, the Consumer Banking segment saw a decrease in net interest income of $\\S3.5$ billion in 2020 compared to 2019, partly due to lower interest rates [8].

Meanwhile, **equity securities** also grew, increasing from **$269,498 thousand in 2020** to **$334,907 thousand in 2021**. On the other hand, **fixed maturity securities** declined from **$20,317 thousand in 2020** to **$16,386 thousand in 2021**, and **other assets** also decreased from **$6,220 thousand in 2020** to **$4,296 thousand in 2021**.\n\n![Insurance business asset composition changed significantly from 2020 to 2021](image1)\n\nThese shifts in asset composition suggest a strategic move toward holding more liquid assets like cash and equity securities while reducing exposure to fixed maturity securities. This may be a response to the low-interest-rate environment, as highlighted in text quote [6], where the company emphasized maintaining liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield in short-term investments.\n\nThe implications of these changes are twofold: first, the decline in interest income likely reduced the overall profitability of the investment portfolio, but the increase in liquidity could enhance financial flexibility. Second, the growth in equity securities may expose the company to greater market volatility, as noted in text quote [9], where unrealized gains and losses on equity securities significantly affect periodic earnings. \n\nIn conclusion, the net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021, and the asset composition shifted toward more liquid and equity-based holdings. These changes reflect a strategy to prioritize liquidity and safety amid a challenging interest rate environment, though they may come with increased exposure to market volatility."}

In 2019, the **Upstream** operations reported earnings of $2,576 million, while the **Downstream** operations contributed $2,481 million, leading to a net income of $2,924 million for the year [1]. However, in 2020, both Upstream and Downstream operations experienced substantial losses, with Upstream reporting a loss of $2,433 million and Downstream posting a loss of only $47 million. This resulted in an overall net loss of $5,543 million for Chevron in 2020 [2].\n\nThe situation improved significantly in 2021. The **Upstream** operations saw a dramatic turnaround, generating $15,818 million in earnings, driven by higher realizations, absence of impairments, and gains from asset sales [5]. Meanwhile, **Downstream** operations also recovered, contributing $2,914 million in earnings, primarily due to improved margins on refined product sales and higher sales volumes [9]. These strong performances in both segments led to a net income of $15,625 million in 2021, reflecting a remarkable recovery compared to the previous year [2].\n\n![Chevron's financial performance summary for 2019-2021](image1)  \nThis table provides a detailed breakdown of Chevron's financial results for each year, highlighting the contrast between the losses in 2020 and the robust recovery in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the **net income (loss) attributable to Chevron Corporation** is presented in another table, showing the per-share amounts and dividends paid during this period [3]. The sharp decline in 2020 was largely attributed to lower crude oil prices and the associated impact on both upstream and downstream profitability [3]. In contrast, the rebound in 2021 was supported by higher crude oil prices, as illustrated in the graph of quarterly average spot prices for WTI Crude Oil and Brent Crude Oil [4].\n\n![Quarterly average spot prices of WTI Crude Oil, Brent Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021](image5)  \nThis graph captures the price trends that influenced Chevron’s financial performance, particularly the dip in 2020 and subsequent recovery in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron's upstream and downstream operations experienced a significant downturn in 2020 but showed a strong recovery in 2021, resulting in a substantial increase in overall net income."}

As stated in the text, \"The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates\" [3]. Additionally, while the interest rate risks associated with the valuations of equity index put option contract liabilities were once significant, they are now considered less so due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021 [3]. This is further supported by the data in image2, which shows that the fair value of equity index put option contracts was $99 as of December 31, 2021, and would decrease slightly under various interest rate scenarios (e.g., $84 under a 300 bp increase). These fluctuations illustrate how sensitive these liabilities are to interest rate movements.\n\nRegarding the differences in non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021, the text indicates that \"The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses\" [8].

According to the data presented, PMI’s total shipment volume in this region decreased by 11.6% from 72,592 million units in 2019 to 64,200 million units in 2020. This decline was primarily driven by a 11.8% decrease in cigarette shipments, which dropped from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020 [3]. However, there was a positive development in the shipment of Heated Tobacco Units (HTUs), which increased by 50.8% from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020 [3].\n\n![Cigarette and Heated Tobacco Unit shipment volumes in Latin America & Canada decreased and increased respectively from 2019 to 2020](image3)\n\nThese shifts in shipment volumes were accompanied by broader financial activity changes that impacted PMI’s overall financial performance. For instance, net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $\\S0.7$ billion compared to the comparable 2019 period. This decrease was mainly due to reduced capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted for derivatives related to exchange rate fluctuations [1]. \n\nIn addition, net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $\\S0.3$ billion compared with 2019. However, excluding unfavorable currency movements of $\\S0.5$ billion, net cash provided by operating activities actually increased by $\\S0.2$ billion. This increase was driven by higher net earnings (excluding non-cash charges) but was partially offset by increased working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs [7].\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2020, but showed an increase when excluding currency effects](image5)\n\nThe overall financial performance in Latin America & Canada was further influenced by factors such as market-specific challenges, including lower total market sizes, reduced market share, and the impact of the pandemic on adult smoker consumption patterns. These issues were particularly evident in countries like Argentina, Canada, Colombia, and Mexico, where shipment volumes declined significantly [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of declining cigarette shipment volumes, increased HTU shipments, and fluctuating financial activities, including changes in net cash flows and operating performance, collectively impacted PMI’s financial results in Latin America & Canada from 2019 to 2020."}

In 2021, the company generated $21.5 billion of net income and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.95, compared with $3.4 billion of net income and EPS of $0.43 in 2020 [6]. This improvement was driven by several factors, including higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, although these were partially offset by lower net interest income [6].\n\nThe selected balance sheet data for Consumer Banking and Lending also evolved over this period. Total deposits (average and period-end) increased significantly due to higher levels of liquidity and savings among consumer customers, which reflected government stimulus programs, payment deferral programs, and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. This trend is illustrated in the financial summary table, which shows changes in total deposits across the years [image1].\n\nRegarding loans, total loans (average and period-end) decreased as paydowns exceeded originations. This decline was particularly notable in Home Lending loan balances, which were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations. Additionally, Small Business period-end loan balances were affected by a decline in PPP loans [9]. These changes are detailed in the balance sheet data, which includes average and period-end figures for loans by line of business [image4].\n\nIn summary, the net income for Consumer Banking and Lending rose sharply from 2020 to 2021, while deposits increased due to economic conditions, but loan balances saw a decrease due to various operational and market factors.\n\n![Total deposits increased due to higher liquidity and savings among consumers reflecting government stimulus programs and economic uncertainty.](image1)\n![Balance sheet data showing changes in total deposits, loans, and other financial metrics across the years 2019 to 2021.](image4)"}

According to the data in image4, the **average Card Member loans** increased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $15.0 billion in 2021, reflecting a growth of approximately 13%. This increase indicates that the company saw higher borrowing activity from its card members over this period.\n\nMeanwhile, **net interest income** also showed a positive trend, rising from $866 million in 2019 to $1,011 million in 2021, representing an increase of about 17%. This growth was primarily due to lower cost of funds, although it was partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances [10].\n\nThese changes had several implications for the company's financial performance. The increase in average Card Member loans suggests stronger customer engagement and potentially higher revenue opportunities through interest charges. However, the rise in net interest income was not solely driven by higher loan volumes but also by improved efficiency in managing the cost of funds. This implies that the company may have been able to secure more favorable financing terms or reduce operational costs related to interest expenses.\n\nThe overall impact on the company’s financial health appears positive, as reflected in the increase in total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses, which rose from $5,739 million in 2019 to $5,109 million in 2021 [image5]. \n\n![Average Card Member Loans increased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $15.0 billion in 2021](image4)  \n![Net interest income rose from $866 million in 2019 to $1,011 million in 2021](image4)\n\nIn summary, the increase in average Card Member loans and net interest income from 2019 to 2021 contributed positively to the company's financial performance."}

Let’s explore how each contributes.\n\nStarting with **share-based compensation**, this refers to the company’s practice of granting employees shares or share units as part of their compensation package. In 2020, Accenture recognized a **share-based compensation expense** that increased **Restricted Share Units (RSUs)** by 1,118,284 and also increased **Additional Paid-in Capital** by $79,522 [5]. This directly impacts **shareholders' equity**, as RSUs represent a future obligation to issue shares, thereby increasing equity through additional paid-in capital. Furthermore, share-based compensation is typically recorded as an expense on the income statement, which reduces net income. However, since it is a non-cash item, it does not affect the **cash position** directly but influences **comprehensive income** and retained earnings indirectly [image5].\n\nNow, turning to **cash flow from operating activities**, this represents the cash generated from the company’s core business operations. For 2020, this section includes **net income** of $5,185,313 and adjustments such as **depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expenses**. These adjustments are necessary to reconcile net income to cash flow because they represent non-cash expenses [image2]. The inclusion of share-based compensation in this section highlights its impact on cash flow, even though it does not involve actual cash outflows. \n\nMoreover, **net income** itself contributes to **retained earnings**, which is a component of **shareholders’ equity**. As noted in image5, **net income** increased **retained earnings** by $5,107,839, directly boosting shareholders' equity. Additionally, **comprehensive income**—which includes both **net income** and **other comprehensive income** (such as foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in defined benefit plans)—amounted to $5,472,296 for 2020, further enhancing equity [image4].\n\nIn terms of the **cash position**, while share-based compensation does not reduce cash, the **cash flow from operating activities** reflects the liquidity generated by operations, which can be used for various purposes such as reinvestment, debt repayment, or dividend payments. In 2020, Accenture declared a **quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share**, which would have reduced cash reserves but also contributed to **shareholder returns** [3]. Dividends, however, do not directly influence **shareholders’ equity** unless they are issued from retained earnings, which reduces retained earnings and thus total equity.\n\nTo summarize, **share-based compensation** increases **shareholders’ equity** through additional paid-in capital and affects **comprehensive income**, while **cash flow from operating activities** provides insight into the **liquidity** of the company, reflecting how effectively it generates cash from operations. Both factors contribute to the overall financial health of Accenture plc in 2020.\n\n![Share-based compensation increases restricted share units and additional paid-in capital, impacting shareholders' equity.](image5)\n![Cash flow from operating activities reflects net income and adjustments like share-based compensation, influencing liquidity and comprehensive income.](image2)  \n\nIn conclusion, share-based compensation enhances shareholders’ equity by increasing additional paid-in capital, while cash flow from operating activities reflects the company's operational liquidity and supports comprehensive income, ultimately contributing to Accenture plc's financial stability in 2020."}

This increase was primarily due to a capital increase in March 2021, which raised issued capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,275 million [10]. Additionally, the company's net income for fiscal year 2021 contributed positively to unappropriated net income, despite the negative impact of dividend distributions [3]. The growth in equity was also influenced by the acquisition of Varian, which was financed through the issuance of new shares [10].\n\nOn the **liabilities** side, there were increases in both current and non-current liabilities. For **current liabilities**, the total rose from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021, as detailed in image3. This increase was largely attributed to higher other current liabilities, which grew from €1,198 million to €2,016 million, along with an increase in current provisions and income tax liabilities. These developments were likely tied to operational expansion and the integration of Varian into Siemens Healthineers’ operations.\n\nFor **non-current liabilities**, the total increased from €969 million in 2020 to €2,686 million in 2021, according to image4. This was mainly driven by a significant rise in deferred tax liabilities, which jumped from €470 million to €2,082 million. This change could be related to adjustments in tax strategies or the valuation of assets post-acquisition.\n\nIn summary, the substantial growth in equity was driven by capital increases and net income, while the rise in liabilities reflected the financial commitments associated with operational expansion and the acquisition of Varian.\n\n![Equity details for Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30, 2021 and 2020](image2)  \n![Current liabilities of Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30, 2021 and 2020](image3)  \n![Non-current liabilities of Siemens Healthineers AG as of September 30, 2021 and 2020](image4)\n\nSiemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity changed significantly from 2020 to 2021, with equity rising due to capital increases and net income, while liabilities increased due to the acquisition of Varian and higher deferred tax obligations."}

These transactions are reflected in the Cash Flows from Financing Activities section of the company's statement of cash flows, where net cash used in financing activities is reported as ($14,933) for 2021 [image1]. This indicates that the redemption of preferred shares required a significant outflow of cash, which was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of new preferred shares.\n\nThe impact of these transactions on shareholders' equity can be seen in the Shareholders’ Equity table, which shows the changes in preferred shares and additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2021, the company had issued and outstanding 1,600 preferred shares with a par value of $1.66⅔ [image3]. The redemption of Series C and Series B preferred shares would have reduced the number of outstanding preferred shares, while the issuance of Series D shares would have increased them.

This table includes both current and non-current assets for the years ending December 31, 2021, and 2020. The data allows for a comparison of total assets over the two periods, although specific figures are not included in the description.\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities is explicitly described in several text quotes:\n\n- **[2]** states that net cash provided by operating activities was $\\Updownarrow7.18$ billion in 2021, compared with $\\S4.05$ billion in 2020.\n- **[9]** confirms this, noting that consolidated operating cash flow for 2021 was $\\mathbb{S}7.20$.20 billion, up $\\S871$ million compared to 2020.\n\nThese figures highlight a significant increase in cash flow from operating activities, primarily driven by higher profit adjusted for non-cash items, such as increased accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, this increase was partially offset by higher working capital requirements, particularly changes in accounts receivable and inventory, which unfavorably impacted cash flow. These effects were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses [2].\n\n### Implications on Business Operations\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities suggests improved profitability and stronger cash generation capabilities in 2021 compared to 2020. This could indicate better operational efficiency or effective cost management, especially given the adjustments related to short-term incentive compensation. Additionally, the ability to generate more cash from operations may provide the company with greater flexibility in funding its operations, investing in growth opportunities, or managing debt obligations.\n\nHowever, the increase in working capital requirements indicates potential challenges in managing liquidity, particularly in areas like inventory and accounts receivable. This may suggest that the company is experiencing higher demand or longer payment cycles, which could affect future cash flow unless managed effectively.\n\n![Summary of cash flow from operating activities increasing from $\\S4.05$ billion in 2020 to $\\S7.18$ billion in 2021](image2)  \n![Comparison of financial data for consolidated entities, including assets, liabilities, and equity for 2021 and 2020](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the consolidated segment experienced a notable increase in cash flow from operating activities from 2020 to 2021, which likely reflects improved profitability and efficient management of non-cash items. However, increased working capital needs may pose challenges for maintaining liquidity unless effectively managed."}

This represents a **decrease of $2.819 billion** in total assets [3].\n\nOn the liability side, **total liabilities** were **$166.371 billion** as of December 31, 2021, compared to **$168.383 billion** as of December 31, 2020, indicating a **decrease of $2.012 billion** in total liabilities [3].\n\nThese changes are reflected in the balance sheet, which provides a snapshot of the entity’s financial position at the end of each year. The decrease in total assets is partially offset by the decrease in total liabilities, resulting in a **reduction in shareholders’ equity** from **$22.984 billion** in 2020 to **$22.177 billion** in 2021, a decline of **$807 million** [4].\n\n### Relationship to Comprehensive Income\n\nThe **comprehensive income** for the entity includes both **net income** and **other comprehensive income (OCI)**. From the data provided, the **net income** for 2021 was **$8,060 million**, while for 2020 it was **$3,135 million** [2]. However, this does not directly explain the reduction in shareholders' equity, as **accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)** also plays a role.\n\nThe **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)** decreased significantly from **$(2,895) million** in 2020 to **$(2,945) million** in 2021 [4]. This reflects losses related to foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits, which negatively impacted shareholders’ equity despite positive net income.\n\n### Relationship to Cash Flows\n\nThe **cash flow statement** reveals that the company experienced a **net decrease in cash and cash equivalents** of **$10,937 million** in 2021 [2]. This decline is attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Cash flows from operating activities** provided **$14,645 million** in 2021, up from **$5,591 million** in 2020.\n- **Cash flows from investing activities** used **$10,529 million** in 2021, compared to providing **$11,632 million** in 2020.\n- **Cash flows from financing activities** used **$14,933 million** in 2021, compared to **$9,068 million** in 2020.\n\nThe large outflows from financing activities, including share repurchases and debt maturities, likely contributed to the overall decrease in cash and cash equivalents, even though operating activities generated more cash in 2021 than in 2020 [2].\n\nAdditionally, the **decrease in cash and cash equivalents** from **$32.965 billion** in 2020 to **$22.028 billion** in 2021 [3] aligns with the cash flow trends described above.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe entity experienced a **decrease in total assets** and **total liabilities** from 2020 to 2021, which led to a **reduction in shareholders’ equity**. These changes were influenced by a combination of **net income**, **changes in accumulated other comprehensive income**, and **cash flow dynamics**, particularly the large outflows from financing activities. \n\n![Total assets and liabilities decreased from 2020 to 2021](image3)"}

This decline was driven by several factors, including lower global interest rates, the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on credit losses, and reduced non-interest income. Specifically, the **Global Trade and Receivables Finance** segment saw a **4% decrease in revenue**, while **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** experienced a **30% drop**, reflecting the broader challenges faced by the banking sector during the pandemic [1].\n\nRegarding **profit before tax**, the same table from image1 shows that **profit before tax** was **$1,868 million in 2020**, a **74% decrease** compared to **$7,170 million in 2019**. The significant drop in profit before tax was attributed to higher adjusted expected credit loss (ECL) charges due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, as well as a decline in adjusted revenue across most segments. In particular, **adjusted ECL charges increased by $3,592 million**, which had a major negative impact on profitability [4].\n\nWhile the provided information does not directly compare the **Wealth and Personal Banking** segment with **Commercial Banking**, it is clear that the overall financial performance of HSBC in 2020 was negatively impacted by the global economic environment, especially the effects of the pandemic. The reallocation of reportable segments in 2020, such as combining **Global Private Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management** into **Wealth and Personal Banking**, likely reflects strategic adjustments made in response to these challenges [1].\n\nTo summarize, HSBC's overall net operating income and profit before tax declined significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, with the impact of the pandemic being a central factor. However, without specific data on the individual performance of **Wealth and Personal Banking** versus **Commercial Banking**, a direct comparison cannot be made based on the available evidence.\n\n![Net operating income decreased by $1,852 million or 12% in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)  \n![Profit before tax fell by $5,302 million or 74% in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)\n\nThe financial performance of HSBC in 2020 showed a notable decline in both net operating income and profit before tax compared to 2019."}

However, based on similar entries in other tables, such as those in **image4**, which reference section 2(87), it is reasonable to infer that the applicable section for TCS Japan Ltd. might also be **section 2(87)**, as this is a commonly referenced section for subsidiaries or fully owned entities of TCS.\n\nFor Italy, TCS has an entity known as **Tata Consultancy Services Sverige AB**, but this is listed in **image5**, which refers to subsidiaries or associates of TCS located in various countries, including Sweden, Belgium, Italy, the UK, Portugal, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Australia. The table in **image5** indicates that all entries show **100%** shareholding, and they are subject to **section 2(87)**.

This decline can be attributed to reductions in various financing-related assets, including commercial financing receivables, client loans, and net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases, which were all lower in 2020 compared to 2019 [image2]. \n\nRegarding **total equity**, IBM’s total equity stood at $2,352 million in 2020, down from $2,749 million in 2019. This reduction was primarily driven by dividend payments of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net income and increases in common stock [4].\n\nAs for **total company debt**, IBM’s total debt decreased from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020 [image3]. This reduction was partly due to strategic mitigation actions and the refocusing of the Global Financing portfolio, which led to a decline in financing receivables and improved liquidity management [7].\n\n![Total assets decreased from $29,568 million in 2019 to $25,075 million in 2020](image2)  \n![Total company debt decreased from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020](image3)  \n![Total equity decreased from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020](image2)\n\nIn summary, IBM experienced a reduction in total assets, total equity, and total company debt from 2019 to 2020, reflecting a strategic focus on improving liquidity and managing financial obligations amid the challenges posed by the pandemic."}

According to the data provided, the beginning of period gross unrecognized tax benefits were $598 million in 2018, rising to $1,056 million in 2019 and further increasing to $1,423 million in 2020. This growth is attributed to both current year tax positions and prior year tax positions, as indicated by the respective increases in these categories [4]. The table also shows that while there were some decreases due to settlements and statute of limitations lapses, the overall trend was upward, with the end of period gross unrecognized tax benefits reaching $1,829 million in 2020 [image4].\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from 2018 to 2020](image4)\n\nRegarding the impact of common share repurchases on the company's financial position during 2019 and 2020, the data indicates that the company actively repurchased shares during both years.

In 2019, the company repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share, with an aggregate cost of $5,500 million [image1]. These repurchases were conducted under the Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares, aimed at optimizing the company’s capital structure and improving returns to shareholders [3]. \n\nThe repurchase program also helped offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards, which are a significant component of the company’s compensation strategy [3].

These changes are documented in several financial tables that provide a detailed breakdown of the asset values over time.\n\nFor **leasehold improvements**, **hardware and software**, and **fixtures and fittings**, the table [4] outlines the depreciation policies and the movement of their costs and accumulated depreciation over the years ending 30 June 2019 and 28 June 2020. The data shows that these assets are depreciated over specific periods—leasehold improvements over the lease term, while hardware and software, as well as fixtures and fittings, are depreciated over three years. Additionally, the table includes information on additions, disposals, and the impact of exchange rate movements, which all contribute to changes in the carrying amounts of these assets.\n\nIn relation to **right-of-use assets** under AASB 16, the table [5] provides a clear summary of the changes. Initially, the Group recognised $138,403 of right-of-use assets upon applying AASB 16 on 1 July 2019. During the year ended 28 June 2020, additions of $48,793 were made, and there was a re-measurement of lease liabilities of $1,698. However, exchange rate movements reduced the balance by $1,755. As a result, the carrying amount of right-of-use assets increased from $138,403 at the beginning of the year to $187,139 by the end of the year [5].\n\nDepreciation and impairment charges also played a significant role in changing the carrying amounts of these assets. For example, the Group recognised $37,454 of depreciation charges and $4,707 of interest costs related to leases under AASB 16 during the year ended 28 June 2020 [1]. These expenses reduce the carrying value of right-of-use assets over time. Furthermore, accumulated depreciation and impairment losses for right-of-use assets reached $(36,675) by the end of the year [5], reflecting the cumulative effect of depreciation and other adjustments.\n\n![Changes in right-of-use assets under AASB 16](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware and software, and right-of-use assets changed between the beginning and end of the fiscal year 2020 due to additions, depreciation, impairment losses, re-measurements of lease liabilities, and exchange rate movements."}

According to the data provided, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 41%, which dropped significantly to 9% in fiscal 2020 and further decreased to 12% in fiscal 2021 [image2]. This fluctuation reflects a combination of various factors influencing the company’s tax position during these periods.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the total effective tax provision was $3,095 million, driven largely by the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property, which resulted in a $2,472 million charge to income tax expense [image2]. Additionally, there was a benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the “check-the-box” elections made by foreign subsidiaries, which contributed a $570 million tax benefit [6].\n\nIn contrast, fiscal 2020 saw a much lower effective tax provision of $521 million. This decrease was influenced by several factors, including the benefit from the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction and the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards. The FDII deduction alone reduced the tax provision by $381 million, while the share-based awards contributed an additional $83 million benefit [image2].\n\nFiscal 2021 continued the trend of a relatively low effective tax rate at 12%, with a total effective tax provision of $1,231 million. Although the FDII deduction still played a role in reducing the tax burden, its impact was slightly less compared to 2020 ($550 million). However, the excess tax benefit from share-based awards remained a notable factor, contributing a $265 million reduction to the tax provision [image2].\n\nIt is also important to consider the breakdown of tax provisions across jurisdictions. In 2019, the federal tax provision was $1,563 million, but this was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $2,037 million, resulting in a grand total effective tax provision of $3,095 million [image3]. In 2020, the federal current provision was only $210 million, while the deferred benefit was $192 million, leading to a total effective tax provision of $521 million. In 2021, the federal current provision increased to $942 million, but the deferred benefit was $251 million, resulting in a total effective tax provision of $1,231 million [image3].\n\nMoreover, the table showing the changes in unrecognized tax benefits highlights the increasing complexity and uncertainty surrounding Qualcomm’s tax positions. The ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits rose from $1,705 million in 2019 to $2,136 million in 2021, indicating growing exposure to potential adjustments or settlements with tax authorities [image5].\n\n![Unrecognized tax benefits increased over the years](image5)\n\nThese trends underscore the evolving nature of Qualcomm’s tax strategy and the impact of regulatory changes, such as the FDII deduction and temporary regulations affecting dividend income, on its financial reporting and tax provisions.\n\nIn summary, Qualcomm experienced significant fluctuations in its tax provisions and related benefits between 2019 and 2021, primarily driven by changes in tax legislation, accounting adjustments, and ongoing interactions with tax authorities."}

However, following the sale of WFAM, there was a substantial reduction in the AUM, reflected by a sale impact of $(587.1) billion. This led to an end-of-period balance of $26.9 billion for 2021. The dramatic drop is directly attributable to the sale of the business, which removed a large portion of the previously managed assets from the company’s books.\n\n![WFAM assets under management decreased significantly due to the sale on November 1, 2021](image5)\n\nIn terms of income, the sale of WFAM contributed to a gain of $\\S269$ million, which is explicitly mentioned in text quote [2].

However, this gain was partially offset by lower gains on the sales of certain residential mortgage loans and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM resulted in a decrease in total assets, as indicated in text quote [1], which mentions that total assets (period-end) decreased modestly, partly due to the timing of cash deployment by the investment portfolio near the end of 2021. While this decline was modest overall, it was partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to the affiliated venture capital business. Furthermore, the sale of WFAM also reduced asset-based fees, as noted in text quote [3], due to the loss of advisory income generated from managing these assets.\n\n![The sale of WFAM contributed a $\\S269$ million gain to the company's income in 2021](image2)\n\nOverall, while the sale of WFAM provided a one-time gain and allowed the company to streamline its operations, it also led to a sharp decline in AUM and a reduction in recurring asset-based fees, reflecting the long-term operational impact of divesting a major business unit."}

However, the exact operating expenses for the WPB segment in 2019 are not explicitly stated in image3. From quote [7], we know that **reported operating expenses in 2020 were \\$34.4 billion**, a decrease of \\$7.9 billion or 19% compared to 2019.

According to the data provided, there was a notable downturn in net interest income primarily due to a significant decrease in interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses from 2019 to 2020 [image2]. This suggests that the net interest spread likely narrowed during this period.\n\nNet interest income decreased by $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, with significant decreases observed in several categories such as interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, time deposits and federal funds, and debt securities and loans and leases. On the other hand, net interest expense also saw a decrease, though not as substantial as the decrease in interest income. Specifically, interest expense decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020 [image2].\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes include lower interest rates, which directly impacted the yield on earning assets, and reduced deposit and funding costs, which helped mitigate some of the decline in net interest income. Additionally, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual contributed to some offsetting effects [6].

Additionally, while impairments also increased from $255 million in 2020 to $619 million in 2021, the most notable change was the inclusion of a negative adjustment of $1 million for acquisition or divestment of businesses in 2021, as opposed to a positive adjustment of $22 million in 2020.\n\n![The table shows the adjustments made to arrive at core operating income for 2020, including amortization, impairments, acquisition/divestment items, and other items.](image1)\n\n![The table provides the adjustments made to arrive at core operating income for 2021, highlighting the significant increase in amortization of intangible assets compared to 2020.](image3)\n\nThe key differences in the adjustments across the two years are the substantial increase in amortization of intangible assets and the shift in the acquisition or divestment adjustment from positive to slightly negative."}

This adjustment reflects a strategic focus on presenting financial performance without the impact of intangible asset amortization, which is often considered a non-cash charge.\n\nIn 2020, the amortization of intangible assets was included in several line items such as cost of goods sold and research and development [1]. These amortization charges were part of the adjustments made to arrive at the core operating income. For instance, the amortization of acquired rights to currently marketed products and other production-related intangible assets was included in the cost of goods sold, while the amortization of acquired rights for technologies was included in research and development [1]. These adjustments helped reconcile the IFRS results to the core results by adding back the amortization expenses, thus increasing the core operating income.\n\nSimilarly, in 2021, the amortization of intangible assets continued to be a key adjustment item affecting core operating income. The table shows that for gross profit, the amortization of intangible assets amounted to USD 3,655 million, contributing to the increase from IFRS gross profit of USD 37,010 million to core gross profit of USD 41,097 million [image2]. In operating income, the amortization of intangible assets was part of the total adjustments of USD 4,899 million, leading to an increase in core operating income from USD 11,689 million (IFRS) to USD 16,588 million [image2].\n\n![Amortization of intangible assets increased core operating income in 2020 by reversing related expenses](image1)  \n![Amortization of intangible assets contributed to the increase in core operating income in 2021 by adjusting IFRS results](image2)\n\nThe impact of these adjustments can be seen clearly in the reconciliation tables, where the addition of amortization expenses back into the financial statements leads to higher core operating income figures. This practice allows stakeholders to better understand the underlying operational performance of the company, excluding the effects of intangible asset amortization.\n\nIn summary, the adjustments for the amortization of intangible assets positively impacted the core operating income in both 2020 and 2021 by increasing the operating income figures when transitioning from IFRS results to core results."}

This increase can be attributed to several factors, including a rise in sales volume by $3,076 million and favorable price realization of $932 million. However, these gains were partially offset by increased manufacturing costs, which rose by $1,246 million, as well as higher SG&A/R&D expenses, which increased by $1,021 million. Despite these challenges, the overall operating profit for 2021 remained strong, indicating robust performance across the company's operations. ![The image shows the changes in consolidated operating profit for Caterpillar between 2020 and 2021, highlighting the various contributing factors](image1).\n\nFor the Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment, the operating profit also showed improvement. In 2021, the profit as a percentage of total sales was 11.8%, compared to 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, the absolute value of ME&T’s profit increased by $363 million, reaching $2.768 billion in 2021 from $2.405 billion in 2020. This growth was driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, although it was somewhat tempered by unfavorable manufacturing costs and increased SG&A/R&D expenses. ![The chart compares the consolidated operating profit between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2021 for Caterpillar, showing the changes in various factors](image5).\n\nRegarding net cash provided by operating activities, the consolidated net cash flow for 2021 was $7.202 billion, representing an increase of $871 million compared to 2020. This improvement was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. These positive trends were partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory. Nonetheless, favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses helped to mitigate some of these effects. For the ME&T segment specifically, the operating cash flow was also positive, with the company ending 2021 with $9.25 billion in cash, reflecting its strong liquidity position. ![This table presents a summary of cash flow information for a company, broken down into three main sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the years 2021 and 2020](image2). \n\nIn conclusion, both the consolidated and ME&T segments demonstrated improved financial performance in terms of operating profit and net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020."}

These changes had implications for the company’s financial position, including its liquidity, capital structure, and potential future tax obligations.\n\nRegarding **gross unrecognized tax benefits**, the data from image3 indicates that the beginning of period balance for 2020 was $1,423 million, which increased to $1,829 million by the end of 2020. This increase was driven by current year tax positions of $416 million and prior year tax positions of $120 million, partially offset by decreases from prior year tax positions of $(130) million and settlements of $—. In contrast, in 2019, the gross unrecognized tax benefits rose from $1,056 million at the start of the year to $1,423 million by year-end, primarily due to current year tax positions of $512 million and prior year tax positions of $2 million, with some reductions from settlements and statute of limitations lapses [3]. The growing balance of unrecognized tax benefits implies uncertainty in the timing and amount of future cash outflows related to tax matters, which could affect the company's effective tax rate and liquidity if these liabilities are eventually settled [10].\n\nIn terms of **common share repurchases**, image1 provides a detailed comparison between 2020 and 2019. In 2020, the company repurchased 14 million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million. In 2019, the company repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million. While the total cost of repurchases decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, the number of shares repurchased also declined. As of December 31, 2020, the company had Board authorization to purchase up to 58 million shares, down from 72 million in 2019 [2]. These repurchases were part of the company's ongoing strategy to optimize its capital structure and improve returns to shareholders [5]. However, the reduced volume of repurchases in 2020 may reflect strategic decisions influenced by market conditions or business needs, as noted in the company’s statement on dividend adjustments [1].\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million at the beginning of 2020 to $1,829 million by the end of the year](image3)\n![Common share repurchases totaled $4,250 million in 2020, compared to $5,500 million in 2019](image1)\n\nThese changes in both gross unrecognized tax benefits and share repurchase activity suggest a shift in the company’s financial priorities and risk management approach during 2020. The increase in tax liabilities highlights ongoing complexities in international tax compliance, while the reduction in share repurchases may indicate a more conservative capital allocation strategy. Together, these factors influence the company's liquidity, shareholder returns, and overall financial flexibility. \n\nThe company's financial position is therefore impacted by both the potential future cash outflows related to tax obligations and the strategic reallocation of capital resources toward other priorities."}

This increase was driven by higher sales volume, which was itself fueled by increased end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as the impact from changes in dealer inventories [10]. Additionally, favorable price realization contributed to the overall growth in sales [10].\n\n![Bar graph showing consolidated sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 versus 2020](image1)\n\nIn terms of operating profit, the fourth quarter of 2021 reported a profit of $1,611 million, an increase of $231 million or 17% compared to $1,380 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 [7]. Several factors contributed to this increase, including higher sales volume and favorable price realization, which offset higher manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses [7].

The acquisition of Varian not only increased goodwill but also impacted other financial metrics such as net debt, operating net working capital, and cash and cash equivalents [6][3][8].\n\n![Total goodwill increased from €9,038 million in 2020 to €17,512 million in 2021](image2)"}

These activities are reflected in the company's financial statements, particularly in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows.\n\nFrom the consolidated balance sheet (image1), we can observe that Chevron’s equity section includes **treasury stock at cost**, which reflects the shares repurchased by the company. The value of treasury stock is a critical component of total equity, as it reduces the overall equity attributable to shareholders. In 2021, the amount of treasury stock would have impacted the total stockholders' equity, reducing it by the cost of shares repurchased during the year. This is consistent with how companies manage their capital structure through share buybacks, which can signal confidence in future performance or be used to return value to shareholders [6].\n\nAdditionally, **cash dividends** play a crucial role in shaping the equity structure. Dividends reduce retained earnings, which is a major component of stockholders’ equity. As shown in image3, **retained earnings** fluctuate based on net income and dividend payouts. In 2021, Chevron reported a substantial net income of $15,689 million, but this was partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders. The payment of dividends would have directly reduced retained earnings, thereby affecting the overall equity position of the company [3].\n\nIn terms of **cash flow**, these activities are captured in the **financing activities** section of the consolidated cash flow statement (image4). Specifically, **cash dividends** paid in 2021 would be classified under financing activities and would represent an outflow from the company’s cash reserves. Similarly, **treasury stock purchases** also fall under financing activities and would be recorded as cash outflows. In 2021, Chevron had a **net cash used for financing activities** of ($23,113) million, indicating that the company spent a significant portion of its cash on financing activities, including dividends and share repurchases [4].\n\nThe combined effect of these two activities—dividend payments and treasury stock transactions—would have reduced Chevron’s cash reserves while simultaneously altering its equity structure. However, these actions may also reflect strategic decisions aimed at optimizing shareholder returns and managing the company’s capital efficiently.\n\n![Chevron's balance sheet showing equity components including treasury stock and retained earnings](image1)\n![Chevron's cash flow statement highlighting financing activities related to dividends and treasury stock](image4)"}

According to the Group’s accounting policy, AASB 16 introduced a single, on-balance-sheet accounting model for lessees, requiring the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities [10]. This change was applied using a modified retrospective approach, with details provided in note D8 [2].\n\nFor lease liabilities, the initial application of AASB 16 resulted in the recognition of a lease liability of $143,621 as of 1 July 2019. During the year ending 28 June 2020, additional lease liabilities were recognized, amounting to $50,245, while re-measurements due to changes in lease terms added $1,559. However, lease payments reduced the liability by $31,886, and interest increased it by $4,707. Adjustments for exchange rate movements decreased the balance by $1,092, resulting in a total lease liability of $167,154 at the end of the reporting period, with $36,019 classified as current and $131,135 as non-current [image1].\n\nIn addition, the Group adopted a practical expedient that allowed lease liabilities to remain unadjusted for rent concessions directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as outlined in note B4 [5]. Furthermore, site restoration costs, which were previously capitalized as part of leasehold improvements, are now included in the lease right-of-use asset and depreciated over the lease term [4].\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, the Group reported a total of $4,092 thousand in employee benefit liabilities as of 28 June 2020, compared to $4,054 thousand as of 30 June 2019. These liabilities include obligations for annual leave and long-service leave, with the liability for annual leave decreasing slightly from $2,992 thousand in 2019 to $2,848 thousand in 2020 [image3].\n\n![Lease liability changes under AASB 16](image1)  \n![Employee benefit liabilities for 2020](image3)\n\nThe transition to AASB 16 significantly increased lease liabilities on the balance sheet, reflecting the new requirement to recognize lease obligations as liabilities.

A significant portion of this amount was allocated to intangible assets such as developed technology and customer relationships. Specifically, the Company recorded approximately $53 million for developed technology and customer relationships with estimated useful lives of four to five years [5]. Additionally, $152 million was allocated to goodwill, primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities from integrating MapAnything’s technology with the Company’s other offerings [5]. The fair values assigned to tangible assets and liabilities were based on management’s estimates and assumptions, and the valuation was expected to be finalized within one year of the acquisition date [5].\n\nSimilarly, in the acquisition of Salesforce.org, the Company included its financial results in the consolidated financial statements starting from the date of acquisition in June 2019 [2]. The business combination contributed approximately $228 million in total revenues in fiscal 2020 [2]. However, the fair value allocation details for Salesforce.org are not explicitly provided in the text quotes, but we can infer that similar principles would apply, such as allocating fair value to identifiable intangible assets and recording goodwill for non-deductible items.\n\nA notable similarity between the two acquisitions is the treatment of goodwill. In both cases, goodwill was primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities, and it was not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes [5] and [3]. Additionally, in both instances, the fair values assigned to tangible assets and liabilities were preliminary and subject to change as more information became available [5] and [3].\n\nHowever, a key difference lies in the specific amounts allocated to intangible assets. For example, in the ClickSoftware acquisition, developed technology was valued at $53 million with a useful life of four to five years, while customer relationships were also assigned a fair value [5]. In contrast, image1 provides a table showing intangible assets subject to amortization, where developed technology had a fair value of $215 with a useful life of four years, and customer relationships had a fair value of $61 with a useful life of eight years, totaling $276 in intangible assets [image1]. This suggests that the fair value allocations may vary depending on the specific assets and assumptions made during each acquisition.\n\nAnother difference is reflected in the net assets acquired. Image2 shows that the net assets acquired in one acquisition totaled $134, whereas image5 indicates that in another acquisition, the net assets acquired amounted to $1,386 [image2] and [image5], respectively. These figures likely correspond to different acquisitions or reflect varying levels of asset and liability valuations.\n\n![Intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships](image1)  \n![Net assets acquired with a total value of $134](image2)  \n![Net assets acquired with a total value of $1,386](image5)\n\nThe fair value allocation of net assets acquired in both the ClickSoftware and Salesforce.org acquisitions shares similarities in the treatment of goodwill and the preliminary nature of fair value assignments. However, they differ in the specific amounts allocated to intangible assets and the overall net assets acquired."}

These adjustments are critical in understanding the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, which provide a clearer view of operational performance by excluding certain non-recurring or one-time events.\n\nIn 2020, PBNA's reported GAAP measure was impacted by various adjustments. For instance, there were specific negative impacts related to acquisitions and divestitures, with PBNA experiencing a -2% impact [image1]. This indicates that the reported GAAP results included effects from these transactions, which may not reflect the underlying operational performance of the segment.\n\nOn the other hand, the core non-GAAP measure adjusts for these items to present a more accurate picture of PBNA’s performance. The core non-GAAP measure for PBNA in 2020 showed an organic growth rate of 2%, reflecting the segment's performance after adjusting for the aforementioned factors [image1]. This organic growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the effects of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and other items affecting comparability [1].\n\nMoreover, the table in image4 illustrates how the shift from GAAP to non-GAAP measures accounts for adjustments like mark-to-market net impact, restructuring and impairment charges, and inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges.

These factors are not only used to set the total amount of remuneration but also to allocate portions of it between fixed and performance-linked components [3].\n\nThe consolidated operating income serves as a key indicator for evaluating Toyota’s efforts based on business performance [image1]. This metric accounts for 50% of the evaluation framework, with a reference value of 1 trillion yen, and in the current fiscal year, it was achieved at 150% of this target [image3]. This shows that strong financial performance directly influences the evaluation and, consequently, the remuneration of executives.\n\nSimilarly, the volatility of Toyota’s share price is considered a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors [image1]. It contributes another 50% to the evaluation framework, with comparative analysis against the Nikkei stock average being used to assess performance [image3]. This ensures that executive compensation reflects not just internal performance but also how the company is perceived by external stakeholders.\n\nIndividual performance evaluations add a qualitative dimension to the assessment process, ensuring that personal contributions and responsibilities are also factored into remuneration decisions [image1]. This comprehensive approach ensures that executive pay is aligned with both operational success and long-term shareholder value creation.\n\n![Consolidated operating income and share price volatility are key indicators for evaluating business performance and shareholder value](image1)\n\n![Toyota’s executive remuneration is structured around fixed and performance-linked components, reflecting both job responsibilities and business outcomes](image4) \n\nIn conclusion, Toyota’s executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance and shareholder value indicators through a combination of financial metrics such as consolidated operating income and share price volatility, alongside qualitative assessments of individual performance."}

In 2018, comprehensive income was approximately \\$2,005 million, rising to \\$2,731 million in 2019 and then surging to \\$6,346 million in 2020 [1]. This substantial growth can be attributed to several factors.\n\nOne of the primary contributors to the increase in comprehensive income was the foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2020, the company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately \\$2.9 billion, compared to a translation loss of \\$75 million in 2019 and a loss of \\$632 million in 2018 [image1]. This dramatic shift from losses to gains played a crucial role in boosting comprehensive income significantly in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the net earnings from continuing operations also increased substantially. Net earnings in 2020 were approximately \\$3.6 billion, compared to \\$3.008 billion in 2019 and \\$2.651 billion in 2018 [image1]. The increase in net earnings was driven by higher sales, particularly due to the acquisition of Cytiva, which contributed 18.0% to the increase in sales in 2020 [4]. The Cytiva acquisition not only boosted sales but also contributed positively to net earnings through its performance in 2020 [6].\n\nAnother factor contributing to the change in comprehensive income was the gain on the sale of product lines. In 2020, the company completed the sale of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment, generating a pretax gain of \\$455 million [3]. This gain further enhanced the comprehensive income for the year.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments had a negative impact on comprehensive income. These losses increased from \\$13 million in 2018 to \\$90 million in 2019 and reached \\$147 million in 2020 [image1]. Despite this, the overall positive contributions from other areas outweighed these losses, leading to an overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\n![Comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, with a notable gain in foreign currency translation adjustments and net earnings.](image1)"}

These differences are reflected in both the financial allocations and the modes of implementation.\n\nIn terms of **financial expenditure**, image4 explicitly mentions a PAN India **COVID Relief project** that had the highest amount spent at ₹24.73 crore. This indicates a large-scale national effort to address the pandemic’s impact. In contrast, rural development projects, such as those described in image2 and image1, have varying amounts spent depending on the specific project and location. For example, some rural development projects may be allocated smaller budgets, such as those focused on social awareness or vocational training, while others may receive more substantial funding for infrastructure or community development [1].\n\nRegarding **project implementation modes**, there are notable distinctions between the two categories. The **COVID Relief projects** often involve collaboration with multiple agencies due to their wide-reaching nature. For instance, the PAN India project mentioned in image4 was implemented through various agencies, including Give India and State Disaster Development Authority, indicating a decentralized and multi-agency approach [4]. On the other hand, **Rural Development Projects**—as seen in image2 and image1—can be implemented either directly by the organization or through implementing agencies. Some projects, like skill training programs in Odisha and Punjab, are implemented directly, while others involve external agencies such as Setu Charitable Trust or the National Health and Education Society [2].\n\nAdditionally, **local area focus** is a key feature of both types of projects. However, while many rural development initiatives specifically target local areas (as noted in image1 and image2), the **COVID Relief projects** may cover broader geographic regions or even be PAN India in scope, as seen in the case of the ₹24.73 crore relief initiative [4].\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Financial Allocation**: The largest single allocation was for a PAN India **COVID Relief project** (₹24.73 crore), whereas **Rural Development Projects** have varied spending levels depending on the specific initiative.\n- **Implementation Modes**: **Rural Development Projects** can be implemented either directly or through agencies, while **COVID Relief projects** often involve multiple agencies due to their extensive reach and urgency.\n\n![PAN India COVID Relief project with significant funding](image4)  \n![Rural Development Projects with varied implementation modes and funding levels](image2)"}

These figures provide insights into the company’s profitability, cash generation, and overall financial health.\n\nFrom the data available, we see that **net income** is a measure of profitability after all expenses, while **net cash provided by operating activities** reflects the actual cash generated from core business operations. On the other hand, **comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo** includes not only net income but also other comprehensive income items like currency translation adjustments, pension adjustments, and other non-operational gains or losses.\n\nFor example, in 2020:\n- **Net income** was $7,175 million [1].\n- **Comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo** was $5,944 million [image1], which is lower than net income due to negative other comprehensive income items such as net currency translation adjustments and pension adjustments.\n- **Net cash provided by operating activities** was $10,613 million [image3], significantly higher than both net income and comprehensive income. This suggests strong cash flow generation from operations despite some non-cash adjustments affecting net income and comprehensive income.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019:\n- **Net income** was $7,353 million [1].\n- **Comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo** was $8,133 million [image1], indicating that other comprehensive income items were positive in this year.\n- **Net cash provided by operating activities** was $9,649 million [image3], again showing that cash flow from operations exceeded net income.\n\nIn 2018:\n- **Net income** was $12,559 million [1].\n- **Comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo** was $10,453 million [image1], which was lower due to negative other comprehensive income items.\n- **Net cash provided by operating activities** was $9,415 million [image3], slightly lower than net income but still reflecting robust operational cash flow.\n\n![PepsiCo's net income and comprehensive income for 2018–2020](image1)  \n![PepsiCo's net cash provided by operating activities for 2018–2020](image3)\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo’s **net cash provided by operating activities** consistently outperformed both **net income** and **comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo** over the years 2018 to 2020, highlighting the company’s strong operational cash generation despite variations in non-cash adjustments impacting reported net income and comprehensive income."}

These assumptions, such as discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression, are critical in calculating the DBO and managing the funded status of pension plans. \n\nFor instance, a change in the discount rate directly affects the present value of future benefits. As noted in the text, discount rates are determined based on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds if necessary [2]. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the DBO, as future benefits are discounted less heavily. This is illustrated in image1, where a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point results in an increase of €271 million in the DBO as of September 30, 2021, compared to a similar increase of €266 million in 2020 [image1].\n\nSimilarly, changes in compensation increase and pension progression also affect the DBO. An increase in compensation assumptions leads to higher future benefits, thus increasing the DBO. According to image1, an increase in compensation by half a percentage point resulted in a €16 million increase in the DBO in 2021, compared to a €11 million increase in 2020 [image1].\n\nThe funded status of the pension plans can be affected by these changes in assumptions, as well as by movements in financial markets. For example, image2 shows that the total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. This growth in assets may have been partly influenced by the investment strategy aligned with the DBO, which aims to mitigate liability risks [8].\n\nHowever, changes in assumptions can also lead to actuarial gains or losses. Image3 reveals that there were actuarial losses in 2021, with total losses amounting to €22 million, compared to a gain of €67 million in 2020. These losses can be attributed to changes in demographic and financial assumptions, such as mortality rates and discount rates, which impact the DBO and the funded status of the pension plans [image3].\n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions between 2020 and 2021 had a notable impact on the defined benefit obligation and plan assets, with adjustments in discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression affecting the DBO and contributing to changes in the funded status of the pension plans. ![The table shows the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage point in three categories: Discount rate, Compensation increase, and Pension progression.](image1) ![The table displays financial data in millions of euros as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.](image2) ![The table shows actuarial gains and losses in millions of euros for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.](image3) Changes in actuarial assumptions impacted the defined benefit obligation and plan assets from 2020 to 2021 by altering the present value of future benefits and influencing the funded status of pension plans."}

Additionally, market risk RWA increased due to higher regulatory Value at Risk (VaR) resulting from increased market volatility [6].

The U.S. saw a **2% decrease in total company-operated sales and franchised revenues** from 2019 to 2020 [3]. However, this decline was partially offset by strategic marketing initiatives, such as the free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers, aimed at accelerating recovery and driving growth [1]. Additionally, the Company’s investments in digital platforms and delivery services positively impacted comparable sales in the second half of 2020 [4].\n\nOn the other hand, the **International Operated Markets** segment faced much more severe declines. Total revenues for this segment decreased by **17%** year-over-year [3], with comparable sales dropping by **15.0%** due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [4]. This segment was particularly affected by government-imposed restrictions and lockdowns that severely limited customer traffic and operational capacity [5].\n\nThe influence of these external factors is further supported by the data shown in the bar chart, which illustrates the significant drop in both franchised and company-operated margins in 2020 compared to previous years [image1]. Franchised margins fell from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020, while company-operated margins dropped even more sharply from $1,660 million to $1,158 million [image1].\n\nMoreover, the table showing percentage changes for different market segments highlights the stark contrast between the U.S. and International Operated Markets [image5].

This led to a net value of assets decreasing from $10,396 million in 2019 to $12,747 million in 2020 [image1], which is an increase in net value despite the rise in accumulated depreciation. This increase is due to the substantial growth in total asset values, which outpaced the depreciation charges.\n\nThe depreciation method used for certain assets, such as Panasonic production equipment, was based on the units-of-production method, where capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated productive life of the assets [3]. This approach ensures that depreciation aligns with the usage of the assets, contributing to the fluctuation in accumulated depreciation and net values.\n\nAdditionally, the construction in progress category, which includes ongoing projects like Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, also plays a role in the overall PPE valuation. These assets are not yet depreciated until they are completed and ready for use [7].\n\n![Accumulated depreciation on solar energy systems in service increased from $723 million in 2019 to $955 million in 2020](image2)  \n![Total asset values before depreciation for property, plant, and equipment increased from $14,130 million in 2019 to $17,864 million in 2020](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, while accumulated depreciation increased from 2019 to 2020, the net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment was influenced by both the rising asset values and the corresponding depreciation charges."}

Net income represents the profit earned by the company after all expenses, while comprehensive income includes net income plus other comprehensive income (OCI), which encompasses items like foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in defined benefit plans, and gains or losses on cash flow hedges.\n\nFor fiscal 2020, Accenture reported **net income of $5,185,313** [2], which directly contributes to retained earnings and thus increases shareholders' equity. In addition, the company experienced **other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax**, with a total of **$278,740** for 2020 [2]. This OCI, although smaller in magnitude compared to net income, still adds to the overall equity by reflecting unrealized gains and losses that are not included in net income but affect the company’s financial position.\n\nIn contrast, fiscal 2019 saw **net income of $4,846,241** [2] and **other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, of $(264,406)** [2]. While the net income contributed positively to equity, the negative OCI slightly reduced the overall comprehensive income for that year.\n\nLooking further back to 2018, **net income was $4,214,594** [2], and **other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, was $(481,387)** [2]. Again, the net income added to shareholders’ equity, while the negative OCI had a minor dampening effect.\n\nThese figures illustrate how both net income and comprehensive income have shaped Accenture’s equity over the years. A detailed breakdown of these components is available in the consolidated shareholders’ equity statements, which show the cumulative impact of these financial activities on equity [3].\n\n![Changes in Shareholders' Equity](image5)"}

The AUM is an important metric for assessing how changes in asset amounts may affect the generation of certain asset-based fees [8]. However, in February 2021, Wells Fargo announced an agreement to sell WFAM and moved it from the Wealth and Investment Management segment to Corporate [10]. This reclassification was followed by the eventual sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021 [6], which resulted in a net gain of $269 million [6].\n\nThe table in image2 provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in WFAM AUM over three years, with a particular focus on December 31, 2021. At the start of 2021, the balance of WFAM AUM was $603.0 billion. During the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion. Additionally, there was a market impact of $11.6 billion, and the sale of WFAM itself reduced the AUM by $587.1 billion, resulting in an end-of-period balance of $603.0 billion + $69.3 billion - $96.8 billion + $11.6 billion - $587.1 billion = $603.0 billion - $587.1 billion = $15.9 billion.\n\nThis dramatic reduction in AUM due to the sale of WFAM would have had a direct impact on the balance sheet data, especially in categories such as total assets and specific asset classes like available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity debt securities. These changes are reflected in the balance sheet data presented in image5, which shows the average and period-end values for various categories, including total assets and deposits.\n\nIn particular, the balance sheet data in image5 indicates that total deposits (average and period-end) decreased in 2021, reflecting actions taken to manage under the asset cap [1]. This aligns with the broader context of the company’s strategic moves, including the sale of WFAM and the Corporate Trust Services business, which were aimed at managing liquidity and interest rate risk through portfolio rebalancing [4].\n\n![WFAM AUM activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019](image2)  \n![Selected balance sheet data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019](image5)\n\nThe sale of WFAM significantly reduced the AUM, which in turn affected the balance sheet data by decreasing the total assets and influencing the composition of investment securities and other related financial instruments. \n\nThe changes in 'Total WFAM assets under management' directly impacted Wells Fargo's balance sheet data in 2021 by reducing the overall asset base and altering the structure of investment portfolios."}

The company's strategy involved entering new markets, optimizing its existing store network, and leveraging both company-owned and franchised models to grow its footprint.\n\nOne of the key aspects of Lovisa’s international expansion is its focus on securing quality retail sites in high-traffic areas. This includes targeting AA, A, or B-grade shopping centers and malls, which allows for quick and cost-effective roll-out of stores [9]. For example, the company has successfully established company-owned stores in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America, as well as franchised stores in several Middle Eastern countries [4].\n\nThe evolution of this strategy can be seen in the data presented in image5, which shows the growth of Lovisa’s store count across various regions from 2016 to 2020. The total number of stores increased significantly, from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, indicating a steady expansion over the period. This growth reflects the company’s ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities in different markets [4].\n\nIn addition to expanding its physical presence, Lovisa has also focused on enhancing the performance of its existing stores through initiatives such as the global rollout of piercing services, which aimed to improve customer loyalty [1]. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to increase earnings contributions from existing stores and continue opening new ones on a timely and profitable basis [10].\n\nHowever, Lovisa has also faced challenges in its international expansion. One of the main risks associated with entering new markets is competition, particularly in the fast fashion jewelry sector, where barriers to entry are relatively low despite the substantial costs required to replicate Lovisa’s business model [7]. Additionally, the impact of the global retail leasing market, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has necessitated close monitoring of opportunities and adjustments to expansion plans [3].\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Lovisa has employed a product team of more than 20 people to meet market demands and has worked to refine its global store model based on optimal size, location, and format [8]. These strategies have helped the company maintain a competitive edge and continue its international growth trajectory.\n\n![Lovisa's financial summary for FY20 and FY19](image1)  \n![Gross margin percentage over five fiscal years](image3)  \n![Lovisa's business strategy pillars and related achievements](image4)"}

Let’s explore this through relevant text and image evidence.\n\nNet interest income (NII) for 2020 was $27.6bn, representing a decrease of $2.9bn or 9.5% compared with 2019 [8]. This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by 84 basis points [1]. However, this was partially offset by an increase in AIEA of $170.1bn or 8.8%, which contributed to some growth in interest income [8].\n\nConcurrently, interest expense for 2020 was $2.7bn, down $2.9bn year-on-year, driven largely by lower market interest rates [6]. The reduction in funding costs on customer deposits and debt issuances further contributed to the decline in interest expenses [6].\n\nThese changes in NII and interest expense are reflected in the financial data presented in image2, which shows that net interest income for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $27,578 million, a decrease from the previous year [image2]. Additionally, the net interest margin (NIM) for 2020 was 1.32%, a drop of 26 basis points compared to 2019 [1], as illustrated in image2.\n\n![Net interest income decreased by $2.9bn in 2020 compared to 2019](image2)\n\nThe combined effect of these changes is evident in the summary consolidated income statement provided in image5, which highlights the organization’s net operating income and overall profitability metrics over several years. In particular, the net operating income before credit provisions and other adjustments likely suffered from the reduced NII, as it is directly tied to interest-related activities [image5].\n\nFurthermore, the net operating income for 2020, as shown in image5, would have been impacted by the lower NII, contributing to a decline in overall profitability. The table also indicates that profit for the year in 2020 was lower than in 2019, reflecting the broader financial challenges faced by the organization during this period [image5].\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net interest income and the corresponding reduction in interest expense from 2019 to 2020 negatively impacted the organization’s net operating income and overall profitability."}

This decrease was primarily driven by a significant drop in **interest and other investment income**, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a decline of 44.4%. The text quote [2] explains that this decline was due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as well as persistently low short-term interest rates throughout 2020 and 2021. Despite this, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, indicating some resilience in this area.

This growth was supported by higher volumes (up 6.9%) and an increase in average revenue per car/unit (up 3.5%), as noted in text quote [7]. Meanwhile, railroad operating expenses increased by $1.3 billion (10.2%) from $13.4 billion in 2020 to $13.7 billion in 2021, mainly due to higher fuel prices and increased volumes, though partially offset by productivity improvements.

This suggests that the company expanded its production and inventory levels to meet rising demand, particularly in light of the Cytiva acquisition and the increased core sales growth mentioned in text quote [4].\n\nThese changes in both **lease assets** and **inventories** are reflected in the company's financial statements. The increase in lease liabilities and ROU assets would appear in the balance sheet under property, plant, and equipment, as well as in the liability section. Similarly, the rise in inventory values would be reflected in the current assets section of the balance sheet. Additionally, the impact of these changes on operating cash flows can be seen in text quote [1], which notes that the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $161 million in 2019. While the change is minimal, it highlights how effective management of the cash conversion cycle affects operating cash flows.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced increases in both lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020, reflecting strategic growth initiatives and increased operational activity, which are clearly visible in the balance sheet and have a subtle impact on operating cash flows.\n\n![Increase in operating lease ROU assets and liabilities](image4)\n![Significant increase in inventory levels across all categories](image1)"}

This trend indicates a reduction in restructuring activities over these years.\n\nThe main components of these costs include:\n\n- **Separations**: These involve costs related to employee severance packages, primarily voluntary, and are based on salary levels and past service periods. For instance, in 2021, $88 was incurred under separations, and in 2022, this amount was $127 [9].\n\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: These consist of asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation due to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardization.

This decrease may be attributed to factors such as market saturation or competitive pressures.\n\nAranesp® experienced a more substantial decline in the U.S. market, with sales dropping by 17% in 2020 relative to 2019. This significant decrease aligns with the broader trend of declining sales for Aranesp® due to competition from both long-acting ESAs and biosimilar versions of EPOGEN? [1].\n\nIn contrast, KYPROLIS® saw a modest increase in U.S. sales, rising by 9% in 2020 compared to 2019.

These changes reflect strategic decisions related to investment in research and development, expansion of user base, and management of marketing and administrative costs.\n\nThe **cost of revenues** increased significantly over the three years. In 2019, service costs made up 89.3% of total cost of revenues at RMB14,967 million, while other costs accounted for 10.7% at RMB1,794 million. By 2021, service costs had risen to RMB18,992 million (or US$2,980 million), representing 87.0% of total cost of revenues, while other costs increased to RMB2,848 million (or US$447 million), contributing 13.0% [2]. This increase in both service and other costs is consistent with the company’s growth in operations and user engagement, as seen in image2.\n\nIn terms of **operating expenses**, there was a clear shift in allocation between selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. In 2019, selling and marketing expenses represented 43.0% of total operating expenses at RMB2,041 million, while general and administrative expenses accounted for 57.0% at RMB2,703 million [image3]. By 2021, these proportions had shifted: selling and marketing expenses decreased slightly to 40.0% of total operating expenses at RMB2,678 million (US$420 million), while general and administrative expenses rose to 60.0% at RMB4,009 million (US$629 million). This suggests that the company may have been allocating more resources toward administrative and research-related functions, which aligns with the emphasis on R&D and operational efficiency mentioned in text quote [3].\n\nAdditionally, **R&D expenses** grew steadily from RMB1,159 million in 2019 to RMB2,339 million (US$367 million) in 2021 [1], indicating a strong commitment to innovation and product development.

While it doesn't explicitly mention years, the context of the surrounding text—particularly quote [2], which references \"During 2018 Consolidated Subsidiaries\"—suggests that these numbers may span multiple years. Additionally, quote [6] states that a table summarizes average production prices and costs by geographic area and product type for the last three years, likely including 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n\nQuote [5] and [8] describe the categories of data included in such tables, specifically mentioning \"crude oil, per barrel\" and \"NGL, per barrel.\" This confirms that the data is relevant to the question.

This increase suggests that IBM was investing in long-term assets, which can be indicative of a strategic move to support future revenue generation or operational expansion. However, this also implies that IBM may have required additional financing to fund these assets, which is reflected in the changes to long-term debt.\n\nLong-term debt for Global Financing decreased from $24,727 million in 2019 to $21,167 million in 2020, primarily due to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets [6]. This reduction in debt could signal improved efficiency in managing financing obligations or a shift in the company’s capital structure towards equity or other forms of financing. The total company debt also decreased slightly from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020 [4], indicating a broader trend of debt reduction across the organization.\n\nFrom a cash flow perspective, financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 [10]. This shift reflects the company’s increased reliance on cash outflows for financing activities, possibly due to the investment in noncurrent assets. Additionally, operating activities provided positive cash flow of $18,197 million in 2020, up from $14,770 million in 2019 [3], suggesting that core operations remained strong and contributed positively to liquidity.\n\nEquity, however, decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments [7]. Despite this decrease, net income contributed positively to equity, increasing it by $5,590 million. This highlights the balance between profitability and dividend distributions, with the latter impacting the overall equity position.\n\n![Noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million in 2020, reflecting IBM's investment in long-term assets](image2)\n\n![Global Financing debt decreased from $24,727 million in 2019 to $21,167 million in 2020, indicating a reduction in financing obligations](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in noncurrent assets and the corresponding decrease in long-term debt suggest that IBM was strategically managing its capital structure while maintaining strong operational performance.

This decline was primarily driven by the impact of the pandemic, with spending for travel and entertainment remaining significantly lower than in 2019. However, debit card purchase volumes increased by $\\S23.8$ billion to $\\S384.5$ billion, indicating that consumers may have shifted from using credit cards to debit cards for everyday transactions, possibly due to a more cautious financial approach amid economic uncertainty [6]. Additionally, outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased by $\\S18.9$ billion to $\\S78.7$ billion in 2020 due to lower retail spending and higher payments [4]. These trends suggest that consumers were reducing their reliance on credit cards and paying down existing balances, likely as a response to reduced income or increased financial prudence.\n\nRegarding home equity, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $\\S5.9$ billion in 2020, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [9].

Similarly, a US$1 per ton increase in energy coal price impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million [1]. These figures highlight the sensitivity of BHP’s coal operations to market price movements. The financial data from FY2021 also shows a significant decline in revenue and underlying EBITDA for Queensland Coal, partly due to lower prices and increased costs, including maintenance and stripping expenses [2].\n\n![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million](image1)\n\nRegarding nickel, a US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million [1]. This underscores the direct relationship between nickel prices and BHP’s profitability. In FY2021, the nickel price was influenced by strong investor sentiment and a rebound in end-use demand, although there were brief corrections due to announcements about production shifts in Indonesia [10].\n\nKey drivers behind these impacts include not only the fluctuating market prices of commodities but also factors such as exchange rate movements, maintenance and operational costs, and global supply chain dynamics. For instance, unfavourable exchange rate movements and increased contractor costs have partially offset the benefits of higher prices and volumes in Nickel West [1].

This decline was attributed to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances due to soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of the student loan portfolio, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization [3].  \n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income saw a dramatic increase, rising from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, an increase of $5,120 million or 104% [image1]. This growth was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income [9]. \n\nThe combined effect of these changes resulted in a significant increase in total revenue.

This increase, which raised issued capital by €53 million, was part of a broader effort to finance the acquisition of Varian [6]. The capital increase was executed through the partial utilization of the Authorized Capital 2021, with new shares placed with institutional investors at a price of €44.10 per share [7].

This growth was partly driven by the net income for the year and the offsetting effect of dividend distributions. Specifically, the dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020 decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million, but this negative effect was more than offset by net income for the year, resulting in an increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million overall [9].\n\n![Increase in equity from 2020 to 2021](image4)\n\nMoreover, the capital reserves under Section 272 (2) number 4 of the German Commercial Code were used again in fiscal year 2021 to acquire treasury shares, of which 5,328,965 were held as of September 30, 2021 [9]. This highlights the company's active management of its equity structure, including the use of reserves for treasury share acquisitions.\n\nThe equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, primarily due to the significant increase in loan liabilities.

This rise in cost per Boe can be attributed to various factors, including lower production volumes and potential increases in operational expenses.\n\n![Petroleum production for FY2021 decreased to 103 MMboe compared to 109 MMboe in FY2020](image5)\n![Cost per Boe increased from $9.74 in FY2020 to $10.83 in FY2021](image5)\n\nThe trend indicates that while the company faced challenges with production levels, the cost per unit of production also rose, suggesting a possible impact on overall profitability unless offset by higher realised prices or improved efficiency measures. \n\nIn summary, petroleum production decreased from 109 MMboe in FY2020 to 103 MMboe in FY2021, and the cost per Boe increased from $9.74 to $10.83 during the same period."}

In 2018, the company reported a **net income** of $8,394 million, which dropped to $7,842 million in 2019 and further declined to $7,264 million in 2020 [5]. Similarly, **comprehensive income**, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (OCI), was $8,313 million in 2018, rose slightly to $8,083 million in 2019, and then fell to $6,807 million in 2020 [image1].\n\nThe decline in net income over this period suggests that the company's core business operations may have faced challenges, such as increased operating expenses or reduced revenues. This is supported by data from the income statement, where total revenues increased from $23,747 million in 2018 to $25,424 million in 2020, but operating expenses also rose significantly, from $13,484 million in 2018 to $16,285 million in 2020 [image5]. The increase in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth, contributing to lower net income.\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income figures reflect not only net income but also gains and losses from other sources, such as foreign currency translation, cash flow hedges, and available-for-sale securities. For instance, in 2019, there was a significant gain on available-for-sale securities of $360 million, which boosted comprehensive income. However, in 2020, this was offset by a loss of $21 million on these securities, along with losses on cash flow hedges, resulting in a drop in comprehensive income [image1].\n\nThese changes suggest that while the company maintained profitability, its financial performance became less stable, with greater volatility in comprehensive income due to fluctuations in investment-related gains and losses. The decrease in net income might indicate pressure on the company’s operational efficiency or external factors affecting its profitability.\n\n![Comprehensive income and net income for 2018, 2019, and 2020](image1)"}

In 2018, total capital expenditures amounted to $2,742 million, with the largest portion allocated to existing restaurants ($2,111 million). By 2019, this figure dropped to $2,394 million, with expenditures for existing restaurants decreasing to $1,702 million. The most significant reduction occurred in 2020, where total capital expenditures fell to $1,641 million, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants as a result of the **COVID-19** pandemic [3]. Specifically, expenditures on existing restaurants in 2020 were only $1,060 million, a sharp decrease compared to previous years. New restaurant investments also declined, with expenditures dropping from $488 million in 2018 to $535 million in 2019 and then to $605 million in 2020 [4].\n\n![Capital expenditures decreased significantly from 2018 to 2020, particularly in existing restaurant reinvestment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic](image4)\n\nRegarding **shareholder returns**, McDonald's demonstrated a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

However, in 2020, despite a significant drop in capital expenditures, the company returned $4,627 million to shareholders, with $3,753 million in dividends and $874 million in treasury stock purchases [5]. This highlights the company’s focus on maintaining dividend payments even during challenging economic times, as evidenced by the increase in the quarterly dividend per share by 3% to $1.29 in the fourth quarter of 2020, equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.16 per share [1].\n\n![McDonald's returned significant amounts to shareholders across 2018 to 2020, with a notable shift toward dividends in 2020](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's capital expenditures declined steadily from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to reduced reinvestment in existing restaurants and the impact of the **COVID-19** pandemic, while shareholder returns remained robust, with a notable emphasis on dividends in 2020."}

One of these is **foreign currency translation**, which includes beginning and ending balances, along with adjustments for income tax benefits or expenses and portions attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, **cash flow hedges** contribute to AOCL, with unrealized gains and losses being recorded and later reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur. For example, during fiscal 2020, net gains of $48,545 were reclassified into Cost of services, compared to $48,333 in 2019 [1]. This indicates a slight increase in the reclassification of gains from cash flow hedges into earnings over the two years.\n\nAnother component of AOCL is **defined benefit plans**, which include actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs, and pension settlement adjustments. These factors influence the balance of AOCL and reflect changes in the company's long-term obligations and assumptions related to employee benefits. \n\nFurthermore, **investments** also contribute to AOCL through unrealized gains and losses. These gains or losses are not immediately recognized in net income but instead affect the equity section of the balance sheet until the investments are sold or deemed impaired.\n\nRegarding **property and equipment**, the data presented in image3 shows significant growth in both gross and net values between fiscal 2019 and 2020.

Specifically, at the end of fiscal 2023, the domestic segment included 14,393 thousand square feet of leased locations and 3,168 thousand square feet of owned locations [1]. Additionally, there were 922 leased locations and 24 owned locations within the domestic segment, with 32 locations categorized as \"owned buildings and leased land\" [image5].\n\nFor the international segment, the ownership distribution differs significantly.

In terms of the number of locations, there were 153 leased locations and only 3 owned locations internationally, with 4 locations categorized as \"owned buildings and leased land\" [image5]. This highlights that the international operations are largely based on leased spaces rather than owned properties.\n\nMoreover, the international segment primarily consists of operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, and Geek Squad [9].

Additionally, references to net income attributable to Costco and related metrics suggest that comprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive income items not directly tied to operations, such as foreign currency translation adjustments or unrealized gains/losses on investments.\n\nLooking at **image2**, which provides a summary of financial figures for the fiscal years ending August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, we see concluding figures at the bottom of the table: $10,203 for 2022, $11,258 for 2021, and $12,277 for 2020. These figures likely represent comprehensive income or a closely related metric, given their placement and context. \n\nThis suggests a **declining trend** in comprehensive income over the three years, with values decreasing from $12,277 in 2020 to $11,258 in 2021, and further to $10,203 in 2022.

This issuance directly contributed to an increase in total stockholders' equity by boosting the preferred stock component and additional paid-in capital. Similarly, in 2019, Danaher issued MCPS Series A, which also contributed to its equity base [5].\n\nThis is further reflected in **image1**, which shows a detailed breakdown of equity components from 2018 to 2020. The preferred stock balance increased notably in both 2019 and 2020 due to these issuances. Additionally, the additional paid-in capital also rose significantly, reflecting the proceeds from the issuance of both common and preferred stock, including conversions and acquisitions [1].\n\nFrom a cash flow perspective, **image5** highlights that financing activities in 2020 included substantial proceeds from the issuance of common stock and MCPS Series B. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and temporarily invested in short-term bank deposits or investment-grade securities [2]. As a result, the company’s total stockholders’ equity grew over the period, as evidenced by **image2**, which shows an increase in total stockholders’ equity from $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020. This growth aligns with the increased equity components seen in **image1**.\n\nMoreover, **image3** indicates that net earnings and retained earnings also played a role in increasing stockholders' equity, but the significant contributions came from the financing activities related to the issuance of MCPS and common stock.\n\n![Increase in preferred stock and additional paid-in capital due to MCPS issuance](image1)  \n![Growth in total stockholders' equity from 2019 to 2020](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and positive cash flows from financing activities had a substantial and direct impact on Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity, contributing to its growth from 2018 to 2020."}

This overall decline was influenced by several factors, including foreign exchange effects and divestitures. However, the specific market with the highest percentage decrease in sales in CHF needs to be identified.\n\nLooking at the data from image1, which provides a detailed breakdown of the percentage changes in sales for various principal markets in both CHF and local currencies, we can observe that some markets experienced significant declines. For example, Japan saw a sales decline, as noted in the text [9], and this is also reflected in the table. Additionally, Brazil showed a decline in local currency terms, though it's not explicitly stated whether this translates to a large decrease in CHF terms.\n\nThe table in image1 reveals that the total percentage difference across all markets was -8.9%, but individual markets may have experienced more pronounced decreases. Notably, Japan is highlighted as having seen a sales decline, and this aligns with the broader context of out-of-home channel impacts and reduced demand for certain products like KitKat due to fewer inbound tourists [9].\n\n![Japan saw a sales decline in 2020, reflecting reduced demand for products like KitKat due to fewer inbound tourists](image1)"}

These structures are designed to reward executives and management based on achieving specific financial targets, such as EBIT growth, over a defined performance period. The exact percentage of incentives that become exercisable depends on the level of EBIT growth achieved.\n\nFor instance, one table outlines that if EBIT growth is less than a specified threshold, no percentage of the award is exercisable [Nil] (image3). However, if there is 24% compound growth in EBIT, then 10% of the incentives become exercisable, and at 25% growth, this increases to 20%. Notably, at 26% compound growth, the full 100% of the incentives are exercisable (image3). This tiered structure ensures that higher levels of EBIT growth result in greater rewards for the individuals involved.\n\nAnother table shows a similar but slightly different structure, where at 17.5% compound growth in EBIT, 40% of incentives are awarded, rising to 60% at 20%, 80% at 22.5%, and reaching 100% at 25% growth (image4). This illustrates how the company may use varying thresholds and percentages depending on the specific plan or year.\n\nThese structures are consistent with the broader remuneration policy of the company, which emphasizes long-term incentives tied to performance metrics like EBIT growth. As stated in the text, \"The Company’s remuneration policy for KMP is currently focused on long term incentives only, and as a result no short term incentives are included within remuneration for KMP\" [1]. This aligns with the use of performance-based options and rights that vest based on achieving pre-determined financial targets.\n\n![EBIT growth determines the percentage of incentives exercisable, with higher growth resulting in greater rewards.](image3)"}

According to the financial data, Chevron reported a **net income of $15,689 million in 2021**, compared to a **net loss of $5,561 million in 2020** [4]. This marked turnaround was primarily driven by several key factors:\n\n- **Higher upstream realizations**: The company benefited from increased revenue in its upstream operations, which are related to oil and gas exploration and production.\n- **Higher downstream margins**: In the downstream segment, which involves refining and marketing, Chevron saw improved profitability.\n- **Absence of impairments and write-offs**: In 2020, Chevron recorded significant impairments and write-offs, which negatively impacted its results. These were absent in 2021, contributing positively to its net income.\n- **Increased U.S. income before tax**: U.S. income before tax rose from a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020 to an income of $9.67 billion in 2021, which had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax, resulting in an increase in tax expense [4].\n\nIn addition to net income, Chevron’s **comprehensive income** also saw a dramatic improvement. Comprehensive income includes not only net income but also other comprehensive income items such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, and actuarial gains or losses on defined benefit plans.\n\nChevron’s **comprehensive income for 2021 was $17,412 million**, compared to a **comprehensive loss of $1,253 million in 2020** [4].

It underscores how Chevron managed to turn around its financial performance in 2021, largely due to operational improvements, absence of one-time charges, and favorable market conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income improved significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher operational performance, the absence of impairments, and favorable market conditions."}

Additionally, there was growth in the NBCUniversal segments, driven by increased revenue in the Media, Theme Parks, and Studios segments [9].\n\nThe waterfall chart in image1 illustrates this financial progression, showing that the starting revenue for 2020 was $72,971 million, and the final figure for 2021 reached $81,764 million. This increase was fueled by a $1,450 million contribution from the Cable Communications Segment, a $6,788 million contribution from the NBCUniversal Segments, and a $1,285 million contribution from the Sky Segment. However, adjustments and eliminations reduced the total by $730 million.\n\nAnother waterfall chart in image2 provides additional context, with a starting point of $103,564 million for 2020 and an endpoint of $116,385 million for 2021. Here, the Cable Communications Segment contributed an increase of $4,277 million, while the NBCUniversal Segments contributed $7,108 million, and the Sky Segment added $1,691 million.

This is highlighted in the conceptual diagram from Toyota, which emphasizes the importance of developing reliable batteries with high performance and safety [1]. The evolution of battery control models ensures that these essential qualities are maintained while also enabling improvements in efficiency and cost reduction.\n\nIn addition to safety and quality, the development of battery control models is closely tied to reducing battery costs. As illustrated in the diagram discussing battery cost targets, one of the key strategies involves enhancing battery control models to ensure safety, security, and longevity [2]. These advancements in control models allow for more precise management of battery functions, leading to better performance and reduced degradation over time.\n\nThis aligns with Toyota’s broader strategy of improving the service life of batteries. For example, the C-HR BEV has been designed with a much higher capacity retention rate after 10 years compared to previous PHEVs, demonstrating the company's commitment to long service life [3]. Similarly, the Toyota bZ4X aims for a 90 percent endurance performance, one of the highest in the world [3].\n\nMoreover, the development of next-generation lithium-ion batteries, as outlined in the image focusing on future battery aims, includes improvements in energy density, compact size, and lower costs [4]. These advancements are supported by innovations in both liquid-based battery materials and all-solid-state batteries, further emphasizing the need for advanced battery control models to manage these new technologies effectively [4].\n\nFinally, the timeline of Toyota's BEV development underscores the company's continuous efforts to refine battery technology through years of HEV advancements [5].

First, the company’s **premium revenues** grew significantly over this period, rising from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020 [2]. This increase reflects the expansion of UnitedHealth Group’s health insurance and healthcare services businesses, particularly in Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, where the company benefits from CMS risk adjustment methodologies that provide higher payments for enrollees with more complex health conditions [5]. Additionally, the company’s ability to estimate and manage its medical costs payable and goodwill has allowed it to make more accurate financial projections, reducing volatility in earnings [4].\n\nAnother key driver of net earnings is the **medical loss ratio (MLR)**, which affects rebates and premium adjustments under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). UnitedHealth Group’s ability to manage these ratios effectively, along with its diversified business model across Optum and United Healthcare, contributes to stable and growing profitability [6].\n\nRegarding **comprehensive income**, the increase from 2018 to 2020 was influenced by **unrealized gains on investment securities** and **foreign currency translation effects**.

These gains reflect the performance of the company’s investment portfolio and market conditions during the respective periods. However, foreign currency translation losses also played a role, decreasing comprehensive income in each year, with the largest impact in 2018 at ($1,242) million [3].\n\n![Net earnings increased from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,769 million in 2020](image3)  \n![Comprehensive income rose from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020](image3)\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group experienced steady growth in both net earnings and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020, driven primarily by increasing premium revenues, effective management of medical costs, and favorable investment returns, despite challenges related to foreign currency translation."}

This growth may reflect strategic investments in long-term projects or assets that are expected to generate future benefits for the company. \n\nSimultaneously, **long-term debt** saw a modest increase, rising from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020. While this change is relatively small, it suggests that the company has maintained a stable level of long-term borrowing, possibly to support ongoing operations or new initiatives without significantly increasing its debt burden.\n\nThe most significant change was observed in **noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt)**, which increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020. This rise could be attributed to various factors, such as an increase in deferred tax liabilities, pension obligations, or other long-term commitments. Such liabilities might indicate a shift in the company’s financial strategy toward more long-term planning or adjustments in its accounting policies.\n\nThese changes collectively suggest that IBM is managing its capital structure with caution. The slight increase in long-term debt and noncurrent liabilities, paired with a rise in noncurrent assets, indicates a balanced approach to leveraging long-term financing while investing in future growth opportunities. This aligns with the company's broader strategy of maintaining strong liquidity and deleveraging over time, as noted in text quote [1], where IBM emphasizes its ability to operate at a single A credit rating despite ongoing financial management efforts.\n\n![Noncurrent assets increased to $116,806 million in 2020, long-term debt rose slightly to $54,355 million, and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) grew to $41,020 million](image2)"}

According to the data provided in image4, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 11.5% in 2020 and further declined to 10.7% in 2021. This indicates a downward trend over the two-year period.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decline. First, as noted in text quote [4], interest income decreased primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances. This suggests that card members were paying off their loans more frequently, reducing the average outstanding balance and, consequently, the overall interest income generated.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [1] supports this explanation, stating that net interest income decreased primarily due to a decline in interest income driven by lower revolving Card Member loan balances, partially offset by lower cost of funds. While the cost of funds may have decreased, the reduction in loan balances had a more significant impact on the net interest yield.\n\nThese changes are also reflected in image2, which shows that total Card Member loans increased slightly from $87.4 billion in 2019 to $88.6 billion in 2021. However, the average loan balance per member may have decreased due to higher paydown rates, contributing to the decline in net interest yield despite the slight increase in total loan volume.\n\n![Net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021](image4)"}

However, this growth was not sustained into 2020, where ENBREL sales dropped by 4% to $4,996 million [4]. This decline was primarily driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory [4]. Additionally, ENBREL has been losing market share over time, a trend that has been exacerbated by the reduced growth rate of the rheumatology market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. The effect of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification, and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients worked through deductibles also contributed to the expected lower sales in the first quarter of 2021 relative to subsequent quarters [4].\n\n![ENBREL sales decreased by 4% in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)\n\nIn contrast, **Prolia** demonstrated more consistent growth across the years.

The increase in 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price [5]. However, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the demand for Prolia during 2020, as patient visits were disrupted, altering the timing of semiannual doses and reducing new diagnoses of osteoporosis [6]. Despite these challenges, historical demand patterns may continue to be affected by the pandemic in 2021 [6].\n\n![Prolia sales increased by 3% in 2020 compared to 2019](image5)\n\nIn summary, while ENBREL experienced a decline in sales due to market competition, pricing pressures, and the effects of the pandemic, Prolia maintained positive growth, albeit with some disruptions attributed to the same pandemic-related factors."}

In contrast, by December 31, 2020, the fair value impact increased significantly to $59 million at year-end, with an average of $78 million, a high of $136 million, and a low of $54 million [4]. This indicates a substantial rise in exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations during 2020, likely influenced by the volatility introduced by the global economic environment, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [5].\n\nSimilarly, for **interest rates**, the fair value impact was $301 million at year-end in 2019, with an average of $247 million, a high of $346 million, and a low of $169 million [4]. By December 31, 2020, this figure rose sharply to $180 million at year-end, with an average of $445 million, a high of $1,146 million, and a low of $180 million [4]. The increase in the average and high values reflects heightened sensitivity to interest rate movements in 2020, which can be attributed to the broader economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic [5].\n\nThese changes highlight the growing exposure of the company's financial instruments to both foreign currency and interest rate risks during 2020 compared to 2019.

This is further supported by quote [6], which states that the gross margin in core merchandise categories decreased by **27 basis points** across all categories, with the most significant drop in fresh foods.\n  \n- The **LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs** also played a role, contributing an additional **19 basis points** to the decline in gross margin [5].\n\n- **Gasoline price inflation** had a complex effect on gross margin. While higher gasoline prices increased net sales (as seen in quote [7], where gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230), they also negatively impacted gross margin percentage due to the higher sales base [2]. However, the impact of gasoline prices on net sales was excluded when calculating the gross margin percentage, which decreased by **19 basis points** in 2022 compared to 2021 [5].\n\n- The **increase in 2% rewards** added a **one-basis-point negative impact** on gross margin [5].\n\n- On the positive side, **warehouse ancillary and other businesses**, such as gasoline sales, contributed **29 basis points** to gross margin [5].

In contrast, other buildings have a shorter useful life of 5 to 10 years, suggesting they may be more specialized or subject to quicker obsolescence.\n\nTechnical machinery and equipment generally have a useful life of 10 years, highlighting the relatively rapid pace at which such equipment may need replacement due to technological advancements or wear and tear.

This growth was driven by changes in exposure across several key sectors.\n\nThe largest contributors to the increase in exposure were the **Financials** and **Real estate** sectors. Financials saw an increase from $40,992 million in 2019 to $44,358 million in 2020, while Real estate exposure increased from $28,348 million in 2019 to $25,484 million in 2020. Although Real estate exposure decreased slightly, it remained a significant component of the overall portfolio. Other sectors that showed increases included **Industrials**, **Consumer discretionary**, **Energy**, and **Information technology**, with each contributing to the overall rise in exposure [3].\n\nAdditionally, the data indicates that the growth in exposure was not limited to specific loan types but spanned across various categories, including corporate loans, secured lending facilities, and commercial real estate loans [9]. The increase in total exposure is also consistent with the broader context of growth in securities-based loans and residential real estate loans within the Wealth Management business segment, as well as an increase in relationship lending commitments within the Institutional Securities segment [7].\n\n![Total exposure increased from $168,518 million in 2019 to $176,632 million in 2020](image3)"}

According to image3, the IFRS results for Gross Profit were $32,218 million, while the Core Results were $35,981 million. This increase was largely driven by adjustments made to the Cost of Goods Sold. Specifically, the adjustments included:\n\n- **Amortization of intangible assets:** $3,419 million\n- **Other items:** $344 million\n\nThese adjustments effectively reduced the Cost of Goods Sold under IFRS, thereby increasing the Gross Profit to arrive at the core result. The original IFRS Cost of Goods Sold was -$11,751 million, and after applying the adjustments, it became -$7,988 million, contributing significantly to the higher core gross profit.\n\nIn contrast, image2 provides data for 2020. For that year, the IFRS Gross Profit was $4,636 million, and the Core Results were $5,279 million. Adjustments to the Cost of Goods Sold included:\n\n- **Amortization of intangible assets:** $366 million\n- **Impairments:** $127 million\n- **Acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items:** $22 million\n- **Other items:** $128 million\n\nThe total adjustments amounted to $649 million, which similarly increased the Gross Profit from the IFRS value to the core result. In this case, the original IFRS Cost of Goods Sold was -$5,252 million, and after adjustments, it became -$4,609 million.\n\nBoth years show that adjustments to the Cost of Goods Sold had a positive impact on core gross profit by reducing the cost base. However, the magnitude of these adjustments was greater in 2020 compared to 2021, which contributed to a larger increase in core gross profit for 2020.\n\n![Adjustments to Cost of Goods Sold in 2021](image3)  \n![Adjustments to Cost of Goods Sold in 2020](image2)\n\nThe adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' positively impacted the core gross profit in both 2021 and 2020, with a more significant effect observed in 2020."}

Their differing positions influence not only their responsibilities but also their financial benefits and voting power.\n\nIn terms of **compensation**, Marc Fogassa received a salary of $16,500 in 2019 and $37,500 in 2020, with no additional awards or bonuses during these periods [image3]. In contrast, Roger Noriega’s compensation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, consisted solely of option awards valued at $50,000, with no cash fees or stock awards [image1]. This suggests that while both individuals receive compensation tied to their roles, Fogassa's compensation is more directly tied to his executive position, whereas Noriega’s compensation reflects a directorship role with equity-based incentives.\n\nRegarding **stock ownership**, Marc Fogassa holds a significant amount of both Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock. He beneficially owns 323,739,052 shares of Common Stock, representing 12.70% of the class and contributing 6.22% to the total voting power [image2]. Additionally, he holds the sole outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock, giving him 100% of the Series A class and 51% of the total voting power [image2].

This represents an increase of approximately 202% in basic earnings per share.\n\nThis substantial increase can be attributed to several contributing factors outlined in the provided quotes and tables. First, the Group’s equity increased by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020 [3], which likely contributed to higher earnings. Additionally, income from associated companies surged to USD 15.3 billion in 2021 from USD 673 million in the prior year, primarily due to the gain of USD 14.6 billion recognized on the divestment of the investment in Roche [4].\n\nFurthermore, image2 shows that total basic earnings per share increased from USD 3.55 in 2020 to USD 10.71 in 2021, a 202% increase, aligning with the textual information. The table also indicates that this increase was driven by a significant rise in income before taxes from continuing operations, which grew from USD 9,878 million to USD 26,137 million, and a corresponding increase in net income from USD 8,071 million to USD 24,018 million [image2].\n\n![Total basic earnings per share increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image2)"}

Let’s explore these changes based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, looking at **non-current assets**, the balance increased from DKK 63,156 million in 2019 to DKK 79,113 million in 2020 [5]. This substantial growth was primarily driven by an increase in intangible assets, which rose from DKK 5,835 million to DKK 20,657 million. The significant rise in intangible assets is likely attributed to investments in research and development projects, as indicated by note 5, which mentions that intangible assets not yet being amortised amounted to DKK 9,607 million in 2020, primarily related to patents and licenses from R&D initiatives. ![Intangible assets increased significantly in 2020](image5). This investment suggests a strategic focus on innovation and long-term growth.\n\nIn addition to intangible assets, other non-current assets such as property, plant, and equipment remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations. However, the overall increase in non-current assets indicates a stronger capital base and potential for future revenue generation through these long-term resources.\n\nNow, examining **total equity**, the balance rose from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020 [3]. This increase can be attributed to retained earnings, which grew from DKK 57,817 million to DKK 63,774 million. This growth reflects the company's profitability, as net profit for 2020 was DKK 42,138 million [4], contributing to higher retained earnings. Additionally, the statement of changes in equity shows that while dividends were paid out, the net profit and other comprehensive income items still resulted in a positive change in equity [image1].\n\nThe increase in both non-current assets and total equity implies that the company has strengthened its financial position by investing in long-term assets and retaining more profits. This supports greater financial stability and capacity for future expansion or debt servicing.\n\nIn summary, the rise in non-current assets, particularly intangible assets, combined with an increase in total equity, reflects a robust financial position in 2020 compared to 2019, indicating a company that is investing in its long-term growth and maintaining strong profitability."}

Specifically, it mentions that \"the total committed credit facilities amount to $7.25 billion\" [3], which includes multiple revolving credit facilities with varying expiration dates and amounts. These facilities provide flexibility for short-term borrowing needs while maintaining access to capital without triggering collateral requirements or restrictive covenants [9]. This suggests a strategic approach to managing liquidity by ensuring access to credit under favorable terms.\n\nIn addition, the company’s total long-term debt was reported at \\$31.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 [10]. This figure highlights the company’s reliance on long-term financing, which is primarily fixed-rate in nature, providing stability against interest rate fluctuations. The weighted-average all-in financing cost of this debt was relatively low at 2.4% in 2020, indicating a favorable cost of capital and potentially strong creditworthiness.\n\nTo further contextualize these figures, we can look at image3, which summarizes the committed credit facilities: ![Committed credit facilities include a 364-day facility of $1.75 billion, a multi-year facility of $3.50 billion, and another multi-year facility of $2.00 billion](image3). \n\nSimilarly, image2 provides a breakdown of the company’s long-term liabilities, including long-term debt of $31,552 million: ![Long-term debt is listed as $31,552 million in the table, highlighting the significant portion of the company’s financial obligations](image2).\n\nThese figures collectively reflect a balanced financial liabilities strategy. The company maintains a substantial amount of long-term debt but also secures committed credit facilities to ensure liquidity and flexibility. Additionally, the company’s strong credit ratings (as seen in image5) support its ability to manage debt effectively: ![The company holds stable long-term credit ratings from Moody’s (A2), Standard & Poor’s (A), and Fitch (A), indicating confidence in its financial stability](image5).\n\nIn conclusion, the total committed credit facilities amount to $7.25 billion, and the total long-term debt stands at \\$31.5 billion, both of which reflect a strategic approach to managing financial liabilities by balancing long-term financing with accessible credit facilities and maintaining strong credit ratings."}

This is further supported by image1, which shows net interest income declining from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, representing a significant drop [image1](image1). The decline was partially offset by lower costs of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt, but these effects were not enough to reverse the overall downward trend.\n\nIn contrast, **total loans** also saw a decrease during this period, as noted in the text quote: \"Total loans (average) decreased driven by lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets\" [5].

This decline suggests that the company either experienced lower profitability or increased dividend distributions during this period. The reduction in retained earnings is further supported by the data in image4, which shows a decrease in retained earnings by $386 million between the two years [image4].\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) also experienced a notable decline, dropping from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021. AOCI includes items such as foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on debt securities, and pension-related adjustments. In particular, foreign currency translation adjustments were a significant contributor, decreasing from $(2,229) million in 2020 to $(2,392) million in 2021 [image4]. This indicates that the company faced adverse impacts from currency fluctuations, likely due to its global operations. Additionally, net unrealized gains on debt securities declined from $65 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021, reflecting a shift in market conditions affecting the valuation of these investments [image4].\n\nThese changes in both retained earnings and AOCI collectively contributed to a decrease in total shareholders’ equity, which dropped from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021 [image4].

In this case, the consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 28 June 2020 shows that the Group’s net cash flow from operating activities, adjusted to remove the impact of AASB 16, was $48.9m [9]. This indicates that despite the challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the company maintained a positive cash flow from its operational activities. This cash flow contributes to the overall liquidity of the company, which in turn supports its ability to reinvest or distribute profits, thereby influencing retained earnings.\n\nRetained earnings are a critical component of total equity, as they represent the cumulative profits that have been reinvested in the business rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends. The consolidated statement of changes in equity reveals that retained earnings began at $43,352 (in thousands) in July 2018 and underwent adjustments due to profit, changes in accounting policy, and dividends over the period [3]. These adjustments directly influence the total equity figure, which increased from $45,242 to $58,368 (in thousands) over the same period [3].\n\nAdditionally, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income highlights that profit after tax decreased from $37,043,000 in 2019 to $11,221,000 in 2020 [4]. This decline in profitability would likely result in lower retained earnings, which could affect the growth of total equity. However, the increase in foreign currency translation reserves, which rose from $124 to $2,780 (in thousands), also contributed positively to total equity [3].\n\n![The table shows the equity attributable to the equity holders of a company over the period from July 2, 2018, to June 28, 2020, with an increase in total equity from $45,242 to $58,368.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the cash flow from operating activities supported the company's liquidity, while changes in retained earnings—driven by profit levels and dividend policies—directly influenced the growth of total equity from July 2018 to June 2020."}

In 1998, the majority of investments were concentrated in the **Seed** stage, accounting for 78% of the total with 21 investments [image1]. This suggests that during this period, venture capital firms were more inclined to invest in very early-stage startups, likely due to the initial enthusiasm and availability of capital in the market.\n\nBy 2007, however, there was a clear shift in focus. The proportion of Seed-stage investments had dropped dramatically to just 10%, while **Early Stage** investments rose sharply to 74%, with 14 investments [image1].

Additionally, **Mid-Stage** investments also increased slightly to 16%, compared to only 4% in 1998. \n\nThis change in investment strategy could be attributed to several factors. First, the post-bubble environment in Europe led to a scarcity of venture capital money, which forced investors to become more selective and focus on higher-potential opportunities [4]. Second, as the European venture ecosystem matured, early-stage companies began to scale faster and achieve greater value sooner, making them more attractive targets for investment [7].\n\n![Shift in Investment Stages](image1)"}

This trend has shown little change over the past few years, indicating a consistent pattern of party affiliation among this demographic [8].\n\nHowever, despite this overall alignment, there is a notable level of uncertainty regarding future party identification. A 2021 Pew Research Center study highlighted that a significant portion of Latino voters have soft ties to the political parties, suggesting that while many currently align with the Democrats, their long-term affiliations may not be firmly set [2].\n\nIn terms of perceptions of differences between the parties, image2 illustrates that a majority of Hispanics believe there is a \"great deal of difference\" between the two major parties. Specifically, 45% of all Hispanics perceive a great deal of difference, while 36% see a fair amount of difference, and only 16% believe there is hardly any difference at all [image2]. This perception is slightly higher among those who lean Republican (48% perceive a great deal of difference) compared to those who lean Democratic (47%) [image2].\n\nThese findings suggest that while Latino voters largely favor the Democratic Party, they remain aware of the distinctions between the two major parties, which may influence their voting behavior and policy preferences. Additionally, as seen in image4, the importance of certain issues—such as abortion—has increased significantly over time, reflecting evolving priorities that could further shape voter alignment and party perception [image4].\n\n![Hispanic voters perceive a significant difference between the Democratic and Republican parties](image2)\n\n![The importance of issues like abortion has increased significantly for Hispanic voters over time](image4)"}

This is significantly higher than **XL**, which had **58.3 million subscribers**, and **Indosat**, which had **54.2 million subscribers** [4]. These figures suggest that Telkomsel maintained a dominant market share in terms of total subscriptions, while XL and Indosat followed closely behind.\n\nIn terms of **data users**, the trend is similar but slightly different. **Telkomsel** had **63.5 million data users**, far outpacing both XL and Indosat. **XL** reported **32 million data users**, and **Indosat** had **29 million data users** [4]. The disparity between Telkomsel’s data user base and those of its competitors highlights its stronger position in the data-driven services segment.\n\nThis performance aligns with broader trends in Indonesia's telecommunications industry. As noted in the text, by early 2014, there were **240 million mobile subscribers**, and the growth rate remained consistent throughout the year [3]. Additionally, the rise of **data-based communication methods such as instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP)** has led to reduced usage of SMS and voice calls, which in turn has contributed to **lower ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** [5] and [10]. This decline in revenue per user could be one reason why operators are focusing more on increasing their data user bases to maintain profitability.\n\n![Telkomsel leads in subscribers and data users](image4)  \n![Prepaid ARPU decline over time](image1)\n\nThe shift toward data usage also reflects changing consumer behavior, where **instant messaging** has become the primary method of communication for most mobile users [8]. With WhatsApp, BBM, and LINE dominating the IM landscape, it's likely that telecom operators are adapting their strategies to accommodate this trend, emphasizing data plans and partnerships with smartphone vendors [2].\n\nIn conclusion, from 2013–2014 to late 2014, **Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat all saw strong subscriber and data user growth**, with Telkomsel maintaining the largest lead in both categories.

However, there are significant differences in perception based on political affiliation and ideology.\n\nRepublicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe the U.S.’s international influence will be strengthened as a result of the crisis, whereas Democrats are about four times more likely than Republicans to expect American influence to weaken after the outbreak [7].

This disparity highlights the unequal treatment women face in these environments.\n\nOne of the most common forms of discrimination reported by women in STEM is earning less than a man doing the same job (29%) and being treated as if they are not competent because of their gender (29%) [6]. In contrast, men in STEM are far less likely to report such experiences, with only 19% indicating they have faced gender discrimination [3].\n\nThe image presented in **image1** further underscores this gap, showing that **74% of women** in computer jobs have experienced gender-related discrimination, compared to just **16% of men** [image1].

These facilities support a wide range of activities, from satellite development and propulsion technology to mission operations and administrative coordination.\n\nOne of the most prominent institutions in Bengaluru is the **ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC)**, which serves as the lead centre for the design, development, fabrication, and testing of all Indian-made satellites [8]. This facility plays a crucial role in advancing spacecraft technology and has developed significant intellectual capital over the years.\n\nAnother key facility located in Bengaluru is the **ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC)**. This centre is entrusted with providing tracking support for all satellite and launch vehicle missions of ISRO. Its responsibilities include estimating preliminary orbits of satellites, carrying out mission operations for operational remote sensing and scientific satellites, and maintaining the ground segment for the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System [2].\n\nAdditionally, the **DOS Secretariat and ISRO Headquarters** are situated at Antariksh Bhavan in Bengaluru. This location coordinates various programs such as satellite communication and navigation, earth observation, launch vehicles, space science, disaster management support, and international cooperation [7].\n\nThe **ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC)**, although primarily located in Mahendra Giri, is part of the broader network of ISRO facilities that contribute to the propulsion technology essential for the Indian space program [6]. While not in Bengaluru, it supports the work done at ISAC and ISTRAC.\n\nFor a visual representation of these and other ISRO facilities across India, including those in Bengaluru, one can refer to the map shown in the image below:  \n![A map of India highlighting various locations associated with ISRO and related departments](image2)"}

This growth indicates that while the number of people identifying as Independents has risen, the majority of these individuals still lean toward either the Democratic or Republican Party. In fact, only 7% of Americans who identify as Independents have no partisan leaning, suggesting that most \"Independents\" are not politically neutral but rather hold views that align closely with one of the major parties.\n\nThis trend is further supported by data showing that 81% of Independents continue to “lean” toward either the Republican or Democratic Party [4]. Specifically, 17% of the public are Democratic-leaning independents, while 13% lean toward the Republican Party [4]. This demonstrates that although the label of \"Independent\" has become more common, it often reflects a preference for one party over the other rather than a truly independent political stance.\n\nMoreover, the chart also reveals that the share of Democrats and Republicans has remained relatively stable, with Democrats fluctuating between 31% and 33% and Republicans declining slightly from 30% to 26% [image5].\n\n![The proportion of political Independents in the U.S. grew from 33% in 1994 to 38% in 2018, with most of these individuals leaning toward either the Democratic or Republican Party.](image5)"}

In contrast, among self-identified non-Hispanics, 96% are of the third or higher generation [image4]. This suggests that the majority of non-Hispanics have long since distanced themselves from immigrant roots, whereas the Hispanic population remains more closely tied to recent immigration patterns.\n\nAs generations progress, the connection to ancestral heritage among Hispanics tends to weaken. For instance, only 44% of third-generation Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their family’s country of origin, compared to 82% of immigrants and 69% of second-generation Hispanics [4]. Similarly, fewer third-generation Hispanics report participating in Hispanic cultural celebrations during childhood, with just 35% doing so, compared to 49% of second-generation Hispanics [5]. These trends indicate a gradual erosion of cultural ties as each subsequent generation becomes more removed from the original immigrant experience.\n\nThis pattern is also reflected in social networks and relationships. Most immigrant Latinos (77%) say all or most of their friends are Latinos, but this share decreases significantly among third-generation individuals, dropping to 37% [9]. Additionally, the likelihood of marrying someone of Hispanic heritage declines across generations, with only 35% of third-generation married Hispanics having a Hispanic spouse, compared to 93% for immigrant Hispanics [6].\n\nIn terms of identity, many self-identified Hispanics prefer to identify by their country of origin or heritage (50%), rather than solely as “Hispanic/Latino” (23%) or “American” (23%) [image3]. This preference may reflect a stronger attachment to specific national identities, which could diminish as generations pass and connections to those origins weaken.\n\n![Generational distribution of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics](image4)  \n![Preference for self-identification terms among Hispanics](image3)"}

This shift is evident in multiple surveys and data visualizations.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015, the percentage of Americans who believed that anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough to protect the country increased significantly, while the percentage of those who felt the policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties decreased. For instance, in 2004, only 49% of respondents felt the country hadn't gone far enough, whereas 29% thought it had gone too far [3]. By 2015, this trend had reversed: 56% believed the policies had not gone far enough, while only 28% felt they had gone too far [8]. This change is illustrated in a line graph showing the evolution of these two perspectives over time, with the lines intersecting around 2010-2011 [image3].\n\nThis shift was also influenced by key events such as Edward Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, which led to a dramatic decline in concerns about government restrictions on civil liberties. In July 2013, 47% of respondents expressed concern that policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties, compared to 35% who felt they did not go far enough [7]. However, by December 2015, the concern about policies not going far enough had risen to 56%, while the concern about excessive restrictions had dropped to 28% [8].\n\nFurthermore, the Pew Research Center found that since the start of 2015, the share of Americans who believe the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points—from 72% to 46%—marking the lowest point in the post-9/11 era [9]. This suggests a growing skepticism about the effectiveness of current anti-terrorism measures.\n\nThe shift in public opinion was not uniform across all demographics. For example, younger adults (ages 18-29) were more likely to believe that policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties (43%) compared to older adults (ages 65+, 15%) [image1]. Similarly, older adults were more likely to feel that policies had not gone far enough to protect the country (71%) than their younger counterparts (44%) [image1].\n\nPolitical affiliation also played a role in shaping opinions. Republicans, in particular, showed a significant increase in concern that anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough.

According to recent surveys, while a majority of Americans still believe the U.S. is the leading global economy, this belief has declined over time. Specifically, in the most recent data from 2020, $52\\%$ of Americans hold this view, down from earlier measurements [4]. \n\nAmong Democrats, there has been a significant decline in the share who see the U.S. as the top economic power since March 2020, with $44\\%$ holding this belief compared to $54\\%$ in March [1]. This suggests a growing skepticism among Democrats about U.S. economic leadership. In contrast, Republican views on this issue have remained relatively stable over the past four months, indicating less fluctuation in their perception of U.S. economic dominance [1].\n\nLooking further back at political trends, image4 shows the changing support for Republican/Lean Republican and Democrat/Lean Democrat groups from 2008 to 2020.

These shifts in party affiliation may reflect broader changes in how individuals perceive the U.S. role in global economics, though the data does not directly link party identification to economic perceptions [image4].\n\nAdditionally, image3 provides insight into shifting perceptions of China, which could influence views on the U.S. as an economic leader. The \"Enemy\" perception of China increased from 15% in 2012 to 26% in 2020, while the \"Competitor\" perception decreased slightly during the same period.

Similarly, Jelly Bean (JB) experienced a more pronounced decrease, falling from 50% in Q2 to 33% in Q3 [image2].

In 1870, the county's population was only 130 residents, but by 1880, it had surged to 8,267, and reached its peak in 1890 with 14,096 people [5]. However, after this peak, the population began a slow decline, reaching 13,330 in 1900 and continuing to decrease through the early 20th century [5]. By 1940, the population had dropped to 9,982, and although there were slight increases in later decades, such as a rise to 9,403 in 2000, the overall trend showed a long-term decline [5]. \n\nThis pattern of growth and decline can be attributed to several historical factors. The Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862 played a pivotal role in attracting settlers to the area, transforming Nebraska from a sparsely populated region into an agricultural hub [9]. These acts encouraged westward migration and land settlement, leading to rapid population growth in the late 19th century. \n\nHowever, as time progressed, farm consolidation and mechanization significantly impacted rural life [4]. The number of farms in Hamilton County decreased steadily since 1900, while the average size of each farm increased. This shift likely contributed to the gradual decline in population as smaller farming communities became less viable. Additionally, the consolidation of rural school districts and churches further reflected the changing demographics and economic realities of the county [6].\n\n![Population data for various census years](image3)\n\n![Map highlighting Hamilton County in Nebraska and its communities](image5)"}

This trend aligns with broader patterns where older adults tend to express more concern about China-related issues and are more likely to view China as an enemy [8].\n\nAdditionally, when considering public opinion more broadly, a majority of Americans (55%) support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S., including about one-in-five who strongly support this idea [7]. However, this support varies by age group: while older Americans are more supportive, younger individuals are more divided or even opposed [6].\n\n![Support for limiting Chinese students varies by age group](image5)"}

Specifically, only 53% of Americans express confidence in Biden’s ability to handle U.S.-China relations [1], which is lower than their confidence in him on other matters such as improving relationships with allies (67%) or dealing with the threat of terrorism and global climate change (around six-in-ten) [3]. This trend is echoed in multiple statements, which note that fewer have confidence in Biden to handle the U.S.-China relationship than other foreign policy issues [4][7][10].\n\nPartisan differences further highlight this gap. For instance, while 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have confidence in Biden’s ability to deal with China, only 19% of Republicans and Republican leaners share that view [5]. Even within the Republican Party, conservative Republicans show even less confidence (10%) than moderate or liberal Republicans (30%) [8]. These stark partisan divides underscore the broader skepticism surrounding Biden’s approach to China.\n\n![Fewer Americans have confidence in Biden to handle U.S.-China relations than other foreign policy issues](image1)\n\nIn addition to political affiliation, demographic factors also play a role. Women (59%) are more confident than men (48%) in Biden’s ability to manage China-related issues, as are Black (82%) and Hispanic adults (70%) compared to White adults (43%) [9]. Education levels also correlate with confidence, with college-educated individuals expressing higher confidence (60%) than those with less schooling (50%) [9].\n\nA visual representation of these findings can be seen in a bar chart that compares confidence levels across various global issues, including dealing effectively with China [3]. The chart shows that while 53% of Americans have confidence in Biden’s ability to handle China, this is lower than the confidence levels for other issues like improving relationships with allies (67%) or making good decisions about international trade (59%) [3].\n\n![Confidence levels in handling various global issues, including dealing effectively with China](image3)\n\nOverall, while there is some confidence in Biden’s ability to address China, it remains the issue among six tested in which Americans have the least confidence in him [3]."}

For instance, nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of Obama’s voters believed that Democratic leaders should work with Republicans even at the risk of disappointing their supporters [5]. Similarly, 76% of McCain’s voters held the same view [5]. This sentiment extended to broader public opinion, where in November 2008, nearly six-in-ten (59%) of all voters believed that GOP leaders should work with Obama, while only 36% wanted them to “stand up” to the new president [9]. Furthermore, among Democrats or those leaning Democratic, 86% wanted Republicans to work with Obama, while just 11% preferred them to stand up to him [image2].\n\nBy contrast, in 2016, after Donald Trump’s election, voter opinions had shifted significantly. In November 2016, only 59% of all voters believed that Democratic leaders should work with Trump to get things done, even if it meant disappointing their supporters, while 39% felt they should stand up to Trump on important issues [image2]. Among Democrats or those leaning Democratic, this divide was even more pronounced: 65% supported standing up to Trump, while only 32% favored working with him [6]. Meanwhile, Republicans or those leaning Republican overwhelmingly supported working with Trump—84% compared to just 14% who wanted to stand up to him [image2].\n\nThis shift highlights a growing partisan divide over cooperation with the opposing party’s leader. In 2008, even among voters who supported the losing candidate, there was a relatively high level of support for cooperation. For example, 58% of McCain voters said Republican leaders should try their best to work with Obama [8]. However, by 2016, the willingness to cooperate had diminished, especially among Democrats, who were far less inclined to work with Trump than Republicans were to work with Obama in 2008 [7].\n\n![Partisan differences in support for cooperation with newly elected presidents](image2)"}

This sentiment is reflected in quotes such as \"Traditional values are outdated and belong in the past I am keen to embrace modern values and beliefs\" [5] and again [7]. These statements indicate a growing inclination among young Arabs to move away from traditional values and adopt more contemporary perspectives.\n\nHowever, not all respondents shared this view. Some believed that traditional values should be preserved, as seen in the statement, \"Traditional values mean a lot to me, and ought to be preserved for generations to come\" [8]. This suggests a divergence of opinions within the Arab youth population regarding the relevance of traditional values.\n\nTo quantify the change in belief between 2011 and 2014, we can refer to image5, which presents a stacked bar chart showing data from 2011 to 2014. In this chart, the red segment likely represents the percentage of respondents who believed traditional values were outdated, while the orange segment may represent those who believed they should be preserved or considered relevant. \n\nIn 2011, the red segment (percentage of respondents believing traditional values are outdated) was 83, and by 2014, it had decreased to 54. This indicates a decline in the proportion of respondents who believed traditional values were outdated, rather than an increase. However, if the question intended to ask about the increase in those who believe traditional values should be preserved (orange segment), then the increase would be from 17% in 2011 to 46% in 2014, representing an increase of 29 percentage points.\n\n![The stacked bar chart shows a trend of decreasing values in the red segment and increasing values in the orange segment from 2011 to 2014](image5)"}

In 2017, 45% of Americans felt that European allies should dedicate more resources to national defense, but by 2019, this had dropped to 35%, with 50% favoring keeping spending the same [10]. This reflects a shift in American public opinion toward maintaining the status quo rather than pushing for increased spending by allies.\n\nIn Germany, opinions on national defense spending also evolved. While the majority of Germans initially favored maintaining current spending levels, there was a gradual increase in support for raising defense budgets over time. In 2017, 51% of Germans were content with the current level of defense spending, while 32% supported an increase. By 2019, this had shifted slightly, with 41% supporting the maintenance of current spending and 40% advocating for an increase [7].

This information is directly supported by the data presented in the text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text, we see that several quotes discuss CO2 emissions and their sources. For instance, quote [9] states that the transportation sector accounts for 30.0% of CO2 emissions in OECD countries and about 20.0% worldwide. However, this does not provide direct insight into the cost-effectiveness of reducing emissions in various sectors. Quote [8] mentions the potential for reducing GHGs from vehicles, biofuels, and other technologies, but again, without specific cost details.\n\nThe key evidence comes from **image4**, which provides a visual representation of the potential CO2 emissions reduction across various sectors along with the associated costs. The bar graph indicates that the **Energy sector** has the largest potential for CO2 emissions reduction, particularly with measures that fall within the lowest cost range of 0 to 50 Euros per ton. This is evident from the light blue segments of the Energy sector’s bar, which are significantly longer than those of other sectors in the same cost category.\n\nOther sectors, such as **Chemistry**, **Paper**, **Construction materials**, **Iron and steel (acier)**, and **Auto**, also show potential for emissions reduction, but their contributions in the lowest-cost range are smaller compared to the Energy sector. Additionally, some sectors, like the Auto sector, have portions of their bars shaded in red, indicating that certain reduction measures come at a higher cost (>500 Euros/ton).\n\n![The Energy sector has the largest potential for CO2 emissions reduction at the lowest cost (0-50 Euros/ton)](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the **Energy sector** has the largest potential for CO2 emissions reduction at the lowest cost (0-50 Euros/ton), surpassing other sectors in both magnitude and cost-effectiveness."}

This improvement suggests that electrification not only increases the number of trains but also allows for more cars per train, thus boosting passenger capacity [5].\n\nFurthermore, extending platforms to accommodate more cars leads to a peak service of 6x8, requiring 48 train cars during peak hours. This scenario highlights the importance of infrastructure upgrades in supporting higher capacity and frequency [5].\n\nFinally, increasing frequency with High-Speed Rail (HSR) results in the highest peak service of 8x8, demanding 64 train cars during peak hours.

For instance, those with postgraduate degrees show a strong preference for the Democratic candidate over the Republican by a two-to-one margin ($62\\%$ to $30\\%$) [2], whereas those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat by a smaller margin ($53\\%$ to $40\\%$) [2]. These educational differences are further reflected in perceptions of ethical standards, with fewer college graduates believing neither party has high ethical standards compared to those with less education [10].\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a crucial role in shaping views on ethical standards. Independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has “high ethical standards,” with about a third of independents ($34\\%$) expressing this view [5]. This contrasts sharply with the relatively lower percentages among Republicans ($19\\%$) and Democrats ($18\\%$) who hold similar views [5].\n\n![A bar chart showing how different groups perceive whether \"high ethical standards\" describe the Republican and Democratic parties](image2)\n\nPartisan perspectives reveal that while majorities of both Republicans ($66\\%$) and Democrats ($64\\%$) describe their own party as having high ethical standards [3], these positive assessments are somewhat tempered when considering the broader public perception. Only $41\\%$ of Americans say the GOP has high ethical standards, and a nearly identical share ($42\\%$) say this about the Democratic Party [8].\n\nIn summary, perceptions of ethical standards differ markedly among various educational and political affiliation groups, with higher levels of skepticism observed among independents and those with less formal education."}

This suggests that older Americans are more critical of China’s performance, which may correlate with their views on its global influence.\n\nSimilarly, text quote [8] emphasizes that American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to believe China will have less global influence after the crisis. This further supports the idea that older individuals are more pessimistic about China's future standing on the world stage.\n\nLooking at image2, which presents survey results broken down by age group, we see that among responses regarding China's influence, the \"Less\" category is most prominent for the 65+ age group, with $59\\%$ believing China's influence will decline. In contrast, younger age groups such as those aged 18-29 show a higher percentage of respondents who think China's influence will increase (22%) compared to older groups.

This view is most commonly held by majorities across various origin groups, as noted in the survey findings [5]. However, not all groups share this perspective to the same degree.\n\nLooking at the relevant evidence:\n\n- The text indicates that **majorities of U.S. Hispanics across many origin groups** say people not seeing racial discrimination is a big problem [5].\n- Additionally, **Hispanic women (64%) are more likely than Hispanic men (58%)** to hold this view [3].\n- A specific breakdown of these views can be found in **image1**, which presents data for different Hispanic origin groups regarding their perceptions of racial discrimination. The right column of the chart shows percentages of people who \"do not see racial discrimination where it does exist.\"\n\nFrom image1, we can infer the following:\n\n- For **All Hispanics**, 61% do not see racial discrimination where it does exist [8], which is above 60%.\n- For **Mexicans**, the percentage is not explicitly stated but likely falls within a similar range, given that the overall majority holds this view [7].\n- For **Puerto Ricans**, again, the exact percentage is not specified, but the general trend suggests that it may also be above 60% [7].\n- For **Cubans**, **Central Americans**, and **South Americans**, the data would need to be interpreted from the visual representation in image1.\n\nNow, referring back to the text and image, we find that **some groups may have less than 60% holding the view** that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist. Based on the data, it appears that **no group has been explicitly identified with less than 60%** holding this view, as the text and image suggest that **majorities** across most groups support this perspective.\n\nHowever, if we consider the possibility that some subgroups might fall below 60%, we would need to rely on image1 for precise figures. Since the exact percentages for each group are not listed in the text, we cannot definitively identify any group with less than 60% holding this view without further data.\n\nIn conclusion, while the majority of Hispanic origin groups hold the view that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem, no specific group has been cited as having less than 60% holding this view based on the available information. ![Majority of Hispanic origin groups perceive people not seeing racial discrimination as a bigger problem](image1)"}

For higher-resource languages, such as Portuguese (PT) and Russian (RU), pre-training consistently provides gains of approximately 3 BLEU points [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages like Azerbaijani (AZ) and Belarusian (BE), the gains are either minimal or notably large, as seen in Galician (GL) to English (EN), where the gain reaches up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This suggests that pre-training is particularly beneficial when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically when the baseline BLEU score is between 3-4 [4].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training also depends on the alignment of word embeddings. In Table 2, it is observed that pre-training the source language embeddings leads to more significant improvements in BLEU scores compared to pre-training only the target language embeddings [6]. Furthermore, aligning the word embeddings across different languages helps improve BLEU scores for all three tasks, especially when the source languages share an encoder [10]. For instance, in the GL→EN translation task, pre-training without alignment yields a BLEU score of 12.8, while alignment results in a slight decrease to 11.5 [image1].\n\nThe relationship between training set size and BLEU scores further highlights the importance of pre-training. As illustrated in image2, pre-training techniques yield higher BLEU scores, especially when the training data is limited. The gains from pre-training are most significant at smaller training set sizes and diminish as the training set size increases.\n\nAdditionally, the performance differences among language pairs are evident. For example, Hebrew (HE) to Portuguese (PT) shows a substantial improvement of +8.9, indicating that pre-training is particularly effective for languages with no common linguistic family with the target language [image3]. Similarly, the dataset sizes for various language pairs, as shown in image5, reveal that some languages have significantly more training data than others, which can influence the effectiveness of pre-training.\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training enhances BLEU scores for different language pairs, with the greatest benefits observed in low-resource scenarios and when the source and target languages are linguistically distant."}

The values show that **Reasoning Error** and **RAG** are the dominant sources of error, while **StepBack** and **Scoring Error** contribute relatively less.

This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that label words act as anchors, aggregating and distributing task-relevant information during the ICL process [5]. By re-weighting these anchors, the method aims to improve the accuracy of ICL predictions.\n\nExperimental results from Table 3 show that the Anchor Re-weighting method achieves significant improvements over vanilla ICL configurations. Specifically, the average accuracy across multiple datasets increases from 51.90% for the vanilla ICL (1-shot per class) to 68.64% with the Anchor Re-weighting method [3]. This represents an average improvement of **16.74 percentage points**.\n\nMoreover, this enhancement is not limited to just one model or dataset. The method demonstrates consistent improvements across various benchmarks such as SST-2, TREC, AGNews, and EmoC, as seen in Table 3 [3]. The effectiveness of the Anchor Re-weighting method is further supported by the comparison with other techniques like Text_anchor and Hidden_random, which show lower accuracy scores [image2].\n\n![Anchor re-weighting improves ICL accuracy](image3)"}

It states that the slots in each domain and their corresponding data sizes are reported in Table 1. Although Table 1 is not explicitly provided, the information about the number of dialogues in the test set can be inferred from the description in [10].

This component plays a crucial role in querying a large external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context [8]. To optimize retrieval speed, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented, which reduces the dimensionality of vectors from $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to $\\frac{d}{9}$, enabling faster and more efficient retrieval [7].\n\nOnce the memory $\\mathcal{M}$ is built, the next step involves retrieving the top-$k$ similar results from this memory during the inference stage [6]. These retrieved category labels are then integrated with the image embedding $e_{\\mathrm{img}}$ and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [4]. \n\nA key part of the RAR pipeline is the **ranking process**, where MLLMs refine and rank the retrieved candidate categories based on similarity, leveraging both internal knowledge and the retrieved information to make the final prediction [1]. This process ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction [4].\n\nTo illustrate how this pipeline works, consider the two-part process shown in the diagram: the first part involves the **Multimodal Retriever**, which includes an Image Encoder, Feature Index, and Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$), while the second part involves the **Retrieving & Ranking** stage, where MLLMs are used to refine and rank the retrieved categories [3]. \n\n![RAR Pipeline](image3)\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline combines a powerful multimodal retriever with a ranking mechanism powered by MLLMs to enhance fine-grained recognition and zero-shot learning capabilities across various visual recognition tasks."}

As the weight increases, the model generates responses that are more specific or divergent from the baseline, potentially using less common words or introducing new topics. Conversely, lower weights may produce responses closer to the baseline, which tend to be more generic.\n\nFor example, when the weight is set to -5.0, the model produces a very brief and vague response: \"Oh......................................\" with a low NIDF of 0.6%, indicating it is highly generic and lacks specificity [5]. At weight 0.0, the response matches the baseline: \"That sounds like a lot of fun!\" with an NIDF of 17.1% [5]. Increasing the weight to 3.0 leads to a slightly more specific response: \"That sounds like a lot of fun. How long have you been studying?\" with an NIDF of 18.3% [5]. At higher weights, such as 7.0 and 10.0, the responses become increasingly specific and divergent, even to the point of being nonsensical, as seen in \"I majored in practising my spiritual full-time philosophy test\" (NIDF = 38.5%) and \"Oh wow!

This critic provides feedback, but unlike self-correction, it also incorporates assistance from external models or tools to refine the outputs further [1]. These external resources can include knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines, among others [image1]. By leveraging these external sources, the refinement process becomes more informed and accurate, as it benefits from specialized tools that may not be part of the original language model’s training data or capabilities.\n\nFor instance, external knowledge sources like Wikipedia or internet-based information can be used to verify the factual accuracy of the generated content [10]. Similarly, program executors or code interpreters can validate the correctness of code-related outputs, ensuring they are functional and error-free [image2]. The inclusion of such external tools allows for a more comprehensive evaluation and correction of outputs, addressing issues that might be difficult for the language model to detect on its own.\n\nThis strategy is particularly useful in tasks requiring high accuracy, such as summarization, where factuality is crucial [2], or in code generation, where syntactic and semantic correctness must be ensured [6].

The key differences between these approaches lie in how they navigate the tree and select relevant nodes.\n\nIn **Tree Traversal Retrieval**, the process begins at the root of the tree and proceeds layer-by-layer. At each level, the method selects the top-k most relevant nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. This selection is repeated iteratively as the traversal moves down through the layers of the tree until reaching the leaf nodes. The retrieved text from all selected nodes is then concatenated to form the final context used for answering the query [7]. This approach allows for control over the specificity and breadth of the retrieved information by adjusting parameters such as depth $d$ and the number of nodes $k$ selected at each layer [9].\n\nOn the other hand, **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** takes a more holistic approach by flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer, allowing all nodes to be evaluated simultaneously. Instead of traversing layer-by-layer, this method considers all nodes across different levels of the tree at once, selecting the most relevant ones based on their cosine similarity to the query vector until a threshold number of tokens is reached [3]. This simultaneous evaluation enables the retrieval of information that matches the question's level of granularity without being constrained by the hierarchical structure [1].\n\nThe distinction between these methods is visually illustrated in image2, which shows both mechanisms side by side. Tree Traversal Retrieval (A) highlights the sequential, layer-based selection of nodes, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval (B) demonstrates the simultaneous comparison of all nodes in a flattened structure [image2].\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval follows a structured, layered approach with controlled exploration, whereas Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers a more flexible and comprehensive search by evaluating all nodes at once."}

These plots illustrate that sentences with different styles are distinctly separated in the style space for both DAE and VAE, while in the content space, the separation is minimal. However, there are notable differences between the two models in terms of the smoothness and continuity of the learned latent space. Specifically, the VAE's latent space appears to be \"considerably smoother and more continuous\" than the DAE's [9].\n\nThis difference can be attributed to the underlying principles of each model. The DAE is a deterministic model where the encoder and decoder are fixed functions, and the latent vector is directly determined by the input [2]. In contrast, the VAE introduces probabilistic elements into the latent space by sampling from a distribution, which allows for a more continuous and structured representation of the data [8].\n\nFurthermore, when evaluating performance on specific datasets like Yelp and Amazon, the results indicate that both models perform better in the style space compared to the content space.

To answer this, we need to examine how different strategies—such as Naive, EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation), and GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory)—compare in terms of performance when applied to the Hotel domain during domain expansion.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that:\n\n- In [9], it is stated: \"Fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains. Take the hotel domain as an example, the performance on the four domains after fine-tuning with GEM only drops from 58.98% to 53.54% (-5.44%) on joint accuracy, whereas naive fine-tuning deteriorates the tracking ability, dropping joint goal accuracy to 36.08% (-22.9%).\"\n\nThis directly compares the Joint goal accuracy for the Hotel domain under GEM and Naive fine-tuning strategies. It shows that **GEM outperforms Naive fine-tuning** in maintaining performance on the Hotel domain after domain expansion.\n\nAdditionally, [10] supports this by noting: \"Finally, when considering hotel and attraction as new domain, fine-tuning with GEM outperforms the naive fine-tuning approach on the new domain.\" This reinforces the idea that GEM is more effective than Naive in preserving performance across domains.\n\nIn [4], Table 3 provides a detailed comparison of results using different fine-tuning strategies. While the exact numbers for the Hotel domain are not explicitly listed, the general trend is that **GEM performs better than both Naive and EWC** in preventing catastrophic forgetting and retaining performance on the original domains after fine-tuning.\n\nTo visualize the performance differences among these strategies, we can refer to `![Zero-shot DST error analysis for Hotel and Restaurant domains](image1)`, which shows how effectively the model tracks slots in zero-shot scenarios. Although this image does not specifically focus on the Hotel domain’s Joint goal accuracy, it provides context about the overall effectiveness of the model in tracking states across domains.\n\nMoreover, `![Error rates of different slots on a test set from multi-domain training](image2)` highlights the distribution of errors across various domains and slots, but again, it does not provide direct insight into the fine-tuning strategies' performance for the Hotel domain.\n\nFor a clearer numerical comparison, we can look at `![Table showing results from an evaluation of a Base Model (BM) trained on four domains and its fine-tuning on a new domain](image4)`.

The fine-tuned models consistently outperform those using in-context learning, as evidenced by the higher accuracy values achieved with fine-tuned models across various datasets [6].\n\nAdditionally, the robustness of the fine-tuning strategy is highlighted, as the MLLM demonstrates minimal performance differences when trained on different fine-tuning datasets, further supporting its generalizability and reliability [8].\n\n![RAR improves performance with fine-tuning](image4)  \nThe table illustrates that fine-tuning (F) strategies yield higher average performance compared to in-context learning (S) strategies across common and fine-grained datasets, particularly for the InternLM-XC2 model.\n\nIn conclusion, fine-tuning significantly enhances the performance of the RAR method on the InternLM-XC2 model across different datasets compared to in-context learning."}

When repetition control is introduced, it reduces the overall rate of question-asking compared to models without such control. This is primarily due to the use of a weighted decoding feature called *extrep bigram*, which discourages the model from producing bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. These bigrams are often common in questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" thereby limiting the model's ability to generate questions [3].\n\nThis phenomenon is further illustrated in Figure 4, which shows that controlling for repetition leads to improvements across various aspects of conversational quality, including interestingness and listening ability. However, when combined with repetition control, the effectiveness of question-asking is reduced, as shown in the results of conditional training (CT) models [1]. Specifically, when both repetition and question-asking controls are applied, the model achieves a lower question-asking rate than when only question-asking control is used [3].\n\nThe impact of repetition control on question-asking frequency is also visible in Figure 3 (right), where the question-asking rate peaks at 65.7% under CT settings. However, when repetition control is added, the model's ability to ask questions is constrained, even though the CT method is still preferred for its flexibility in achieving desired question rates [2].\n\n![The graph shows how different methods affect the percentage of utterances containing a question mark ('?') as the question-asking control level increases from 0 to 10.](image4)"}

This initialization allows the model to start with a pre-established understanding of the user’s long-term preferences, which is then updated as it processes recent browsing behavior. This approach is visualized in Figure 3a, where the long-term user vector influences the initial state of the GRU network before processing the sequence of recently browsed news articles ![Initialization of GRU with long-term user representation](image3).\n\nIn contrast, the second method, **LSTUR-con**, concatenates the long-term user representation with the short-term user representation to form the final unified user vector. This means that both the long-term and short-term representations are combined directly, preserving all information from both sources. This method is illustrated in Figure 3b, where the concatenated vector serves as the final representation for the user ![Concatenation of long-term and short-term user representations](image3).\n\nThese differences highlight how each method leverages long-term and short-term information: LSTUR-ini uses the long-term representation as a starting point for the short-term model, while LSTUR-con combines both representations explicitly.

As noted in the text, the softmax operation can lead to divergences when training with multiple modalities due to its translation invariant property [1]. This issue is exacerbated by the uncontrolled growth of output norms, which is strongly correlated with predicting future loss divergence [1]. To address this, the authors introduced query-key normalization (QK-Norm), which directly controls the norm growth of inputs to the softmax by applying layer normalization to the query and key vectors within the attention mechanism [5].\n\nThe effectiveness of QK-Norm is illustrated in image5, where the training loss of Chameleon-7B is compared with and without QK-Norm. The graph shows that both approaches lead to a reduction in training loss over time; however, the model employing QK-Norm consistently achieves a slightly lower training loss, indicating potentially better performance [image5](image5).\n\nFurthermore, image1 provides evidence that ablations without image generation do not diverge, suggesting that the presence of multiple modalities significantly influences the training stability [image1](image1). This aligns with the findings in the text that the divergence problem is particularly pronounced when training with multiple modalities of varying entropy [1].\n\nIn addition, image2 highlights the importance of controlling output norms during training. It shows that without QK-Norm and dropout, the output norm grows significantly, indicating strong potential for training divergence and instability [image2](image2).\n\nFinally, image10 further supports these findings by showing that the training loss curve for Chameleon-7B without QK-Norm diverges after approximately 20% of a training epoch [image10](image10).\n\nThe loss spikes when training without QK-Norm occur after approximately 20% of a training epoch."}

Each method is designed to enhance the quality of information retrieval and generation, but they do so through distinct mechanisms.\n\n**Iterative Retrieval** involves alternating between retrieval and generation steps, with the aim of gradually enriching the context provided to the generator. This process iterates a fixed number of times or until a certain threshold is met, ensuring that each iteration contributes more refined and targeted information from the knowledge base. The process follows a pattern: Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge → (Repeat or Response). This method emphasizes the refinement of context over successive cycles [5].\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**, on the other hand, focuses on gradually refining the user query itself and breaking down complex problems into sub-problems. It uses query transformation or decomposition to tackle intricate tasks by recursively solving smaller components. The process is described as: Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge → Query Transformation → (Repeat or Response). This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the initial query may be ambiguous or complex, requiring systematic clarification and problem breakdown [1].\n\nFinally, **Adaptive Retrieval** introduces a level of autonomy to the RAG system, allowing it to determine when external knowledge retrieval is necessary. Unlike the other two methods, which follow predefined steps, adaptive retrieval enables the system to decide dynamically whether to retrieve information based on the current state of the query or generation. This is achieved using special tokens to signal when to stop retrieval and generation. The process can be summarized as: Query → Judge → Retrieve (on demand) → Generate → Query Transformation → Judge → (Repeat or Response). This flexibility allows for more efficient use of resources and better alignment with the specific needs of the query [2].\n\nTo visualize these differences, consider the following image:\n\n![Comparison of Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive Retrieval](image5)"}

However, it does not explicitly state which metric had the highest correlation for this specific pair.\n\nIn Text Quote [6], it is noted that in some instances, QE systems like UNI and UNI+ show upward correlation trends when other metrics have downward trends. Specifically, it mentions that UNI performs better for top-performing systems or systems closer in quality. This suggests that for the 'kk-en' language pair, where YiSi-2 is mentioned as performing well, there might be a high correlation associated with that metric.\n\nAdditionally, in Text Quote [9], it is stated that the YiSi metrics achieve the highest correlations in several language pairs and are not significantly outperformed by any other metrics. This supports the possibility that YiSi-2 could be one of the best-performing metrics for 'kk-en'.\n\nLooking at Image Quote [2], which presents a table with performance metrics for various language pairs, including 'en-kk', we see that the \"Correlation\" section lists several metrics such as BEER, BLEU, sacreBLEU.BLEU, and sacreBLEU.chrF.

In the **distractor setting**, where questions are paired with two gold paragraphs and eight distractors, single-paragraph BERT achieves an F1 score of 67.08 [1]. This indicates that even with the presence of distractors, many questions can be answered using a single-hop model, which is surprising given the complexity of multi-hop reasoning typically required for such tasks.\n\nHowever, when the number of distractors increases significantly—such as using 500 distractors instead of eight—the F1 score drops to 39.12 in the open-domain setting [6]. This highlights the challenges faced by models when they must sift through large volumes of irrelevant information. The situation improves dramatically when a **gold paragraph** is included in the open-domain setting, raising the F1 score to 53.12 [5], demonstrating how access to relevant information directly enhances model performance.\n\nThis phenomenon is further supported by Table 5, which shows that standard TF-IDF retrieval often fails to retrieve gold paragraphs even when using 500 candidates [6]. This failure to locate critical information leads to significant drops in performance, emphasizing the importance of effective retrieval systems for multi-hop QA tasks [10].\n\nMoreover, adversarial selection of distractors has been shown to challenge single-hop models. When adversarial distractors are used, the F1 score drops from 67.08 to 46.84 [4]. However, retraining the model on these adversarial distractors allows it to recover much of its original accuracy, increasing the F1 score to 60.10 [4]. This suggests that while adversarial distractors make the task harder, they also provide valuable training signals for improving model robustness.\n\n![Single-paragraph BERT struggles with adversarial distractors but can recover when retrained](image2)\n\nThe impact of distractors and gold paragraphs is also evident in the categorization of question types. For instance, 35% of bridge questions are currently single-hop but may become multi-hop when combined with stronger distractors [5]. This implies that the design of distractors influences whether a question requires multi-hop reasoning or not. \n\n![Different types of questions and their associated percentages](image1)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of gold paragraphs significantly boosts model performance, especially in open-domain settings, while the presence of strong or adversarial distractors can degrade performance unless the model is specifically trained to handle them. These findings suggest that future research should focus on improving retrieval methods and developing more effective strategies for selecting distractors that better simulate real-world challenges in multi-hop QA tasks."}

This impressive result highlights how effective the document-cue approach can be when leveraging co-occurrence statistics between documents and candidate answers.

This is because the meaning and sentiment conveyed by a sentence can change significantly based on the order of words. For instance, the phrases “not really good” and “really not good” express different levels of negative sentiment, solely due to differences in word ordering [2]. LSTM models are particularly well-suited for capturing such word-order dependencies, as they are designed to process sequential data and maintain memory of previous inputs [3].\n\nTo evaluate the impact of word-order information on sentiment analysis accuracy, researchers conducted experiments where the training set was randomly shuffled while keeping the test set's original word order intact. This approach aimed to remove word-order features from the training data and assess how sensitive the model’s performance was to these features [3]. The results showed that when trained on a shuffled dataset, the LSTM model's performance on sentiment analysis tasks dropped notably compared to when it was trained on the original dataset [7]. This drop suggests that word-order information plays a significant role in achieving high accuracy in sentiment analysis with LSTM models.\n\n![LSTM performance drops on shuffled training sets for sentiment analysis](image1)\n\nAdditionally, when comparing LSTM with other models like SWEM (Simple Word-Embedding Models), it was found that LSTM and CNN-based models outperformed SWEM on sentiment analysis tasks. This further supports the idea that word-order information is essential for accurate sentiment prediction [2]. \n\nMoreover, experimental results on specific datasets, such as Yelp Polarity, demonstrated that shuffling the words in the training set led to a noticeable decline in performance, reinforcing the conclusion that word-order features are vital for sentiment analysis [6].\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as evidenced by the drop in performance when this information is removed during training."}

Without repetition control, a $z=10$ setting is designed to produce 100% question-asking responses.

This mechanism inadvertently prevents the model from generating common question-related bigrams such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" which are frequently used in questions.\n\nThis issue is visualized in Figure 2, where increasing $z$ from 0 to 10 results in a wide range of question-asking rates, but with repetition control, the $z=10$ setting only produces 79.67% questions instead of the expected 100% [4].

The bar graph compares the impact of isolating label words versus randomly isolating non-label words within the first or last 5 layers on loyalty for the LLaMA-30B model.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of $77\\%$ on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1].

When the adversarial dataset was introduced—designed to eliminate these cues—BERT’s performance dropped dramatically to a maximum of $53\\%$, with mean and median scores at $50\\%$ [5].\n\nThis decline highlights that BERT's initial success was not based on true argument comprehension but rather on learning patterns that were unintentionally embedded in the original dataset [9]. In contrast, other models such as BoV and BiLSTM showed more consistent performance across different configurations, with their best results being much lower than BERT's pre-adversarial peak [10]. For example, the BoV model achieved a maximum of $59.5\\%$ [image1], while the BiLSTM model reached up to $59.2\\%$ [image1].

This shift in performance underscores the importance of using adversarial datasets to evaluate machine learning models, especially in tasks like argument comprehension where subtle differences in reasoning are critical.\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial transformation reduces BERT's performance substantially, revealing that its earlier success was due to exploiting statistical cues rather than genuine understanding.

The **retriever–reader model** involves a retriever that searches Wikipedia for relevant evidence, followed by a reader that processes the retrieved information to generate an answer [3].\n2. The **FLAN-T5 model** is a Seq2Seq model pre-trained on over 1.8K tasks with instruction tuning.

Additionally, the average embedding method, which predicts senses from the average of sub-word token embeddings, also performs comparably well, suggesting that both strategies enhance the model's ability to understand word-level semantics [5].\n\n![SenseBERT improves performance with a larger vocabulary](image3)\n\nThe results confirm that increasing the vocabulary size from 30K to 60K significantly enhances the model's ability to handle rare and OOV words, leading to better performance on downstream tasks like supersense disambiguation.\n\nThe improvement in performance when using SenseBERT with a 60K-token vocabulary over the baseline of 30K no OOV is approximately **1.1 points** (from 81.9 to 83.0)."}

The specific repair pathways include:\n\n- **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This mechanism is used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases on a DNA strand [5]. It involves the removal of damaged bases by glycosylase enzymes, followed by the addition of new nucleotides and rejoining of the DNA backbone by ligase enzymes.\n\n- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This pathway is highly conserved among species and can excise a wide range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts [4]. However, it is not functional in mitochondria [2].\n\n- **Direct Reversal Repair**: This method directly reverses certain types of damage without incising the DNA strands. For example, it uses DNA photolyase enzymes to repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimers through a light-dependent process [9].\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system identifies and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from errors during DNA replication [6]. It removes the mutated sequence and replaces it with the correct one using polymerase and ligase enzymes.\n\n- **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism is primarily used to repair double-strand breaks, which are among the most severe forms of DNA damage. It includes two main pathways: homologous recombination repair (HR), which is accurate and uses an undamaged homologous DNA template, and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is efficient but prone to errors [10].\n\nThese repair mechanisms collectively ensure the maintenance of genomic stability and integrity by detecting and correcting mutations that occur during DNA replication, transcription, or due to exogenous mutagens.\n\n![DNA repair mechanisms illustrated in Figure 11](image3)"}

This approach ensures both accuracy and transparency in the problem-solving process.\n\nFirst, during the **Problem Formulation** stage, the **Problem Formulator** module takes a natural language description of the problem and translates it into a precise symbolic representation. This translation is achieved using LLMs trained via in-context learning, which allows them to understand the structure of the problem and identify key entities, facts, and rules [2]. For example, if the input is a statement like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing,\" the system converts this into a symbolic logic formulation such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [4]. This step is crucial because it shifts the burden from direct reasoning in natural language to creating a clear, unambiguous symbolic form.\n\nNext, the **Symbolic Reasoner** module performs inference on the formulated problem using deterministic algorithms. The type of solver used depends on the nature of the problem: for instance, Logic Programming solvers are used for rule-based problems, First-order Logic Provers for logical entailment, and Constraint Optimization tools for constraint satisfaction problems [5]. This stage leverages the logical faithfulness and transparency of symbolic solvers, ensuring that the reasoning process is reliable and free from hallucinations or ambiguous interpretations [6].\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** module interprets the output from the Symbolic Reasoner and maps it back to a natural language answer that directly addresses the original question [2].

Specifically, it mentions that for Movie Reviews and BoolQ, the mean agreement of individual annotators with the majority vote per token was calculated. For e-SNLI, the mean agreement between individuals and the majority was calculated. For CoS-E, MultiRC, and FEVER, members of the team annotated a subset for comparison with existing rationales.

According to the analysis in the text, slots such as *hotel-type*, *attraction-type*, *attraction-name*, *hotel-internet*, and *hotel-parking* show significant improvements when using DS-DST compared to DS-Span [9]. This is because these slots often have values that cannot be directly extracted from the dialog context and instead require prediction from candidate-value lists, which DS-DST handles effectively.\n\nHowever, for time-related slots like *taxi-leave at* and *train-arrive by*, the improvement is less pronounced. These are typically treated as non-categorical slots in DS-DST and rely on span matching, which can be challenging if the exact value (e.g., a specific time) is not explicitly mentioned in the dialog context [5]. In such cases, the model may struggle to find the correct value, leading to lower performance gains compared to other slot types.\n\nThis distinction between categorical and non-categorical slots is also reflected in Table 4, where slot-level accuracy data for DS-DST and DS-Span is presented [3].

Additionally, the introduction of the \"conscious incompetence\" setting allows models to recognize when certain information is missing from the KG, potentially pointing to gaps in the graph's completeness [6].\n\n![Evaluation of precision and recall for conscious incompetence](image1)  \nThis image illustrates the evaluation of precision and recall specifically for the concept of \"conscious incompetence,\" using color-coded indicators and calculations to represent correct matches and errors.\n\nWhile the exact details of Figure 1 are not directly described in the provided text, the general principles of knowledge graph representation suggest that relation arrows pointing to leaf nodes would be those that connect to entities without further outgoing connections. To determine which arrows do not point to such nodes, one would need to analyze the full graph structure depicted in Figure 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes are those that connect to entities with outgoing edges or connections in the knowledge graph."}

During this period, researchers have explored various methodologies and datasets to better understand these shifts. One of the earliest milestones was the introduction of the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" in 2010, which laid the groundwork for modeling semantic changes across time [1]. This approach allowed for a more structured way to represent how words evolve semantically.\n\nIn 2011, the use of the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" became prominent, enabling large-scale analysis of word usage and meaning across decades [9]. This dataset played a crucial role in the emerging field of 'culturomics,' allowing scholars to trace linguistic trends through vast amounts of digitized text. ![The timeline shows the introduction of the Google Ngrams corpus in 2011](image1).\n\nBy 2012, researchers were working on \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" focusing on identifying the correct meaning of a word within specific historical contexts. This marked a shift toward more nuanced understanding of how context influences meaning over time.\n\nIn 2013, there were advancements in \"Prediction-based models,\" which improved the accuracy of detecting semantic shifts by using machine learning techniques. These models provided a more dynamic and adaptive way to track changes in word meanings [7].\n\nThe year 2014 saw the widespread adoption of \"Word embeddings,\" particularly exemplified by the \"word2vec\" model. This innovation allowed for more efficient representation of word meanings in vector space, making it easier to compare words across different time periods [7]. ![The timeline highlights the use of word embeddings with the example of word2vec in 2014](image1).\n\nIn 2015, efforts were made to develop \"Models alignment,\" which aimed to ensure consistency between different models used to trace semantic shifts. This was important for comparing results across studies and ensuring that findings were reliable and reproducible [1].\n\n2016 brought further refinement with the use of the \"NYT corpus\" and the \"COHA corpus.\" These corpora provided detailed insights into how words changed in meaning within specific historical contexts, such as cultural and political events [10]. ![The timeline notes the analysis using the NYT corpus and COHA corpus in 2016](image1).\n\nFinally, in 2017, researchers gained deeper insights into the \"Laws of semantic change,\" exploring how certain patterns govern the evolution of word meanings. Additionally, there was an emphasis on \"Local measures better for cultural shifts,\" indicating a growing recognition of the importance of local contexts in understanding semantic change [8]. The \"Gigaword corpus\" and \"Diachronic relations\" were also highlighted as key developments in this year. ![The timeline includes insights into laws of semantic change and other developments in 2017](image1).\n\nIn summary, the key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of time tensors, the use of Google Ngrams, advancements in prediction-based models, the adoption of word embeddings like word2vec, the development of model alignment, and the use of detailed corpora like the NYT and COHA. These developments collectively enhanced our ability to understand and analyze how word meanings evolve over time."}

To answer this, we need to examine the performance metrics provided in the text and image quotes.\n\nFrom [6], it is mentioned that \"Table 4 presents performance of each language model on the relations. The oracle KGLM is given the correct entity annotation for $X$, while the NEL KGLM uses the discriminative model used for importance sampling combined with the NEL entity linker to produce an entity annotation for $X$.\" This implies that the Oracle KGLM has access to the correct entity annotations, making it a strong baseline for comparison.\n\nIn [7], the authors provide qualitative comparisons between KGLM and GPT-2. They note that KGLM gets factual statements correct when the head or tail entities are rare, especially in cases like birthdates. However, this does not directly quantify top-1 accuracy on birthdates specifically.\n\nLooking at [2], we see a clear example of the KGLM's ability to generate accurate dates based on knowledge graph modifications. When the KG fact for Barack Obama’s birth date was changed from 1961-08-04 to 2013-03-21, the model adjusted its predictions accordingly, generating “March”, “21”, and “2013” as the top tokens. This illustrates the KGLM's capacity to accurately reflect changes in the knowledge graph, suggesting strong performance in date-related tasks.\n\nAdditionally, [10] states that \"KGLMs are also competitive with models trained on orders of magnitude more data, producing factual completions that require specific knowledge, such as birthplaces, dates, and authors.\" This supports the idea that KGLM performs well on specific factual tasks like birthdates.\n\nNow, turning to image2, which is described as a table comparing the performance of AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and two configurations of KGLM—Oracle and NEL—across various categories, including `birthdate`. The values are presented in a \"correct/total\" format.

For instance, removing the abstract from the input to SPECTER results in a substantial decrease in performance [10]. This highlights the importance of the abstract in capturing the essence of a scientific paper for accurate embeddings. Similarly, adding authors as an input feature (along with the title and abstract) surprisingly hurts performance, likely due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and potential issues with tokenization [10].\n\n![The SPECTER model uses a transformer initialized with SciBERT and computes a triplet loss based on query, related, and unrelated papers](image1)\n\nMoreover, adding venue information slightly decreases performance, except for document classification, where venues are expected to have high correlation [10]. These findings emphasize that not all metadata fields contribute positively to the model's performance across all tasks.\n\nAnother critical factor is the use of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective. Removing this component and using only easy negatives leads to reduced performance across all tasks [2]. Additionally, using a strong general-domain language model like BERT-Large instead of SciBERT, which is pretrained on scientific text, also reduces performance [2].\n\n![SPECTER outperforms other models across multiple tasks and metrics, especially excelling in classification and citation prediction](image2)\n\nThe impact of these features is further illustrated in Table 3, where SPECTER outperforms a SciBERT model fine-tuned on end tasks and their multitask combination without any additional task-specific fine-tuning [5].

In contrast, the **Data Map by pseudo-labels** identifies \"easy-to-contrast\" and \"hard-to-contrast\" samples, which are determined without manual annotations and rely instead on the model's pseudo-labels.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we see that label diversity significantly influences the performance of active querying strategies [7]. Moreover, hard-to-contrast data, identified through pseudo-labels, are considered more typical of the entire dataset and carry shared characteristics across classes [9]. These data points are typically found in regions of lower confidence and higher variability on the dataset map [9].\n\nIn particular, the **Data Map by ground truth** requires manual annotation and tends to highlight specific class distributions, which may not be as diverse or representative of the overall dataset due to selection bias [6]. On the other hand, the **Data Map by pseudo-labels** helps achieve a more balanced representation of classes, especially minority ones, thereby improving label diversity [4].\n\nThus, while both maps show confidence and variability, the **map by pseudo-labels** likely exhibits a larger confidence variance because it captures a broader range of data points—especially from minority classes—that are otherwise overlooked in the ground-truth-based map.

For specific slots such as 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by,' the performance of these models differs due to their underlying methodologies.\n\nFor the 'taxi-leave at' slot, which is typically a span-based slot, DS-DST relies on extracting values directly from the dialog context using span matching. However, this approach can be limited when the exact string representation of the time is not explicitly mentioned or formatted consistently. In contrast, DS-Picklist benefits from access to a full ontology, allowing it to select values from a predefined list of candidate values. This makes DS-Picklist more robust for slots like 'taxi-leave at,' where the correct value may not be found through span extraction alone.\n\nSimilarly, for the 'train-arrive by' slot, both models face challenges due to the nature of the information being time-related and often expressed in non-standard formats. DS-DST struggles with these cases because it depends on span matching, which may fail if the required string is not present in the context. On the other hand, DS-Picklist's ability to use a candidate-value list allows it to predict these values more accurately, even when they are not explicitly mentioned in the dialogue.\n\nThe differences in performance are further supported by Table 5, which highlights that DS-Picklist significantly reduces error rates for slots like 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' compared to DS-Span and DS-DST [10].

Step-Back prompting allows the model to abstract from specific details and focus on high-level concepts, which makes the retrieval process more effective [10]. As a result, the retrieved information is more relevant and better aligned with the task at hand, leading to improved accuracy.\n\n![Step-Back + RAG achieves the best performance on MuSiQue and StrategyQA](image3)\n\nIn contrast, other prompting techniques like CoT and TDB provide only modest improvements on MuSiQue (around 3–3.5%) but fail to show significant gains on StrategyQA, likely due to the already high baseline performance on this task [9].

Based on the information provided in [2], Table II summarizes the main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding datasets. Additionally, from image2, we understand that the table categorizes various tasks related to QA, dialog, information extraction (IE), reasoning, and other NLP applications. Each category is divided into sub-tasks, with associated datasets and methods cited by numerical references.\n\nFrom the description of image2, it is clear that each dataset is linked to specific methods used in studies, represented by citation numbers. However, the task at hand requires identifying datasets that are associated with **exactly three methods**.\n\nLet’s analyze the relevant data from image2:\n\n- **QA (Question Answering):**\n  - **Single-hop:** Uses datasets like Natural Question (NQ), TriviaQA (TQA), SQuAD, and others. Methods are indicated by citation numbers.\n  - **Multi-hop:** Datasets like HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA are listed along with the methods.\n  - **Long-form QA:** Includes datasets like ELI5 and NarrativeQA with relevant methods.\n\n- **Dialog:**\n  - Tasks include dialog generation and personal dialog, with datasets like Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) and KBP.\n\n- **Information Extraction (IE):**\n  - Sub-tasks include event argument extraction and relation extraction, using datasets like WikiEvent and T-REx.\n\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - Covers commonsense reasoning and complex reasoning with datasets like HellaSwag and CSQA.\n\n- **Others:**\n  - Includes language understanding, modeling, fact-checking, and more, with datasets like MMLU and WikiText-103.\n\nEach entry links tasks and datasets with diverse methods used in studies, represented by numerical citations.\n\nNow, based on this breakdown, we can infer that certain datasets may be associated with multiple methods. For example, **HotpotQA**, as a multi-hop QA dataset, likely has several methods associated with it due to its complexity. Similarly, **NarrativeQA** and **ELI5** might also have multiple methods since they deal with long-form answers.\n\nHowever, without direct access to the full contents of Table II or the exact number of methods for each dataset, it's challenging to definitively state which datasets have **exactly three methods**. Nonetheless, based on the structure and examples given in image2, **HotpotQA** and **NarrativeQA** are strong candidates, as they are described as being suitable for multi-hop and long-form question answering, respectively—both of which typically involve a variety of methods.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact count of methods per dataset isn’t explicitly stated, **HotpotQA** and **NarrativeQA** are likely among the datasets that have exactly three methods, given their roles in multi-hop and long-form QA scenarios. \n\n![Datasets with multiple methods](image2)"}

The tree traversal method involves traversing the tree layer-by-layer, selecting the most relevant nodes at each level based on cosine similarity to the query vector [8]. This process continues until reaching the leaf nodes, where the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context [8].\n\nIn contrast, the collapsed tree approach evaluates nodes collectively across all layers, effectively flattening the tree into a single layer for comparison [5]. This allows for a more flexible retrieval process, as it considers all nodes simultaneously rather than sequentially [6]. However, this flexibility comes with a computational cost, as it requires performing cosine similarity searches on all nodes in the tree [3].\n\nTo compare the performance of these two methods in terms of F1 score across different context lengths, we refer to image3, which illustrates the results of an experiment conducted on the QASPER dataset. The graph shows that the collapsed tree method (represented by the green line) achieves the highest F1 scores, peaking at 2000 tokens before slightly decreasing as the context length increases to 2500 tokens. In contrast, the tree traversal method (represented by the blue line) shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length but consistently performs lower than the collapsed tree method [10].\n\nThis comparison highlights the superior performance of the collapsed tree approach in terms of F1 score across varying context lengths, making it the preferred method for the experiments conducted in the study.\n\n![Collapsed tree method achieves higher F1 scores compared to tree traversal across different context lengths](image3)"}

This wide variety of image formats ensures that models are tested on a broad range of visual inputs, which is a significant departure from the narrower scope of previous benchmarks.\n\nIn terms of **depth**, the MMMU benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge, which is more advanced than the commonsense or simple physical/temporal reasoning typically required by other benchmarks [2].

Take the cable car up to the top of Bergen where you’ll find a fantastic landscape, views, activities and unique culinary experiences in Sky skrape ren Restaurant.\" [8]  \n- \"Sky sk rape ren is located at the top of Mount Ulriken with a spectacular view overlooking Bergen and its surrounding mountains, fjords and ever-changing weather.\" [5]  \n\nNow, looking at the image descriptions, **image1** is described as: *\"The image shows a dining table set elegantly with wine glasses, plates, and napkins, positioned in front of a large window. Outside, there is a scenic view of a mountainous landscape under a partly cloudy sky. The setting has a sophisticated and serene ambiance.\"* This matches the description of **Skyskraoeren**, given its location on Mount Ulriken and the panoramic view of the city and mountains [5].\n\nThus, we can conclude that **image1** depicts the **Skyskraoeren** restaurant.\n\nIn **image1**, the description explicitly mentions *\"wine glasses\"*, but it does not specify the number of goblets. However, it says *\"a dining table set elegantly with wine glasses\"*, which implies multiple goblets are present, though the exact number is not stated.\n\nTherefore, while the image shows **goblets** (wine glasses), the specific **number** is not provided in the image description. \n\n![A dining table set elegantly with wine glasses, plates, and napkins, positioned in front of a large window with a scenic view of a mountainous landscape](image1)\n\nThe figure showing Skyskraoeren includes goblets, but the exact number is not specified in the description."}

This standard is related to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and similar regulations that restrict the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that Lenovo products comply with several international standards, including the RoHS 2 Directive (Directive 2011/65/EU), which restricts the use of hazardous substances such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) [10]. Additionally, the Republic of Turkey also has a directive on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in WEEE [9], which aligns with these international standards.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, **image3** provides a detailed table about component substance declarations for RoHS compliance. It shows that for the **hard disk**, the presence of **lead (Pb)** is indicated by an \"X\", meaning it is present. However, all other substances—mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), PBB, and PBDE—are marked with an \"O\", indicating compliance or absence within permissible limits.\n\nThis suggests that while the hard disk contains lead, it does not exceed the limits for other restricted substances. However, since the question specifically refers to the **GB/T 26572** standard, which may have specific thresholds for each substance, we must determine whether the presence of lead in the hard disk exceeds those thresholds.\n\nUnfortunately, no direct mention of **GB/T 26572** is made in the provided text or image quotes. However, given that the **hard disk** contains **lead (Pb)** as per **image3**, and assuming that the **GB/T 26572** standard aligns with RoHS restrictions, it is possible that **lead (Pb)** could be the element in question if its concentration in the hard disk exceeds the permitted levels under this standard.\n\n![Lead is present in the hard disk component according to the RoHS compliance table](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, **lead (Pb)** is the chemical element present in the hard disk, and it may potentially exceed the limit requirements stipulated in the GB/T 26572 standard."}

For instance, NAMRU-3 has been collaborating with the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR) on projects focused on disease vector surveillance, detection of vector-borne viral pathogens such as malaria, and vector control [5]. These efforts have enabled Liberia to independently expand its capacity for disease surveillance and detection, which benefits not only the Liberian Armed Forces but also the general population. This collaboration is part of broader military-to-military engagements aimed at improving local healthcare systems through training and shared resources [7].\n\nIn addition to supporting local communities, these initiatives also protect U.S. military personnel. For example, NAMRU-3, in collaboration with the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence (NECE), has implemented insecticide spraying programs combined with surveillance and geospatial mapping to reduce the distribution of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. As a result, no malaria infections have been diagnosed in U.S. troops since the onset of the spraying [1]. This illustrates how environmental vector controls and anti-malarial prophylaxis contribute to force health protection policies.\n\nThe impact of these efforts extends beyond malaria control. The Patient Condition Occurrence Frequency (PCOF) tool, developed by the Expeditionary Medicine Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis group at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), provides a functional and accurate means of estimating the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types in various military scenarios [4]. Once accredited, this tool will support military medical planning by enabling more precise healthcare simulations, which in turn enhances readiness and response capabilities for both military and civilian populations in diverse operational environments.\n\n![Military-to-military engagement in Liberia](image4)  \n![Collaboration in disease vector surveillance](image1)  \n\nThese examples highlight the dual focus of NAMRU activities: protecting U.S. military personnel while simultaneously strengthening local healthcare infrastructures in partner nations."}

These systems are central to managing patient data and clinical workflows efficiently.\n\nLooking at the data from image2, we see that while the adoption of **Electronic Medical Records** increased slightly from 61% in 2005 to 62% in 2006, other key systems like **Bar Coded Medication Management** and **CPOE** saw a slight decline in adoption rates. This suggests that while some foundational systems are being adopted more widely, others face challenges or slower growth.\n\nHowever, image4 provides a forward-looking perspective. It indicates that **Access to Patient Clinical Information** is expected to increase from 45% today to 53% in two years, and **Physician Access for Clinical Orders** is projected to rise from 44% to 57%. This implies a growing emphasis on improving access to critical patient data and enabling more efficient clinical workflows through technology.\n\nAdditionally, image1 shows that **Reducing Medical Errors** was a significant concern in 2006, with 57% of respondents prioritizing it, compared to 44% in 2005. This aligns with the broader push for better integration and interoperability [6] and the use of decision support systems [1], which aim to minimize errors and improve patient safety.\n\n![Expected increase in access to patient clinical information](image4)  \n![Trends in adoption of electronic medical records and CPOE](image2)  \n\nIn conclusion, the functions related to patient information and clinical orders are expected to evolve toward greater integration and accessibility, with an increasing focus on reducing medical errors and improving operational efficiency."}

This transformation begins with raw data, which is then used to generate reports, analyzed for deeper insights, and ultimately translated into actionable decisions that drive value.\n\nIn the **data-driven process**, illustrated in image1, the journey starts with **Data**—a foundational element stored in a blue cylinder. From here, the data moves into the **Reporting** phase, where it is visualized through charts and graphs to provide an overview of what has happened [1]. Next, the data undergoes **Analysis**, represented by a magnifying glass over a chart, where insights are extracted to understand why certain trends or patterns exist [3]. These insights lead to the **Action** phase, symbolized by a figure walking, indicating that informed decisions are made based on the analysis. Finally, this leads to **Value**, depicted as an upward-trending graph, showing the tangible benefits derived from the actions taken [6].\n\nThis progression aligns with the **analytics value chain**, which emphasizes that the true value is only realized when data is pushed all the way through the chain—from collection, to analysis, to decision-making, action, and finally impact. As stated in quote [6], \"Push data through 'analytics value chain' from collection, analysis, decisions, action, and finally to impact. Partway along chain doesn't count.\" This underscores the importance of completing the entire chain to achieve meaningful outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the **levels of analytics** illustrate a hierarchy from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling, as shown in image2. Starting with **Standard Reports** that answer \"What happened?\" and moving up to **Predictive Modelling** that addresses \"What will happen next?\" each level represents an increase in both **business value** and **degree of intelligence**. The transition from **Business Intelligence** (stages 1–4) to **Business Analytics** (stages 5–8) reflects a shift from descriptive to prescriptive analytics, where insights not only explain past events but also guide future strategies [3].\n\nThe distinction between **Reporting** and **Analysis** further clarifies this progression. Reporting is **descriptive**, focusing on backward-looking information and raising questions, while Analysis is **prescriptive**, offering forward-looking insights and answering those questions [image3]. This evolution is essential in driving business value, as highlighted in the table comparing these two phases: reporting transforms data into information, while analysis combines data and information to produce actionable insights [3].\n\nFinally, the ultimate goal of this process is to ensure that data and analytics are embedded into every level of decision-making, as emphasized in quote [4]: \"Managers that expect and rely on data insights to make informed decisions. More generally across organization, data and analytics are deeply embedded into our processes and decisions.\"\n\n![Data-driven process leading to value](image1)  \n![Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image2)  \n![Comparison of Reporting and Analysis](image3)  \n\nIn conclusion, the process of transforming data into business value progresses through a clear chain of stages—from data collection and reporting to in-depth analysis and strategic decision-making—ensuring that insights lead to impactful actions that drive organizational success."}

The **Analytics Value Chain** provides a clear pathway for how data moves from collection to impact, while the **Levels of Analytics** illustrate the progression in depth and intelligence of analytical work. Together, they form a cohesive model for understanding how organizations can systematically leverage data to drive decisions and create value.\n\nThe **Analytics Value Chain**, as described in quote [4], emphasizes that data must be pushed through several stages—collection, analysis, decisions, and finally, impact. Each stage builds upon the previous one, ensuring that data is not only collected but also analyzed, acted upon, and ultimately leads to measurable outcomes. However, the chain stresses that partial progress is not enough; the full journey from data to impact is essential. This concept aligns with the idea that analytics should not stop at generating reports or insights but must lead to tangible business results.\n\nMeanwhile, the **Levels of Analytics**, depicted in image2, show a progression from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling and optimization. Starting with standard reports that answer \"What happened?\" and moving up to forecasting and optimization, which ask \"What will happen next?\" and \"What's the best that can happen?\" respectively, this hierarchy reflects increasing complexity and intelligence in analytical work. It highlights that as an organization evolves its analytical maturity, it can move beyond merely describing past events to predicting and influencing future outcomes.\n\nThese two concepts complement each other by providing both a **process framework** (the Analytics Value Chain) and a **capability roadmap** (the Levels of Analytics). For example, the Analytics Value Chain ensures that data is processed through all necessary stages to reach impact, while the Levels of Analytics ensure that the analytical work performed at each stage is sufficiently advanced to deliver meaningful insights. A company may use reporting (Level 1) to raise questions about performance, then apply statistical analysis (Level 5) to understand why certain trends are occurring, and finally use predictive modeling (Level 7) to make informed decisions that drive value.\n\n![Data is transformed into value through a structured process involving reporting, analysis, action, and impact.](image4)\n\nThis interplay between the Analytics Value Chain and the Levels of Analytics is critical for creating a **data-driven culture**, as highlighted in quote [7], where data and analytics are deeply embedded into organizational processes and decisions.

These systems are particularly useful in both light and heavy construction, allowing contractors to handle a variety of tasks, including straight, battered, curved, or cut-up vertical walls, regardless of height [4].\n\nOne significant advancement in this field has been the development of gang forming, which involves grouping multiple forms together and moving them as a single unit [5]. This technique enhances efficiency and reduces labor requirements on-site, as it allows for the reuse of forms either as large sections or individual units [3]. Additionally, prefabricated systems offer the advantage of being able to remove and replace forms at any point during the construction process, simplifying erection and stripping [8].\n\n![Large yellow frame structure and partially constructed interior space with staircase](image1)\n\nAnother example of prefabricated formwork is illustrated in an image showing a 3D model of a construction formwork setup for creating a concrete column.

The diagram shows how light rays reflect off a surface, with one arrow labeled as the angle of incidence and another as the angle of reflection. This visual representation aligns with the concept of reflection discussed in the text quotes.\n\nAnother example of a reflecting surface is found in the context of CDs and DVDs, as mentioned in [2]. These discs have microscopic pits that act like the absence of light in Morse code. When a laser hits a shiny surface, it reflects, but when it hits a pit, it doesn't reflect. This reflective property of the shiny surface on CDs and DVDs is crucial for transmitting data to computer chips.\n\n![Reflection of light rays off a surface](image5)  \n![Shiny surface of a CD or DVD reflecting a laser](image1)  \n\nIn conclusion, two examples of reflecting surfaces are the shiny surface of a CD or DVD and a flat surface that reflects light rays according to the law of reflection."}

According to the provided materials, this shift is not merely about processing more data but involves deeper analytical capabilities that drive strategic decision-making and impact.\n\nIn the context of BI, the focus is primarily on descriptive analytics—answering questions like \"What happened?\" and \"How many, how often, where?\" This is illustrated in **image3**, which shows the progression from Standard Reports to Ad-Hoc Reports and Query Drilldowns, all of which are foundational elements of BI. These stages emphasize backward-looking analysis and provide a clear picture of past performance [3]. \n\nHowever, as we move into BA, the emphasis shifts towards predictive and prescriptive analytics, addressing more complex questions such as \"Why is this happening?\" and \"What will happen next?\" As depicted in **image3**, BA encompasses stages like Statistical Analysis, Forecasting, Predictive Modelling, and Optimisation. These advanced stages reflect a higher degree of intelligence and greater business value, enabling organizations to anticipate future trends and make informed decisions [3].\n\nThis evolution is further supported by the concept of the \"analytics value chain\" described in [3], which emphasizes that true impact comes only when data moves through the entire chain—from collection, to analysis, to action, and finally to measurable outcomes. Simply analyzing data without taking action does not yield impact, highlighting the importance of moving beyond BI to BA for meaningful results.\n\nAdditionally, **image4** visually represents this transformation, showing how data is transformed into value through a series of steps: from raw data storage, to reporting, to analysis, then to action, and ultimately to increased value. This flowchart underscores the necessity of progressing from basic reporting to deeper analysis to unlock actionable insights [4].\n\nMoreover, the distinction between reporting and analysis is clearly outlined in **image5**, where reporting is characterized as descriptive, backward-looking, and focused on raising questions, while analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, and aimed at answering those questions with insights. This highlights how BA enhances data handling by incorporating both data and existing information to derive actionable recommendations [5].\n\n![Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the transition from business intelligence to business analytics enhances data handling and insights generation by shifting from descriptive, backward-looking analysis to predictive and prescriptive, forward-looking approaches, thereby enabling organizations to achieve greater strategic impact."}

In the case of pea plants, Gregor Mendel discovered that traits are determined by heritable factors (now known as genes) that are passed on in discrete units [2]. When considering a monohybrid cross, such as between plants with purple flowers (dominant trait) and white flowers (recessive trait), the first generation (F₁) consists entirely of plants with purple flowers because the dominant allele masks the recessive one [5]. \n\nThis phenomenon is explained by the fact that each parent contributes one allele to their offspring, and if one allele is dominant, it will be expressed in the phenotype regardless of the other allele [7]. However, in the second generation (F₂), when the F₁ hybrids self-pollinate, the alleles segregate during gamete formation, leading to a predictable phenotypic ratio of 3:1 (three-quarters purple-flowered plants and one-quarter white-flowered plants) [5]. This segregation of alleles is visually represented in image4, where the F₂ generation shows this phenotypic ratio along with the corresponding genotypic distribution of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp [image4].\n\nThe concept of dominant and recessive alleles further clarifies why certain traits appear to disappear in the F₁ generation but reappear in the F₂ generation. For instance, the recessive allele for white flowers (p) is not expressed in the F₁ generation because it is masked by the dominant allele (P) inherited from the purple-flowered parent [6]. However, in the F₂ generation, there is a chance for two recessive alleles (pp) to come together, resulting in the expression of the white flower trait [5].\n\n![Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in F2 generation](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, Mendelian inheritance explains the observed phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F₂ generation through the principles of allele segregation and dominance, which are clearly illustrated in the genetic cross diagram [5]."}

This is illustrated in image4, where a classical Mendelian cross is depicted. The parental generation consists of homozygous plants with PP (purple flowers) and pp (white flowers). When these are crossed, all offspring in the F1 generation are heterozygous (Pp), displaying the dominant purple phenotype [10].\n\nAs the F1 hybrids (Pp) produce gametes, they segregate their alleles, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. When these gametes combine randomly, the F2 generation exhibits both genotypic and phenotypic variation. According to image4, the genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp, while the phenotypic ratio is 3 purple to 1 white. This outcome aligns with the principle that dominant alleles mask recessive ones in the phenotype [8].\n\n![Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in F2 generation](image4)\n\nThe observed phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is **3 purple to 1 white**, and the genotypic ratio is **1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp**."}

One of the most significant challenges is related to **management and culture**, rather than data or technology [2]. This highlights that internal misalignment and resistance to change can be more obstructive than technical limitations. In fact, a siloed approach is identified as the greatest barrier to adoption [3], which aligns with the observation that \"there is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" [image1]. This issue is reported by 52% of respondents, underscoring its prevalence.\n\nAnother key barrier is the lack of **resources** and **technical infrastructure** to support such an approach, with 36% and 28% of respondents respectively identifying these as challenges [image1]. Additionally, the inability to measure the influence of activities on customer behavior is also a concern, noted by 27% of respondents [image1].\n\nThe challenge of **measuring customer engagement** accurately is further emphasized in text quotes, where it is stated that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure” [2], and “what you measure will determine what you do” [2]. These statements highlight the importance of selecting the right metrics—those that reflect what matters most, such as customer engagement, conversion, and satisfaction [2]. However, many organizations are still focusing too much on reach and not enough on engagement [6], and they often drown in data without deriving actionable insights [6].\n\nFurthermore, there is a notable gap between **quantitative and qualitative data**, with too much emphasis placed on quantitative metrics like site visits and transactions, while qualitative aspects such as brand awareness, loyalty, and sentiment are overlooked [5]. This is particularly relevant given the complexity of modern marketing, where traditional metrics fail to capture the full story of customer behavior [8].\n\nIn terms of organizational structure, the absence of a **360-degree view** of customer behavior is another major obstacle [6]. Marketers are often constrained by tactical metrics and unable to see the complete picture of their activities and customer interactions. This lack of integration is compounded by issues such as inconsistent digital marketing taxonomies, unclear roles and responsibilities, and a lack of skilled resources [6].\n\nDespite these challenges, some progress is being made. For instance, while only 35% of organizations are product/brand focused, 44% are customer focused [image2], indicating a shift toward more integrated strategies. However, this shift is not yet universal, and many companies still struggle with aligning their efforts across departments and functions.\n\nIn summary, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include **siloed structures**, **lack of ownership and alignment**, **insufficient resources and technical capabilities**, **inadequate measurement frameworks**, and **an overemphasis on quantitative data at the expense of qualitative insights**. Addressing these issues requires a cultural shift, investment in the right tools and people, and a commitment to measuring what truly matters for customer engagement and satisfaction. \n\n![Siloed approaches and misaligned goals are major challenges](image1)"}

For instance, while functions like posting policies and procedures and staff communication are expected to decrease in use, access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are projected to increase [image2]. This shift indicates a move toward more efficient, data-driven operations that prioritize direct access to critical health information.\n\nSimilarly, the trends observed in website and technology adoption for the next two years, as illustrated in image5, show an upward trajectory in the adoption of technologies such as single sign-on/identity management, bar code technology, speech recognition, and wireless information appliances. These advancements support the integration of clinical workflows and improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery, reinforcing the importance of consolidating information systems [9].\n\nMoreover, the diffusion of innovations model depicted in image4 provides context for how these technological and functional changes might unfold over time.

This reflects how we naturally perceive objects that are near each other as part of the same group.\n\nAnother clear example is **Similarity**, where the letters \"T\" and \"A\" share a similar striped pattern, leading us to group them visually based on their shared characteristics [5]. This demonstrates how similarity in shape or color influences our perception of grouping.\n\nMoreover, the principle of **Continuity** is shown through the \"S,\" which follows a continuous contour line, guiding the eye along a smooth flow or pathway [4]. This illustrates how we tend to see lines as continuing in a particular direction rather than breaking abruptly.\n\nFinally, the concept of **Pregnanz (Prägnanz)**, which emphasizes simplicity and clarity in perception, is highlighted by the straightforward and clean design of the letter \"A\" [3].

According to the text quote, current system fragments patient information and creates redundant, inefficient efforts [5], but future systems are expected to consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts [8]. This shift underscores the growing importance of integrated digital platforms, including web and intranet functions.\n\nLooking at the projected trends in web and intranet usage, image3 reveals that while some functions like posting policies and procedures (currently 87%, projected to drop to 70%) and staff communication (currently 82%, projected to drop to 70%) may see reduced use, other areas such as access to patient clinical information (currently 45%, projected to rise to 53%) and physician access for clinical orders (currently 44%, projected to rise to 57%) are expected to grow significantly. Additionally, there is a marked decline in the number of organizations without an intranet, from 7% today to just 1% in two years. These changes indicate a move toward more centralized, data-driven operations within healthcare institutions.\n\nThis transformation will necessitate new staffing needs. For instance, the text quote \"2006 Health IT Staffing Needs\" [2] highlights the increasing demand for specialized roles in health information technology. Image2 further supports this by showing the distribution of roles in healthcare IT, with Network Support (27%), Clinical Informaticists (24%), and Process/Workflow Design (24%) being among the most significant. As healthcare organizations increasingly rely on web and intranet functions, the need for skilled professionals who can manage, design, and support these systems will grow.\n\nMoreover, the increased use of technologies such as automated alerts to clinicians, wireless information appliances, and speech recognition—shown in image1—suggests a broader reliance on digital tools, which in turn demands more personnel trained in supporting and maintaining these systems. Roles such as Application Support (22%) and Systems Integration (15%) will become even more vital as healthcare systems work to unify fragmented data and streamline workflows.\n\nIn conclusion, the projected increase in the use of web and intranet functions in healthcare indicates a growing need for specialized staffing in areas such as network support, clinical informatics, and systems integration to ensure the effective implementation and maintenance of these technologies."}

The diagram in image4 illustrates this configuration clearly, where the **throttle valve** and **injector** are positioned close to each other, with the **fuel** and **air** entering the system and mixing before being distributed through the **intake manifold** to the **engine** [4].\n\nOn the other hand, in MPFI systems, the injectors are placed in each branch of the intake manifold, below the throttle valve [3]. This means that the throttle valve is situated above the injectors, not beneath them. Image3 shows a typical MPFI system, where the **throttle valve** controls the air intake, and the **injectors** are located in the **intake manifold**, spraying fuel into the airflow before it reaches the **engine**.\n\nTherefore, the throttle valve is placed beneath the fuel injector only in systems where the injector is located in the throttle body, such as in Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) systems. This is evident from the description of image4, where the **throttle valve** and **injector** are closely positioned, with the **fuel** and **air** entering the system and mixing before being delivered to the **engine**.\n\n![Throttle valve and injector positioned together in TBI system](image4)"}

According to the data presented in the table described in image4, the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, but as more hot dogs are consumed, the utility decreases: +4 for the second, 0 for the third, and then becomes negative with the fourth (-1), fifth (-4), and sixth (-10) hot dogs. This pattern indicates that while the initial consumption of hot dogs increases satisfaction, each subsequent hot dog provides less utility than the previous one, eventually leading to dissatisfaction or even negative utility.\n\nThis phenomenon aligns with the broader economic theory that as individuals consume more of a good, the additional satisfaction (or utility) they gain from each additional unit tends to decrease. This is illustrated in image5, which also highlights the concept of **diminishing marginal utility** through a similar table showing how utility drops significantly with each additional hot dog consumed, even turning negative at higher quantities.\n\nMoreover, image5 introduces an interesting twist by showing a dramatic jump in utility at the 64th hot dog, where it goes from -50 to +5000. This could suggest that under certain conditions—perhaps due to competition or specific rewards—utility can suddenly increase again, indicating that context plays a significant role in consumption behavior.\n\nIn summary, the change in utility with each additional hot dog implies that consumers should be mindful of their consumption levels to maximize satisfaction. Initially, increasing consumption brings greater utility, but beyond a certain point, it leads to diminishing returns and potentially negative outcomes. This suggests that optimal consumption occurs before the point where utility begins to decline [4], and it reinforces the importance of balancing variety and focus in consumption decisions [9]. \n\n![Diminishing marginal utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed](image4)"}

It consists of two consecutive divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. The differences between these two divisions are crucial for reducing the chromosome number and ensuring genetic diversity.\n\nIn **meiosis I**, homologous chromosomes separate. This process begins during **prophase I**, where homologous chromosomes pair up to form tetrads, and crossing over occurs, contributing to genetic variation [7]. During **anaphase I**, homologous chromosomes are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell, effectively halving the chromosome number [7]. By the end of meiosis I, two haploid cells are formed, each containing one set of chromosomes [9]. This stage is illustrated in image5, which clearly shows **meiosis I** as the phase where **homologous chromosomes separate** [5].\n\nIn contrast, **meiosis II** resembles mitosis in that it involves the separation of sister chromatids. During **prophase II**, the nuclear envelope breaks down again, and spindle fibers form [8]. In **anaphase II**, the sister chromatids are separated and pulled to opposite poles [4]. This division does not reduce the chromosome number further, as the cells are already haploid [7]. Image3 provides a visual representation of this process, showing **sister chromatids separating** and the formation of **haploid daughter cells** [3].\n\nThe key difference between meiosis I and meiosis II lies in what is being separated: homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and sister chromatids in meiosis II.

Specifically, quote [7] outlines parameters like `?fill` and `?stroke`, which define the fill and outline colors of geoshapes. This suggests that the color of a country like Mali would be determined by the value assigned to the `?fill` variable in the corresponding query.\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides direct evidence about how colors are associated with African countries. The table includes a column labeled **fill**, which contains hexadecimal color codes for each country. For example, Mali is listed with the color code `#6A5ACD`.

For instance, while the percentage of healthcare organizations prioritizing the implementation of an **Electronic Medical Record (EMR)** remained relatively stable—45% in 2005 and 46% in 2006—there was a slight decline in the priority placed on **reducing medical errors** and **promoting patient safety**, which dropped from 50% to 35% [4]. Similarly, priorities such as **implementing wireless systems** and **upgrading network infrastructure** saw significant decreases over the same period [4]. This suggests that while EMR implementation continued to be a focus, other areas of IT innovation were becoming less of a priority.\n\nIn contrast, the adoption of specific healthcare IT systems also showed mixed results. The use of **digital picture archiving (PACS)** increased from 26% in 2005 to 42% in 2006 [2], indicating growing interest in this area. However, the adoption of **ambulatory systems** decreased from 22% to 17% during the same time frame [2]. These trends suggest that while some technologies were gaining traction, others faced challenges or declining interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the barriers to implementing IT in healthcare also evolved between 2005 and 2006. One of the most persistent concerns was **internal breach of security**, which remained a top concern at 56% in 2005 and slightly decreased to 51% in 2006 [1]. Concerns about **HIPAA compliance** dropped significantly, from 35% in 2005 to just 18% in 2006 [1]. This may reflect either improved compliance measures or a shift in organizational priorities.\n\nHowever, new or growing concerns emerged. For example, the percentage of respondents citing **vendors' inability to effectively deliver products** increased from 12% in 2005 to 18% in 2006 [3]. Additionally, the **lack of financial support** rose from 18% to 20% during the same period [3]. These findings indicate that while some traditional concerns like HIPAA compliance declined, new challenges related to vendor performance and funding became more prominent.\n\n![Top Security Concerns in Healthcare IT](image1)  \n![Healthcare IT Priorities Over Time](image4)  \n![Barriers to Implementing IT in Healthcare](image3)\n\nIn summary, the adoption of healthcare IT applications from 2005 to 2006 showed mixed trends, with some technologies gaining momentum while others lost priority. At the same time, barriers to implementation shifted, with issues like vendor performance and financial constraints becoming more pressing compared to earlier concerns like HIPAA compliance."}

For instance, the lead funnel progression [8] outlines how many leads convert into Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs), Sales-Accepted Leads (SALs), Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs), and ultimately into Sales-Won Opportunities (SWO). These metrics provide a clear view of how efficiently the organization is moving leads through the funnel.\n\nSimilarly, marketing diagnostics offer average conversion rates across various stages of the sales funnel, such as the 2-5% conversion rate from awareness to names [3], the 4-8% conversion rate from contacts to MQLs, and the 45-75% conversion rate for SALs [image3]. These averages help identify where the funnel might be underperforming or excelling compared to industry benchmarks.\n\nFor example, if a company's MQL to SAL conversion rate is significantly lower than the diagnostic average of 45-75%, it could signal inefficiencies in the handoff between marketing and sales teams. This insight can then guide targeted improvements, such as better lead qualification processes or enhanced training for sales representatives [2].\n\n![Lead Funnel Conversion Rates](image4)  \n![Average Conversion Rates by Funnel Stage](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression are closely aligned with the average conversion rates found in marketing diagnostics, providing a comprehensive view of performance and opportunities for improvement."}

These systems allow contractors to handle various types of work, including straight, battered, curved, or cut-up vertical walls, and can be erected to any wall height. Text quote [5] highlights that these systems minimize concrete drop and ensure effective vibration during placement.\n\nIn addition to wooden frameworks, **metal systems** are illustrated in image3, showing reinforced formwork assemblies supported by scaffolding. These systems are particularly useful for creating strong and stable structures while pouring concrete [3].\n\nFinally, the **rolled sheet metal component** shown in image2 emphasizes the use of stiffener ribs and edge bolts, which contribute to the structural integrity of the formwork. This type of formwork is likely used in cylindrical structures, providing additional strength and stability against external forces such as wind or impact [2].\n\n![Circular column formwork with labeled components](image1)  \n![Rolled sheet metal component with stiffener ribs and edge bolts](image2)  \n![Concrete formwork structures at a construction site](image3)  \n![Circular object secured within a timber frame using wedges](image4)  \n![Detailed technical illustrations of column formwork](image5)\n\nIn summary, the special forms of column formworks illustrated in the slides include circular, two-piece fabricated steel, prefabricated systems for varied constructions, specialized solutions for small columns, and metal-reinforced formwork, all aimed at ensuring structural integrity and efficient construction processes."}

The choice between 20mm and 25mm sheeting depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as the load-bearing capacity needed and the type of concrete being poured. \n\nAccording to standard practices, 18mm plywood is typically sufficient for most pours [5]. However, if the weight of the concrete is expected to cause bowing or distortion in thinner materials, thicker plywood may be required [6]. This suggests that 25mm sheeting might be more appropriate in scenarios where higher strength and rigidity are necessary.\n\nFor instance, when constructing columns or walls, especially those subjected to heavy loads, using 25mm sheeting can help prevent deformation during the concrete pouring process. This is supported by the description of an image showing wooden formwork with vertical panels held together by horizontal metal braces, emphasizing the need for sturdy materials [image1].\n\nMoreover, the table provided outlines that sheeting for slabs, beam sides, and column sides ranges from 25mm to 40mm [image3], indicating that 25mm is within the acceptable range for such applications.\n\n![Timber formwork with vertical wooden panels and metal braces](image1)  \nWhile 20mm sheeting could be used in less demanding situations, 25mm sheeting is generally considered more appropriate for timber formwork due to its increased durability and resistance to deformation under heavier loads. Therefore, 25mm sheeting is the preferred choice for most standard construction projects involving timber formwork."}

As described in the text, the ECU is an embedded system that controls one or more electrical systems or subsystems in a motor vehicle [2]. Specifically, it determines the amount of fuel, ignition timing, and other parameters necessary for the internal combustion engine to operate efficiently [4].\n\nThe ECU accomplishes this by reading values from sensors that monitor various aspects of the engine's operation. These sensors include the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor [5]. The information collected from these sensors allows the ECU to make real-time adjustments to ensure optimal engine performance.\n\nFor example, the ECU regulates the opening and closing of injector valves based on input from these sensors, ensuring that the correct amount of fuel is delivered to the engine [3]. Additionally, it adjusts the ignition timing to enhance both power and fuel economy [6]. In some systems, the ECU also controls idle speed using a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control step motor [5].\n\nThis functionality is visually represented in image5, which shows the ECU at the center of the diagram, connected to multiple sensors on the left and injectors on the right, with directional arrows indicating the flow of information and control signals [image5].\n\n![The Engine Control Unit (ECU) is at the center of the system, receiving data from various sensors and sending control signals to the injectors.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the role of the Engine Control Unit (ECU) in the depicted engine management system is to regulate fuel delivery, ignition timing, and other engine parameters by processing sensor inputs and controlling the injectors."}

This duplication ensures that each daughter cell will receive an exact copy of the genetic material [10]. The process of DNA replication is crucial for maintaining genetic continuity across generations.\n\nAs the DNA copies separate, the cell begins to elongate. This elongation is essential for creating space between the two newly replicated chromosomes, allowing them to be positioned at opposite ends of the cell [10]. This step ensures that during the final division, each daughter cell will receive one complete set of genetic material.\n\nFinally, the plasma membrane starts to grow inward at the midpoint of the cell, dividing the cytoplasm and separating the two copies of the chromosome into two distinct cells. This completes the process of binary fission, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells [10].\n\n![The image shows a bacterial cell dividing into two daughter cells, with genetic material being duplicated and split evenly between them.](image4)"}

This principle is illustrated in the context of hot dog consumption through several images and text quotes.\n\nIn standard consumption, as shown in image4, the utility derived from each additional hot dog decreases over time. The first hot dog provides +10 units of utility, but by the sixth hot dog, the utility drops to -10, indicating not only diminishing returns but also negative utility. This aligns with the idea that variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences; when enjoyment drops, we should switch to another choice [3]. In standard consumption economics, focusing on one activity or item too much can be detrimental, as it may lead to reduced overall satisfaction [4].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the impact of focus and repetitive practice can yield different outcomes. For instance, image3 shows a young athlete practicing soccer, emphasizing that \"Practice makes the game more fun to play because I know what I am doing. Practice makes it more likely that I will win and I like winning.\" This suggests that in competitive settings, focused practice can enhance both the experience and the outcome of an activity. Focused practice may result in increased utility due to improved activity experience and better outcomes from cumulative experience [7]. Furthermore, in competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be beneficial, leading to mastery and success [10].\n\nThis contrast is further highlighted by image5, which displays the relationship between hot dog consumption and utility in both diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome contexts. While the left side illustrates the typical pattern of decreasing utility, the right side shows a dramatic jump in utility at 64 hot dogs, suggesting that under certain conditions—like a competitive scenario—utility can increase dramatically. This could be analogous to how focused training in sports or other competitive fields can lead to significant improvements and outcomes, even if the initial stages show diminishing returns.\n\n![How standard consumption leads to diminishing utility with repeated hot dog consumption](image4)\n![How competitive contexts, such as sports, can benefit from focused practice and repetition](image3) \n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility typically results in lower satisfaction with repeated consumption in standard scenarios, competitive contexts can leverage focused practice and repetition to achieve improved performance and outcomes, thereby increasing utility."}

These two components are integral to understanding and responding to the evolving expectations of stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nThe **Needs Exploration** phase involves identifying and analyzing the requirements and expectations of stakeholders. This is not a one-time activity but an ongoing effort that ensures the solution being developed aligns with the actual needs of the users and business. As stated in the DAD framework, \"At the ha stage you reflect upon and question why disciplined agile strategies work, seeking to understand the range of strategies available to you and when they are best applied\" [6]. This reflection is crucial for ensuring that Needs Exploration is both effective and aligned with the broader goals of the project.\n\nMoreover, the DAD framework outlines various methods for Needs Exploration, such as **Active stakeholder participation**, **High-level requirements specification**, and **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming** [image2]. These methods allow teams to engage stakeholders directly or through proxies, ensuring that their voices are heard and incorporated into the development process. For instance, **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming** enables teams to quickly adapt to new insights or changes in stakeholder needs without getting bogged down by excessive documentation [image2].\n\nComplementing Needs Exploration is the use of **Elicitation Methods**, which are techniques used to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders. The DAD framework highlights several elicitation methods, including **JIT model storming**, **Look-ahead modeling**, and **All-hands demos** [image1]. These methods provide structured yet flexible ways to capture stakeholder input at different stages of the project. For example, **Look-ahead modeling** helps anticipate future requirements based on current trends and stakeholder feedback, while **All-hands demos** allow for broad stakeholder engagement and validation of the solution as it evolves.\n\nAdditionally, when stakeholders are geographically distributed, **Elicitation Methods** become even more critical. In such cases, teams may rely on **Indirectly via electronic means** or **Indirectly via proxies** to ensure that all stakeholders' needs are adequately addressed [image1]. This approach supports the agile principle of continuous communication and collaboration, even in complex or remote environments.\n\nBy combining **Needs Exploration** and **Elicitation Methods**, agile teams can effectively manage changing stakeholder needs and ensure that the final product meets the expectations of all involved parties. This process is further supported by tools like the **Work Item Management Strategy** and **Prioritization Strategy**, which help organize and prioritize stakeholder requirements [image1].\n\n![Addressing Changing Stakeholder Needs](image1)  \n![Exploring Needs and Producing a Solution](image2)  \n\nIn summary, the processes of **Needs Exploration** and **Elicitation Methods** contribute significantly to addressing stakeholder needs in agile project management by enabling continuous engagement, adapting to change, and ensuring that the final solution aligns with stakeholder expectations."}

During interphase, the cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and prepares for division. This stage is further divided into three sub-phases: **G₁**, **S**, and **G₂** [7]. The G₁ phase is characterized by cell growth and an increase in cytoplasm. The S phase involves the duplication of chromosomes, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of genetic material [6]. Finally, during the G₂ phase, the cell continues to grow and prepares for the actual process of division [7].\n\nThe mitotic phase includes **mitosis** and **cytokinesis** [10]. Mitosis is the division of the nucleus, during which the duplicated chromosomes are separated into two identical sets. Cytokinesis follows, dividing the cytoplasm and resulting in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells [2].\n\n![Interphase and Mitotic Phase of the Cell Cycle](image1)\n\nDuring interphase, as shown in image1, the cell undergoes significant growth and DNA replication, while the mitotic phase involves the physical separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm.

This is ideal for natural landscapes where even lighting is desired. On the other hand, if you're capturing a portrait, **Center Metering Mode** focuses on light near the center of the screen, ensuring that the subject—typically the face—is properly exposed [5]. For more specific focus areas, such as a subject's eyes, **Spot Metering Mode** provides precise control by focusing on light from a specific region [5].\n\nSimilarly, different focus modes are tailored for specific situations. **AF-S (single autofocus)** is best suited for stationary subjects, as it locks focus once the subject is in frame [image1]. In contrast, **AF-C (continuous autofocus)** is designed for moving subjects, continuously adjusting focus as the subject moves [image1]. Lastly, **MF (manual focus)** gives the user full control, allowing them to touch the subject of interest—such as a face—to achieve precise focus [image1].\n\n![Matrix metering mode is ideal for shooting natural landscapes](image5)  \n![AF-S (single) is best for stationary subjects](image1)\n\nBy fine-tuning these settings, photographers can adapt their approach to different environments and subjects, resulting in more professional and visually appealing images."}

To answer this, we need to focus on programmes that are delivered by coursework and fall under the category of \"disciplinary content.\" \n\nFrom the text quotes, we can see that several graduate programmes are offered, including those in applied linguistics, humanities education, life sciences, and more. Specifically, quote [7] outlines a programme in life sciences that offers three areas of specialization, and quote [6] discusses the duration and mode of study for various programmes.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, **image4** provides an overview of Master's and Doctoral programmes categorized into Research, Coursework, and Doctoral Programmes. Under the **Coursework** category, there is a subcategory called **Disciplinary Content**, which includes:\n\n- MA (Applied Linguistics)\n- MA (Humanities Education)\n- MSc (Exercise & Sport Studies)\n- MSc (Life Sciences)\n- MSc (Mathematics for Educators)\n- MSc (Science of Learning)\n\nAdditionally, **image1** lists the duration and mode of study for various programmes.

{"q_id": 1997, "model": "qwen3-14b", "in_tok": 2254, "out_tok": 425, "total_tok": 2679, "response": "The conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) is a critical metric that reflects how effectively marketing and sales teams align in moving leads through the funnel. This rate can vary significantly across different datasets, and understanding these variations is essential for diagnosing inefficiencies or opportunities in lead management.\n\nFrom the provided data, one dataset indicates that the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate is **1.50%** [4], while another dataset reports a much higher range of **45-75%** for SALs as a stage in the sales funnel [5]. These differences are substantial and suggest varying definitions, processes, or methodologies across organizations.\n\nThe 1.50% conversion rate [4] might reflect a scenario where marketing hands off leads to sales without sufficient qualification or alignment between the two teams. This could result in sales teams rejecting or not prioritizing many MQLs, leading to low acceptance rates. On the other hand, the 45-75% range [5] suggests a more effective handoff, where MQLs are well-qualified and sales teams are more likely to accept them as SALs. This could be due to better lead scoring, clearer qualification criteria, or stronger collaboration between marketing and sales.\n\nThese discrepancies highlight the importance of defining clear criteria for what constitutes an MQL and an SAL. If marketing is generating high-quality leads that meet sales' expectations, the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate will be higher. Conversely, if there is misalignment or poor lead quality, the conversion rate may drop significantly.\n\n![Sales funnel conversion rates](image5)  \nThis image illustrates cross-industry average conversion rates at various stages of the sales funnel, including the MQL-to-SAL stage, which ranges from 45-75%.  \n\nIn conclusion, the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate varies widely across datasets, with implications for how well marketing and sales teams collaborate and how effectively leads are qualified. A low rate may indicate a need for improved lead scoring, better communication, or refined qualification processes."}

These problems can often be resolved by following troubleshooting tips or adjusting usage practices.\n\nFor instance, if dishes are not drying properly, it could be due to selecting the wrong program or using cutlery with a low-quality coating [10]. Similarly, spilled rinse-aid can lead to stains on the interior of the dishwasher, and this issue can be resolved by wiping up spills immediately [image2]. Additionally, white film on the inside surface may be caused by hard water minerals, which can be cleaned using a damp sponge and dishwasher detergent [image2].\n\nOther common problems include the dishwasher not starting, which might be due to a blown fuse, tripped circuit breaker, or incorrect loading [image3]. Water not being pumped out could result from a twisted drain hose, clogged filter, or kitchen sink blockage [image3]. Suds in the tub are typically caused by using the wrong detergent, and the solution is to use only special dishwasher detergent [image3].\n\nIn some cases, the dishes may not be clean because of insufficient detergent, blocked spray arms, or dirty filters [image5]. Cloudiness on glassware might be due to excessive detergent in soft water, while white spots could be caused by hard water limescale [image5]. Black or grey marks on dishes may result from aluminum utensils rubbing against them, and this can be addressed with a mild abrasive cleaner [image5].\n\nBy addressing these issues through proper maintenance, correct usage, and following the provided troubleshooting guidelines, many common dishwasher problems can be resolved without the need for professional assistance.\n\n![Dishwasher not starting](image3)  \n![Dishes not drying](image1)  \n![Spilled rinse-aid and stained interior](image2)  \n![Dishes not clean and cloudiness on glassware](image5)\n\nThe dishwasher may encounter **multiple possible problems** before calling for service."}
