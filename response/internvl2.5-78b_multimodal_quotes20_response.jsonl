This is followed by the economy at 15% and immigration at 15%. These priorities reflect the issues that were central to Trump's campaign and resonate with his voter base. The focus on health care, economy, and immigration suggests that Trump voters are looking for immediate action on these issues, which they likely see as critical to their well-being and the nation's prosperity.\n\nIn contrast, Clinton voters have a different set of priorities. Only 12% of Clinton voters suggest health care as the top priority, which is significantly lower than the 29% of Trump voters. Instead, Clinton voters are more divided in their priorities, with 12% suggesting unifying the country, 11% wanting Trump to change his personal behavior and address divisions, and 9% focusing on the economy. This suggests that Clinton voters are more concerned with the broader implications of Trump's presidency, such as national unity and the tone of political discourse, rather than specific policy issues.\n\nThe differing priorities between Trump and Clinton voters also reflect their views on Trump's leadership. Trump voters, who are more focused on specific policy issues, likely have a more positive view of Trump's leadership capabilities in these areas. They are confident that he will address these issues effectively, as indicated by the 87% of Trump voters who have a good idea of where Trump wants to lead the country.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton voters, who are more concerned with the overall direction and tone of Trump's presidency, have a less positive view of his leadership. Only 14% of Clinton voters have a good idea of where Trump wants to lead the country, suggesting a lack of clarity and confidence in his vision and leadership style.\n\nIn summary, the differing priorities for Trump's presidency between Trump and Clinton voters reflect their contrasting views on his leadership. Trump voters are more focused on specific policy issues and have a more positive view of his leadership capabilities in these areas, while Clinton voters are more concerned with the broader implications of his presidency and have a less positive view of his leadership."}

This enthusiasm can lead to strong backing for Trump's policies and actions, potentially influencing legislative and executive decisions.\n- **Clinton Voters' Disappointment**: In contrast, only 10% of Clinton voters are happy, with 87% being unhappy. This high level of disappointment can lead to opposition and resistance to Trump's policies, potentially creating a more polarized political environment.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe expectations of race relations and partisan relations after the 2016 election show significant differences between Trump and Clinton voters. Trump supporters are more optimistic about both race and partisan relations, while Clinton supporters are predominantly pessimistic. The high level of enthusiasm among Trump voters and the disappointment among Clinton voters suggest a polarized political climate, with potential implications for the effectiveness and acceptance of Trump's presidency.\n\n![Voters' Expectations of Race Relations](image4)\n![Voters' Expectations of Partisan Relations](image4)\n![Trump Voters' Happiness](image6)\n![Clinton Voters' Happiness]("}

In contrast, Democrats are more likely to believe that relying too much on force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism, with 66% expressing this opinion [4].

In Germany, nearly six-in-ten adults on the right see military force as necessary, while about a third on the left agree [1].\n\n![American and German views on military force necessity](image1)\n\nWhen it comes to defense spending, Americans and Germans also have differing opinions. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019. There has also been a more modest decline in this view among Democrats [4]. In Germany, the public is divided on whether to increase or maintain current levels of spending on national defense, with about four-in-ten taking each view. This division has changed since 2017, with a shift towards maintaining current spending levels [9].\n\n![American and German views on defense spending](image5)\n\nFurthermore, Americans and Germans differ in their views on the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany. While about half of Germans see U.S. military bases as important for their country’s national security, 45% disagree. In contrast, 85% of Americans believe these bases are important to the U.S.’s security interests, and nearly six-in-ten see them as very important [5].\n\n![American and German views on the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany](image2)\n\nAdditionally, there are differences in the views of Americans and Germans on whether their country should defend NATO allies against Russia. Six-in-ten Americans say their country should defend a NATO ally in the event of a potential Russian attack, while an equal share of Germans say their country should not [11].\n\n![American and German views on defending NATO allies against Russia](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, American and German opinions on military intervention and defense spending are markedly different, with Americans generally more supportive of military force and defense spending, while Germans are more divided and less supportive."}

While both Republicans and Democrats agree that the UK is their most important partner, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are keener on Israel as a partner (26%) than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (9%). Democrats also place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico for their top foreign policy affiliate. However, views of Germany are similar among partisans in the U.S., with both sides ranking Germany fifth on the list of most or second-most important foreign policy partners.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- ![Political affiliations in the U.S. regarding foreign policy partners](image1) shows that 41% of Republicans/Lean Republican consider the UK as their most important foreign policy partner, followed by Israel at 26%.

According to the data, 67% of liberal Democrats believe the U.S. can learn a great deal from other nations, compared with only 25% of conservative Republicans [5]. This indicates a strong belief among liberal Democrats in the value of international learning, while conservative Republicans are much less likely to hold this view.\n\nSecondly, the belief that the U.S. can learn from other countries about COVID-19 is more widespread among Americans with higher levels of education than among those with lower education levels [7].

This trend is consistent with the general population, where tablets and e-book readers are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans [ 12 ].\n\nTo understand how this compares to the adoption trends of technology among different age groups over time, we can look at the data presented in the images. Image1 shows the adoption rates of tablets and e-book readers among different age groups from 2006 to 2013. The data indicates that the adoption rates for both devices have been increasing over time for all age groups, with the highest adoption rates among the 18-29 age group. However, the adoption rates among seniors (65+) are significantly lower than those of younger age groups.\n\nIn conclusion, education level plays a significant role in the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, with college graduates being more likely to own these devices. This trend is consistent with the general population, where higher education and income levels are associated with higher adoption rates of technology. However, the adoption rates among seniors are still significantly lower than those of younger age groups, indicating that there is still a significant gap in technology adoption between different age groups."}

Workers with higher levels of education tend to view technology more positively, seeing it as a tool that enhances their work and provides opportunities for career advancement. For instance, 64% of college graduates believe technology has made their work more interesting, compared to 38% of those with high school diplomas or less [1]. Similarly, 53% of college graduates feel that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, while only 32% of less-educated workers share this view [2].\n\nThe data also shows that college graduates are more likely to see technology as making their work less demanding (31% vs. 20%) [2]. This suggests that higher education may equip individuals with the skills to effectively utilize technology, thereby reducing the perceived demands of their jobs.\n\nWhen it comes to specific technologies, the differences in perception are even more pronounced. For example, 90% of college graduates view word processing or spreadsheet software positively, compared to 45% of those with high school diplomas or less [3]. This trend holds true for other technologies such as smartphones, email or social media, and software that manages daily schedules or routines [3].\n\nThe expectations for driverless car technology in the future are also influenced by educational attainment. According to the survey, 94% of Americans are aware of the effort to develop driverless vehicles, and roughly two-thirds anticipate that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century [8]. This widespread awareness and anticipation suggest a high level of interest and readiness for this technology.\n\nIn conclusion, educational attainment plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of workforce technologies. Higher education is associated with more positive views of technology, seeing it as a tool that enhances work and provides career opportunities. The expectations for driverless car technology are high, with a significant portion of the population anticipating its widespread adoption in the coming decades."}

According to the data, those who have heard a lot about the concept of machines taking many human jobs are more enthusiastic about the idea, with 48% expressing some level of enthusiasm [image1]. However, even among those with high levels of awareness, there is substantial concern, with 76% expressing worry about the future of jobs [image1]. This indicates that while awareness can lead to a more realistic view and some level of enthusiasm, it does not alleviate the overall worry about job displacement.\n\nWhen examining the levels of enthusiasm and worry in more detail, we see that 47% of those who have heard a lot about automation are enthusiastic, while 76% are worried [image1]. This suggests a significant disparity between enthusiasm and worry, with worry being more prevalent. Among those who have heard a little about automation, 30% are enthusiastic, and 72% are worried, and among those who have not heard anything, 18% are enthusiastic, and 69% are worried [image1]. This shows that as awareness increases, so does both enthusiasm and worry, but worry consistently outweighs enthusiasm.\n\nIn terms of expected outcomes, Americans generally expect more negative than positive outcomes from a world in which machines can do many of the jobs currently done by humans. For instance, 76% expect that widespread automation will lead to much greater levels of economic inequality than exist today [4]. Additionally, 64% expect that people will have a hard time finding things to do with their lives [image6]. These expectations highlight a significant concern about the social and economic impacts of automation.\n\nOn the positive side, 43% of Americans expect the economy to become much more efficient [image6], and 42% believe that people can focus less on work and more on what really matters to them [image6]. However, only 25% of Americans expect that the economy will create many new, well-paying jobs for humans in the event that workforce automation capabilities become much more advanced than they are today [12]. This indicates a pessimistic outlook on job creation in the face of automation.\n\nIn summary, Americans' levels of awareness about automation lead to both increased enthusiasm and worry, with worry being more prevalent. They generally expect more negative outcomes, such as increased economic inequality and difficulty finding purpose, but also see some potential positive outcomes like increased efficiency and a shift in focus from work to personal fulfillment. However, there is a notable lack of optimism regarding the creation of new, well-paying jobs."}

According to the text, 82% of Democrats believe this is a major reason for the outbreak's continuation, compared to only 21% of Republicans [1]. This partisan gap is also reflected in the image data, where 82% of Democrats and 21% of Republicans see an inadequate federal response as a major reason [![{Majority of Democrats see inadequate federal response as a major reason}](image2)].\n- **State and Local Governments**: There is a notable difference in perceptions regarding state and local governments' responses. While 64% of Democrats believe state and local governments are primarily responsible, only 35% of Republicans share this view [![{Majority of Democrats hold state and local governments responsible}](image6)].\n\n### Social Distancing\n- **Majority Agreement**: Both Democrats and Republicans agree that insufficient social distancing is a major reason for the outbreak's continuation. However, the percentage of Democrats (89%) who hold this view is higher than that of Republicans (57%) [![{Majority of both Democrats and Republicans agree on insufficient social distancing}](image2)].\n- **Public Health and Social Distancing**: The image data further supports this, showing that 75% of the total population considers insufficient social distancing a major reason [![{Majority of the total population considers insufficient social distancing a major reason}](image7)].\n\n### Conclusion\nPolitical affiliations significantly shape perceptions of the COVID-19 outbreak's continuation. Democrats are more likely to criticize the federal government's response and hold state and local governments responsible, while Republicans are more divided on these issues. However, there is a broad consensus across both parties on the importance of social distancing in controlling the spread of the virus."}

According to text quote [4], a clear majority of Hispanic registered voters (73%) say they would not like to see Trump remain a national political figure, including nearly all Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners (94%). This sentiment is echoed in image quote 6, which shows that 94% of Hispanic Democrats believe Trump should not remain a national political figure, while only 35% of Hispanic Republicans share this view. Furthermore, image quote 6 also indicates that 41% of Hispanic Republicans think Trump should run for president in 2024, compared to just 1% of Hispanic Democrats.\n\nSecondly, the perception of racial discrimination among Hispanic Democrats and Republicans also varies significantly. Text quote [5] mentions that since George Floyd’s killing in May 2020, the nation has gone through a sharp and deep discussion about race and equality, police funding, and racial discrimination. Image quote 5 provides a detailed breakdown of these perceptions. It shows that 73% of Hispanic Democrats believe people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem, while only 36% of Hispanic Republicans agree. Conversely, 62% of Hispanic Republicans think it is a bigger problem that people see racial discrimination where it really does not exist, compared to just 25% of Hispanic Democrats.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic Democrats overwhelmingly oppose Trump's continued political role and are more likely to perceive racial discrimination as a significant issue. In contrast, Hispanic Republicans are more divided on Trump's future, with a significant portion supporting his candidacy, and they are more likely to believe that racial discrimination is overperceived. These differences highlight the deep partisan divides within the Hispanic community on these critical issues."}

According to the data, men in STEM jobs place a higher value on job characteristics such as higher pay, opportunities for promotion, and the prestige associated with the job. This is evident from the fact that 59% of men in STEM jobs consider higher pay an important factor in choosing a job, compared to 48% of women [9]. Similarly, 57% of men value opportunities for promotion, while only 46% of women do so [7].\n\nOn the other hand, women in STEM jobs are more likely to value job characteristics that align with societal expectations of women's roles, such as helping others and making a meaningful contribution to society. For instance, 59% of women in STEM jobs consider a job that helps others as important, compared to only 31% of men [4]. Additionally, 60% of women value making a meaningful contribution to society, while only 51% of men do so [7].\n\nThese differences in job values are closely related to the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce. Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience discrimination and to consider discrimination a major reason that more women are not working in STEM [1, 3]. This discrimination can manifest in various forms, including pay gaps, unequal treatment from coworkers, and a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age [5, 7]. The emphasis on job characteristics that align with societal expectations of women's roles may be a coping mechanism for women in STEM to navigate these challenges and find meaning and fulfillment in their work.\n\nFurthermore, the data suggests that women in STEM jobs are more likely to value job flexibility and work-life balance, which can be a significant factor in their career choices and advancement opportunities. For example, 71% of women in STEM jobs consider having flexibility to balance work and family needs as important, compared to 53% of men [11]. This may be due to the fact that women are often expected to take on more caregiving responsibilities, both at home and in the workplace, which can make it more difficult for them to advance in their careers.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM reflect broader societal attitudes towards gender roles and expectations. These differences are closely related to the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce, including discrimination, pay gaps, and a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age.

Asians (including both men and women) are also overrepresented among STEM workers compared with their share in the total workforce, particularly among STEM workers with a postgraduate degree.\n- [5] STEM middle-skills workers are distinct from middle-skills workers in other occupations because they are more likely to have additional educational training that is directly related to their job. STEM workers are more likely than non-STEM workers to have completed any vocational or technical training, a certificate, or apprenticeship. Among those with some college experience or an associate degree, about seven-in-ten STEM workers (69%) say they have completed this kind of training, compared with about half of non-STEM workers (49%).\n- [6] STEM workers tend to have relatively high levels of education compared with other workers. Overall, they are about twice as likely as those in non-STEM occupations to have earned at least a bachelor’s degree (65% vs. 32%). Roughly three-in-ten STEM workers (29%) have earned a master’s, doctorate or professional degree, far exceeding the share of non-STEM workers with advanced degrees (12%). Some 36% of STEM workers have a bachelor’s degree (but no postgraduate degree) compared with 21% of non-STEM workers. Among STEM workers, life scientists are the most highly educated on average; 54% of these workers have an advanced degree.\n- [7] Most STEM workers work for a private, for-profit employer.

According to the data, 65% of STEM workers have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, which is double the percentage of non-STEM workers (32%) [5]. Furthermore, 29% of STEM workers have an advanced degree (master’s, doctorate, or professional degree), compared to only 12% of non-STEM workers [5]. This indicates a strong correlation between STEM occupations and higher levels of education.\n\nIn terms of employment sectors, the majority of STEM workers are employed in the private, for-profit sector, with 66% working in this category, which is the same percentage as all employed adults [4]. However, there are variations within STEM fields. For instance, 82% of engineers and architects work in the private sector, while only 58% of healthcare practitioners and technicians do so [4]. This suggests that while the private sector is dominant, there are notable differences across STEM fields.\n\nOver time, the percentage of STEM workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher has been increasing. In 1990, 43% of STEM workers had a bachelor’s degree, and by 2016, this figure had risen to 47% [3]. Similarly, the percentage of STEM workers with a master’s degree or higher has also increased, from 37% in 1990 to 47% in 2016 [3]. This trend indicates a growing emphasis on higher education within STEM fields.\n\nIn contrast, the percentage of STEM workers with only a high school diploma or less has been decreasing. In 1990, 52% of STEM workers had a high school diploma or less, but by 2016, this figure had dropped to 43% [3]. This decline suggests that higher educational attainment is becoming more prevalent and possibly more necessary for STEM occupations.\n\nIn summary, STEM workers generally have higher educational attainment compared to non-STEM workers, with a significant increase in the percentage of STEM workers holding advanced degrees over time. The private sector remains the primary employer for STEM workers, although there are variations across different STEM fields."}

These factors include mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, lack of Spanish language proficiency, and a sense of being American rather than Hispanic. \n\nFor adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic, 81% say they have never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino [1]. The reasons for this are many and are often linked to mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and few Hispanic cultural links. For example, some 27% said they do not consider themselves Hispanic because they have a mixed Hispanic and non-Hispanic background or that their Hispanic ancestry is too distant. Another 16% said they do not consider themselves Hispanic despite their Hispanic ancestry because of their upbringing or that they have little contact with their Hispanic relatives; 15% said the reason they say they are not Hispanic is because they do not speak Spanish or have no link to Hispanic culture; 12% said they do not look Hispanic or they identify as another race; and 9% said they were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American.\n\nThe importance of having a Spanish last name to Hispanic identity is also a factor, but it is not as significant as other factors. The vast majority (84%) of self-identified Hispanics say it is not important to have a Spanish last name to be considered Hispanic [2].\n\nThe contemporary experiences linked to the Hispanic background of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry vary across generations in much the way their childhood and cultural experiences do [5]. For example, some 36% of immigrant Hispanics consider themselves a typical American. That share rises to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and to 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics, reflecting their birth country (the U.S.) and their lifetime experiences [3].\n\nThese trends may have implications for the shape of Hispanic identity today. With so many U.S.-born Hispanics of Hispanic and non-Hispanic heritages, their views and experiences with Hispanic culture and identity vary depending on how close they are to their family’s immigrant experiences [6].\n\nThe views on what makes someone Hispanic also vary across generations. For example, 58% of immigrant Latinos hold the view that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, while 84% of second-generation Latinos and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos (the group farthest from their family’s immigrant roots) say the same [7].\n\nIn terms of self-identification, the share that self-identifies as Hispanic falls to 77% by the third generation and to just half of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry by the fourth or higher generation [10].\n\nLower immigration levels than in the past and continued high intermarriage rates may combine to produce a growing number of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestors"}

In contrast, 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry say they are seen as white [3].\n\nFurthermore, the composition of social networks also varies by generation. Image1 shows that 77% of immigrant Latinos say all or most of their friends are Latinos, but this share drops to 55% among second-generation self-identified Latinos and only 37% among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos [11].\n\nIn conclusion, generational differences significantly impact the perception of discrimination and racial identification among Hispanics. Immigrant Hispanics are more likely to experience discrimination and identify strongly with their Hispanic heritage, while later generations are less likely to experience discrimination and more likely to identify as white."}

According to the data, the majority of self-identified Hispanics prefer to describe themselves by their country of origin or heritage, with 50% choosing this option [![Self-identified Hispanics prefer country of origin/heritage](image1)]. This preference is most pronounced among immigrants, with 57% often identifying this way [![Immigrants often identify by country of origin/heritage](image2)]. However, as we move to the second generation, this percentage drops to 50%, and among the third or higher generation, it further decreases to 33% [![Second generation often identify by country of origin/heritage](image2)]. This trend indicates a shift towards a more American identity as generational distance from immigrant roots increases.\n\nIn terms of language use, the data reveals a clear decline in Spanish proficiency and usage across generations. Among self-identified Hispanics, 71% do not consider speaking Spanish a requirement for Latino identity [![Most Hispanics do not consider speaking Spanish a requirement for Latino identity](image4)]. This sentiment is most prevalent among the third or higher generation, with 92% not speaking Spanish [![Third or higher generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish](image4)]. The second generation shows a moderate proficiency, with 84% not speaking Spanish, while immigrants have the highest proficiency, with 58% speaking Spanish [![Second generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish](image4)].\n\nFurthermore, the frequency of speaking Spanish also varies by generation. Among self-identified Hispanics, 51% often speak Spanish, but this percentage drops to 33% among the third or higher generation [![Self-identified Hispanics often speak Spanish](image6)]. This decline in Spanish language use is mirrored in the frequency of using Spanish at home, with 65% of immigrants often using Spanish, compared to 36% of the second generation and only 26% of the third or higher generation [![Immigrants often use Spanish at home](image8)].\n\nIn conclusion, generational differences have a profound impact on the self-identification preferences and language use among Hispanics. As generational distance from immigrant roots increases, there is a noticeable shift towards a more American identity and a decline in Spanish language proficiency and usage."}

In 2012, 72% agreed, which dropped to 54% in 2014. Conversely, the percentage of people who disagree a lot/somewhat increased from 24% in 2012 to 34% in 2014.\n\n### Views by Country\n\n**Text Evidence:**\n- [3] states, \"A growing number of Arab youth are embracing modern values while family, friends, and religion continue to shape their opinions and influence their lives.\"\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- **Image 1** provides a detailed breakdown of the percentage of people who agree with embracing modern values by country in 2014. The percentages range from 40% in Oman to 60% in Libya, indicating significant variation across different countries.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Evolution Over Time:**\n   - There has been a noticeable shift in the general population's views on modern values. The data from **Image 2** indicates a decline in the acceptance of modern values over the years, with a significant drop from 2012 to 2014. This suggests a growing resistance or skepticism towards modern values.\n\n2. **Country-Specific Views:**\n   - The data from **Image 1** highlights that the acceptance of modern values varies widely by country. For instance, Libya shows a higher acceptance rate (60%) compared to Oman (40%). This variation could be attributed to cultural, social, and economic differences between countries.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe views on traditional values versus modern values have shown a decline in the acceptance of modern values over the years, as evidenced by the data from 2012 to 2014. Additionally, there is significant variation in these views across different countries, with some countries showing higher acceptance rates for modern values than others. This suggests that while there is a general trend towards skepticism of modern values, the extent of this trend varies by country, influenced by local cultural and social contexts."}

Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **User Utterance Encoding**:\n   - The user's input is first processed by a **Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder**. This encoder converts the user's natural language input into a continuous vector representation. The bidirectional nature of the LSTM allows it to capture context from both directions of the input sequence. [2]\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**:\n   - The encoded user utterance is then fed into the **LSTM Dialogue State** component. This component maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state, which includes information about the user's goals and the context of the conversation. The dialogue state is updated after each turn by incorporating the user's utterance and the system's previous action. [10]\n\n3. **Policy Network**:\n   - The policy network takes the dialogue state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results as inputs. It then emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act. This action is conditioned on the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the encoding of the query results. [5]\n\n4. **Query to Knowledge Base**:\n   - Based on the dialogue state and the emitted system action, a query is formulated and sent to the **Knowledge Base (KB)**. The KB returns relevant information, which is then encoded. [7]\n\n5. **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**:\n   - The final system response is generated using a **template-based NLG**. The delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced by values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action. This results in a natural language response that is coherent and contextually appropriate. [6]\n\n6. **System Response**:\n   - The generated response is then presented to the user, completing the dialogue turn. The system is designed to be interactive, allowing it to adapt and improve its responses over time through continuous learning and updates. [1]\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, tracking the dialogue state, formulating and querying the knowledge base, and finally generating a natural language response using a template-based approach. This process ensures that the system's responses are contextually relevant and aligned with the user's goals."}

Let's break down the comparison using the provided text and image quotes.\n\n### Categories\nThe SnapNTell dataset encompasses a wide array of categories, which are crucial for diverse and comprehensive entity recognition. According to [5], the dataset includes 22 categories, such as landmark, painting, sculpture, food, fruit, vegetable, mammal, amphibian, insect, fish, bird, reptile, celebrity, instrument, plant, electronics, tool, transportation, sport, book, household, and car. This extensive categorization ensures a broad coverage of real-world entities.\n\n![22 categories in SnapNTell](image5)\n\nIn comparison, other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA have fewer categories. As shown in ![Dataset comparison](image7), ViQuAE has 3 categories, and Encyclopedic VQA has 12 categories. This highlights the superior diversity in SnapNTell.\n\n### Entities\nThe number of unique entities in a dataset is a critical measure of its richness and complexity. SnapNTell boasts 7,568 unique entities, as indicated in [10] and ![Dataset comparison](image7). This is significantly higher than other datasets, such as ViQuAE with 2,400 entities and Encyclopedic VQA with an unspecified number.\n\n![7,568 unique entities in SnapNTell](image7)\n\n### Knowledge\nThe depth of knowledge required to answer questions in the SnapNTell dataset is another distinguishing feature. The dataset is designed to include knowledge-intensive responses, as mentioned in [1] and [6]. This means that the answers are not just simple binary responses but require a deep understanding of the entities depicted in the images.\n\n![Knowledge-intensive responses in SnapNTell](image1)\n\nIn contrast, other datasets often fall short in this aspect. For instance, WebQA, as discussed in [7], lacks fine-grained entities in many QA pairs, resulting in more general questions and answers. The SnapNTell dataset, on the other hand, demands detailed, entity-specific knowledge.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the SnapNTell dataset stands out in the VQA landscape due to its extensive categorization, a large number of unique entities, and the requirement for knowledge-intensive responses.

This is further supported by the data in image4, which shows the proportion of different error types across 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop scenarios:\n\n- **Syntax Error**: 0% for all hops.\n- **Semantic Error**: 29% for 2-hop, 38% for 3-hop, and 77% for 4-hop.\n- **Token Error**: 8% for 2-hop, 20% for 3-hop, and 18% for 4-hop.\n- **Structure Error**: 19% for 2-hop, 13% for 3-hop, and 57% for 4-hop.\n- **Incorrect Execution**: 71% for 2-hop, 62% for 3-hop, and 23% for 4-hop.\n\n### Model Performance Analysis\n\nThe image quotes provide detailed performance metrics for different models across the HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets.\n\n- **Image1** shows the performance of various models on HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets.

The key challenges can be categorized into grounding errors, ambiguity errors, calculation errors, and program errors.\n\n### Grounding Errors\nGrounding errors occur when the model incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table. This is a significant challenge for both InstructGPT and GPT-4, as evidenced by the confusion matrices and error analysis.\n\n- **InstructGPT**: The confusion matrix for InstructGPT shows that it frequently classifies supported and refuted claims as 'NEI'. This indicates that InstructGPT struggles with accurately grounding the claims to the table data.\n- **GPT-4**: GPT-4, on the other hand, exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This suggests that GPT-4 has difficulty in distinguishing whether a claim is verifiable, leading to grounding errors.\n\n### Ambiguity Errors\nAmbiguity errors arise when the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the model fails to represent accurately.\n\n- **InstructGPT**: InstructGPT faces challenges with ambiguous claims, as it tends to generate content that might not always be grounded in the provided data. This results in a higher proportion of ambiguity errors.\n- **GPT-4**: GPT-4 also struggles with ambiguous claims, but the error analysis indicates that it has a slightly better handling of ambiguity compared to InstructGPT.\n\n### Calculation Errors\nCalculation errors occur due to incorrect floating-point arithmetic calculations in Python, leading to inaccurate results.\n\n- **InstructGPT**: InstructGPT has a notable proportion of calculation errors, as it relies on parsing reasoning steps as Python programs and executing them.\n- **GPT-4**: GPT-4 also faces calculation errors, but the error analysis suggests that it has a more robust handling of numerical reasoning tasks, resulting in fewer calculation errors compared to InstructGPT.\n\n### Program Errors\nProgram errors encompass mistakes such as incorrect or missing arguments/variables, and erroneous operations.\n\n- **InstructGPT**: InstructGPT has a higher proportion of program errors, as it generates Python programs to derive answers, which can lead to various programming mistakes.\n- **GPT-4**: GPT-4 has fewer program errors, indicating that it has a more refined approach to program generation and execution.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, both InstructGPT and GPT-4 face significant challenges in accurately classifying NEI claims in the zero-shot 3-class classification task. The main challenges include grounding errors, ambiguity errors, calculation errors, and program errors. However, GPT-4 generally performs better than InstructGPT, particularly in"}

The reduction in recall is nearly linear as retrieval accuracy decreases. This suggests that the model's ability to filter out incorrect knowledge helps maintain precision to some extent, but recall suffers more when knowledge is missing.\n\n2. **Text [9]**: The removal of required knowledge has a minimal impact on correctness but significantly affects citation precision and recall. As more knowledge is absent from the provided knowledge graph, both precision and recall drop drastically. This highlights the challenge of generating high-quality citations when knowledge coverage is incomplete.\n\n3. **Text [10]**: The recall remains stable at about 15 regardless of the number of absent knowledge elements. This indicates that the current LLMs have a limited ability to identify absent knowledge. However, precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, showing that with more absent knowledge, the model can locate absent knowledge more accurately.\n\n### Analysis of Image Quotes\n\n1. **Image 2**: This table shows the impact of removing knowledge elements on correctness, precision, recall, and F1-Score. As the number of removed knowledge elements increases, precision, recall, and F1-Score all decrease. This demonstrates the negative impact of missing knowledge on the model's performance.\n\n2. **Image 7**: This graph illustrates the retrieval analysis, showing how precision, recall, and F1-Score change as retrieval accuracy decreases. The graph indicates that precision and recall both decrease as retrieval accuracy drops, with recall being more affected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe removal of knowledge elements significantly affects precision, recall, and F1-Score. Precision is less affected compared to recall, indicating that the model can filter out incorrect knowledge to some extent. However, recall suffers more, especially as more knowledge is absent. This implies that the models have a limited ability to handle absent knowledge, and their performance in generating high-quality citations is heavily dependent on the completeness of the provided knowledge graph.\n\nIn the context of 'Conscious Incompetence,' the models show some ability to identify absent knowledge, as indicated by the upward trend in precision and F1-Score with more absent knowledge. However, the stability of recall suggests that the models still struggle to effectively handle situations where knowledge is missing.\n\nOverall, the changes in precision, recall, and F1-Score imply that while the models have some mechanisms to deal with absent knowledge, there is still significant room for improvement in their ability to generate accurate and thorough citations under conditions of incomplete knowledge coverage."}

The process involves several key steps, as outlined in the provided text and images.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Cropping**: The system begins by cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates. This step is crucial because object detection datasets often contain multiple objects of varying sizes. Cropping helps to focus on the objects of interest.\n   - **Resizing**: The cropped regions are then resized to a fixed proportion. This standardization ensures that the objects are presented in a consistent format for further processing.\n   - **Blurring**: To help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This strategy directs the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, facilitating their identification in object detection tasks.\n\n2. **Retrieving and Ranking**:\n   - **Retrieving**: The system uses a multimodal retriever to query a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. The retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques.\n   - **Ranking**: After retrieving the top-k similar results from the memory, the MLLMs rank these results. The ranking is based on the internal knowledge of the MLLMs and the retrieved information, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n3. **Integration with MLLMs**:\n   - The retrieved category labels alongside image embedding \\( e \\) are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs combine the internal knowledge and the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category.\n\n### Visual Representation:\n\n- **Image 5**: This image provides a visual representation of the ranking prompt example. It shows how the system retrieves and ranks different categories of cars, demonstrating the process of sorting and ranking the retrieved results.\n\n- **Image 6**: This image illustrates the overall architecture of the multimodal retriever system. It shows the flow from encoding images, retrieving top-k categories, and ranking them using MLLMs.\n\n- **Image 7**: This image demonstrates the pre-processing steps, including cropping and blurring, and how these steps are integrated into the embedding and retrieval process.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by employing a combination of cropping, resizing, and blurring techniques to focus on the objects of interest. The system then retrieves and ranks the objects using a multimodal retriever and MLLMs, integrating internal knowledge and retrieved information to make accurate predictions.

The joint accuracy is a metric that evaluates the performance of the models in predicting the correct values for all domain-slot-value triplets in a dialog turn.\n\n- **DS-DST**: This model uses a dual strategy to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots.\n- **DS-Picklist**: This model assumes a full ontology is available and treats all domain-slot pairs as categorical slots.\n\nFrom the text [6], it is mentioned that DS-Picklist shows higher joint accuracy than DS-DST. However, in real scenarios, it may be nontrivial to have access to the full ontology.\n\n### Slot Accuracy Comparison\nTo compare the slot accuracy, we can refer to Table 4 in the text [12] and the image [image2].\n\n- **DS-Span**: This model uses span-based methods to extract values from the dialog context.\n- **DS-DST**: This model uses a dual strategy to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots.\n- **DS-Picklist**: This model treats all domain-slot pairs as categorical slots.\n\nFrom the table, we can observe the slot-level accuracy for each model. The slots are categorized into categorical and non-categorical slots for DS-DST. The slots above the first dashed line are categorical slots, and the slots below the first dashed line are non-categorical slots for DS-DST.\n\nFor categorical slots, DS-Picklist generally shows higher accuracy than DS-DST and DS-Span. For non-categorical slots, DS-DST shows higher accuracy than DS-Span, but the performance of DS-Picklist is not provided for non-categorical slots.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn terms of joint accuracy, DS-Picklist outperforms DS-DST.

The choice between DS-DST and DS-Picklist depends on the availability of the full ontology and the specific requirements of the task.\n\n### Image Analysis\nThe images provided do not directly contribute to the comparison of joint accuracy and slot accuracy.

According to the text [9], the DS-DST model achieves a joint accuracy of 51.21% on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set, while the DS-Picklist model achieves a joint accuracy of 53.30%. This indicates that the DS-Picklist model performs better overall compared to the DS-DST model.\n\nNext, let's examine the performance of the two models on specific slots. The text [7] provides a table (Table 4) that shows the slot-level accuracy on the test set of MultiWOZ 2.1. The table indicates that the DS-Picklist model outperforms the DS-DST model for some slots, including hotel-type, attraction-type, attraction-name, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking. This is because their values usually have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which decreases the performance of the span-based methods. In contrast, their values can be predicted directly from the candidate-value lists.\n\nTo further support this analysis, we can refer to the image [2], which shows the slot-level accuracy for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist models. The table indicates that the DS-Picklist model outperforms the DS-DST model for several slots, including hotel-type, attraction-type, attraction-name, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking. This is consistent with the findings reported in the text [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the DS-Picklist model performs better overall compared to the DS-DST model on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. The DS-Picklist model also outperforms the DS-DST model for specific slots, including hotel-type, attraction-type, attraction-name, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking. This is because the DS-Picklist model can predict the slot values directly from the candidate-value lists, which is more effective for slots with different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context."}

According to [3], the model performs significantly better on the LANI dataset when given access to oracle goals. However, it fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for the CHAI dataset, highlighting the complexity of the task. This suggests that the CHAI dataset presents a more challenging environment for the model.\n\nNext, let's examine the performance of different methods on both datasets. Table 3 [image3] shows the performance of various methods on the LANI and CHAI datasets. The 'Our Approach' method outperforms the other methods on both datasets, with a stop distance (SD) of 8.43 on LANI and 3.34 on CHAI. However, the manipulation accuracy (MA) on CHAI is still relatively low at 39.97, indicating that the model struggles with manipulation tasks in the CHAI environment.\n\nFurthermore, the text [4] mentions that the inherent ambiguities in instruction following make exact goal identification difficult, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance. This suggests that the complexity of the tasks in both datasets contributes to the challenges faced by the model.\n\nIn conclusion, the key differences in task completion and performance metrics between the LANI and CHAI datasets are that the CHAI dataset presents a more complex environment for the model, with a greater emphasis on manipulation tasks. The 'Our Approach' method outperforms the other methods on both datasets, but the model still struggles with manipulation tasks in the CHAI environment. The inherent ambiguities in instruction following also contribute to the challenges faced by the model in both datasets."}

On the other hand, on the CHAI system, CHAPLOT 18 and MISRA 17 both fail to learn, while the approach shows an improvement on stop distance (SD). However, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially on manipulation (MA).\n\nThe image data also provides some insights. The table in image3 shows the performance of different methods on the LANI and CHAI systems. The 'Our Approach' method has the lowest stop distance (SD) and the highest task completion (TC) on the LANI system, indicating better performance. On the CHAI system, the 'Our Approach' method also has the lowest stop distance (SD), but the manipulation accuracy (MA) is not as high as the 'STOP' method.\n\nIn terms of linguistic categories, the table in image2 provides some information. The LANI system has a higher count of spatial relations between locations, temporal coordination of sub-goals, and constraints on the shape of trajectory compared to the CHAI system.

The figure shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Alignment of Word Embeddings:**\n  - Aligning word embeddings is beneficial in multilingual training scenarios, as it allows the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between the source and target languages.\n  - In bilingual scenarios, a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary, as the gains or losses are essentially insignificant.\n\n- **F-measure Scores Based on Frequency:**\n  - Pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, with a more significant improvement for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n- **Table 5: Effect of Pre-training on Multilingual Translation into English**\n  ![Effect of Pre-training on Multilingual Translation into English](image12)\n\n- **Figure 2: F-measure Scores for Target Words Based on Frequency in the Training Corpus**\n  ![F-measure Scores for Target Words Based on Frequency in the Training Corpus](image6)\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings has a positive impact on translation performance in multilingual scenarios, while in bilingual scenarios, the benefits are less pronounced. Pre-training significantly improves the translation accuracy for low-frequency words in the training corpus."}

The key components in question are the R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types such as MATCH and COREF. We will examine how the removal of these components affects the model's performance under both unmasked and masked conditions.\n\n### R-GCN Component\n\nThe R-GCN (Relational Graph Convolutional Network) is a crucial component in the model, as it helps in updating mention representations based on their relations to other mentions. The impact of removing the R-GCN component can be observed in the following table:\n\n| Model                      | Unmasked | Masked |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------|\n| GloVe with R-GCN       | 59.2     | 11.1   |\n| GloVe w/o R-GCN       | 51.2     | 11.6   |\n\nFrom the table, it is evident that removing the R-GCN component results in a significant drop in performance, especially in the unmasked condition. The performance drops from 59.2% to 51.2%, indicating that the R-GCN component is essential for the model's effectiveness.\n\n### Relation Types\n\nThe study also investigates the impact of removing relation types. The results are summarized in the following table:\n\n| Model                      | Unmasked | Masked |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------|\n| No R-GCN                | 62.4     | 63.2   |\n| No relation types       | 62.7     | 63.9   |\n| No DOC-BASED            | 62.9     | 65.8   |\n| No MATCH                  | 64.3     | 67.4   |\n| No COREF                 | 64.8     | -        |\n| No COMPLEMENT            | 64.1     | 70.3   |\n| Induced edges             | 61.5     | 56.4   |\n\nRemoving relation types leads to a slight decrease in performance, with the unmasked condition showing a drop from 68.5% to 62.7%, and the masked condition showing a drop from 71.6% to 63.9%. This indicates that relation types play a role in enhancing the model's performance.\n\n### Specific Relation Types\n\nThe study further examines the impact of removing specific relation types, such as MATCH and COREF. The results are summarized in the following table:\n\n| Model                      | Unmasked | Masked |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------|\n| No MATCH                  | 64.3     | 67.4   |\n| No COREF                 | 64.8     | -        |\n\nRemoving the MATCH relation"}

For instance, Google Translate shows the highest accuracy in French (63.6%) and the lowest in Italian (39.6%) [4].\n   - Amazon Translate performs best in Spanish (59.4%) and worst in Italian (42.4%) [4].\n   - Microsoft Translator has the highest accuracy in German (74.1%) and the lowest in Italian (39.8%) [4].\n\n2. **Gender Bias**:\n   - Gender bias is evident across all tested systems and languages. The difference in performance (ΔG) between masculine and feminine scores is substantial. For example, in Spanish, Google Translate has a ΔG of 23.4, while Amazon Translate has a ΔG of 15.4 [4].\n   - The difference in performance (ΔS) between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments also varies. In Spanish, Google Translate has a ΔS of 21.3, while Amazon Translate has a ΔS of 22.3 [4].\n\n3. **Impact of Adding Adjectives**:\n   - Adding stereotypical gender adjectives (e.g., \"handsome\" for male and \"pretty\" for female) improves performance in some languages. For instance, in Spanish, the accuracy improved from 53.1% to 63.5% [5].\n   - This improvement is also seen in Russian (from 37.7% to 48.9%) and Ukrainian (from 38.4% to 42.9%) [5].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe translation accuracy and gender bias vary across different machine translation systems and languages. Google Translate, Amazon Translate, and Microsoft Translator all exhibit significant gender biases, with the highest accuracy observed in French for Google Translate and in German for Microsoft Translator. Adding stereotypical gender adjectives can improve translation accuracy in some languages, indicating a potential method to mitigate gender bias in machine translation.\n\n![Translation accuracy and gender bias comparison across different machine translation systems and languages](image4)"}
{"q_id": 441, "model": "OpenGVLab/InternVL2_5-78B", "in_tok": 0, "out_tok": 0, "total_tok": 0, "response": "To understand the impact of stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation on gender bias accuracy across different languages, we need to analyze the data provided in the text and images.\n\nFirst, let's look at the evidence from the text. Text [2] mentions that there is a significant difference in performance between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender role assignments. This indicates that machine translation systems tend to perform better when translating stereotypical gender roles.\n\nNext, let's examine the data from the images. Image 4 shows a bar graph comparing the accuracy of stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations across different languages. The graph clearly shows that the accuracy of stereotypical translations is consistently higher than that of non-stereotypical translations for all the languages tested.\n\nFurthermore, Image 7 provides a table showing the accuracy of translations with and without the addition of adjectives. The table indicates that adding adjectives, which are often associated with stereotypes, can significantly improve the accuracy of translations.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence from both the text and images suggests that stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can have a positive impact on gender bias accuracy across different languages. However, it is important to note that relying solely on stereotypes can also perpetuate gender biases and may not always result in accurate translations. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between using stereotypes to improve accuracy and avoiding the perpetuation of gender biases."}

This indicates an increasing trend in the provisions for income taxes over the three years.\n\nThe image shows the components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

The table shows that the net revenue for the total division increased from $64,661 in 2018 to $70,372 in 2020. This represents a growth of approximately 8.8%. \n\nNext, let's look at the operating profit changes. The table shows that the operating profit for the total division increased from $10,110 in 2018 to $10,080 in 2020. This represents a growth of approximately 0.7%. \n\nNow, let's discuss how these changes might be related to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. The table shows that the percentage of net revenue generated from the beverage business increased from 45% in 2018 to 55% in 2020, while the percentage of net revenue generated from the food/snack business decreased from 55% in 2018 to 45% in 2020.

Specifically, the total assets were $675,250 million in 2020 and $743,089 million in 2021, which is a decrease of $67,839 million or 10%. This decrease is primarily due to the sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) and Corporate Trust Services business, as mentioned in text [5] and [7].\n\n### Changes in WFAM Assets Under Management\nFrom image8, we can see the changes in WFAM assets under management:\n- **December 31, 2020**: Total WFAM assets under management were $508.8 billion.\n- **December 31, 2021**: Total WFAM assets under management were $603.0 billion before the sale, but after the sale on November 1, 2021, the balance became $0.\n\nThe sale of WFAM significantly impacted the total assets of Wells Fargo, as WFAM was a substantial part of the assets under management.\n\n### Impact on Financial Strategy\n1. **Capital Management and Risk Management**:\n   - The sale of WFAM and Corporate Trust Services allowed Wells Fargo to reposition its overall portfolio for capital management purposes, as mentioned in text [8]. This strategic move likely aimed to optimize the company's capital structure and improve its risk profile.\n   - The decrease in total assets by 10% indicates a strategic shift towards a leaner balance sheet, which can improve the company's financial stability and reduce risk exposure.\n\n2. **Focus on Core Business**:\n   - By divesting non-core assets like WFAM, Wells Fargo can focus more on its core banking and financial services. This realignment can enhance operational efficiency and potentially improve profitability.\n\n3. **Asset Allocation**:\n   - The decrease in total assets suggests that Wells Fargo might be reallocating resources to more profitable or less risky areas. This could involve increasing investments in higher-yielding assets or reducing exposure to lower-yielding or higher-risk assets.\n\n4. **Regulatory Compliance**:\n   - The changes in total assets and the sale of WFAM could also be part of Wells Fargo's strategy to comply with regulatory requirements and improve its regulatory capital ratios.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in total assets and WFAM assets under management from 2020 to 2021 reflect a strategic decision by Wells Fargo to streamline its operations, optimize its capital structure, and focus"}

The table shows the following values:\n\n- Adobe Systems: $100.00 in 2010, $316.30 in 2015\n- S&P 500 Index: $100.00 in 2010, $189.62 in 2015\n- S&P 500 Software & Services Index: $100.00 in 2010, $219.06 in 2015\n\nFrom this data, we can see that Adobe Systems had a cumulative total return of 216.30% from 2010 to 2015, while the S&P 500 Index had a return of 89.62% and the S&P 500 Software & Services Index had a return of 119.06%.\n\nTherefore, Adobe Systems' five-year cumulative total return was significantly higher than both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Software & Services Index from 2010 to 2015."}

Firstly, the significant decrease in interest and other investment income, which dropped from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, as shown in image7. This decrease is primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as mentioned in text quote [12]. The image6 shows a decrease in the carrying value of fixed maturity securities from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, reflecting the lower interest income.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in income taxes and noncontrolling interests from $910 million in 2020 to $842 million in 2021, as seen in image7, also contributed to the decline in net investment income. The effective income tax rate decreased from 15.3% in 2020 to 14.9% in 2021, but the overall tax expense still increased, impacting the net investment income.\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes by showing a shift towards equity securities, which increased from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, as depicted in image6. This shift indicates a move towards potentially higher-yielding investments to compensate for the lower interest income from fixed maturity securities. However, the overall decrease in net investment income suggests that the returns from these equity investments were not sufficient to offset the decline in interest income."}

Specifically, higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal were partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG. This resulted in a net positive impact of $16,965 million on Underlying EBITDA for FY2021.\n\n- **Price-Linked Costs:**\n  - The increased royalties due to higher realized prices for iron ore and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs led to a negative impact of $870 million on Underlying EBITDA for FY2021.\n\n- **Operating Cash Costs:**\n  - Higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and Nickel West, combined with the ramp-up of South Flank, contributed to an increase in operating cash costs. However, this was largely offset by strong cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across assets, lower technology costs, and gains from renegotiation of canceled power contracts at Escondida and Spence. The net impact of these changes was a positive contribution of $109 million to Underlying EBITDA for FY2021.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe changes in sales prices and operating cash costs had a significant impact on BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021. The positive impact from higher sales prices was partially offset by increased price-linked costs, while the overall increase in operating cash costs was mitigated by strong cost performance and other positive factors. The net result was a substantial increase in Underlying EBITDA, reflecting the company's strong financial and operational performance during the year."}

The company's net cash provided by operating activities increased to $10.6 billion, compared to $9.6 billion in 2019. This increase primarily reflects lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. The net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with acquisitions, net capital spending, and purchases of short-term investments. The net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases, payments of long-term debt borrowings, and debt redemptions.\n\nIn terms of contractual commitments, PepsiCo had various obligations, including long-term debt obligations, operating leases, and other long-term liabilities. The company also had commitments for purchasing, marketing, and other long-term contractual commitments. The total contractual commitments for 2020 were $66,321 million, compared to $66,321 million in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, PepsiCo's net cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 billion, net cash used for investing activities was $8.5 billion, and net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion.

Additionally, the division's performance in Global Markets was strong, with revenue growth of 27% compared with 2019, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit. Rates also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds. The division's financial performance was also impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak, together with the resultant reduction in global interest rates. The fall in reported profit was due to an increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, and a reduction in reported revenue.

This could be due to increased market volatility and the acquisition of E*TRADE, which added more investment securities to the portfolio.\n   - Higher RWA means that the institution needs to hold more capital to cover potential losses, impacting the overall capital structure by requiring more capital to be set aside.\n\n2. **External TLAC as a Percentage of RWA Decrease**:\n   - The decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 suggests that the institution's total loss-absorbing capacity relative to its risk-weighted assets has decreased.\n   - This could indicate a relative decrease in the institution's ability to absorb losses, which might necessitate adjustments in the capital structure to maintain regulatory compliance and financial stability.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe increase in Credit Risk RWA and the decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 have likely led to a more cautious approach in the institution's capital structure.

This decrease is reflected in the lower yields on earning assets, particularly in the consumer and commercial segments.\n   - The organizational structure of Bank of America, as shown in image1, includes various segments such as Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets. The decrease in net interest income impacts all these segments, but the Consumer Banking segment is particularly affected due to its reliance on interest income from loans and deposits.\n\n2. **Increase in Net Interest Income (2018 to 2019):**\n   - The increase in net interest income from 2018 to 2019 was driven by higher interest rates and increased loan balances, as indicated in text quote [5].

The segment moved from a substantial loss in 2019 to a significant profit in 2021.\n   - The improvement in upstream earnings can be attributed to higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and higher sales volumes.\n\n2. **Downstream Operations**:\n   - The downstream segment also showed improvement, with earnings increasing from $47 million in 2020 to $2,914 million in 2021.\n   - The increase in downstream earnings was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes.\n\n3. **Overall Net Income**:\n   - The overall net income of Chevron showed a dramatic turnaround from a loss of $5,543 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,625 million in 2021.\n   - The significant improvement in both upstream and downstream segments contributed to the overall positive net income in 2021.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe trends in Chevron's upstream and downstream operations' financial performance from 2019 to 2021 indicate a strong recovery and improvement in profitability.

The text states that the interest rate risks associated with the valuations of these contracts are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021. However, historically, these risks were significant.\n\nTo understand the impact, we can refer to the table in image6, which shows the estimated fair value of equity index put option contract liabilities after hypothetical changes in prices. The table indicates that a 30% increase in prices would result in a fair value of $5, while a 30% decrease would result in a fair value of $1,088. This suggests that the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n\n### Differences in Non-U.S. Denominated Debt Effects on Net Earnings Between 2020 and 2021\n\nFrom the text [1], we know that the company holds investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own.

This could be due to various factors such as tighter lending standards, reduced demand for loans, or increased paydown rates by customers.\n- **Decrease in Net Interest Income**: The decrease in net interest income suggests that the company is earning less from its lending activities. This could be due to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, or increased interest expenses.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe decrease in both average Card Member loans and net interest income from 2019 to 2021 has likely had a negative impact on the company's financial performance. Lower loan balances and reduced net interest income can lead to decreased profitability and may require the company to focus on other revenue streams to maintain financial stability.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced a decline in both average Card Member loans and net interest income from 201"}

This compensation impacts shareholders' equity through the issuance of new shares or the recognition of expenses related to share-based awards.\n\nFrom the text:\n- [12] On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.\n\nFrom the image:\n- ![Share-based compensation expense](image2) shows that the share-based compensation expense for the year 2020 was $1,197,806.\n\nThis expense is recognized in the income statement and reduces net income, which in turn affects retained earnings, a component of shareholders' equity.\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities represents the cash generated or used by a company's primary business operations. This cash flow is crucial for understanding a company's liquidity and financial health.\n\nFrom the image:\n- ![Cash flows from operating activities](image4) shows that the net cash provided by operating activities for the year 2020 was $8,215,152.\n\nThis cash flow contributes to the company's overall cash position, which is essential for funding operations, paying dividends, and making investments.\n\n### Contribution to Shareholders' Equity and Cash Position\n1. **Share-Based Compensation:**\n   - The share-based compensation expense of $1,197,806 reduces net income, which decreases retained earnings, a component of shareholders' equity.\n   - The issuance of new shares as part of share-based compensation increases the number of outstanding shares, which can dilute existing shareholders' ownership percentage.\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n   - The net cash provided by operating activities of $8,215,152 increases the company's cash position, enhancing its liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations.\n   - This cash can be used for various purposes, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, or investing in growth opportunities.\n\nIn"}

This is evident from the decrease in the yield on earning assets from 2.34% in 2019 to 1.94% in 2020.\n\n2. **Higher Deposit and Loan Balances:**\n   - Despite the lower interest rates, there was a partial offset due to the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances. This is reflected in the increase in average balances of deposits and loans.\n\n3. **Reduction in Deposit and Funding Costs:**\n   - The deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual also contributed to the partial offset of the decrease in net interest income.\n\n4. **Increase in Net Interest Expense:**\n   - The increase in net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to higher costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities, as seen in the increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decrease in the net interest spread from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the significant decrease in net interest income, driven by lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances and a reduction in deposit and funding costs. Additionally, the increase in net interest expense contributed to the overall decrease in the net interest spread.\n\nIn summary, the net interest spread decreased from 2.34% in 2019 to 1.94% in 2020, mainly due to lower interest rates and an increase in net interest expense, despite some offsetting factors such as higher deposit and loan balances and reduced funding costs."}

However, the actual graph is not provided in the text quotes.\n\nNext, let's look at the image quote image8 which is a graph showing the stock performance of UnitedHealth Group, the S&P Health Care Index, the Dow Jones US Industrial Average Index, and the S&P 500 Index from December 2015 to December 2020.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that UnitedHealth Group's stock performance (represented by the solid line with square markers) has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 Index (represented by the dashed line with triangle markers) over the five-year period. The graph shows that UnitedHealth Group's stock price has increased from around $100 in December 2015 to over $300 in December 2020, while the S&P 500 Index has increased from around $100 to around $200 over the same period.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the text and image quotes, we can conclude that UnitedHealth Group's stock performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from December 2015 to December 2020."}

Therefore, the operating profit is affected by these charges.\n   - In 2020, the operating profit was $1,609 million.\n   - In 2019, the operating profit was $1,589 million.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Direct Impact of Restructuring Charges:**\n   - In 2020, the restructuring charges of $25 million reduced the operating profit by $25 million.\n   - In 2019, the restructuring charges of $(15) million increased the operating profit by $15 million.\n\n2. **Comparison of Operating Profit:**\n   - The operating profit in 2020 was $1,609 million, which is higher than the operating profit in 2019 of $1,589 million.\n   - The difference in operating profit between 2020 and 2019 is $1,609 million - $1,589 million = $20 million.\n\n3. **Net Impact:**\n   - The net impact of restructuring charges on the operating profit from 2019 to 2020 is the difference between the restructuring charges in 2020 and 2019.\n   - Net impact = $25 million (2020 charges) - $(15) million (2019 charges) = $40 million reduction in operating profit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe restructuring charges in 2020 had a significant impact on the financial statements compared to 2019. The restructuring charges of $25 million in 2020 reduced the operating profit by $25 million, whereas the restructuring charges of $(15) million in 2019 increased the operating profit by $15 million. Therefore, the net impact of restructuring charges on the operating profit from 2019 to 2020 was a $40 million reduction in operating profit.\n\nIn summary, the restructuring charges in 2020 negatively impacted the operating profit by $25 million, while in 2019"}

The text quote [12] mentions that the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19. This suggests that the pandemic had a significant impact on the company's operational cash flow.\n  \n- **Increase in Number of Systemwide Restaurants**: Despite the decrease in cash provided by operations, the number of systemwide restaurants increased from 38,695 in 2019 to 39,198 in 2020. This indicates that the company continued to expand its restaurant base, possibly through franchising or other business arrangements, even during challenging economic conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe decrease in cash provided by operations and the increase in the number of systemwide restaurants from 2019 to 2020 suggest that while the company faced operational challenges, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it still managed to expand its restaurant network. This could indicate a strategic focus on long-term growth and market presence, even in the face of short-term financial pressures.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced a decrease in operational cash flow but continued to grow its restaurant base, reflecting a balance between immediate financial challenges and long-term expansion strategies."}

To understand the trend, we can look at the data from previous years:\n\n- **2018**: $1,126 million\n- **2019**: $1,878 million\n- **2020**: $2,119 million\n\nThis shows a clear upward trend in total recognized compensation expenses over the three years. The expenses increased from 2018 to 2019 by $752 million (approximately 67%) and from 2019 to 2020 by $234 million (approximately 12.5%).\n\n### Distribution of Compensation Expenses in 2020\n\nTo understand how these expenses are distributed across different business segments in 2020, we can refer to image1:\n\n- **Institutional Securities**: $851 million\n- **Wealth Management**: $1,000 million\n- **Investment Management**: $268 million\n\nThe total recognized in compensation expense for 2020 is $2,119 million, which matches the sum of the individual segments:\n\n\\[ 851 + 1000 + 268 = 2119 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total recognized compensation expenses have shown a significant upward trend from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the expenses were distributed as follows:\n- Institutional Securities: $851 million\n- Wealth Management: $1,000 million\n- Investment Management: $268 million\n\nThis distribution indicates that the Wealth Management segment has the highest compensation expenses, followed by Institutional Securities and Investment Management."}

This could be due to expansion, new leases, or revaluation of existing leases. The increase in lease assets would be reflected in the balance sheet under long-term assets and would also impact the operating lease liabilities.\n\n**Inventories:**\n- The substantial increase in total inventories from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020 indicates a significant build-up in inventory levels. This could be due to increased production, higher demand, or strategic stockpiling. The increase in inventories would be reflected in the balance sheet under current assets and would impact the cost of sales and gross profit margins in the income statement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe company experienced notable growth in both lease assets and inventories from 2019 to 2020. The increase in lease assets suggests a higher commitment to leasing, which could impact future cash flows and operating expenses. The rise in inventories indicates a potential increase in production or sales, which could positively affect revenue but also requires careful management to avoid excess inventory and associated costs.\n\nIn summary, the changes in lease assets and inventories reflect the company's strategic decisions and operational activities,"}

This decrease was primarily due to lower loan balances, reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization, partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. The net interest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans of $518 million and interest income associated with loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools of $1.1 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income increased by $5,120 million, or 104%, compared to 2020. This increase was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income.\n\nThe total revenue increased by $3,138 million, or 59%, from 2020 to 2021. This increase was primarily due to the higher noninterest income, which more than offset the decrease in net interest income. The total revenue in 2021 was $8,495 million, compared to $5,357 million in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the decrease in net interest income was partially offset by the increase in noninterest income, resulting in an overall increase in total revenue from 2020 to 2021. The changes in net interest income and noninterest income had a significant impact on the total revenue, with the increase in noninterest income being the primary driver of the overall increase in total revenue."}

Therefore, an increase in the valuation allowance reduces the net deferred tax assets.\n  - The net deferred tax assets are calculated as total deferred tax assets minus the valuation allowance.\n  - From ![Valuation Allowance](image1), the total deferred tax assets for 2022 and 2021 are $2,013 and $1,891, respectively.\n  - The net deferred tax assets for 2022 are $2,013 - $313 = $1,700.\n  - The net deferred tax assets for 2021 are $1,891 - $214 = $1,677.\n  - Therefore, the net deferred tax assets decreased from $1,677 in 2021 to $1,700 in 2022 due to the increase in the valuation allowance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe valuation allowance increased by $99 from 2021 to 2022, which resulted in a decrease in the net deferred tax assets from $1,677 in 2021 to $1,700 in 2022."}

This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Operating Income**: There was a significant increase in operating income from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021. This increase in operating income directly contributed to the higher net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n2. **Depreciation and Amortization**: The depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from $13,100 million in 2020 to $13,804 million in 2021. This stability in non-cash expenses helped maintain the cash flow from operations.\n\n3. **Noncash Share-Based Compensation**: There was a slight increase in noncash share-based compensation from $1,193 million in 2020 to $1,315 million in 2021. This increase, although non-cash, reflects the company's investment in employee compensation, which indirectly supports operational activities.\n\n4. **Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities**: The changes in operating assets and liabilities had a negative impact in both years, but the decrease was less severe in 2021 ($1,499 million) compared to 2020 ($178 million). This suggests better management of working capital in 2021.\n\n5. **Payments of Interest**: The payments of interest decreased from $3,878 million in 2020 to $3,908 million in 2021, which positively impacted the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n6. **Payments of Income Taxes**: The payments of income taxes also decreased from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021, contributing to the higher net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n7. **Proceeds from Investments and Other**: The proceeds from investments and other increased from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021, providing additional cash inflow to the operating activities.\n\nIn summary, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by higher operating income, stable depreciation and amortization expenses, and reduced payments of interest and income taxes. Additionally, the proceeds from investments and other activities also contributed positively to the cash flow from operations."}

This represents an increase of $641 million.\n\n### Key Contributing Factors:\n1. **Adoption of CECL**: \n   - The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard in 2020 resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses. According to text [5], the adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans.\n   \n2. **Economic Impact of COVID-19**:\n   - The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment principally resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19. This is mentioned in text [2] and [11].\n\n3. **Provision for Credit Losses**:\n   - The provision for credit losses increased significantly in 2020. According to image5, the provision for credit losses in 2020 was $762 million, compared to $590 million in 2019.\n\n4. **Gross Charge-offs and Recoveries**:\n   - Gross charge-offs in 2020 were $105 million, and recoveries were $8 million, resulting in net charge-offs of $97 million. This is detailed in image5.\n\n5. **Sector-Specific Risks**:\n   - The provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19.

This is a major factor contributing to the increase in earnings per share.\n\nAdditionally, from the text [4], we see that the Group's equity increased by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020. This increase was mainly due to the net income of USD 24.0 billion, net actuarial gains of USD 1.8 billion, equity-based compensation of USD 0.7 billion, and the net favorable fair value adjustments on financial instruments of USD 0.2 billion. These factors also contributed to the overall increase in earnings per share.\n\nIn summary, the percentage increase in total basic earnings per share (USD) from 2020 to 2021 is approximately 201.7%, primarily driven by the significant gain from the divestment of the investment in Roche and the overall increase in the Group's equity due to various positive financial factors."}

It is a key component of shareholders' equity.\n\n- **2020 Retained Earnings:** $13,837 million\n- **2021 Retained Earnings:** $13,474 million\n\nThe retained earnings decreased by $363 million from 2020 to 2021. This decrease can be attributed to the net income and dividends paid during the year.\n\n### Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)\nOther comprehensive income includes revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are excluded from net income on an income statement. It is reported in the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n- **2020 OCI:** $(2,895) million\n- **2021 OCI:** $(2,945) million\n\nThe OCI also decreased by $50 million from 2020 to 2021. This decrease indicates a worsening in the components that make up OCI, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains/losses on debt securities.\n\n### Total Shareholders' Equity\nThe total shareholders' equity is the sum of all equity components, including common shares, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\n- **2020 Total Shareholders' Equity:** $191,367 million\n- **2021 Total Shareholders' Equity:** $188,548 million\n\nThe total shareholders' equity decreased by $2,819 million from 2020 to 2021. This decrease is primarily due to the reduction in retained earnings and the slight decrease in OCI.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021 indicate a weakening in the company's financial position. The decrease in retained earnings and OCI suggests that the company experienced lower net income and higher comprehensive losses, which negatively impacted the total shareholders' equity. This could be a concern for investors and stakeholders, as it reflects a reduction in the company's net worth and financial stability.\n\nIn summary, the company's financial position was negatively affected by the decrease in retained earnings and other comprehensive income, leading to a reduction in total shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021."}

Some 41% of both groups say this. The share that lives in largely Latino neighborhoods falls to 30% among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos.\n- **[11]**: Four-in-ten (39%) self-identified Hispanics say that “all” (10%) or “most” (30%) of their neighbors are Hispanics. By comparison, just 17% of self-identified non-Hispanics say the same, showing that non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are more dispersed across the country than their Hispanic counterparts.\n\n### Image Analysis\nThe images provide additional insights into the perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity across different generations.\n\n- **Image 4**: This image shows the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who say that \"all/most\" or \"some/only a few\" of their neighbors are Hispanic/Latino.\n  - **Foreign born**: 41% say \"all/most\" and 57% say \"some/only a few\".\n  - **Second generation**: 41% say \"all/most\" and 55% say \"some/only a few\".\n  - **Third or higher generation**: 30% say \"all/most\" and 64% say \"some/only a few\".\n\n- **Image 7**: This image provides another perspective on the same question.\n  - **Foreign born**: 77% say \"all/most\" and 22% say \"some/hardly any\".\n  - **Second generation**: 55% say \"all/most\" and 45% say \"some/hardly any\".\n  - **Third or higher generation**: 37% say \"all/most\" and 61% say \"some/hardly any\".\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the text and image analysis, we can conclude that perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity vary significantly across generations of self-identified Hispanics. The foreign-born and second-generation Hispanics are more likely to perceive their neighborhoods as predominantly Hispanic, with 41% and 55% respectively saying that \"all/most\" of their neighbors are Hispanic.

In image1, we see that 68% of postgraduates disapprove of Trump, compared to 62% of college graduates, 53% of those with some college experience, and 49% of those with a high school degree or less.

Some common funding sources include:\n\n1. **Renewed Bridge Tolls**: As mentioned in [2], bridge tolls can be a significant source of funding. These tolls are often renewed periodically to continue generating revenue for transportation projects.\n\n2. **High-Speed Rail State Cap and Trade Funds**: These funds are part of a broader environmental policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A portion of the revenue generated from these funds can be allocated to transportation projects.\n\n3. **Transportation Ballot Measures**: These measures allow local communities to vote on funding for specific transportation projects. They can include taxes or bonds that are specifically earmarked for transportation infrastructure.\n\n4. **Development Funds and Local Taxes**: As seen in [11], development funds and local taxes can also be used to finance transportation projects. These funds are often raised through local initiatives and can be crucial for smaller-scale projects.\n\n### Bridge Depiction and Funding Sources\n\nThe bridge depicted in ![Bridge](image3) is likely a significant infrastructure project that requires substantial funding. The bridge's construction and maintenance could be supported by the following funding sources:\n\n- **Bridge Tolls**: The bridge itself might generate revenue through tolls, which can be used to fund ongoing maintenance and future improvements.\n\n- **State and Federal Grants**: Large infrastructure projects like bridges often receive grants from state and federal governments. These grants can cover a significant portion of the project's costs.\n\n- **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)**: Sometimes, private companies partner with government entities to fund and manage infrastructure projects. This can be an effective way to leverage private investment for public benefit.\n\n- **Local Taxes and Bonds**: Local communities might approve taxes or issue bonds specifically to fund the bridge's construction and maintenance.\n\nIn summary, the bridge depicted in ![Bridge](image3) is likely funded through a combination of bridge tolls, state and federal grants, public-private partnerships, and local taxes and bonds. These diverse funding sources help ensure that such critical infrastructure projects can be completed and maintained over time."}

Among self-identified Hispanics, the connection to Hispanic heritage is strongest among the foreign-born, with 57% often identifying as Hispanic, compared to 33% among the third or higher generation [image1]. This trend is also reflected in the identification with country of origin or heritage, where 50% of self-identified Hispanics identify with their country of origin, while 23% identify as Hispanic/Latino, and another 23% identify as American [image2].\n\nThe data further shows that as generations progress, the identification with Hispanic heritage decreases. For instance, 38% of all self-identified Hispanics are foreign-born, but this percentage drops to 25% among the second generation and further to 23% among the third or higher generation [image3]. This decline is also evident in the percentage of those who speak Spanish, with 58% of foreign-born Hispanics speaking Spanish, compared to 84% of the second generation and 92% of the third or higher generation [image8].\n\nIn contrast, self-identified non-Hispanics show a much lower percentage of heritage identification. Only 15% of self-identified non-Hispanics identify as Hispanic, and this percentage is consistent across all generations [image6]. This suggests that the generational distance from immigrant roots has a significant impact on the strength of Hispanic heritage identification among self-identified Hispanics, while non-Hispanics maintain a consistent low level of identification with Hispanic heritage.\n\nIn summary, the generational breakdown reveals that the closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the stronger their identification with Hispanic heritage. As generations progress, this identification weakens, particularly among self-identified Hispanics. Non-Hispanics, on the other hand, show a consistently low level of identification with Hispanic heritage across all generations."}

This trend is consistent across various age groups, with younger adults (ages 18-29) being more critical than older adults (ages 65+) [image1].\n\nMoreover, the belief that the U.S. can learn from other countries about effective ways to combat the coronavirus is more widespread among Americans with higher levels of education [9]. For example, 58% of postgraduates think the U.S. can learn a great deal from other nations, compared to 47% of those with a high school degree or less [image3].\n\nIn summary, higher educational attainment is associated with more critical evaluations of the U.S. COVID-19 response and a greater belief in the potential for learning from other countries' approaches."}

The railroad transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state, attracting settlers with the promise of land and economic opportunities.\n   - The Homestead Act provided pioneers 160 acres of land if they constructed a permanent structure and resided on the land for five years. This act attracted nearly sixty-nine thousand people to Nebraska by 1900.\n\n2. **Agricultural Economy and Mechanization**\n   - Corn dominated the agricultural economy, but mechanization altered the scale of farming. This led to a decline in the number of farms and an increase in the average farm size.\n   - In 1900, there were over 2,000 individual farms in Hamilton County, but by 2002, the number had declined to 603, with the average farm size increasing from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002.\n\n3. **Ethnic Settlements**\n   - Early settlers came from various states and countries, settling in clusters across the county.

Calculate the difference:\n   - Difference = 45% - 29% = 16%\n\nTherefore, the percentage difference between the proportion of people who are very confident in Trump's ability to make wise decisions about immigration policy and those who are not confident at all is 16%."}

According to the Pew Research Center survey [1], a majority of U.S. adults (69%) are more concerned that state governments have been lifting restrictions on public activity too quickly [2]. This concern is reflected in the image showing that 69% of the total population believes that restrictions have been lifted too quickly, while only 30% think they have not been lifted quickly enough [image2].\n\nWhen it comes to the overall effectiveness of the U.S. response compared to other wealthy countries, about six-in-ten Americans (62%) say the U.S. response has been less effective, while just 13% say it has been more effective [4]. This is further illustrated in the pie chart [image6], where 62% of respondents believe the U.S. response has been less effective, 25% think it has been about as effective, and only 13% believe it has been more effective.\n\nThere is also a partisan divide in these opinions. Republicans and Democrats have divergent views, with 87% of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying the U.S. response has been less effective compared to other wealthy countries, while only 22% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree [7]. This partisan difference is also evident in the image showing that 80% of Democrats/Lean Dem believe there are more new infections, not just more tests, compared to 36% of Republicans/Lean Rep [image1].\n\nIn terms of specific reasons for the perceived ineffectiveness, the majority of Americans (75%) believe that not enough people are social distancing and mask-wearing [image3]. Additionally, 58% think that restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places, and 53% believe there has been an inadequate response from the federal government [image3].\n\nThe public's evaluation of various entities involved in the response is also telling. Hospitals and medical centers in the local area receive the highest ratings, with 88% of respondents rating them as good or excellent [image7]. In contrast, only 37% of respondents rate Donald Trump's response as good or excellent [image7].\n\nOverall, the public's opinion on the effectiveness of the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak is largely critical, with major concerns about the speed of lifting restrictions, the level of social distancing and mask-wearing, and the federal government's response. There is a clear partisan divide, with Democrats being more critical of the U.S. response compared to Republicans."}

This is an unprecedented low in Pew Research Center's surveys on this question.\n   - The decline in confidence is tied to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with the U.S. unemployment rate skyrocketing and the International Monetary Fund predicting a shrinkage in the U.S. GDP in 2020, while the Chinese economy is expected to achieve positive growth.\n\n2. **Perceptions by Age Group**:\n   - Text quote [4] indicates that Americans ages 50 and older are about 20 percentage points more likely than their younger counterparts to have no confidence at all in Chinese President Xi Jinping (62% vs. 40%).\n\n3. **Perceptions by Political Affiliation**:\n   - Text quote [4] also highlights a partisan divide in evaluations of Xi Jinping. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are now 10 points more likely than their Democratic counterparts to have no confidence at all in Xi.\n   - Image quote image1 shows a clear trend where the percentage of Republicans/Lean Republican who see the U.S. as the world's leading economy has increased from 17% in 2012 to 38% in 2020. In contrast, the percentage of Democrats/Lean Democratic has increased from 11% in 2012 to 19% in 2020, but at a slower rate.\n   - Image quote image3 further illustrates this partisan divide, showing that the percentage of Republicans/Lean Republican who see the U.S. as the leading economy has remained relatively stable around 50-60% from 2011 to 2020, while the percentage of Democrats/Lean Democratic has fluctuated more, starting at 32% in 2011 and dropping to 19% in 2020.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmericans' perceptions of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power have generally declined over time, influenced significantly by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. There is a notable partisan divide, with Republicans/Lean Republican consistently more likely than Democrats/Lean Democratic to view the U.S. as the leading economy. This divide has become more pronounced in recent years.\n\nIn summary, the perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power has decreased, with a significant partisan gap where Republicans are more confident in the"}

But older Americans – who tend to have less favorable attitudes toward China – give it the lowest marks; 69% of those ages 65 and older say the country has done a fair or poor job, compared with 59% of those under 30.\n   - [11] There is a large partisan divide on this question: Roughly six-in-ten Republicans believe China’s international clout will diminish as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, while just 40% of Democrats say the same. Age divides emerge on this question as well. American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis.\n\n2. **Image Evidence**:\n   - ![image8](image8) shows the percentage of people who believe China's global influence will increase, stay the same, or decrease after the coronavirus outbreak, broken down by age group.\n\n### Answer Construction:\n- **Analysis**:\n  - From [10], we know that older Americans (ages 65 and older) are more critical of China's performance and believe less in China's global influence increasing.\n  - From [11], we see that there is a significant age divide, with older Americans being more likely to believe China's influence will decrease.\n  - ![image8](image8) provides a clear breakdown of the beliefs by age group. The image shows that the 65+ age group has the lowest percentage of people who believe China's global influence will increase (10%).\n\n- **Conclusion**:\n  - The age group that believes the least that China's global influence will increase after the coronavirus outbreak is the 65+ age group.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe age group that believes the least that China's global influence will increase after the coronavirus outbreak is the 65+ age group."}

However, by the time of the survey, only 27% of Republicans held this view.\n- [4] Slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January (57%) and 33 points since July 2013 (38%).\n\n### Image Analysis\nFrom the image quotes:\n- ![image4](image4) shows the approval ratings for government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat over time for Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. The graph indicates a significant decline in approval ratings among Republicans from 2009 to 2015.\n- ![image5](image5) shows the percentage of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents who view various threats as major. The graph indicates that 93% of Republicans view ISIS as a major threat, which is the highest among all groups and threats.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the text and image analysis, it is evident that Republicans' views on government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat have become more critical over time. The approval ratings for government efforts have significantly declined, and a majority of Republicans now believe that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough. This shift in opinion is reflected in the increased concern about threats like ISIS, with 93% of Republicans viewing it as a major threat.\n\nIn summary, Republicans' views on government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat have become more negative, with a significant decline in approval ratings and an increased concern that anti-terrorism policies are not stringent enough."}

This suggests that Rock fans are more likely to stream older, established albums and songs rather than new releases. This could be due to the enduring popularity of classic Rock music and the loyal fan base that continues to engage with these timeless tracks.\n\n- **Pop Genre**:\n  - The lower catalog share of streams (40.6%) suggests that Pop music has a more dynamic market with a significant focus on current releases. Pop fans are more inclined to stream new music, indicating a faster turnover of popular tracks and a greater emphasis on staying current with the latest hits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe catalog share of streams is higher for Rock (approximately 57.4%) compared to Pop (approximately 40.6%). This indicates that Rock music relies more heavily on its established catalog, reflecting the genre's timeless appeal and loyal fan base. In contrast, Pop music has a more dynamic market with a greater focus on current releases, highlighting the genre's fast-paced nature and the importance of staying current with new"}

According to the table in image4, the training speed of the LSTM model is 5998 seconds, while the training speed of the SWEM model is 63 seconds.\n\nTo calculate how much faster SWEM is compared to LSTM, we can use the following formula:\n\nSpeedup = Training time of LSTM / Training time of SWEM\n\nSubstituting the values from the table, we get:\n\nSpeedup = 5998 seconds / 63 seconds ≈ 952.22\n\nTherefore, the SWEM model is approximately 952 times faster than the LSTM model in terms of training speed."}

However, further increasing the number of demonstrations (e.g., ≥10) results in limited improvements.\n- **[4]**: Adding logical constraints into LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations.\n- **[4]**: The performance of incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass that of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations.\n\n### Analysis of Image Quotes\n- **![image1](image1)**: This image shows the Micro-F1 performance and logical inconsistency for different numbers of demonstration samples (1, 5, 10, 20) in the MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets, both with and without logical constraints.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n1. **MAVEN-ERE Dataset**:\n   - **Without Logical Constraints (MAVEN-ERE w/o. Ic)**:\n     - As the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 20, the Micro-F1 performance improves significantly.\n     - The performance peaks at around 10 demonstration samples and then plateaus.\n   - **With Logical Constraints (MAVEN-ERE w.

The performance improves as the number of demonstration samples increases, peaking at around 10 samples. Adding logical constraints further enhances the performance, indicating that logical constraints play a crucial role in improving the Micro-F1 score.

Here's a detailed breakdown of these components:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Function**: The multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions.\n   - **Process**: As shown in ![Multimodal Retriever](image1), the retriever encodes images and text into embeddings, which are then indexed and stored in a memory bank. This memory bank is used to retrieve the top-k similar results based on the input image.\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - **Function**: This component retrieves the top-k categories most similar to the input image and ranks these retrieved candidate results as the final prediction results.\n   - **Process**: The retrieved embeddings are combined with the input image embedding, and the MLLMs rank these candidates based on similarity. The ranking prompt guides the MLLMs to make the final prediction of the image category.\n\n3. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Function**: For object detection datasets, the pipeline includes additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring to help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected.\n   - **Process**: As depicted in ![Pre-processing](image3), the image regions are cropped based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resized to a fixed proportion. Blurring is applied to non-target areas to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects.\n\n4. **Index System**:\n   - **Function**: To enhance the speed of retrieval, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented.\n   - **Process**: The HNSW methodology facilitates a significant dimensionality reduction, enabling the construction of a more condensed index. This reduction in dimensionality plays a pivotal role in enhancing the speed of the retrieval process.\n\n5. **Ranking Prompt**:\n   - **Function**: The ranking prompt serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory and guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity.\n   - **Process**: The prompt format is designed to help the MLLMs rank the retrieved results, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n6. **Integration with MLLMs**:\n   - **Function**: The RAR pipeline can be seamlessly integrated into various MLLMs in a plug-and-play manner.\n   - **Process**: The retrieved and ranked results are fed into the MLLMs, which combine the internal knowledge and the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category.\n\nIn"}

This strategy involves generating an initial output, which is then evaluated and refined using feedback from external models or tools.

These external sources can include trained models, code interpreters, search engines, and other tools that can assess the output from different perspectives.\n\n3. **Feedback Integration**: The feedback from the external sources is integrated into the refinement process. This feedback can highlight errors, inconsistencies, or areas where the output can be improved.\n\n4. **Output Refinement**: The language model uses the feedback to refine the initial output, making necessary adjustments to improve its quality and accuracy. This refinement process can involve correcting factual errors, enhancing the coherence and fluency of the output, and ensuring that the output aligns with the desired criteria.\n\n5. **Iterative Refinement**: The process of generating an output, collecting feedback, and refining the output can be repeated iteratively until the output meets the desired quality standards.\n\nBy leveraging external feedback, the 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy allows for a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the language model's outputs.

It starts by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are then considered at the next layer, and the top-k nodes are selected from this pool again based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated until the leaf nodes are reached. The text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. This method allows for a controlled retrieval process, where the depth (d) and the number of nodes (k) selected at each layer can be adjusted to control the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved. The algorithm starts with a broad outlook by considering the top layers of the tree and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers [8][9].\n\nOn the other hand, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method, also shown in ![Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image3), offers a simpler way to search for relevant information. Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. The steps for this method are outlined below: \n\n- All nodes in the tree are considered simultaneously.\n- The nodes are evaluated collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.\n- This approach allows for greater flexibility than tree traversal, as it searches through all the nodes simultaneously, retrieving information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question.\n\nThe comparison between these two methods is illustrated in ![Comparison of RAPTOR’s tree structure and DPR](image6), where RAPTOR selects nodes from different layers depending on the level of granularity required by the question, while Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) selects nodes from a single layer. This comparison highlights the advantage of RAPTOR’s tree structure in providing more relevant and comprehensive information for downstream tasks [12].\n\nIn summary, the Tree Traversal Retrieval method offers a controlled, layer-by-layer approach to retrieving information, while the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method provides a more flexible, simultaneous evaluation of all nodes in the tree. Both methods have their own advantages and trade-offs, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the retrieval task."}

These object queries are learned positional encodings that are added to the input of each attention layer in the decoder. The queries are transformed into an output embedding by the decoder, which are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network (FFN). This process allows the model to globally reason about all objects together using pair-wise relations between them, while being able to use the whole image as context. The object queries are crucial for the model to output the correct number of objects of each class, and they are shared across all layers in the decoder. The use of object queries in DETR simplifies the detection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components that encode prior knowledge, like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression. The model achieves comparable results to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO dataset, and it can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. Training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebook research/detr. ![The detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, with positional encodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Fig. 11](image11) The self-attention mechanisms of transformers, which explicitly model all pairwise interactions between elements in a sequence, make these architectures particularly suitable for specific constraints of set prediction such as removing duplicate predictions. The object queries in DETR are an essential part of this process, as they allow the model to reason about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The use of object queries in DETR is a key innovation that sets it apart from other object detection models, and it is a crucial component of the model's architecture.

Specifically, the setting \\( z=10 \\) (which should produce 100% questions) now only produces 79.67% questions.\n   - [10] also introduces an extra setting \\( z=10 \\) (boost), which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, yielding a 99.54% question-asking rate, at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\n2. **Image Evidence**:\n   - ![Question-asking rate with and without repetition control](image4) shows the percentage of utterances containing questions as the Question-Asking Control Level (CT) increases. The blue line represents the Question-controlled CT model, and the red dashed line represents the target for question-controlled CT. The purple line represents the Question-controlled CT with repetition control.\n\n### Answer Construction\n\n#### Analysis\n\n- **Without Repetition Control**:\n  - As shown in ![Question-asking rate with and without repetition control](image4), the blue line indicates that without repetition control, the percentage of utterances containing questions increases steadily as the Question-Asking Control Level (CT) increases. At \\( z=10 \\), the model achieves nearly 100% question-asking.\n\n- **With Repetition Control**:\n  - The purple line in ![Question-asking rate with and without repetition control](image4) shows that when repetition control is applied, the percentage of utterances containing questions is significantly lower. At \\( z=10 \\), the model only achieves around 79.67% question-asking, as mentioned in [10].\n\n- **Boost Setting**:\n  - The introduction of the boost setting (red dashed line in ![Question-asking rate with and without repetition control](image4)) allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, achieving a 99.54% question-asking rate. However, this comes at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe presence of repetition control negatively affects the frequency of question-asking in generated text. Without repetition control, the model can achieve a higher rate of question-asking. However, when repetition control is applied, the rate of question-asking decreases. The boost setting helps to mitigate this reduction, allowing the model to produce a higher rate of questions while still controlling for repetition.\n\nIn summary, repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking"}

Let's break down each retrieval process using the provided text and image quotes.\n\n### Iterative Retrieval Process\n**Text Quote [11]:**\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and NLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results. The process involves iteratively refining search queries based on the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive Retrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide the retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained retrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that systematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It can be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The recursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\n\n**Image Quote [image2]:**\n![Iterative Retrieval Process](image2)\nThe Iterative process involves a loop where the query is refined and the retrieval and generation steps are repeated multiple times.

According to [7], word-order information is crucial for sentiment analysis tasks. This is because the positional information of a word in a text sequence can significantly influence the sentiment conveyed. For instance, the phrases \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" have different levels of negative sentiment, despite having the same words but in different orders. LSTM models, which can capture this type of information via recurrent transition functions, perform better than SWEM models in sentiment analysis tasks. This is consistent with the findings of Pang et al. (2002), who hypothesized that positional information is beneficial for predicting sentiment.\n\nFurthermore, [9] suggests that word-order information does not contribute significantly to tasks like topic categorization and textual entailment. However, on the Yelp polarity dataset, the results drop noticeably when the word-order is shuffled, indicating that word-order does matter for sentiment analysis.\n\nNow, let's look at the image quotes. Image 4 presents a table comparing the performance of LSTM models on different datasets when the original word order is maintained versus when it is shuffled. The table shows that for the Yelp polarity dataset, the accuracy drops from 95.11% to 93.49% when the word order is shuffled. This further supports the idea that word-order information is important for sentiment analysis in LSTM models.\n\nIn conclusion, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models. LSTM models perform better in sentiment analysis tasks when they can capture word-order information, as demonstrated by the drop in accuracy when the word order is shuffled. This highlights the importance of considering word-order in sentiment analysis tasks."}

Let's break down the evidence step by step.\n\n### Original Dataset Performance\n\nFrom the original dataset, BERT's performance is highlighted in [1] and [11]. BERT achieves a peak performance of 77% on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline. This performance is summarized in ![Original Performance](image1), where BERT's median performance is 71.2%, and the maximum is 77%.\n\n### Adversarial Dataset Performance\n\nThe adversarial dataset is designed to eliminate spurious statistical cues that models might exploit. The results of BERT and other models on this dataset are shown in ![Adversarial Performance](image6). Here, BERT's performance drops significantly:\n\n- **Mean**: 50.4%\n- **Median**: 50.5%\n- **Max**: 53.3%\n\nThis indicates that BERT's performance is reduced to essentially random when the adversarial dataset is used.\n\n### Comparison with Other Models\n\nTo compare BERT's performance with other models, we can look at the results in ![Comparison with Other Models](image5). The table shows the performance of BERT, BoV, and BiLSTM on the original dataset:\n\n- **BERT**: Mean = 67.1%, Median = 71.2%, Max = 77%\n- **BoV**: Mean = 56.4%, Median = 56.9%, Max = 59.5%\n- **BiLSTM**: Mean = 55.2%, Median = 55.2%, Max = 59.2%\n\nOn the adversarial dataset, the performance of these models is summarized in ![Adversarial Performance](image6):\n\n- **BERT**: Mean = 50.4%, Median = 50.5%, Max = 53.3%\n- **BoV**: Mean = 50.1%, Median = 50.1%, Max = 50.2%\n- **BiLSTM**: Mean = 50.0%, Median = 50.0%, Max = 50.2%\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe adversarial transformation significantly reduces BERT's performance, bringing it down to random levels. This indicates that BERT's high performance on the original dataset was largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuinely understanding argument comprehension. The adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation, showing that BERT, like other models, performs randomly when these cues are eliminated.\n\nIn summary, the adversarial transformation reveals that BERT's performance is not robust and is heavily influenced by spurious cues.

The annotations indicate which entities are new and which are related based on their reachability from previously linked entities. For instance, in the example annotation provided in Table 1, the entity \"Super Mario Land\" is linked to its publication date \"1989\" through the relation \"Publication Date\". The annotations also highlight the distinction between new and related entities, such as \"side-scrolling game\" and \"platform video game\", which are incorrectly marked as new due to missing links in Wikidata. Additionally, the annotations include multiple plausible reasons for the mention of an entity, such as \"Game Boy\" being the platform for \"Super Mario Land\" and being manufactured by \"Nintendo\", although only the former is more relevant in this context. This representation allows the model to dynamically decide the facts to incorporate from the knowledge graph, guided by the discourse. The annotations are crucial for training the knowledge graph language model (KGLM) to generate factually correct sentences and to generalize to rare/unseen entities. The annotations also help in identifying the parent entity for a later entity in the document, based on the relations between the entities in the knowledge graph. The annotations are further expanded using string matching for entities, dates, and quantities, to cover all possible ways of expressing them. This ensures that the model can handle the different ways of expressing a numerical quantity, without performing unit conversions. The annotations are also used to construct plausible reasons for why an entity may have been mentioned, either as a new entity or as an entity related to an already mentioned entity. This helps in generating a coherent and contextually relevant text. The annotations are an essential part of the training process for the KGLM, as they provide the necessary information for the model to learn the relationships between entities and to generate factually correct sentences. The annotations are also used to evaluate the performance of the model, by comparing the generated text with the gold standard annotations. The annotations are a critical component of the KGLM, as they enable the model to incorporate factual knowledge into language models, which is a primary barrier to incorporating factual knowledge into language models. The annotations are also used to facilitate research on knowledge graph-based language modeling, by providing a benchmark for comparing the performance of different models. The annotations are a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on knowledge graph-based language modeling, as they provide a rich source of information for training and evaluating the performance of language models. The annotations are also used to identify the parent entity for a later entity in the document, based on the relations between the entities in the knowledge graph.

The dataset spans over seven domains, but only five domains (restaurant, hotel, attraction, taxi, train) are used in the experiment due to the limited number of dialogues in the other two domains (hospital, police). The slots in each domain and the corresponding data size are reported in Table 1.\n\n### Image Analysis\n- **Image 1** provides a detailed breakdown of the slots and the number of dialogues for each domain in the MultiWOZ dataset. The table shows the distribution of slots across different domains and the number of dialogues for training, validation, and testing sets.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe data in the MultiWOZ dataset is distributed across various slots in different domains. The distribution is not uniform, with some slots having more dialogues than others. For instance, the \"restaurant\" domain has a higher number of dialogues compared to the \"taxi\" domain. This uneven distribution can impact the performance of dialogue state tracking (DST) models, as they may struggle with slots that have fewer dialogues.\n\n![Data distribution across different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset](image1)"}

(6) for randomly masking long-term user representation in model training. It mentions that the results are summarized in Fig. 8.\n   - [7] explains that the performance of both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con improves when \\( p \\) increases from 0, but declines when \\( p \\) is too large.

In the depth aspect, the previous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, our benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge [6]. The MMMU benchmark underscores both the progress and the challenges in multimodal understanding and reasoning. While GPT-4V leads in performance, the overall results indicate substantial room for improvement, especially in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge [12]. The MMMU benchmark is meticulously curated to assess the expert-level multimodal understanding capability of foundation models across a broad scope of tasks. Covering 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, including Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, and over 183 subfields [9]. The detailed subject coverage and statistics are detailed in Figure 3 [9]. The questions in our benchmark were manually collected by a team of 50 college students (including coauthors) from various disciplines and subjects, drawing from online sources, textbooks, and lecture materials [9]. The MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges to multimodal foundation models, as detailed in Figure 1 [10]. Among these, we particularly highlight the challenge stemming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [10]. This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model’s adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason [10]. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, calling for an advanced approach that integrates advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge [10]. ![{MMMU benchmark covers 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, including Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, and over 183 subfields}](image1) ![{MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges to multimodal foundation models, as detailed in Figure 1}](image4) ![{MMMU benchmark questions and options}](image5) ![{MMMU benchmark questions and options}](image6) ![{MMMU benchmark questions and options}](image7) ![{MMMU benchmark questions and options}](image8) The MMMU benchmark is highly different from other benchmarks by collecting more"}

When the model encounters a token that needs to be associated with an entity, it uses the knowledge graph to determine the most appropriate entity to render. This process involves several steps:\n\n1. **Identifying the Entity Mentioned**: The model first identifies the entity mentioned in the text. For example, in the sentence \"Super Mario Land is a side-scrolling platform video game developed by Nintendo,\" the entity \"Super Mario Land\" is identified.\n\n2. **Selecting the Relation**: The model then selects the relation that connects the entity to the token it needs to generate. In the context of 'published by', the relation would be \"PUBLISHER.\"\n\n3. **Choosing the Entity to Render**: Based on the selected relation, the model picks the entity that is connected to the mentioned entity through that relation. In this case, the model would choose \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render because it is the publisher of \"Super Mario Land.\"\n\n4. **Generating the Token**: Finally, the model generates the token that represents the chosen entity. In this example, the token \"Nintendo\" is generated.\n\n### Knowledge Graph and Entity Rendering\nThe knowledge graph plays a crucial role in this process by providing the necessary information about the entities and their relations. The model uses this information to make informed decisions about which entity to render in a given context.\n\n### Example from the Text\nIn the text, the model is described as using a knowledge graph to guide the generation of text. The model selects the entity \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity and follows the \"PUBLISHER\" relation to select \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render. This process is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows how the model uses the entity \"Super Mario Land\" to render the first three tokens and then selects \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render in the context of 'published by.'\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the model decides which entity to render in the context of 'published by' by identifying the entity mentioned in the text, selecting the appropriate relation from the knowledge graph, choosing the entity connected to the mentioned entity through that relation, and generating the token that represents the chosen entity. The knowledge graph is essential in this process, providing the necessary information about the entities and their relations."}

Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **BERT Embeddings**: The model utilizes a pre-trained BERT model to encode the dialogue context and the domain-slot pairs. This encoding captures the contextual information of the dialogue and the specific slots that need to be filled.\n\n2. **Cosine Similarity Matching**: After obtaining the BERT embeddings for the dialogue context and the candidate values, the model calculates the cosine similarity between these embeddings. This similarity score measures how closely related the candidate values are to the dialogue context.\n\n3. **Slot Gate Mechanism**: For non-categorical slots, the model uses a two-way linear mapping to find text spans in the dialogue context that match the candidate values. For categorical slots, the model selects the most plausible values from the picklists based on the contextual representation.\n\n4. **Direct Interactions**: The DS-DST model enables direct interactions between the dialogue context and the domain-slot pairs. This interaction is crucial for accurately determining the matching between candidate values and the dialogue context.\n\n5. **Training and Fine-Tuning**: The model is fine-tuned using the BertAdam optimizer, with parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and maximum sequence length set to optimize performance. The model is trained on datasets like MultiWOZ 2.0 and 2.1, and the best checkpoint is selected based on joint accuracy on the validation set.\n\n6. **Evaluation and Comparison**: The effectiveness of the DS-DST model is evaluated by comparing its performance with other models, such as BERT-DST and DS-Picklist.

These embeddings are effective in representing the meaning of words and are useful for tasks that require understanding the context and semantics of words. However, they may not capture morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which can be important for certain tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER).\n\n### Character-Level Embeddings\nCharacter-level embeddings, on the other hand, capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. This is particularly useful for languages with rich morphology or for handling out-of-vocabulary words. Character-level embeddings can help the model understand the structure of words and provide additional context that word-level embeddings might miss.\n\n### Combining Both Embeddings\nBy combining both word-level and character-level embeddings, the model can leverage the strengths of both types of embeddings. This allows the model to capture both the semantic meaning of words and the subword information, leading to a more robust and accurate representation of words. This combined approach can improve the model's performance on tasks like NER, where understanding both the context and the structure of words is crucial.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs to capture a comprehensive representation of words, combining semantic meaning with subword information.

This step involves two primary techniques: cropping and blurring, which are specifically designed to focus the model's attention on the relevant objects and reduce distractions from the background.\n\n### Pre-processing Steps:\n\n1. **Cropping**:\n   - **Purpose**: The cropping technique is used to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the image. This is particularly important in object detection datasets where images often contain multiple objects of varying sizes.\n   - **Implementation**: As shown in the diagram, the image is divided into different bounding boxes (bboxes), each focusing on a specific object. For instance, bbox1 focuses on a flower arrangement, bbox2 on a saltshaker, and bbox3 on a vase.\n   - **Benefit**: By cropping the image to focus on individual objects, the model can concentrate on the features of the object without being influenced by other elements in the image. This helps in improving the accuracy of object recognition.\n\n2. **Blurring**:\n   - **Purpose**: The blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This technique helps in directing the model's focus towards the relevant objects.\n   - **Implementation**: In the diagram, the areas outside the bounding boxes are blurred, making the objects within the bounding boxes more prominent.\n   - **Benefit**: Blurring the background reduces the noise and irrelevant information, allowing the model to better understand and classify the objects of interest. This is especially useful in zero-shot recognition tasks where the model has to identify objects it has not seen during training.\n\n### Contribution to Zero-Shot Recognition:\n\n- **Enhanced Focus**: The combination of cropping and blurring ensures that the model's attention is directed towards the most relevant parts of the image. This focused attention is crucial for zero-shot recognition, where the model needs to generalize from seen categories to unseen ones.\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By reducing distractions and emphasizing the key features of the objects, the pre-processing steps help in improving the overall accuracy of the recognition system.\n- **Better Generalization**: The pre-processing techniques enable the model to generalize better to new, unseen categories. This is because the model learns to recognize objects based on their intrinsic features rather than being influenced by the surrounding context.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing step in the zero-shot recognition system, as depicted in the diagram, significantly contributes to the model's performance by enhancing its ability to focus on and accurately identify objects of interest. This is achieved through the strategic use of cropping and blurring techniques, which together help in reducing noise and improving the model's generalization capabilities."}

Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Standard Reports**:\n   - **What happened?**\n   - These are basic reports that provide historical data. They answer simple questions about what has occurred in the past.\n\n2. **Ad-Hoc Reports**:\n   - **How many, how often, where?**\n   - These reports allow for more flexible querying of data to answer specific questions that arise.\n\n3. **Query Drilldown (OLAP)**:\n   - **Where exactly is the problem?**\n   - This involves drilling down into data to pinpoint specific issues or trends.\n\n4. **Alerts**:\n   - **What actions are needed?**\n   - Alerts notify users of specific conditions or thresholds being met, prompting immediate action.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis**:\n   - **Why is this happening?**\n   - This level involves using statistical methods to understand the reasons behind observed trends or events.\n\n6. **Forecasting**:\n   - **What if these trends continue?**\n   - Forecasting uses historical data to predict future trends, helping businesses plan for the future.\n\n7. **Predictive Modelling**:\n   - **What will happen next?**\n   - Predictive models use statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes based on historical data.\n\n8. **Optimisation**:\n   - **What's the best that can happen?**\n   - Optimisation involves using advanced analytics to determine the best possible outcomes and strategies.\n\n### Analytics Value Chain\nThe analytics value chain describes the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights and, ultimately, business value. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Data Collection**:\n   - Data is gathered from various sources. This is the foundational step where raw data is accumulated.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**:\n   - The collected data is analysed to identify patterns, trends, and insights. This involves using various analytical techniques and tools.\n\n3. **Reporting**:\n   - Insights from the analysis are compiled into reports. These reports provide a summary of the findings and are often used for decision-making.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - Based on the insights from the reports, actions are taken. This could involve implementing new strategies, making operational changes, or addressing specific issues.\n\n5. **Impact**:\n   - The actions taken are monitored to assess their impact on the business. This step is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the decisions made.\n\n6. **Value**:\n   - The ultimate goal is to create business value. This is achieved when the actions taken based on the insights lead to tangible benefits such as increased revenue, improved efficiency, or enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\n### Inter"}

Each pair of homologous chromosomes, consisting of two sister chromatids, is positioned along the equatorial plane of the cell.\n\n2. **Spindle Attachment**: Microtubules from the spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. This ensures that each chromosome is properly aligned and ready for separation.\n\n3. **Crossing Over**: Although crossing over occurs during Prophase I, its effects are visible in Metaphase I. The genetic material has been exchanged between non-sister chromatids, leading to genetic variation.\n\n4. **Centromere Function**: The centromere holds the sister chromatids together, ensuring they move as a single unit during the next phase.\n\n5. **Preparation for Separation**: The cell prepares for the separation of homologous chromosomes, which will occur in Anaphase I. This separation is crucial for reducing the chromosome number by half, leading to haploid daughter cells.\n\nThese processes ensure that genetic material is accurately distributed to the resulting gametes, maintaining genetic diversity and proper chromosome number in offspring."}

However, the image does not provide direct overlap data. We can infer that the combined percentage would be less than the sum of individual percentages due to potential overlaps.\n\n3. **Estimate Overlap:**\n   - Since we don't have exact overlap data, we can use the Venn diagram concept to estimate. The combined percentage would be the sum of individual percentages minus the overlaps. However, without specific overlap data, we can only provide an upper bound.\n\n4. **Upper Bound Calculation:**\n   - Sum of individual percentages:\n     - Direct + Organic Search + Referral = 62.67% + 40.12% + 18.49% = 121.28%\n   - Since the total cannot exceed 100%, the upper bound for the combined percentage is 100%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percentage of total conversions involving the combination of Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels is less than or equal to 100%.

Let's explore these stages in detail:\n\n### Telophase\n- **Nuclear Envelope Reformation**: The nuclear envelope begins to re-form around each set of chromosomes. This is a crucial step as it re-establishes the nucleus in each daughter cell.\n- **Chromatin Decondensation**: The chromosomes start to decondense, returning to their less compact chromatin form. This allows for the resumption of normal cellular activities, such as transcription.\n- **Nucleolus Reformation**: The nucleolus, which is the site of ribosome synthesis, reappears within the newly formed nuclei.\n\n![Nuclear envelope forming](image2) - The nuclear envelope re-forms around the separated chromosomes.\n\n### Cytokinesis\n- **Cleavage Furrow Formation**: In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms at the cell's equator. This furrow is initiated by the contraction of a ring of microfilaments beneath the plasma membrane.\n- **Cell Plate Formation**: In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle of the cell. This plate grows outward and eventually fuses with the cell wall, dividing the cell into two.\n- **Separation of Cytoplasm**: The cytoplasm divides, and the cell splits into two daughter cells. This process ensures that each new cell receives an equal distribution of organelles and cytoplasm.\n\n![Cleavage furrow](image6) - The cleavage furrow forms and contracts, leading to the separation of the cell into two daughter cells.\n\n### Conclusion\nDuring telophase and cytokinesis, the cell undergoes significant structural changes to ensure the proper formation of two genetically identical daughter cells. The reformation of the nuclear envelope, decondensation of chromosomes, and the division of the cytoplasm are critical steps in this process."}

Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Parental Generation (P Generation)**\n- Mendel started with true-breeding plants, meaning they had homozygous genotypes. For example, he used plants with purple flowers (PP) and plants with white flowers (pp).\n- These plants were crossed to produce the F1 generation.\n\n### 2. **First Filial Generation (F1 Generation)**\n- The F1 generation resulted from the cross between the P generation plants. All F1 plants had a heterozygous genotype (Pp) and displayed the dominant phenotype (purple flowers).\n- This is because the dominant allele (P) masks the effect of the recessive allele (p).\n\n### 3. **Second Filial Generation (F2 Generation)**\n- The F1 plants were then allowed to self-pollinate, producing the F2 generation.\n- According to Mendel's law of segregation, each gamete receives one allele from each parent. Therefore, the possible gametes from the F1 plants are P and p.\n- When these gametes combine, the possible genotypes in the F2 generation are PP, Pp, and pp.\n\n### 4. **Phenotypic and Genotypic Ratios**\n- The phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1, with three plants having purple flowers (PP and Pp) and one plant having white flowers (pp).\n- The genotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with one plant having the genotype PP, two plants having the genotype Pp, and one plant having the genotype pp.\n\n### Visual Representation\n- ![Phenotypic and Genotypic Ratios](image1) shows the genetic makeup and the resulting ratios in the F2 generation.\n- ![Dominant and Recessive Traits](image2) illustrates the concept of dominant and recessive traits, where the dominant trait (purple flowers) masks the recessive trait (white flowers).\n- ![Crossing of P Generation](image4) visually represents the crossing of the P generation to produce the F1 generation, and the subsequent self-pollination to produce the F2 generation.\n\n### Conclusion\nMendelian inheritance explains the observed ratios through the principles of segregation and independent assortment. The dominant allele masks the recessive allele in the F1 generation, but in the F2 generation, the recessive trait reappears due to the combination of alleles during gamete formation.

This is a direct application of the proximity principle, where objects that are close to each other are perceived as part of a group.\n\n2. **Similarity**:\n   - The letters share similar characteristics, such as color and shape, which further enhances the perception of them as a cohesive unit. This similarity in design elements helps to reinforce the idea that they belong together.\n\n3. **Continuity**:\n   - The design of the word 'GESTALT' incorporates lines and shapes that guide the viewer's eye smoothly from one letter to the next. This continuity in the visual flow helps to create a sense of order and coherence, making the word appear as a continuous, uninterrupted form.\n\n4. **Closure**:\n   - Some of the letters in 'GESTALT' are designed with incomplete shapes, but the viewer's mind fills in the missing parts to perceive the complete form of each letter. This is an example of the closure principle, where the brain tends to complete incomplete shapes to form a whole.\n\n5. **Figure-Ground**:\n   - The contrast between the letters and the background helps to distinguish the word 'GESTALT' as the figure, while the surrounding space is perceived as the ground. This contrast is essential for making the word stand out and be easily recognizable.\n\nBy applying these Gestalt principles, the design of the word 'GESTALT' effectively communicates a sense of unity, coherence, and completeness, making it visually appealing and easy to perceive as a single, meaningful unit."}

This approach, often referred to as \"last click attribution,\" assigns the entire credit for a conversion to the last interaction a customer had with a brand, typically through a paid search or organic search click. However, this method can be misleading as it overlooks the influence of earlier touch points that may have played a significant role in the customer's journey towards conversion.

Diploid cells have two homologous sets of chromosomes.\n- [11] During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. The chromosome number is reduced by half.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- ![Meiosis I stages](image4) shows the stages of meiosis I, including the separation of homologous chromosomes.\n- ![Meiosis I summary](image5) provides a summary of meiosis I, highlighting the separation of homologous chromosomes.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then separate, moving to opposite poles of the cell. This results in a reduction of the chromosome number by half, from diploid to haploid.\n\n### Meiosis II\n\n**Text Evidence:**\n- [11] During meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. The chromosome number remains the same.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- ![Meiosis II stages](image2) illustrates the stages of meiosis II, including the separation of sister chromatids.\n- ![Meiosis II summary](image6) shows the final stages of meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- In meiosis II, sister chromatids, which are already haploid, separate and move to opposite poles.

To understand their contributions, it's essential to explore their definitions, functions, and how they interlink within the broader analytics framework.\n\n### Reporting\nReporting is the process of collecting, organizing, and presenting data in a structured format. It primarily focuses on descriptive analytics, which answers the question \"What happened?\" Reporting provides a historical view of data, often through dashboards, charts, and tables. This backward-looking approach helps organizations understand past performance and identify trends or patterns.\n\n- **Descriptive Analytics**: Reporting falls under descriptive analytics, which involves summarizing historical data to understand what has occurred. It provides insights into past events, helping organizations identify areas of success or failure.\n- **Function**: Reporting serves as the foundation for more advanced analytics. It ensures that data is accessible, organized, and presented in a way that is easy to understand. This accessibility is crucial for decision-makers who need to quickly grasp the state of the business.\n- **Tools**: Common tools for reporting include dashboards, reports, and alerts. These tools help in visualizing data and making it actionable.\n\n### Analysis\nAnalysis, on the other hand, delves deeper into the data to uncover insights, answer questions, and predict future outcomes. It encompasses various types of analytics, including diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.\n\n- **Diagnostic Analytics**: This type of analysis seeks to understand why something happened. It involves drilling down into data to identify the root causes of events or trends.\n- **Predictive Analytics**: Predictive analytics uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future events. It answers the question \"What will happen next?\" by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that can predict future outcomes.\n- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Prescriptive analytics goes a step further by recommending actions based on predictive insights. It answers the question \"What should we do?\" by providing actionable recommendations to decision-makers.\n\n### Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics\nThe progression from business intelligence (BI) to business analytics (BA) involves moving from a reactive to a proactive approach to data. Business intelligence focuses on reporting and descriptive analytics, providing insights into past performance. Business analytics, however, leverages advanced analytics techniques to drive strategic decision-making and optimize business processes.\n\n- **Business Intelligence**: BI is primarily concerned with reporting and descriptive analytics. It provides a historical view of data, helping organizations understand what has happened. BI tools include dashboards, reports, and alerts, which are essential for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and identifying trends.\n- **Business Analytics**: BA builds on BI by incorporating diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. It aims to answer more complex questions, such as \"Why did this happen?\" and \"What will happen next?\" BA uses advanced analytics techniques to uncover insights, predict future outcomes, and recommend actions."}

For example, the utility from the first hot dog is +10, but it drops to -10 by the sixth hot dog.\n\n### Competitive Context\n\nIn competitive contexts, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can be altered due to the potential for significant rewards or outcomes. The focus and determination to achieve a specific goal can override the typical diminishing utility pattern.\n\n**Text Quote [9]:**\n\"In competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be good...\"\n\n**Image Quote image1:**\n![Different Utility in Competition](image1)\n- The table shows a different utility pattern in a competitive context. Initially, the utility decreases as in standard consumption, but at a certain point (64 hot dogs), the utility dramatically increases due to the competitive reward (e.g., winning a championship).\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Standard Consumption:**\n   - The utility from each additional hot dog decreases progressively.\n   - Consumers are likely to switch to another choice when the utility drops significantly.\n\n2. **Competitive Context:**\n   - The utility pattern is altered by the potential for a large reward.\n   - The focus and determination to win can lead to increased utility even after consuming a large number of hot dogs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility leads to a decrease in satisfaction with each additional unit consumed, encouraging variety. However, in competitive contexts, the potential for significant rewards can override this pattern, leading to increased utility and focus on a single activity, even when the initial utility decreases. This highlights the importance of context in understanding economic behaviors and preferences."}

Resources are also available for students to support them through various periods in the academic journey. The Centre is located at University Health Service, #02-01, 36 Nanyang Avenue. Consultation is free of charge for students and held in strict confidence. For more information, students can visit the Centre or drop by the Centre for these resources. \n\nIn case of hospitalization, eligible students may seek a reimbursement under the Group Hospitalisation and Surgical Insurance (GHSI) scheme for the hospitalisation fee incurred in Singapore government/restructured hospitals. The insurance company will review and determine the reimbursed amount based on the scheme’s terms and conditions. For eligible students on the GHSI, the underwriter of GHSI will prepare a Letter of Guarantee (LOG), which you can present to the hospital in lieu of the cash deposit, subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance scheme. \n\nFor students who are not entitled to medical subsidies, falling ill and being hospitalised in Singapore can be a financial drain. Hospitals require a deposit of the entire estimated cost upon admission. For example, if the estimated cost for a hospital stay is $5,000, you must place a deposit of $5,000 with the hospital upon admission. \n\nIn case of an emergency, students can contact the NTU Student Wellbeing Centre at 6790 4462 during office hours or call Campus Security at 6790 5200 (24-hour Campus Security Hotline).

Let's delve into how these processes contribute to the overall goal of producing a potentially consumable solution.\n\n### Needs Exploration\n\nNeeds Exploration is a critical phase in agile project management where the team identifies and understands the stakeholders' needs. This process involves several key activities:\n\n1. **Active Stakeholder Participation**: Stakeholders are actively involved in the project, providing continuous feedback and insights. This ensures that the team is aligned with the stakeholders' expectations and can adapt to changing needs.\n\n2. **High-Level Requirements Specification**: The team gathers high-level requirements from stakeholders, which helps in setting the initial scope and direction of the project.\n\n3. **Split (A/B) Testing**: This method involves testing different versions of a product to determine which one performs better. It helps in validating assumptions about stakeholder needs and preferences.\n\n4. **Detailed Requirements Specification**: Detailed requirements are documented to provide a clear understanding of what needs to be developed. This ensures that the team has a comprehensive view of the stakeholders' needs.\n\n5. **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)**: ATDD involves writing acceptance tests before the development of features. This ensures that the developed solution meets the stakeholders' acceptance criteria.\n\n6. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Model Storming**: This technique involves creating models just in time to address specific needs or questions. It helps in quickly visualizing and understanding complex requirements.\n\n7. **Look-ahead Modeling**: This involves creating models that look ahead to future iterations, helping the team anticipate and prepare for upcoming needs.\n\n### Elicitation Methods\n\nElicitation Methods are techniques used to gather and understand stakeholder needs. These methods include:\n\n1. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Model Storming**: As mentioned earlier, this technique helps in quickly visualizing and understanding complex requirements.\n\n2. **Look-ahead Modeling**: This method helps in anticipating future needs and preparing for them.\n\n3. **All-hands Demos**: Regular demonstrations of the product to all stakeholders ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the solution meets the stakeholders' expectations.\n\n4. **Iteration Demos**: Demonstrations at the end of each iteration provide stakeholders with a tangible view of the progress and allow for feedback and adjustments.\n\n5. **Consumability Design**: This involves designing the solution in a way that it is easily consumable by the stakeholders. It ensures that the solution is user-friendly and meets the stakeholders' usability requirements.\n\n6. **Consumability Testing**: Regular testing of the solution's consumability ensures that it meets the stakeholders' expectations and is ready for deployment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the processes of Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods are essential in agile project management for addressing stakeholder needs.
