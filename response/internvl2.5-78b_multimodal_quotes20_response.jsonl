Nearly 60% of Americans feel there should indeed be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines, while 41% take the view that businesses are justified in replacing humans with machines if they can receive better work at lower cost [1]. The public is evenly divided on whether government or individuals should be responsible for providing for displaced workers, but is more supportive of limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines [2]. Along with these concerns, the public generally responds favorably to policies that would limit the use of these technologies to specific situations or that would bring human beings more fully into their operations. In the event that robots and computers become capable of doing many human jobs, for example, 85% of Americans are in favor of limiting machines to performing primarily those jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans. Were robots and computers to become widely competitive with human workers, majorities would also support providing all Americans with a guaranteed income that would allow people to meet their basic needs (60% in favor), as well as a national service program that would pay humans to perform jobs even if machines could do them faster or cheaper (58% in favor). In addition, a notably larger share of the public sides with the notion that there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, as opposed to the idea that businesses are justified in replacing human workers with machines if they can receive better work at lower cost [4]. Partisan opinions are much more aligned on the question of whether or not businesses should be limited in the number of human jobs they can replace with machines. Just over half of Republicans (54%) feel that there should be limits to how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines, only slightly less than the 60% of Democrats who hold this view [5]. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are substantially more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents to favor both a universal income (by a 77% to 38% margin) and a national service program (by a 66% to 46% margin) in the event that machines threaten to displace substantial numbers of human workers.

According to [6], 53% of the public express at least some confidence in Trump's economic policy decisions, while 46% express little or no confidence. This is a mixed response, indicating a divided public opinion.\n\nNow, let's look at the perceptions of Trump's ethical standards. [1] states that only 41% of Americans believe the GOP has high ethical standards, and a nearly identical share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party. This suggests a general skepticism about the ethical standards of both major political parties.\n\nWhen we break down these views by political affiliation, we see stark differences.

However, perceptions of his ethical standards are more negative, especially among Democrats. Republicans, on the other hand, are more likely to view Trump's ethical standards positively, although there is still a significant portion that has mixed or negative feelings.

This is a significant drop compared to the ratings for officials in previous administrations, as shown in image7, where the ratings for Trump are lower than those for Obama, G.W.

This disapproval is more intense among certain demographic groups, such as women, non-whites, and those with higher levels of education [6][8]. The low approval ratings for Trump's job performance are likely related to the low ratings for the ethical standards of his administration officials, as the public's evaluation of the way Trump is handling his job as president is little changed in recent months and is roughly on par with ratings at the outset of his presidency [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the approval ratings for the ethical standards of Trump administration officials are lower than those of past administrations, and this is likely related to the low public approval of Trump's job performance. The data suggests that the public is concerned about the ethical standards of Trump administration officials, and this concern is reflected in the low approval ratings for Trump's job performance. ![The approval ratings for the ethical standards of Trump administration officials are lower than those of past administrations](image7)"}

According to the data, younger adults (18-29) have consistently been more divided in their views, with 43% expressing concern that policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties and 44% worried that these policies do not go far enough to protect the country [8]. In contrast, older adults (65+) have been more concerned about security, with 71% saying this [8].\n\nWhen comparing these opinions across political affiliations, the data reveals stark differences. Republicans, particularly conservative Republicans, have become more likely to say that the government’s anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country [5]. In fact, 71% of conservative Republicans now express this concern, up 14 points since January [5]. Democrats, on the other hand, are more divided, with 54% of Democrats now saying their greater concern is that government policies do not go far enough, up somewhat since January and 16 points since 2013 [11]. Liberal Democrats are split, with equal shares saying their greater concern is that policies have gone too far in restricting average people’s civil liberties as say they worry more that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (41% each) [6].\n\nThe image data further supports these trends. For instance, the graph in image6 shows that the concern that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country has increased over time, peaking at 58% in 2010 and remaining high at 56% in 2015. This trend is particularly pronounced among Republicans, as shown in image7, where 71% of Republicans express this concern, compared to 54% of Democrats and 49% of Independents.\n\nIn summary, opinions on government anti-terrorism efforts have evolved over time, with younger adults being more divided and older adults being more concerned about security.

This sentiment has remained relatively consistent since October 2014, with a slight improvement in July 2015, where 30% viewed the campaign positively [image1]. However, there has been an uptick in the belief that the U.S. and its allies will ultimately succeed, with 66% expressing this view in December 2015, up from 55% in July 2015 [9].\n\nThe partisan divide in these perceptions is notable. Democrats are more likely to view the campaign positively, with 72% believing it will ultimately be successful, compared to 65% of Republicans and 62% of independents [2]. Conversely, Republicans are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the militants, with 75% expressing this concern, while only 18% worry about the U.S. becoming too involved [6]. Democrats, on the other hand, are more divided, with 61% concerned about not going far enough and 33% worried about over-involvement [image2].\n\nOverall, a 64%-majority continues to approve of the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, with support remaining steady over the course of 2015 [11]. However, the level of approval varies significantly by political affiliation, with 66% of Republicans, 33% of Democrats, and 48% of independents favoring the campaign [image8].\n\nIn summary, while public perceptions of the U.S. military campaign against ISIS have shown some improvement in terms of ultimate success, there remains a significant partisan divide in these views. Republicans are more optimistic about the campaign's success but more concerned about the U.S. not going far enough, while Democrats are more divided in their concerns."}

Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to view Israel as a key partner, with 26% ranking it highly compared to only 9% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [2]. Democrats, on the other hand, place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico as top foreign policy affiliates. However, both Republicans and Democrats rank Germany similarly, with both sides considering it as the fifth most important foreign policy partner [2][3].\n\nIn Germany, political affiliations also play a role in shaping foreign policy preferences. Supporters of the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens all name France as their first or second most important partner, followed by the U.S. [7]. This indicates a consensus among different political groups in Germany regarding the importance of France and the U.S. in their foreign policy.\n\nWhen it comes to cooperation with other countries, there is a divergence between American and German views. Nearly 70% of Americans want to cooperate more with Germany, compared with only half of Germans who say the same about the U.S. [8]. However, the percentage of Germans who want to cooperate more with the U.S. has increased by nine points since 2018, indicating a growing willingness for cooperation [8].\n\nIn terms of cooperation with Russia, Germans are almost twice as likely as Americans to want greater collaboration. Increased cooperation with Russia is a more common preference among Republicans in the U.S. (41%) than Democrats (32%), as well as among Germans living in former East Germany (75%) than in the former West (63%) [10].

According to the data, 62% of Germans in this age group believe that U.S. military bases are not important, while only 33% consider them important [8]. In contrast, older Germans, especially those aged 65 and above, are more likely to see these bases as important, with 61% holding this view [10]. This age-related disparity highlights a generational divide in Germany regarding the role of U.S. military presence.\n\nIn the U.S., political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of foreign policy partners. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to name Israel as a top foreign policy partner, with 26% considering it important, compared to only 9% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [9]. This partisan divide is also evident in the importance placed on Germany as a foreign policy partner, with both Republicans and Democrats ranking Germany similarly, but with Republicans showing a stronger preference for Israel [11].\n\nFurthermore, the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany is viewed differently by Americans and Germans. While 85% of Americans believe these bases are important to U.S. security interests, only about half of Germans see them as important for their country’s national security [8]. This disparity underscores the differing perspectives between the two nations on the significance of U.S. military presence in Germany.\n\nIn summary, age differences in Germany and political affiliations in the U.S. significantly impact perceptions of the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany and foreign policy partners. Younger Germans are more skeptical about the bases' importance, while older Germans are more supportive. In the U.S., Republicans prioritize Israel more than Democrats, and both groups view Germany similarly as a foreign policy partner.

For instance, 81% of liberal Democrats think the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared to just 22% of conservative Republicans [12]. This indicates a stark contrast in how different political groups perceive the U.S.'s performance on global issues.\n\nEducation also plays a role in these views.

According to the text, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more supportive of government obligations to care for displaced workers, with 65% feeling that the government should take responsibility, compared to 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who believe individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-being [4]. This partisan divide is also evident in the support for policies such as a universal basic income and a national service program, with Democrats showing higher support rates [11].\n\nRegarding education levels, the text indicates that Americans with varying levels of educational attainment respond in broadly comparable ways on the question of whether the government has an obligation to take care of workers who have been displaced by widespread automation of jobs [6]. However, those with lower levels of educational attainment are far more supportive of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines. For instance, 70% of those with high school diplomas or less support such limits, compared to 41% of those with four-year college degrees [6].\n\nThe image data further supports these findings. Image 6 shows that 85% of Democrats/lean Dem support the idea that machines should do dangerous or unhealthy jobs only, while 86% of Republicans/lean Rep agree with this concept. This indicates a high level of agreement across party lines on this specific policy. However, when it comes to a guaranteed basic income, the support is significantly higher among Democrats/lean Dem at 77%, compared to 38% among Republicans/lean Rep [6].\n\nIn conclusion, political affiliations and education levels play a crucial role in shaping opinions on government obligations and automation limits related to job displacement. Democrats and those with lower educational attainment tend to be more supportive of government intervention and limits on automation, while Republicans and those with higher educational attainment are more likely to favor individual responsibility and fewer restrictions on automation."}

For instance, only around one-third of Americans think that the video job interview and personal finance score algorithms would be fair to job applicants and consumers [2]. This skepticism is further emphasized by the fact that two-thirds of Americans find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable, and 67% say the computer-aided video job analysis algorithm is unacceptable [2]. The public's concern about fairness spans several dimensions, including worries about human bias, privacy violations, and the inability of these systems to capture the nuance of complex situations [6].\n\nThe image quotes provide additional insights into these perceptions. Image 2 shows that a majority of Americans find the personal finance score (68%) and automated video analysis of job interviews (67%) unacceptable, with only 31% and 32% respectively finding them acceptable. This indicates a significant gap between the perceived effectiveness and fairness of these systems. Image 3 further breaks down the perceptions of fairness, showing that a substantial portion of the public believes these systems are not fair at all or not very fair. For example, 33% of respondents believe the automated personal finance score is not fair at all, and another 33% believe it is not very fair.\n\nThe differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems imply that public trust in these systems is low. The largest gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness is observed in the personal finance score, with a 22-percentage-point difference [11]. This suggests that while some people may see these systems as effective, they do not necessarily trust them to be fair. The demographic differences in perceptions of fairness, as highlighted in the text quotes, also indicate that certain groups, such as blacks and Hispanics, are more likely to find these systems fair, while others, such as whites, are more skeptical [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the public's perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems used for decision-making are significantly disparate. This disparity implies a lack of public trust in these systems, particularly in their fairness.

In image6, it is evident that 65% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents view Trump as successful, while only 3% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents share this view. Conversely, 80% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents see Trump as unsuccessful, compared to just 9% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.\n\nIn terms of confidence in Mueller's investigation, image8 shows that 70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are not at all or not too confident in Mueller, whereas only 10% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents hold this view.

The partisan gap in views of job availability is sizable, with 71% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats saying there are plenty of jobs available [1, 6]. This gap is also reflected in the personal financial situation ratings, where 62% of Republicans rate their financial situation as excellent or good, compared to 44% of Democrats [3].\n\nOver time, the trends in perceptions of job availability have been influenced by the political climate. The line graphs [image2, image3, image5, image6, image8] show fluctuations in the percentage of people saying there are plenty of jobs available, with notable peaks and troughs corresponding to different presidential administrations. For instance, the percentage of Republicans saying there are plenty of jobs available has generally been higher during Republican administrations, while the percentage of Democrats has been higher during Democratic administrations.\n\nThe bar chart [image1] further illustrates the demographic differences in perceptions of economic conditions, with variations based on race, age, and income. The line graph [image7] shows a long-term trend in the percentage of people saying jobs are difficult to find, with a significant decrease in recent years, indicating an overall improvement in perceptions of job availability.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of economic conditions and job availability are strongly influenced by political affiliation, with Republicans generally holding more positive views.

As shown in [1], only 22% of Republicans believe the U.S. response has been more effective, while 87% of Democrats view it as less effective. This disparity is also reflected in the trust placed in public health officials, such as those at the CDC.

This difference in values is reflected in the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce. Women are more likely to say that they have experienced discrimination at work because of their gender and to consider discrimination a major reason that more women are not working in STEM [3]. They are also more likely to say that they have faced difficulties in balancing work and family needs in STEM jobs [11]. These challenges may discourage women from pursuing STEM careers, despite their interest and qualifications. The data suggests that addressing these challenges and creating a more inclusive and supportive work environment could help to attract and retain more women in STEM. ![Women in STEM jobs are much more likely than men in such jobs to say they have experienced discrimination at work because of their gender and to consider discrimination a major reason that more women are not working in STEM. While the majority of STEM workers say their gender has made no particular difference in their success, women in STEM jobs are more inclined than men to say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work.

This suggests a high level of energy consumption and industrial activity per person.\n- **China**: China has a much smaller bubble size compared to the USA, indicating lower CO2 emissions per capita. This could be due to a larger population base or more efficient energy use.\n- **Germany**: Germany's bubble size is smaller than the USA's but larger than China's, suggesting moderate CO2 emissions per capita.\n\n### Motor Vehicle Ownership\n- **USA**: The USA also has a high number of motor vehicles per capita, as shown by the large bubble size in image3. This high vehicle ownership contributes significantly to the country's CO2 emissions.\n- **China**: China has a lower number of motor vehicles per capita, which aligns with its lower CO2 emissions per capita. However, the rapid growth in vehicle ownership in China could lead to increased emissions in the future.\n- **Germany**: Germany has a moderate number of motor vehicles per capita, which is consistent with its moderate CO2 emissions per capita.\n\n### Environmental Implications\n- **USA**: The high CO2 emissions per capita and high motor vehicle ownership in the USA imply a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\n- **China**: While China's per capita emissions and vehicle ownership are lower, the sheer size of its population means that its total emissions are substantial. The country's rapid industrialization and urbanization could lead to increased environmental pressures.\n- **Germany**: Germany's moderate emissions and vehicle ownership suggest a balanced approach to economic development and environmental protection. However, there is still room for improvement in reducing emissions and promoting sustainable transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA has the highest environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, followed by Germany and then China. This highlights the need for continued efforts in reducing emissions and promoting sustainable practices in all three countries."}

The number of subscribers grew from 132.7 million in 2013 to 139.3 million in 2014. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing adoption of smartphones and the expansion of data services.\n\nHowever, despite the growth in subscribers, Telkomsel's ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) showed a decline. The line graph [![image2](image2)] indicates that both voice and SMS ARPU decreased during this period. This trend is consistent with the broader industry shift towards data-based services, as mentioned in the text [5]. The decline in voice and SMS ARPU can be attributed to the rise of instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP) services, which are often free or significantly cheaper than traditional voice and SMS services.\n\nAdditionally, the text [9] highlights that the majority of mobile phone users in Indonesia prefer using data-based IM services like WhatsApp, BBM, and LINE, which further contributed to the decline in voice and SMS ARPU. The increasing popularity of these services led to a reduction in the usage of traditional voice and SMS services, impacting the ARPU of telecom operators like Telkomsel.\n\nIn summary, while Telkomsel's subscriber base grew from 2013 to 2014, the company's ARPU declined due to the shift towards data-based services and the increasing adoption of instant messaging and VoIP services."}

However, the distribution of this streaming activity varies widely among genres. For instance, Rock music shows a balanced distribution with 32% of total activity coming from physical albums, 26% from digital albums, and 26% from streams [4]. This suggests that Rock fans still value owning music in physical and digital formats.\n\nIn contrast, R&B/Hip-Hop music has a much higher streaming share at 39%, with only 19% from physical albums and 20% from digital albums [4]. This indicates a strong preference for streaming among R&B/Hip-Hop fans, which aligns with the genre's dynamic and ever-evolving nature, where new releases are quickly consumed through streaming platforms.\n\nPop music also shows a high streaming share at 36%, with 18% from physical albums and 15% from digital albums [4]. This suggests that Pop fans are highly engaged with streaming services, likely due to the genre's frequent releases and the appeal of discovering new hits quickly.\n\nCountry music presents a different picture, with a higher share of physical album sales at 35%, digital album sales at 21%, and streaming at 18% [4]. This indicates a strong traditionalist base among Country music fans who prefer owning music in physical formats.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for the music industry. Artists and labels in genres with high streaming shares, such as R&B/Hip-Hop and Pop, may need to focus more on creating content that performs well on streaming platforms. This could involve strategies like releasing singles more frequently or optimizing music for streaming algorithms.\n\nOn the other hand, genres like Rock and Country, with higher album sales, might benefit from strategies that emphasize the value of owning music, such as special edition releases or bundling physical albums with exclusive content.\n\nOverall, understanding these genre-specific trends can help the music industry tailor their marketing and distribution strategies to better meet the preferences of their target audiences."}

This encoding, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state [10]. The dialogue state tracker updates its estimation of the user's goal, represented by a list of slot-value pairs [10].\n\nNext, the policy network emits a system action based on the dialogue state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results [5].

This is a substantial increase compared to other datasets, as shown in ![{The SnapNTell dataset includes 22 major categories and 7,568 unique entities}](image5). For each entity, the dataset curates 10 illustrative images and crafts 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs, emphasizing knowledge-intensive responses over simple binary answers [10].\n\nIn terms of knowledge, the SnapNTell dataset focuses on entity-centric knowledge-based VQA, requiring models to provide detailed, entity-specific knowledge in their responses [6]. This is a notable contrast to other datasets, which may not demand such in-depth knowledge extraction [7].\n\nThe dataset's questions are highly anonymous, implying that they do not rely on question templates for question generation, unlike some other datasets [7]. This anonymity ensures that the questions are more challenging and require a deeper understanding of the entities depicted in the images.\n\nFurthermore, the SnapNTell dataset boasts a higher count of images and a longer average length for answers compared to other datasets [9]. Specifically, the dataset is structured to include 10 images for each entity, whereas the exact number of images per entity in other datasets remains unspecified [9].\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell dataset surpasses existing VQA datasets in terms of the variety of categories, the number of distinct entities, and the overall number of QA pairs. It emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses and includes a wide range of fine-grained entities with representative images and explicit entity names in the answer sets [9]. The dataset's questions are highly anonymous, requiring models to provide detailed, entity-specific knowledge in their responses [6]."}

This trend is further supported by the table in image ![Table showing the impact of removed knowledge on precision, recall, and F1-Score](image2), which shows a clear downward trend in recall and F1-Score as the number of removed knowledge elements increases.\n\nThe text [10] states that the recall is stable at about 15 regardless of the number of absent knowledge. This indicates that the current LLMs have the ability to identify absent knowledge to a limited extent. While precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, which shows that with more absent knowledge in KG, [NA] enables generated outputs to locate absent knowledge more accurately. Therefore, the “Conscious Incompetence” setting plays an increasingly crucial role when the coverage problem of knowledge graph is more serious [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of knowledge elements affects precision, recall, and F1-Score, with recall being the most significantly impacted. The models' ability to handle absent knowledge is limited, but the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting helps to identify and locate absent knowledge more accurately."}

From the provided text and images, we can observe several key points:\n\n1. **Impact of Logical Constraints**:\n   - Adding logical constraints into LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. For example, the performance of using 5 demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints (25.7%) surpasses that of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%) [1].\n   - Logical constraints help in reducing logical inconsistency. As shown in Figure 6, the logical inconsistency of answers decreases with the increase of iterations [5].\n   - The performance of LLMs improves when incorporating logical constraints, but injecting irrelevant logic introduces fluctuations in results [4].\n\n2. **Effect of Demonstration Samples**:\n   - When the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is an evident improvement in performance, but subsequent improvements are limited when continuing to increase the number of demonstrations (e.g., ≥10) [1].\n   - Incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass the performance of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations [1].\n\n3. **Model Performance Analysis**:\n   - From Table 3, we find that training LLMs on LLM-LR improves their performance greatly compared to baselines without logical constraints [3].\n   - The performance of LlaMA2-13B-PT could even surpass that of some greater LLMs [3].\n   - The results in Table 6 show that models like GPT-4 and Llama2-13B-PT achieve better performance when logical constraints are incorporated [3].\n\n4. **Iterative Retrieval**:\n   - The logical inconsistency of answers gradually decreases with the increase of iterations, but the overall micro-F1 seems relatively stable [5].\n   - This indicates that instructing LLMs with logic is beneficial for conversation, but how to support longer information is still challenging [5].\n\n5. **Comparison of Models**:\n   - Models like GPT-4 and Llama2-13B-PT show significant improvements when logical constraints are used [3].\n   - The performance of LLMs can be improved if we explicitly teach them the logical constraints [11].\n\n6. **Visual Evidence**:\n   - ![The performance of different models on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets"}

Modular RAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or adjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its applicability across different tasks [3]. \n\nThe Modular RAG framework introduces additional specialized components to enhance retrieval and processing capabilities. The Search module adapts to specific scenarios, enabling direct searches across various data sources like search engines, databases, and knowledge graphs, using LLM-generated code and query languages [9]. RAG-Fusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing a multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse perspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent re-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowledge [9]. The Memory module leverages the LLM’s memory to guide retrieval, creating an unbounded memory pool that aligns the text more closely with data distribution through iterative self-enhancement [9]. Routing in the RAG system navigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal pathway for a query, whether it involves summarization, specific database searches, or merging different information streams [9]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy and noise by generating context directly through the LLM, ensuring relevance and accuracy [9]. Lastly, the Task Adapter module tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating prompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific retrievers through few-shot query generation [9]. This comprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval process but also significantly improves the quality and relevance of the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks and queries with enhanced precision and flexibility [9]. \n\nIn summary, Advanced RAG enhances retrieval quality through refined indexing and optimization methods, while Modular RAG introduces a flexible and adaptable framework with specialized modules to address specific challenges and improve retrieval-augmented generation [1][3][9]. ![Advanced RAG and Modular RAG](image5)"}

The blurring strategy is designed to direct the MLLMs’ focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks. After successfully constructing memory by using our multimodal retriever, the system integrates the memory with the retrieval process and uses MLLMs to rank the retrieval results and enhance the performance in few-shot/zero-shot perception tasks [8]. The retrieved category labels alongside image embedding are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through our ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category [7]. Our proposed inference process, using both the retrieval results from our memory bank and subsequent ranking by the MLLM, ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.

The SnapNTell benchmark has been designed to evaluate models’ abilities in accurately identifying entities and generating responses that showcase a deep understanding of these entities. To support this task, we have curated a new evaluation dataset that departs from existing datasets in two crucial ways: (1) it encompasses a wide range of categorized entities, each represented by images and explicitly named in the answers; (2) it features QA pairs that require extensive knowledge for accurate responses.

The table compares the performance of BERT models fine-tuned with different training objectives, including cross-entropy (CE), dice loss (DL), and dynamic soft dice loss (DSC). The results indicate that BERT with CE achieves the highest accuracy on both SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, while DL and DSC perform slightly worse.

This suggests that pre-training is particularly effective for languages with larger headroom for improvement. The gain in BLEU score is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4]. This indicates that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect. \n\nThe similarity of the source and target languages also plays a crucial role in the efficacy of pre-training.

This indicates that aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks. The increases are intuitive, as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space.

The text and image quotes provide insights into how the removal of components such as R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types (e.g., MATCH, COREF) affects the model's performance under unmasked and masked conditions.\n\nFirst, let's consider the impact of removing the R-GCN component. According to [4], replacing ELMo with GloVe and removing the R-GCN component results in a significant drop in performance. Specifically, the model loses 8.0 points in accuracy on the unmasked validation set. This indicates that the R-GCN component is crucial for the model's performance, as it helps update mention representations based on their relation to other mentions.\n\nNext, we look at the impact of removing relation types. [1] states that fully connecting all nodes within and across documents without distinguishing edges by type (i.e., no relation types) results in only marginal improvements compared to using ELMo alone. This suggests that a more informative graph construction, which includes relation types, is necessary for better performance.\n\nNow, let's examine the impact of removing specific relation types, such as MATCH and COREF. [7] reveals that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. This is because the majority of connections are between mentions in the same document, and removing these connections removes important information. Additionally, coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role. However, modeling all these different relations together gives the Entity-GCN a clear advantage. Surprisingly, with coreference, the model observes performance degradation on the test set, likely due to the test documents being harder for the coreference system.\n\nTo further illustrate the impact of removing specific components, we can refer to the results presented in image4. The table shows the performance of different models under unmasked and masked conditions. The \"full (ensemble)\" model, which includes all components, achieves the highest accuracy of 68.5% on the unmasked validation set and 71.6% on the masked validation set. In contrast, the \"GloVe with R-GCN\" model, which replaces ELMo with GloVe but still includes the R-GCN component, achieves lower accuracy of 59.2% on the unmasked validation set and 11.1% on the masked validation set.

The results are presented in Table 3, which is referenced in the text quotes [4] and [6].\n\nIn the unmasked setting, the Entity-GCN model with coreference information achieved an accuracy of 68.5%, while the model without coreference information achieved an accuracy of 65.3%.

This is evident from the results shown in Table 2 [1], where SWEM models outperform CNNs in topic prediction tasks. For instance, SWEM-concat achieves higher accuracy than a 29-layer deep CNN model on the Yahoo! Answer dataset. Similarly, on the DBpedia dataset, SWEM models show comparable or even better results than CNN or LSTM models [1].\n\nIn sentiment analysis tasks, SWEM-hier performs exceptionally well, as seen in the results for the Yelp Polarity dataset, where it achieves an accuracy of 95.81%, outperforming CNN models [2]. This indicates that the hierarchical pooling operation in SWEM-hier effectively abstracts spatial information, which is beneficial for sentiment analysis.\n\nHowever, when it comes to sentence classification tasks, SWEM models tend to perform less effectively than CNN or LSTM models, especially on shorter text sequences. This is due to the fact that word-order features are more critical in shorter texts, and SWEM models may not capture these features as effectively as CNN or LSTM models [5].\n\nIn terms of subspace dimensions, the performance of SWEM and CNN models varies. As shown in Figure 2 (c) and (d) [10], SWEM models exhibit higher accuracy than CNN models for a large range of low subspace dimensions. For example, on the AG News dataset, SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN when the subspace dimension is low. However, as the subspace dimension increases, CNN models can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy.\n\nThe insights drawn from these comparisons suggest that SWEM models, with their simple pooling strategies, can be highly effective and parameter-efficient for certain NLP tasks, particularly those involving longer text sequences. However, for tasks that require capturing more complex spatial information, such as sentiment analysis on shorter texts, CNN or LSTM models may still hold an advantage.\n\nIn summary, the performance of SWEM and CNN models across different datasets and subspace dimensions highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach. SWEM models excel in tasks where word embeddings alone carry sufficient information, while CNN models are better suited for tasks that require more sophisticated compositional functions to capture spatial information."}

It shows that the accuracy for stereotypical translations is generally higher than for non-stereotypical translations, with the largest difference observed in French (FR) and the smallest in Italian (IT).\n\nThe text [5] and image [5] provide specific examples of how stereotype-based adjustments can affect the translation of gender roles. For instance, the translation of \"the pretty baker\" into Spanish as \"la panadera\" (female baker) demonstrates how adding a stereotypically female adjective can \"fix\" the translation and reduce gender bias.\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can significantly impact gender bias accuracy across different languages. These adjustments can improve the performance of machine translation systems by aligning the translations more closely with stereotypical gender roles, as evidenced by the higher accuracy percentages for stereotypical translations and the successful reduction of bias in certain languages when using stereotypical adjectives. However, it is important to note that this approach may not be practical as a general debiasing scheme, as it assumes oracle coreference resolution. ![Stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can improve gender bias accuracy across different languages.](image4) ![Adding stereotypical adjectives can \"fix\" the translation and reduce gender bias.](image5) ![The accuracy for stereotypical translations is generally higher than for non-stereotypical translations.](image4) ![Stereotype-based adjustments can significantly impact gender bias accuracy across different languages."}

According to the text [1], BERT's peak performance on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT) was initially reported to be 77%, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline. However, this performance was found to be largely due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset. The analysis revealed that BERT and other models exploit these cues, leading to inflated performance metrics.\n\nTo address this issue, an adversarial dataset was constructed, as described in [8] and [9]. This dataset was designed to eliminate the major problem of statistical cues over labels in ARCT. By negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, the distribution of statistical cues in the warrants was mirrored over both labels, effectively removing the signal that models were exploiting.\n\nThe results of evaluating BERT on this adversarial dataset are shown in image3. The table indicates that BERT's performance on the adversarial test set dropped to a mean accuracy of 50.4%, with a median of 50.5% and a maximum of 53.3%. This is a substantial decrease from the original performance, demonstrating that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminated the cues that BERT was exploiting.\n\nThe conclusion drawn from these results is that BERT's initial high performance on the ARCT dataset was not due to a genuine understanding of argument comprehension but rather due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues. The adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension and should be adopted as the standard in future work on this dataset, as stated in [3] and [8].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset was artificially inflated by exploiting statistical cues. The adversarial dataset, which eliminates these cues, provides a more accurate assessment of BERT's capabilities in argument comprehension, showing that its performance is much closer to random when these cues are removed. This highlights the importance of controlling for spurious statistics in evaluating NLP models."}

For the closed vocabulary models, the pass-through backoff strategy has a WER of 17.6 for swap attacks, 19.7 for drop attacks, and 0.8 for add attacks. The background backoff strategy has a WER of 19.5 for swap attacks, 22.3 for drop attacks, and 1.1 for add attacks.

The table shows the WER for different backoff strategies under various attack types. For the open vocabulary models, the pass-through backoff strategy has a WER of 39.6 for swap attacks, 35.3 for drop attacks, and 19.2 for add attacks.

They predict an answer span within a single document and are adapted to a multi-document setting by sequentially concatenating all documents in random order into a superdocument. The first answer mention in the concatenated document serves as the gold span during training, and the order of documents is randomized both at training and test time to rule out any signal stemming from the order of documents.\n\nThe text also mentions that BiDAF is overall stronger across both datasets compared to FastQA. This is possibly due to the iterative latent interactions in the BiDAF architecture, which are of increased importance for the task where information is distributed across documents.\n\nLooking at the image data, we can see the performance of BiDAF and FastQA models under different test conditions. In the standard test condition, BiDAF performs better than FastQA on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets. In the masked test condition, BiDAF still outperforms FastQA on both datasets, but the performance gap between the two models is smaller compared to the standard test condition.\n\nIn the gold chain test condition, where only documents leading to the correct answer are used, BiDAF and FastQA models show significant improvement in performance. BiDAF achieves almost perfect scores in this setup, while FastQA shows a slight increase in performance.\n\nIn conclusion, BiDAF outperforms FastQA on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets under different test conditions. The iterative latent interactions in the BiDAF architecture are particularly beneficial for the task where information is distributed across documents. The performance of both models improves significantly in the gold chain test condition, where only relevant documents are used."}

This indicates a significant increase in both foreign tax provision and foreign income before taxes over the two-year period.\n\nThe increase in foreign income before taxes suggests that the company has been expanding its operations or increasing its profitability in foreign markets. The corresponding increase in the foreign tax provision indicates that the company is paying more taxes in these foreign jurisdictions, which could be due to higher taxable income or changes in tax laws and regulations in these regions.\n\nThese changes might impact the company's financial strategy in several ways.

Firstly, the interest and other investment income decreased significantly by 44.4% [7]. This decrease was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [12]. The image shows that the carrying value of corporate bonds, which are a type of fixed maturity security, increased from  $1,761$ million in 2020 to  $1,761$ million in 2021, indicating a potential decrease in yield [![{The carrying value of corporate bonds increased from $1,761 million in 2020 to $1,761 million in 2021}](image1)]. Additionally, the cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, which are short-term investments, increased from  $67,082$ million in 2020 to  $90,688$ million in 2021, reflecting a shift towards safer, lower-yield investments [![{The cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021}](image6)].

Comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership also increased from $464 million in 2018 to $542 million in 2020. The main contributing factors to these increases include higher net income, primarily driven by increased income from equity method investments and higher distributions from Poseidon, as well as a decrease in other comprehensive loss. The increase in net income is also supported by the increase in operating income and the decrease in interest expense. Additionally, the elimination of IDRs and the conversion of the general partner's economic interest into a non-economic interest in April 2020 contributed to the increase in net income attributable to the Partnership. The comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership was also positively impacted by the increase in net income and the decrease in other comprehensive loss. The increase in net income and comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership is reflected in the increase in net income per unit applicable to common limited partner units from $1.50 in 2018 to $1.28 in 2020. The increase in net income per unit is primarily due to the increase in net income attributable to the Partnership and the decrease in the weighted average number of common units outstanding.

The increase in net income and comprehensive income attributable to the Partnership is also reflected in the increase in cash and cash equivalents from $290 million in 2018 to $320 million in 2020.

This is reflected in the increase in revenue from US$42,931 million in FY2020 to US$60,817 million in FY2021, as shown in image1. Additionally, the increase in Underlying EBITDA was also due to higher volumes achieved at WAIO, along with the highest annual production at Olympic Dam since our acquisition in 2005, as mentioned in [6]. However, this increase was partially offset by the impacts of expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence, natural field decline in Petroleum, and adverse weather events. The increase in Underlying EBITDA was also due to higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and Nickel West, as well as lower technology costs and a gain from the optimized outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence, as mentioned in [7].

According to the data, NBCUniversal's revenue increased by 26.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, and the Adjusted EBITDA also increased by  6.0% during the same period [10]. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the overall market recovery compared to the prior year period, as well as an increase in average revenue per customer relationship [11]. The increase in average revenue per customer relationship reflected the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets, and rate increases in the United Kingdom, which were partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy. Customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in Italy were offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany [11]. The declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy [11]. Additionally, the total customer relationships remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease of  198 in 2021 compared to 2020 [5]. This stability in customer relationships, combined with the increase in average revenue per customer relationship, contributed to the overall positive financial performance of NBCUniversal during this period."}

This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, as well as lower line utilization and higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets. Additionally, the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) substantially all of which related to the sales of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods, partially offset by originations of $72.6 billion, contributed to the decrease in consumer loans. ![Total loans decreased by $30,199 million, or 14%](image3)\n\n- **Total Deposits**: The total deposits increased by $18,323 million, or 10%, from $178,946 million in 2020 to $197,269 million in 2021.

This increase was also driven by Lending commitments within the Wealth management and Institutional Securities business segments and an increase in Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains. Additionally, credit risk RWA under the Advanced Approach increased for CVA, mainly due to increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility [3]. \n\nThe External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [7]. This increase indicates that the financial institution has a higher level of loss-absorbing capacity relative to its risk-weighted assets, which is a positive development for its capital structure.\n\nOverall, the increase in Credit Risk RWA and the increase in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA suggest that the financial institution has a more robust capital structure, which can help it better withstand potential losses and maintain financial stability. However, it is important to note that these changes may also have implications for the institution's capital requirements and regulatory compliance, as discussed in the text quotes [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. \n\n![Credit Risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches](image4) \n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image7) \n\nIn conclusion, the changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets from 2019 to 2020 had a significant impact on the financial institution's overall capital structure, indicating a more robust capital structure with a higher level of loss-absorbing capacity relative to its risk-weighted assets."}

As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of these contracts was near zero, and the recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and have historically been significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three years were insignificant.\n\nRegarding the differences in non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021, the image shows that the non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings was $955 million in 2021 and $(764) million in 2020. This indicates a significant increase in the impact of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings from 2020 to 2021. The increase in the impact of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings could be due to various factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the fair values of equity index put option contracts, and changes in the fair values of other interest rate sensitive instruments. The image also shows that the net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings were $58 million in 2021 and $(163) million in 2020, indicating a decrease in the impact of these contracts on net earnings from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in the impact of these contracts on net earnings could be due to various factors, including changes in the fair values of these contracts and changes in the fair values of other interest rate sensitive instruments.

The volatility of Toyota's share price is another key indicator, reflecting the market's perception of the company's value and stability. This is also highlighted in image5, where it is mentioned as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors.\n\nIndividual performance evaluations are conducted to assess each director's contributions and efforts in line with the company's goals and strategies. This qualitative evaluation ensures that executives are rewarded based on their specific achievements and responsibilities, as detailed in image5.\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation process is structured to ensure that remuneration is effectively linked to corporate performance while reflecting individual job responsibilities and performance. This approach is designed to secure and retain talented personnel, as stated in text [2]. The remuneration standards in each member's home country are also taken into account, ensuring a fair and competitive compensation package.\n\nIn addition to these performance-based metrics, Toyota also considers the total amount of remuneration for a given fiscal year, as mentioned in text [10]. The Board of Directors resolves to delegate the determination of the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors to the Executive Compensation Meeting. This meeting reviews the executive remuneration system and determines the amount of remuneration for each Member, taking into account factors such as corporate performance and individual job responsibilities and performance.\n\nOverall, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation is a multifaceted process that reflects the company's commitment to aligning executive compensation with business performance and shareholder value.

The interest expense decreased by $2.9$ billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts, which increased by $142.9$ billion [11]. The decrease in net interest income and the decrease in interest expense both contributed to the overall decrease in net operating income, which decreased by $12.9$ billion or $24\\%$ [4]. The overall profitability of the organization was impacted by the decrease in net operating income, which resulted in a decrease in profit before tax of $8.8$ billion or $34\\%$ [1]. The decrease in net operating income was due to an increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (‘ECL’) and a reduction in reported revenue, which were partly mitigated by lower reported operating expenses [1]. The decrease in net operating income and the decrease in profit before tax both contributed to the overall decrease in profitability of the organization. The decrease in profitability was also impacted by the decrease in net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss, which decreased by $1.5$ billion compared with 2019 [6]. The decrease in net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses was primarily due to less favorable equity market performance, compared with 2019 in France and Hong Kong, due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the equity and unit trust assets supporting insurance and investment contracts [6]. The decrease in net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses also contributed to the overall decrease in profitability of the organization. The decrease in profitability was also impacted by the decrease in net insurance premium income, which decreased by $0.6$ billion compared with 2019, primarily reflecting lower new business volumes due to the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in France and Hong Kong, partly offset by lower reinsurance premiums ceded in Hong Kong [6].

The decrease in credit card purchase volumes suggests that consumers were cutting back on discretionary spending, while the decrease in home equity balances suggests that they were paying down their existing home equity loans rather than taking on new debt.

For coal, a $1 per tonne decline in the average metallurgical coal price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of $24 million and on underlying EBITDA of $35 million [5]. This is due to the fact that BHP sells its products at prevailing market prices, and fluctuations in commodity prices can affect its financial performance [4]. The average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne (FY2020: US$13,860 per tonne) for nickel, which benefitted from positive investor sentiment amidst a strong, geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand [6]. The increase in nickel price was supported by strong demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks. The impact of a $1 per tonne decline in the average nickel price on FY2021 profit after taxation would be $1 million and on underlying EBITDA would be $1 million [5]. The key drivers behind these impacts include global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, commodity supply and demand (including inventory levels), technological change, product substitution, tariffs, and exchange rate fluctuations [4]. Additionally, the prices obtained for BHP's products are a key driver of value for the company, and fluctuations in these commodity prices affect its results, including cash flows and asset values [10]."}

These changes resulted in a total revenue increase of $3,138 million, or 59%, from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower loan balances, reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization. The increase in noninterest income was mainly driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income.

Retained earnings are a key component of shareholders' equity.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**: This includes items that are not included in net income but affect shareholders' equity, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on certain investments, and pension and postretirement benefit adjustments.\n\nLet's analyze the changes:\n\n1. **Retained Earnings**:\n   - In 2020, retained earnings were $13,837 million.\n   - In 2021, retained earnings increased to $13,474 million.\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**:\n   - In 2020, OCI was $(2,895) million.\n   - In 2021, OCI improved to $(2,945) million.\n\n3. **Total Shareholders' Equity**:\n   - In 2020, total shareholders' equity was $191,367 million.\n   - In 2021, total shareholders' equity decreased to $188,548 million.\n\nFrom the data, we can see that while retained earnings decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021, OCI also showed a slight improvement. However, the overall total shareholders' equity decreased, indicating a net reduction in the company's financial position in terms of shareholders' equity.\n\nThe decrease in retained earnings could be due to several factors, such as higher dividend payments, net losses, or other distributions to shareholders. The slight improvement in OCI suggests that some of the items affecting OCI, such as foreign currency translation adjustments or unrealized gains on investments, had a less negative impact in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021 indicate a slight deterioration in the company's financial position, primarily driven by a decrease in retained earnings, despite a slight improvement in other comprehensive income.

Specifically, 50% of women in STEM jobs report experiencing gender discrimination, while only 19% of men in STEM jobs report the same. The most common forms of gender discrimination experienced by women in STEM jobs include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent because of their gender (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights in their workplace (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man who was doing the same job (18%). Women in computer jobs are particularly likely to report pay inequities (46%) and being treated as if they were not competent at work because of their gender (40%). Women with advanced degrees working in STEM jobs are also more likely to report that they have experienced discrimination in their workplace because of their gender and to say that their gender has made it harder to succeed at work. The image quotes further support these findings, showing that women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience gender-related discrimination at work, with 78% of women in STEM jobs reporting experiencing at least one form of gender-related discrimination, compared to only 19% of men in STEM jobs. Additionally, women in STEM jobs are more likely to report that their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job (48%) and to feel the need to prove themselves at work all/some of the time (79%).

Initially, in 2004, there was a higher concern that government policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties, with 47% expressing this concern [1]. However, by 2015, the balance of opinion had shifted dramatically. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center found that since the start of the year, the share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism had fallen by 26 percentage points, from 72% to 46%, marking its lowest point in the post-9/11 era [4]. This decline in positive ratings indicates a growing dissatisfaction with the government's anti-terrorism efforts.\n\nMoreover, the survey revealed that for the first time, more Americans now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) than say the government is doing either very or fairly well (46%) [6]. This shift in opinion highlights a significant increase in public concern that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country.\n\nThe image showing the percentage of Americans who believe the government's anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country versus those who believe these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties further supports this trend. In 2015, 56% of Americans expressed greater concern that the government's anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, compared to 28% who were more concerned that these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties [10]. This represents a substantial increase in concern about the inadequacy of anti-terrorism policies since 2004.\n\nIn conclusion, public opinion regarding anti-terror policies has shifted from a greater concern about civil liberties restrictions in 2004 to a more significant concern about the inadequacy of these policies in protecting the country by 2015. This change reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism and a heightened awareness of the need for more effective anti-terrorism measures."}

According to the text, the population of Hamilton County was 130 in 1870, and it surged to 8,267 by 1880 and reached its peak at 14,096 in 1890 [1]. However, since that peak, the population has slowly declined [1]. The table in image2 provides a detailed breakdown of the population over the years, showing fluctuations but generally a downward trend after the peak in 1890.\n\nSeveral historical factors influenced these population changes. The Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862 had a profound impact on the state, transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural state [5]. The railroad facilitated the movement of people and goods, while the Homestead Act encouraged settlement by providing land to pioneers who constructed permanent structures and resided on the land for five years [5]. These acts led to a significant influx of settlers, contributing to the population surge in the late 1800s.\n\nAdditionally, the consolidation of farms and the mechanization of agriculture have had significant impacts on rural life in Hamilton County [6]. As farming methods evolved, the scale of farming increased, leading to a decline in the number of farms and an increase in the average size of farms [6]. This consolidation trend has continued, affecting the population dynamics of the county.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the settlers also played a role in shaping the population trends. Immigrants from various countries, including Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, settled in clusters across the county, contributing to its cultural diversity [2]. The establishment of rural school districts and churches, such as the Zion Lutheran Church and School, further influenced the social and cultural landscape of the county [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000, were influenced by a combination of factors, including the Transcontinental Railroad Act, the Homestead Act, farm consolidation, and the ethnic composition of the settlers. These factors contributed to the initial population surge and the subsequent decline in population over the years. ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image2)"}

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques. The retriever uses an encoder to process input images and retrieve the top-k class names most similar to the image from the memory bank. This is illustrated in ![Multimodal Retriever](image1).\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**: After retrieving the top-k categories, the MLLMs rank these retrieved candidate results as the final prediction results. The prompt format guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity. This process is depicted in ![Retrieving & Ranking](image1).\n\n3. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: For object detection datasets, the methodology involves additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring. This helps the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected by directing their focus toward the relevant objects. The process is shown in ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image3).\n\n4. **Index System**: To enhance the speed of retrieval, an index system that uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented. This facilitates a significant dimensionality reduction, enabling the construction of a more condensed index. This is mentioned in [7].\n\n5. **Ranking Prompt Example**: The ranking prompt example demonstrates how the retrieved categories are sorted and ranked by the MLLM. This is illustrated in ![Ranking Prompt Example](image6).\n\n6. **Integration with MLLMs**: The retrieved category labels alongside image embedding are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through the ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category. This is described in [2].\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline enhances the fine-grained few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs by integrating a multimodal retriever, optimizing retrieval speed, and using MLLMs to rank the retrieved results, thereby significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language recognition tasks. ![Multimodal Retriever](image1) and ![Retrieving &"}

The input embeddings, referred to as object queries, are learned positional encodings that are added to the input of each attention layer.

This is consistent with the findings of Pang et al. (2002), who hypothesized that the positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment. The phrase \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, demonstrating the importance of word order.\n\nThe text [9] further supports this by stating that SWEM ignores word-order information within a text sequence, which could be potentially captured by CNN- or LSTM-based models. The empirical findings show that except for sentiment analysis, SWEM exhibits similar or even superior performance as the CNN or LSTM on a variety of tasks. This indicates that word-order features are particularly important for sentiment analysis.\n\nThe text [11] provides additional evidence by showing that on the Yelp polarity dataset, the results drop noticeably when word-order information is removed, further suggesting that word-order does matter for sentiment analysis.\n\nThe image [4] shows a table comparing the performance of LSTM models on different datasets with and without shuffled word order. The table indicates that for the Yelp polarity dataset, the accuracy drops from 95.11% to 93.49% when the word order is shuffled, demonstrating the significant impact of word-order information on sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models.\n\nIn conclusion, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as evidenced by the experimental results and the noticeable drop in accuracy when word order is shuffled."}

The initial set of entity mentions is identified using links between Wikipedia articles, which are associated with their corresponding Wikidata entities [5]. These links provide a large number of gold entity annotations, but they are insufficient for capturing all mentions in the article since entities are only linked the first time they occur. To address this, the neural-el (Gupta et al., 2017) entity linker is used to identify additional links to Wikidata, and coreferences are identified using Stanford CoreNLP to cover pronouns, nominals, and other tokens missed by the linker [5].\n\nThe annotations indicate which entities are new and related based on whether they are reachable by entities linked so far. For instance, in the example annotation provided in Table 1 corresponding to the instance in Figure 1, the entity mentioned for most tokens are human-provided links, apart from “1989” that is linked to 04-21-1989 by the string matching process [4]. The annotations also indicate that some entities, such as “side-scrolling game” and “platform video game,” are incorrectly marked as new due to missing links in Wikidata [4].\n\nFurthermore, multiple plausible reasons for mentioning an entity are included in the annotations. For example, Game Boy is mentioned because it is the platform for Super Mario Land and it is manufactured by Nintendo, even though only the former is more relevant in this context [4]. This approach allows the model to dynamically decide the facts to incorporate from the knowledge graph, guided by the discourse [8].\n\nIn summary, entities and their relationships are represented in the example annotation through a combination of human-provided links, automatic linking processes, and annotations indicating new and related entities. This approach enables the model to generate factually correct sentences and generalize to rare/unseen entities, as well as to incorporate factual information from the knowledge graph into the generated text [11].\n\n![Entities and their relationships are represented through a combination of human-provided links and automatic linking processes](image1)"}

Similarly, in Figure 14, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy outperforms other strategies on PathMNIST [12]. The quantitative comparison in Figure 4 further supports this, showing that selecting hard-to-contrast data contributes to optimal models [11]. The bar chart in image1 also highlights the superior performance of the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy across various datasets, including PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST [1].

In contrast, other benchmarks largely focus on relatively basic perception abilities without requiring expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate reasoning [ 1 ]. MMMU is designed to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. [ 6 ]. In the depth aspect, the previous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, our benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge [ 6 ]. The MMMU benchmark underscores both the progress and the challenges in multimodal understanding and reasoning. While GPT-4V leads in performance, the overall results indicate substantial room for improvement, especially in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge [ 12 ]. The benchmark poses significant challenges to current models. Notably, GPT-4V, despite being an advanced model, achieves an accuracy of only 55.7%, with ample headroom for improvement [ 8 ]. This reflects the benchmark’s rigorous and demanding standards. Disparity between Open-source Models and GPT-4V: Leading open-source models such as BLIP2-FLAN-T5-XXL and LLaVA-1.5 reach an accuracy level of approximately 34%, which is significantly lower than GPT-4V [ 8 ]. The MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges to multimodal foundation models, as detailed in Figure 1. Among these, we particularly highlight the challenge stemming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [ 10 ]. This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model’s adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, calling for an advanced approach that integrates advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge [ 10 ]. The detailed subject coverage and statistics are detailed in Figure 3. The questions in our benchmark were manually collected by a team of 50 college students (including coauthors) from various disciplines and subjects, drawing from online sources, textbooks, and lecture materials [ 9 ].

We then analyze the accuracy of using texts to obtain personality profiles and output personality score distributions. To explore the effectiveness of using personality in current recommendation systems, we conduct a few experiments with the standard neural collaborative filtering (NCF) recommendation algorithm and our variants, finding that incorporating personality information improves recommendation performance by 3% to 28%.

Orazio Gentileschi was an Italian painter born in 1563 and died in 1639. He was born in Pisa and died in London. Orazio’s influence on Artemisia’s development as a prominent Baroque painter can be seen in her highly naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes and the use of chiaroscuro technique. He also provided her with the opportunity to study with him and learn from his experience and expertise. She became an important second-generation proponent of Caravaggio’s dramatic realism.}](image7)\n\nIn the knowledge graph, we see that Orazio Gentileschi is connected to Artemisia Gentileschi as her father.

[1]\n\n2. **2011: Google Ngrams Corpus**\n   - The release of the Google Books Ngrams corpus played a crucial role in the development of the field. It spurred work on 'culturomics,' studying human culture through digital media. Researchers like Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) used this dataset to detect differences in word usage and meaning across 50-year time spans. [12]\n\n3. **2012: Word Epoch Disambiguation**\n   - The method of word epoch disambiguation was proposed, which helped in detecting the time span that specific contexts of a word undergoing a shift belong to. This was a significant step in understanding the temporal aspects of semantic shifts. [3]\n\n4. **2013: Prediction-Based Models**\n   - Prediction-based models started gaining traction. The work of Kim et al. (2014) was seminal in employing prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts. They used incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS). [10]\n\n5. **2014: Word Embeddings with Incremental Updates**\n   - The use of word embeddings with incremental updates became prominent. This allowed for more dynamic and accurate modeling of semantic changes over time. [10]\n\n6. **2015: Models Alignment**\n   - The alignment of models across different time periods became a focus area. This was crucial for comparing word vectors across time spans and understanding the evolution of word meanings. [2]\n\n7. **2016: NYT Corpus and COHA Corpus**\n   - The use of the NYT (New York Times) corpus and the COHA (Corpus of Historical American English) corpus became prevalent. These corpora provided rich data sources for tracing subtle semantic shifts. Researchers like Hamilton et al. (2016a) used these corpora to analyze semantic changes.

It does not directly address the impact of specific features.\n\n[2] One design decision in SPECTER is to use a set of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective. The fifth row of Table 2 shows that this is important—using only easy negatives reduces performance on all tasks. While there could be other potential ways to include hard negatives in the model, our simple approach of including citations of citations is effective. The sixth row of the table shows that using a strong general-domain language model (BERT-Large) instead of SciBERT in SPECTER reduces performance considerably. This is reasonable because unlike BERT-Large, SciBERT is pretrained on scientific text.\n\n[3] We emphasize that our citation-based pretraining objective is critical for the performance of SPECTER; removing this and using a vanilla SciBERT results in decreased performance on all tasks.\n\n[4] Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SCIDOCS, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.\n\n[5] Comparison with Task Specific Fine-Tuning: This quote discusses the comparison between SPECTER and task-specific fine-tuning of SciBERT.

This tool is essential for medical mission planning, as it enables planners to move beyond anecdotal, rule-of-thumb planning estimates into a repeatable, organized, and robust estimating method. The PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk. These tables exist within casualty categories of wounded in action, nonbattle injuries, disease, and outpatient visits for a given combat or noncombat scenario throughout the range of military operations (ROMO). ROMO is defined for this effort to include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities, and various combat operations. The military medical planning community, until now, lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating PCOFs, which are necessary to develop the patient streams used in health care simulations. Using an accredited PCOF tool, planners can employ baselined, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission. This will help inform decision makers on the types of patient conditions to expect, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of medical planning and response in military operations. ![The PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk.](image6)"}

This alignment is crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. [2]\n   - Image 6 shows the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, with microtubules attached to the kinetochores, ensuring that each chromosome is properly aligned.\n\n2. **Chromosomes Structure**:\n   - Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, which are identical copies of the chromosome that are joined at the centromere. [1]\n   - Image 3 illustrates the structure of a duplicated chromosome, showing the sister chromatids and the centromere.\n\n3. **Crossing Over**:\n   - Non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over, which occurs during prophase I. This genetic recombination increases genetic diversity. [1]\n   - Image 6 also highlights the sites of crossing over, indicating where genetic material has been exchanged between homologous chromosomes.\n\n4. **Spindle Formation**:\n   - The mitotic spindle, composed of microtubules, forms and attaches to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. This spindle is essential for moving the chromosomes during cell division. [6]\n   - Image 6 shows the spindle fibers attached to the kinetochores, ready to separate the homologous chromosomes.\n\n5. **Centromere and Kinetochore**:\n   - The centromere is the region where the sister chromatids are joined, and the kinetochore is the protein structure on the centromere that attaches to the spindle fibers. [3]\n   - Image 6 clearly depicts the centromere and kinetochore, emphasizing their role in chromosome movement.\n\n6. **Preparation for Separation**:\n   - The chromosomes are now fully aligned and attached to the spindle fibers, preparing for the separation of homologous chromosomes in Anaphase I.

This is shown in ![Chromosome Duplication](image3), where the duplicated chromosomes are visible.\n\n3. **Cell Elongation**:\n   - The cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies separate further. This step is depicted in ![Cell Elongation](image5), where the cell is shown elongating with the chromosomes moving apart.\n\n4. **Plasma Membrane Inward Growth**:\n   - The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cell.

This process is crucial for the re-establishment of the nucleus in each daughter cell. The chromosomes start to decondense, returning to their less compact state, and the nucleolus reappears, as indicated in text quote [11].\n\nCytokinesis, which often overlaps with telophase as mentioned in text quote [8], involves the division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, this is achieved through the formation of a cleavage furrow, which is a constricting ring of microfilaments that pinches the cell in two, as depicted in image6. The contracting ring of microfilaments pulls the cell membrane inward, eventually separating the cell into two daughter cells.\n\nIn plant cells, cytokinesis occurs differently. A cell plate forms in the middle of the cell from vesicles containing cell wall material, as described in text quote [10]. This cell plate grows outward to reach the edges of the cell, effectively dividing the contents into two cells, as illustrated in image4.\n\nIn summary, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear envelope reforms, chromosomes decondense, the nucleolus reappears, and the cytoplasm divides, resulting in the formation of two daughter cells."}

This strategy is typically applied during the inception phase of a project, as illustrated in image6. The goal is to gather high-level requirements and ensure that the project aligns with the stakeholders' needs and the enterprise's direction. Key activities in 'Needs Exploration' include:\n\n- **Active Stakeholder Participation**: Engaging stakeholders directly to gather their input and ensure that their needs are understood and documented. This is highlighted in image2, where active stakeholder participation is a key component of the 'Needs Exploration' phase.\n- **High-Level Requirements Specification**: Defining the broad requirements of the project without delving into detailed specifications. This helps in setting the initial direction and scope of the project.\n- **Look-Ahead Modeling**: Creating preliminary models to visualize the potential solutions and gather feedback from stakeholders. This is depicted in image7, where 'Look-ahead modeling' is a part of the 'Needs Exploration' strategy.\n\n### Elicitation Methods\n'Elicitation Methods' are techniques used to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. These methods are applied during the construction phase and are designed to address changing stakeholder needs, as shown in image4. Key activities in 'Elicitation Methods' include:\n\n- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Model Storming**: Quickly creating models to address immediate needs and gather feedback. This is a flexible and iterative approach that allows for rapid adjustments based on stakeholder input.\n- **All-Hands Demos**: Conducting demonstrations of the work in progress to gather feedback and ensure that the solution meets the stakeholders' expectations. This is highlighted in image2, where 'All-hands demos' are a part of the 'Elicitation Methods'.\n- **Iteration Demos**: Regularly demonstrating the progress of the project to stakeholders to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. This ensures that the project remains aligned with the stakeholders' evolving needs.\n\n### Comparison\nWhile 'Needs Exploration' is focused on the initial gathering and definition of high-level requirements, 'Elicitation Methods' are more about the ongoing and detailed gathering of requirements throughout the project.

This process is depicted in the diagram labeled **MEIOSIS I: Homologous chromosomes separate** [image5]. During this stage, homologous chromosomes, which are pairs of chromosomes that carry the same genes, are separated from each other. This separation occurs during **anaphase I**, where the homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. The result of meiosis I is the formation of two haploid cells, each containing a single set of chromosomes.\n\nIn contrast, **meiosis II** involves the separation of sister chromatids. This is illustrated in the diagram labeled **MEIOSIS II: Sister chromatids separate** [image6]. During **anaphase II**, the sister chromatids, which are identical copies of a chromosome that are attached at the centromere, are separated and pulled to opposite poles of the cell. The result of meiosis II is the formation of four haploid cells, each with a unique combination of chromosomes.\n\nThe key difference between meiosis I and meiosis II is that meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids. This distinction is crucial for understanding the genetic diversity that arises from meiosis, as the separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I leads to the independent assortment of chromosomes, while the separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II ensures that each resulting cell has a complete set of chromosomes.\n\nIn summary, meiosis I and meiosis II differ in terms of chromosome separation and cell division, with meiosis I focusing on the separation of homologous chromosomes and meiosis II focusing on the separation of sister chromatids. This process ultimately results in the production of four genetically diverse haploid cells."}

In standard consumption economics, focusing on variety is often considered beneficial because it helps avoid the negative effects of diminishing marginal utility. As shown in the table from image1, the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, eventually becoming negative. This illustrates the typical pattern where the enjoyment from consuming more of the same item diminishes over time.\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the dynamics can be quite different. Image1 also shows a scenario where the utility from consuming hot dogs in a competitive setting, such as a hot dog eating contest, can actually increase significantly at certain points. For example, the utility jumps from -50 to +5000 when the 64th hot dog is consumed, indicating a substantial positive outcome, such as winning a prize or achieving a personal best. This suggests that in competitive situations, the focus and motivation to achieve a specific goal can override the typical diminishing marginal utility, leading to increased utility from continued consumption.\n\nIn summary, while standard consumption economics emphasizes the importance of variety to avoid diminishing marginal utility, competitive contexts can create scenarios where focused effort and achievement of specific goals can lead to increased utility, even as consumption increases. This highlights the importance of context in understanding how utility is derived from consumption."}

It showcases how people in the countryside outside Bergen lived, linking objects and the living cultural heritage of textiles and costumes, weaving, and local building customs. The museum provides a glimpse into the rural life and traditions of the region, offering visitors a chance to understand the cultural practices and historical context of the area. The museum's focus on textiles and costumes highlights the importance of these crafts in the local community and their role in preserving cultural heritage.\n\nOn the other hand, the Textile Industry Museum, as mentioned in [1], is a local history museum for Ytre Arna, where the industrialization of Western Norway began in 1846. The museum is housed in the same building as the Oleana textile factory, which was the biggest textile factory in Norway in the 1950s. The museum offers insights into the industrial history and the development of the local community, combined with a visit to the Oleana textile factory. This museum provides a unique perspective on the industrialization process in Norway and its impact on the local community. The focus on the textile industry highlights the economic and social changes that occurred during this period and the role of the textile industry in shaping the region's history.\n\nIn conclusion, both museums offer valuable insights into the historical and cultural significance of their respective regions. The Osterøy Museum focuses on the rural life and traditions of the countryside outside Bergen, while the Textile Industry Museum highlights the industrialization process and its impact on the local community in Ytre Arna.
