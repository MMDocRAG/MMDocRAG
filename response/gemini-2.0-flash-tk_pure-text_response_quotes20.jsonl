However, it has been criticized for not adequately considering neighborhood context in development [8].  Rezoning initiatives, especially since 2002 under Mayor Bloomberg, have become a key tool for city planning, moving away from solely developer-led proposals [4]. These rezonings are classified into upzoning, downzoning, and contextual-only rezoning, based on changes to residential development capacity [3]. Upzoning increases capacity by at least 10%, while downzoning decreases it to less than 90% of the original, and contextual-only rezoning makes changes without significantly altering capacity [3].\n\nThe impact of rezoning can be seen in various socioeconomic aspects and development patterns. Areas with upzoned lots experienced similar levels of new construction as the city average, while downzoned areas saw less, and contextual-only areas saw much higher development rates ![Contextual-only rezoned lots are associated with high rates of development.](image2) [2].  This suggests upzoning might be proactively guiding market growth, potentially into areas with underutilized infrastructure or planned upgrades [2].  However, it's also possible that market disinterest might persist despite upzoning efforts [2].\n\nTo understand the broader impact, census tract data is analyzed, using 2000 census boundaries to estimate socioeconomic characteristics in rezoned areas [1]. This analysis weights tracts by the number of rezoned lots to accurately reflect the characteristics of these areas [1]. For example, a tract with 10 upzoned lots is weighted ten times in calculations [1]. This method helps in comparing the characteristics of neighborhoods affected by different types of rezoning with the city's baseline median tract ![Bar chart showing median racial/ethnic demographics in NYC census tracts, categorized by rezoning type.](image1) [1].\n\nThe sum of the number of cars in the figures on page 2 and the number of bars in the figures on page 4 is 24."}

Conservative Republicans notably stand out as the only major group where a majority supports greater scrutiny of Muslims [3, 12].\n\n![This bar chart illustrates that a majority of people think Muslims should not be subject to additional scrutiny due to their religion, though this varies across demographics.](image5)\n\nIn fact, while nearly half of Republicans are inclined to support greater scrutiny, clear majorities of both Independents and Democrats oppose this idea [9].  Specifically, liberal Democrats are particularly firm in their rejection of increased scrutiny for Muslims, with an overwhelming majority holding this view [5].  This partisan divide is evident when considering that conservative Republicans are the only political or ideological group where a majority favors greater scrutiny [12].

Similarly, non-white individuals, including Black and Hispanic respondents, are more inclined than whites to reject the idea of scrutiny of Muslims based on their religion [4].

Seniors with higher education attainment and income levels demonstrate much greater adoption rates for internet and broadband services compared to their counterparts with lower education and income [9].  For instance, a considerable disparity exists in internet usage depending on educational background and income.  ![This table illustrates the percentage of seniors online and with broadband, segmented by age, education, and income, highlighting the impact of these factors on technology adoption.](image3)  Specifically, 87% of seniors who are college graduates use the internet, and 76% have broadband at home, while only 40% of seniors with a high school education or less go online, and a mere 27% have broadband [8].  Similarly, income plays a crucial role, with 90% of seniors earning $75,000 or more annually using the internet, and 82% having broadband, compared to just 39% of those earning less than $30,000 going online and 25% having broadband [8].\n\nThis pattern extends to mobile technology as well.

Individuals with higher educational attainment are considerably more inclined to regard technology as a positive force that enriches their work experience and opens up avenues for career growth [1, 6].  The difference in perception based on education is clearly illustrated in ![This bar chart compares the views of workers with different education levels and shows that college graduates are more likely to perceive technology as enhancing job interest and career advancement compared to those with less education.](image5). Conversely, those without a college education are less likely to hold such favorable views regarding current workforce technologies [11]. Workers with a high school diploma or less are less prone to believe that technology has made their jobs more engaging or improved their career prospects [11].  Workers with some college education but no four-year degree tend to fall between these two groups in their attitudes towards technology [9].\n\nSpecific technologies also play a crucial role in shaping these perceptions. Commonly used workplace technologies, such as word processing software, smartphones, and email, are generally seen as having a beneficial impact [8, 10].  For example, a large percentage of workers view word processing and spreadsheet software as having a positive influence, as shown in ![This bar chart details the perceived impact of different technologies, demonstrating that word processing software is seen positively by 70% of workers.](image6).  Despite the overall positive view of these technologies, this positive sentiment is more pronounced among workers with college degrees [8].\n\nUltimately, education level and specific technologies significantly shape workers' perceptions of their job's interest and career advancement opportunities, with higher education correlating with more positive views and specific technologies like word processing and smartphones generally being perceived favorably, particularly among the more educated workforce."}

Here, GCC registers 63 against Non-GCC's 62, pointing to potentially different employment dynamics or perceptions within these nations.  The pervasive nature of concern about rising living costs is further emphasized when examining individual countries, where the majority express being \"very concerned\" [image3].  This widespread high level of concern is also visible across different countries and regions when considering the rising cost of living as a key issue [image4].  Over time, the trend of rising cost of living has consistently been a top concern, even surpassing unemployment in some years [image8].  This longitudinal view underscores the enduring and escalating nature of financial pressures faced by the youth in the Middle East.  Therefore, while both GCC and Non-GCC countries share significant worries about rising living costs and unemployment, subtle variations exist, reflecting diverse economic realities and priorities across the region."}

Despite this expansion, the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) was generally on a declining trend [5]. This decrease in ARPU was influenced by several factors, notably the intense price competition [7] and the shift in user communication habits towards data-based Instant Messaging and VoIP services, leading to reduced usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [2, 9].  This trend is visually represented in ![Line graph depicting the decreasing trend of Voice and SMS ARPU from 2013 to 2017](image2), and the historical decline in prepaid ARPU from 2008 to 2012 ![Bar chart comparing prepaid ARPU for different telecom companies in 2008 and 2012, showing a general decrease](image1).

This overall ARPU decline until around 2015 is further substantiated by the expectation that data users would eventually adopt larger data plans, aiming to counterbalance the diminishing revenues from voice and SMS services [5].  This shift is largely attributed to the increasing preference for data-driven applications such as Instant Messaging and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which consequently led to a reduced reliance on traditional SMS and voice calls [4]. Therefore, the reduced usage of SMS and voice services directly contributed to the observed decrease in ARPU [7].\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, both Telkomsel and XL likely saw a decrease in overall ARPU, accompanied by a rise in smartphone users and data consumption, influenced by the growing adoption of data-based communication methods."}

This is visually depicted in the initial graphs where random selection, marked in grey, either matches or surpasses the performance of active querying strategies in the early stages of learning, particularly at lower image budgets [image1].  The issue arises because many active learning strategies suffer from biased queries, failing to select a diverse set of labels representative of the overall data distribution [12]. For instance, certain strategies might over-select data from majority classes while neglecting minority ones, as observed in the class distribution analysis [3, 12, 7]. To counteract this, employing label diversity in querying strategies becomes crucial, enhancing both performance and robustness [1, 5]. Visualizations of data maps, stratified by pseudo-labels, offer a way to identify and select data that is either easy or hard to contrast, mitigating the cold start problem by ensuring a more balanced and diverse initial dataset selection [image2, image6, image8]. These data maps help in moving beyond simple random sampling by incorporating structured data selection right from the beginning [image2, image6].  The effectiveness of \"hard-to-contrast\" querying strategies in achieving better performance across various datasets further supports this approach [3, 9, image3].\n\nFour figures besides the first one convey similar messages."}

With an increasing number of knowledge elements removed—from zero (gold standard) to three—there is a clear downward trend in precision, recall, and F1-score. For instance, when no knowledge is removed, recall is at 57.1, but it drops to 20.4 when three knowledge elements are removed [2].

As shown in the line graph, when the model is evaluated on its ability to identify missing knowledge, precision and F1-score actually show an upward trend as more knowledge is removed.  This is because the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting allows the model to explicitly indicate when knowledge is absent from the provided knowledge graph [3]. In this scenario, recall remains relatively stable, suggesting a consistent capability to identify absent knowledge to a certain extent, while precision in identifying truly absent knowledge improves [10].\n\n![The line graph demonstrates that in a 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, precision and F1-score increase with the removal of knowledge elements, reflecting improved accuracy in identifying absent knowledge.](image1)\n\nFurthermore, retrieval accuracy plays a crucial role.  Experiments simulating varying retrieval accuracies show that as retrieval accuracy drops, all metrics—precision, recall, F1-score, and even correctness—exhibit downward trends [7].  Specifically, the impact on recall is more pronounced than on precision when retrieval accuracy suffers [1]. This indicates that while the model can somewhat filter out incorrect knowledge, its ability to cite relevant knowledge significantly diminishes when the initial retrieval quality is poor [1]. The most substantial drop in recall occurs between perfect retrieval (ground truth) and 80% accuracy [1].\n\n![This graph shows how precision, recall, and F1-score decrease as retrieval accuracy diminishes, emphasizing the critical role of accurate knowledge retrieval for citation quality.](image7)\n\nIn summary, the removal of knowledge elements generally degrades citation precision and recall, reflecting a challenge in maintaining quality citations with less information.

Although both logical constraints and post-processing reduce logical inconsistency, logical constraints appear to offer a more balanced approach by improving both consistency and performance, whereas post-processing, while ensuring zero inconsistency, may potentially compromise the quality of the generated content [1, 12].\n\nIn conclusion, both logical constraints and post-processing are effective in reducing logical inconsistency in LLMs, but logical constraints tend to offer a better balance between consistency and overall performance compared to post-processing."}

These results underscore the broad applicability and effectiveness of Step-Back prompting in enhancing accuracy across diverse knowledge-based tasks [8].\n\nFurthermore, error analysis reveals that Step-Back prompting not only improves overall accuracy but also effectively corrects errors made by baseline models.  Compared to baseline PaLM-2L predictions, Step-Back prompting can rectify $39.9\\%$ of incorrect predictions, while introducing only $5.6\\%$ new errors [6]. This indicates a substantial net benefit in prediction accuracy.  In tasks like high-school physics problem-solving on the MMLU dataset, error analysis pinpoints 'Reasoning Error' as the most frequent error type when using Step-Back prompting, but also shows that Step-Back prompting corrects a significant portion of baseline errors. ![Error distribution and error classes for Step-Back prompting in high-school physics problems](image6).  Even when retrieval augmentation (RAG) is used, Step-Back prompting continues to fix a notable $21.6\\%$ of RAG-induced errors, with a relatively low error introduction rate of $6.3\\%$ [6]. This is further illustrated in error analysis on TimeQA, where 'Reasoning Error' and 'RAG' are identified as dominant error sources, but Step-Back still contributes positively by reducing overall errors. ![Error types and their proportions observed in Step-Back prompting on TimeQA](image7).\n\nIn contrast to Chain-of-Thought prompting, which focuses on generating a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, Step-Back prompting excels by abstracting the problem to a higher level, leading to more accurate solutions, as exemplified in problems like the Ideal Gas Law and questions about Estella Leopold’s education history. ![Comparison of Chain-of-Thought and Step-Back prompting methods with examples demonstrating Step-Back's structured and accurate approach](image3).  While methods like CoT and TDB do not consistently show significant improvements across tasks like SituatedQA and TimeQA, Step-Back prompting, especially when combined with RAG, consistently delivers substantial gains [10, 3].  Moreover, Step-Back prompting maintains robust performance even with varying numbers of examples, demonstrating sample efficiency in learning abstraction skills, as indicated by stable accuracy across different few-shot settings. ![Accuracy stability of Step-Back prompting across varying number of shots in few-shot learning](image1).\n\nIn summary, the Step-Back prompting method significantly enhances task performance across various benchmarks by promoting abstraction and improving error correction compared to baseline models and other prompting techniques like CoT and TDB."}

The '+negative' augmentation method, using negative training examples as templates, results in a dataset with a skewed distribution of 21% positive and 79% negative examples [5].  The table visually summarizes the performance changes under '+ Positive', '+ Negative', and '- Negative' conditions, showing how these augmentations impact BERT model outcomes across different configurations ![Performance changes with data augmentation techniques](image2).\n\nExperiments on the paraphrase identification dataset QQP further illustrate these effects; synthetic training sets with varying positive-negative ratios were constructed to observe how imbalance degrees affect model performance [12].

This is also evident in evaluations across MultiWOZ datasets where DS-Picklist consistently shows a higher accuracy [7]. DS-DST is designed to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots, categorizing time and number-related slots as non-categorical, whereas DS-Picklist operates under the assumption of a full ontology, treating all slots as categorical [4, 5].\n\nThe improved accuracy in DS-DST and DS-Picklist, especially over DS-Span, is particularly noticeable in specific slot categories. Slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` experience significant gains because their values are often diverse and not easily extracted directly from the dialogue context, making prediction from candidate-value lists more effective [3].  This is highlighted in error analyses, showing that DS-DST and DS-Picklist substantially reduce errors for slots such as `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` ![Top-10 slots with highest ratio of unfound ground-truth values by DS-Span](image5).

Ultimately, DS-Picklist tends to exhibit higher joint and slot accuracy given a full ontology, but DS-DST provides a strong, more practically applicable method by efficiently handling different slot types and achieving competitive performance gains over span-based methods.

This is because DS-Picklist leverages the ontology to refine predictions, leading to enhanced accuracy [2].  While DS-Picklist shows a performance edge, it's important to note that obtaining a complete ontology in real-world scenarios can be challenging [6].

These models are also compared against other BERT-based methods, where DS-Span already shows significant improvement over SpanPtr, COMMER, and DSTreader, highlighting the effectiveness of BERT in this context [2].\n\nTo understand these differences further, consider the architecture of DS-DST, which utilizes two BERT models to process candidate values and dialog contexts, employing cosine similarity matching for predictions  ![Schematic of DS-DST model architecture, showing fixed and fine-tuned BERT models connected by cosine similarity.](image1).  When comparing slot-level accuracy, we observe that DS-DST and DS-Picklist significantly improve upon DS-Span for specific slot types such as hotel-type, attraction-type, hotel-internet, and hotel-parking [12]. These are often categorical slots where values are not explicitly mentioned in the dialog context, making span extraction less effective for DS-Span [3, 10].

In relation extraction on the same SciERC dataset, the improvement is even more pronounced, with SciIE achieving a $13.1\\%$ relative improvement over E2E Rel [6].\n\nFurthermore, when assessed on the SemEval 17 dataset, SciIE surpasses previous models, particularly in span identification. This suggests a strength in accurately delineating entity boundaries [7].  The comparative performance in span identification, keyphrase extraction, and relation extraction against models like Luan 2017 and the best SemEval system is summarized in ![SciIE shows improved performance over Luan 2017 and Best SemEval models across span identification, keyphrase extraction, and relation extraction on SemEval 17 dataset](image4).  The effectiveness of SciIE is largely attributed to its unified multi-task learning approach. By sharing span representations and leveraging cross-sentence information, SciIE effectively enhances performance across entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution simultaneously [10]. The advantage of this multitask approach over single-task configurations is further highlighted in ![SciIE demonstrates better overall performance compared to single-task configurations across entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference tasks](image1), where SciIE consistently achieves higher scores.\n\nIn summary, the SciIE model demonstrates improved precision, recall, and F1 score across several NLP tasks compared to other models, primarily due to its effective multitask learning strategy which leverages shared span representations and cross-sentence context."}

This is visually supported by the trend shown in ![Average GLUE score increases with more pretraining data.](image7), where the average GLUE score rises with increasing amounts of Common Crawl data.\n\nThe structure of the pretraining data also plays a crucial role. Corpora retaining paragraph structure, like Common Crawl, are more effective than datasets consisting of individual sentences, such as News Crawl [3, 10].  Training examples with multiple sentences are particularly advantageous for tasks involving sentence pairs, evident in the 14-point accuracy difference on RTE between models trained on News Crawl versus Common Crawl [3]. In terms of modeling approaches, the cloze-driven training regime, which predicts center words using both left and right context, proves more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately [2, 4, 12].

The idea is that by having similar vector spaces, the NMT model can learn more effectively, especially when a single encoder is used for multiple source languages [2]. Indeed, studies have shown that aligning word embeddings can lead to increased BLEU scores, indicating improved translation quality [2]. For instance, in scenarios involving languages like Galician, Portuguese, Azerbaijani, Turkish, Belarusian, and Russian, the application of aligned embeddings often results in the highest metric scores, surpassing standard and preprocessed methods, suggesting a positive impact of alignment on translation performance ![Alignment can improve BLEU scores in some cases](image2).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of word embedding alignment is not universally positive across all translation tasks. Some findings indicate that the alignment of word embeddings might not always be beneficial for training, with instances showing insignificant gains or even slight losses in BLEU scores across different language pairs [7].  For example, when comparing aligned and unaligned embeddings for translation tasks such as Galician to English, Portuguese to English, and Turkish to English, the BLEU scores for aligned embeddings are sometimes lower than those for unaligned embeddings, demonstrating that alignment does not guarantee improvement and can occasionally lead to a decrease in performance ![Alignment does not always improve BLEU scores and can sometimes decrease them](image3).  Despite these mixed results in bilingual scenarios, it's noted that *a priori* alignment might be more advantageous in multilingual training settings [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of word embedding alignment on BLEU scores is not consistently positive; while it can enhance translation quality in certain contexts, particularly in multilingual scenarios, it is not always beneficial and can sometimes lead to marginal decreases in performance, especially in bilingual translation tasks."}

This is reflected in evaluations showing that pre-trained embeddings lead to increased BLEU scores [8]. The degree of accuracy gain, however, is not uniform across all language pairs.  Interestingly, languages with initially lower translation quality often experience more substantial improvements from pre-training.  For example, when translating into Portuguese, Russian and Hebrew, which are linguistically distant, exhibit larger accuracy gains compared to more similar languages like French and Italian [1]. This phenomenon can be attributed to these systems having greater potential for improvement due to their lower starting performance levels [1].\n\n![The table shows datasets translated to Portuguese, categorized by language family, with performance improvements from pre-training.](image1)\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training also depends on the initial quality of the translation system. Gains are typically highest when the baseline system achieves a moderate level of performance, suggesting that a system needs to be somewhat functional for pre-training to be most beneficial [4].  Furthermore, the amount of available training data plays a critical role. Pre-training proves particularly advantageous when the training dataset is small, as demonstrated by the diminishing gains in BLEU scores as training set size increases [image2].\n\n![The line graphs compare BLEU scores with and without pre-training across different training set sizes, showing pre-training's benefit is greater with smaller datasets.](image2)\n\nIn multilingual translation scenarios, language similarity becomes an important factor.  Pairs of languages that are more linguistically similar tend to benefit more from pre-training [11].  For instance, language pairs like Galician and Portuguese, which are highly similar, show the largest improvements when pre-trained embeddings are applied [11, 10].  Qualitative analysis further supports these quantitative findings.  In translations from Galician to English, pre-training not only aids in capturing rarer vocabulary but also results in grammatically superior sentences, successfully translating names and multi-word phrases that baseline systems struggle with [6, 7].  This improvement is especially noticeable for words that are less frequent in the training data [7].\n\n![The bar chart compares F-measure scores for standard and pre-trained models across different word frequencies, showing pre-training improves performance particularly for low-frequency words.](image4)\n\nUltimately, pre-trained embeddings are most effective within a \"sweet spot\": where training data is limited, but sufficient to train a basic system, and especially for translation between similar languages [12].\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training boosts translation accuracy, especially for low-resource and similar language pairs, with the most pronounced benefits observed when training data is limited but adequate for initial model training."}

However, in bilingual translation systems, the benefit of a priori alignment of embeddings is not consistently observed, with findings suggesting it may not be necessary or significantly advantageous [6, 11].

Furthermore, when relation types are disregarded, and all nodes are connected without distinction, the model achieves only marginal improvements over using ELMo in isolation [1]. This implies that a simplistic graph structure lacking informative relations is inadequate for substantial gains. `![Performance without relation types](image4)`  The table data reveals that ‘No relation types’ yields performance levels comparable to ‘No R-GCN’, emphasizing the necessity of constructing graphs with meaningful relationships.  In examining specific relation types, it becomes evident that document-based connections (DOC-BASED) are more influential than exact match (MATCH) or coreference (COREF) connections [7]. Eliminating document-based connections deprives the model of crucial contextual information derived from the co-occurrence of mentions within the same document. `![Performance impact of removing specific relation types](image4)`  As demonstrated in the table, removing DOC-BASED connections results in a more pronounced performance decrease, whereas the impact of removing MATCH or COREF is less substantial.\n\nIn summary, removing components like R-GCN, relation types, or specific relation types generally impairs model performance in both unmasked and masked conditions, with R-GCN and document-based relations having a more significant impact."}

Interestingly, while coreference edges are integrated into the model, their impact appears to be somewhat marginal.  It's suggested that simpler heuristics like exact match already capture many coreference instances, and the external coreference system used might not be entirely reliable, potentially leading to performance degradation in harder test sets when coreference is included [8].  In masked settings, coreference resolution becomes less critical because mentions of the same entity are consistently labeled with a unique identifier, simplifying entity recognition even without explicit coreference resolution [5].\n\nHowever, examining the performance metrics of Entity-GCN models with and without coreference reveals nuanced effects.  For instance, on the development set, the Entity-GCN single model achieves an accuracy of 65.3% with coreference, compared to 64.8% without coreference in unmasked settings, and 70.5% vs 65.3% in masked settings respectively, indicating a slight advantage in both scenarios when coreference is included in development set. Conversely, on the test set, the single Entity-GCN model shows a slight decrease in performance with coreference (66.4%) compared to without (67.6%) in unmasked conditions, suggesting that the benefits of coreference can be context-dependent and may not always generalize to harder datasets ![Table comparing Entity-GCN performance with and without coreference](image8).

Further analysis into relation-based performance, as depicted in the relation performance table ![relation-based performance metrics](image6), reveals that accuracy and precision vary greatly depending on the relation type queried. For instance, relations like 'member_of_political_party' exhibit high accuracy, while 'place_of_birth' and 'place_of_death' show much lower accuracy, aligning with observations that questions about places are inherently more challenging for the model [3].

These propagation layers iteratively refine entity and relation predictions by leveraging contextual information within the text [image7]. Ablation studies reveal that while coreference propagation is particularly beneficial for entity extraction, relation propagation significantly boosts both entity and relation extraction performance [3, 4].  Specifically, removing coreference propagation (-CorefProp) slightly decreases entity extraction F1 score from 68.2 to 68.0, while removing relation propagation (-RelProp) causes a more noticeable drop to 67.5 [image1].  Interestingly, coreference propagation may sometimes hinder relation extraction, as seen in ACE05 [4], where removing CorefProp leads to a better relation extraction F1 score [image4].  Relation propagation, conversely, consistently improves both tasks, especially in sentences with multiple entities and relations [9, 4].\n\nOptimizing the number of propagation iterations is crucial; experiments show that for coreference propagation in entity extraction, the best performance is achieved at the second iteration (N=2) [2, image8].  This suggests that iterative refinement up to a certain point enhances the model's ability to capture complex dependencies, after which further iterations may not yield additional improvements [2].

Coreference propagation, for instance, is particularly beneficial for entity extraction, achieving optimal performance around the second iteration [12].  However, its effect can vary; while it aids entity extraction, it may not always enhance relation extraction and, in some cases, might even slightly impede it, as observed on the ACE05 dataset [11].  Conversely, relation propagation consistently benefits both entity and relation extraction, especially in scenarios with sentences containing multiple relation instances across different entities [11].  This is further illustrated in relation to the number of entities in a sentence, where relation propagation becomes more critical as sentence complexity increases, although DyGIE generally maintains better performance even without relation propagation as the number of entities grows. ![DyGIE outperforms DyGIE-RelProp across all categories as the number of entities in the sentence increases, showing relation propagation attempts to address performance decline but not as effectively as DyGIE without it.](image2) Ablation studies further confirm these observations, where removing coreference propagation or relation propagation leads to a decrease in performance for their respective primary tasks [6].

However, its impact on entity F1 is smaller compared to relation propagation [5].  Relation propagation, or RelProp, significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in domains like ACE05 and SciERC, especially in sentences with multiple relation instances [8, 9].

Coreference propagation addresses this issue, as demonstrated by DyGIE's $6.6\\%$ improvement in pronoun performance, confirming the hypothesis that coreference significantly aids in pronoun entity categorization [3]. The impact of coreference propagation is further highlighted when comparing DyGIE with its variant that excludes coreference propagation.  ![DyGIE achieves higher F1 scores for entity recognition compared to DyGIE without CorefProp](image2).

These datasets are in the news and biomed domains respectively, and have coreference annotations available ![ACE04-O and GENIA have coreference annotations, while ACE05-O does not.](image6).  However, the SciERC dataset presents a different scenario. In SciERC, pronouns are uniformly labeled with a \"Generic\" label, which explains why coreference propagation does not significantly impact entity extraction performance on this dataset [8].  Despite variations across datasets, DyGIE consistently achieves state-of-the-art results in overlapping entity extraction on datasets like ACE04-O and ACE05-O, improving the state of the art by $11.6\\%$ and $11.3\\%$ respectively [9].  Across various datasets including ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, DyGIE demonstrates superior Entity F1 scores compared to other models [image5].

This is further substantiated by performance metrics that show a marked difference in translation accuracy between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles; MT systems generally exhibit higher accuracy when translating stereotypical roles [11].

This notable rise in operating income was largely attributed to factors such as reduced legal settlements and lower impairments, although this was partially offset by unfavorable gross margin and decreased sales [6].\n\nHowever, when examining core operating income, a different picture emerges.  The data reveals that core operating income for Sandoz in 2021 was USD 2,064 million, which represents a 12% decrease in USD and a 14% decrease in constant currencies compared to 2020, where it was USD 2,334 million.

This decline in core operating income occurred despite an overall improved financial performance for the company which was driven by growth brands [2], and a general increase in core operating income from continuing operations across the company [3]. The discrepancy between the increase in operating income and the decrease in core operating income for Sandoz suggests that the adjustments made to arrive at core operating income, as mentioned in text quote [12], had a more pronounced negative impact on the Sandoz segment specifically.

The fluctuations in receivables are connected to broader economic factors and portfolio quality.

The net income, along with adjustments like foreign currency translation and stock-based compensation, ultimately impacts the retained earnings and thus the total stockholders' equity, while transactions like acquisitions and dividends directly affect noncontrolling interests ![The table appears to be a financial summary or earnings report showcasing multiple financial figures or metrics over three different fiscal years: August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020.](image3).\n\nIn summary, the increase in total stockholders' equity and the decrease in noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 are reflected in Costco's comprehensive income statements and are primarily driven by net income, stock transactions, and strategic acquisitions impacting ownership structure."}

These rates are established based on the yields of high-quality corporate bonds, or government bonds when corporate bond yields are insufficient [4].  While direct comparative figures for compensation increase and pension progression between Germany and the US are not detailed in the provided data, pension progression for Germany is documented at 1.5% for both 2021 and 2020 [image8].  Fluctuations in these actuarial assumptions and financial indicators, particularly the discount rate, can significantly influence the defined benefit obligation and the funded status of pension plans [5].  In summary, there are clear differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators between Germany and the United States concerning defined benefit plans, especially in demographic projection models and discount rates."}

Overall, there was a significant downturn as the adjusted profit before tax was substantially lower, marking a 74% decrease compared to 2019 [1]. This was largely driven by the repercussions of the Covid-19 outbreak, which led to increased adjusted ECL and a decline in adjusted revenue [1, 9].  However, not all segments mirrored this negative trend; Global Banking and Markets (GBM) notably increased its adjusted revenue, fueled by a robust performance in Global Markets [8]. This strong showing in GBM also translated to a higher adjusted profit before tax compared to the previous year [5].  In contrast, other segments faced headwinds. Revenue in ‘Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other’ diminished due to the impact of lower interest rates on capital income, coupled with reduced revenue from Insurance, Investments, and Markets products [6]. Similarly, Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) saw a revenue decrease, attributed to diminished lending balances and fees, particularly in key regions like Hong Kong and the UK, reflecting the Covid-19 induced slump in global trade [7]. Global Banking also experienced a revenue contraction, primarily from reduced fee income and losses in specific portfolios, although there was growth in capital markets revenue and corporate lending net interest income [12].  Thus, while certain segments like GBM demonstrated resilience and even growth, the overarching financial outcome for the banking group was considerably hampered by widespread revenue reductions and elevated credit loss provisions in response to the challenging economic conditions of 2020 [1, 9].  Ultimately, the adjusted profit before tax in 2020 was significantly lower than in 2019 across the banking group, though individual segment performances varied."}

Commercial loans saw an increase, while consumer loans experienced a decrease compared to 2020 [8].  Specifically, commercial loans reached $513,120 million in 2021 from $478,417 million in 2020, whereas consumer loans declined to $382,274 million from $409,220 million over the same period, resulting in a total loan portfolio of $895,394 million in 2021 and $887,637 million in 2020 ![Total loans increased from 2020 to 2021.](image4). This overall change represents an increase of $7,757 million in total loans [image4]. The rise in commercial loans was primarily due to increased demand, leading to more originations and loan draws, especially in the commercial and industrial sector [8].  Conversely, the reduction in consumer loans, particularly in residential mortgages, was largely attributed to loan paydowns influenced by the low-interest-rate environment and the strategic transfer of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [8].\n\nSimultaneously, total deposits also increased from 2020 [7].  Looking at the deposit composition, noninterest-bearing demand deposits saw a significant rise of 13%, reaching $527,748 million in 2021, and interest-bearing demand deposits increased by 4% to $465,887 million ![Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.](image3).

This shift in deposit types may reflect strategic actions to manage assets, possibly in response to regulatory asset caps, leading to a reduction in time deposits and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits [10]. Despite decreases in certain categories, the overall deposit balance increased by 6%, reaching $1,482,479 million in 2021 from $1,404,381 million in 2020 [image3]. In summary, while total loans and deposits both saw increases, the composition within these categories shifted, indicating active management and adaptation to economic conditions and possibly regulatory constraints.

Within GBM, however, there was a mixed performance; revenue in Global Banking experienced a decrease of 2%, primarily due to reduced income from real estate and structured finance fees, coupled with losses from legacy corporate restructuring positions, although capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending did see growth [7].  A significant change in 2020 involved the allocation of certain costs and revenues previously held in the Corporate Centre. Funding costs initially retained in the Corporate Centre during 2019 were redistributed to global businesses starting from January 1, 2020 [6]. Furthermore, revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, funding costs associated with HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina, which were previously accounted for in the Corporate Centre, were also allocated to the global businesses to more accurately reflect their financial activities [9].

Overall, GBM showed resilience while Corporate Centre underwent significant changes in how costs and revenues were allocated to provide a clearer view of global business performance.\n\nIn 2020, Global Banking and Markets showed revenue growth, while Corporate Centre's financial presentation changed due to cost and revenue reallocation to business segments."}

This improvement was underpinned by a 10% rise in net cash provided by operating activities, climbing to $10,613 million in 2020 from $9,649 million in 2019 [image6], driven by factors such as reduced net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions [7].  ![Free cash flow increased by 15% in 2020 compared to 2019.](image6)\n\nDespite the growth in operating cash flow, PepsiCo's investment activities in 2020 significantly increased, utilizing $11.6 billion in cash, primarily due to major acquisitions like Rockstar, Pioneer Foods, and Be & Cheery, alongside capital spending [9].  In contrast, 2019 saw a smaller amount of $6.4 billion used for investing activities [8].  Financing activities in 2020 provided $3.8 billion, largely from long-term debt issuances, which was partly offset by shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases [12].

On the Sky front, revenue increased by $9.1\\%$ to $20.3$ billion [7], with growth in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, though content revenue decreased [7].  Despite the overall revenue increase, Sky experienced a decrease in revenue from content, and fluctuations due to changes in sports programming rights, particularly in Italy, impacted customer relationships and revenue in specific regions [2, 11].

This decline is further corroborated by the decrease in after-tax earnings from insurance investment income [1].  ![Net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021](image7) This reduction in net investment income is largely attributed to a significant decrease in interest and other investment income, which plummeted from $\\S1,059$ million in 2020 to $\\S589$ million in 2021 [image7]. According to the text, this was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities as a result of prevailing low interest rates [4].\n\nConversely, dividend income saw a slight increase, rising from $\\S4,890$ million in 2020 to $\\S5,060$ million in 2021 [image7].

This shift towards increased cash and equity holdings, coupled with reduced fixed maturity securities, suggests a strategic realignment of assets. The company's emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield in short-term investments, as mentioned in [4], likely contributed to the increased cash holdings. The rise in equity securities could be aimed at seeking higher returns, although it also introduces greater volatility to earnings due to market fluctuations [7].\n\nThe implication of these changes is that while the company has fortified its liquid assets, the overall investment income has decreased, primarily due to lower returns from interest-sensitive investments in a low-interest-rate environment. The increased allocation to equity securities might offer potential for higher returns but also exposes the portfolio to greater market risk and earnings volatility.\n\nIn summary, net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021, accompanied by a shift in asset composition towards more cash and equity securities and less fixed maturity securities, reflecting a strategy focused on liquidity and safety in a low-interest-rate environment."}

As the price of crude oil is a critical factor for upstream profitability [9], the fluctuations in prices, as depicted by the trends in WTI and Brent Crude Oil prices from 2019 to 2021, are relevant to understanding these financial shifts ![Quarterly average spot prices of WTI Crude Oil, Brent Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021, showing price recovery in 2021](image1).\n\nSimilarly, downstream operations also experienced a positive trend, though with some variations. U.S. downstream operations improved from a profit of $\\$1,559$ million in 2019 and a loss of $\\$(571)$ million in 2020 to a profit of $\\$2,389$ million in 2021 [image3].  International downstream operations, however, showed a slightly different pattern, with earnings of \\$922 million in 2019, \\$618 million in 2020, and \\$525 million in 2021 [image3]. Although international downstream earnings decreased slightly over these years [8], the overall downstream segment still contributed positively to the company's financial results, especially with the strong recovery in the U.S. downstream sector driven by higher margins on refined product sales [7].\n\nThe combined improvements in both upstream and downstream operations significantly boosted Chevron's overall net income.  The company's net income attributable to Chevron Corporation dramatically increased from \\$2,924 million in 2019 and a loss of $\\$(5,543)$ million in 2020 to a substantial profit of \\$15,625 million in 2021 [image3, image4]. This net income trend reflects the strong recovery and improved profitability across Chevron's major operating areas, particularly in the upstream segment, which is most sensitive to crude oil prices and a major determinant of the company's earnings [9].\n\nIn summary, Chevron's financial performance improved significantly from 2019 to 2021, primarily due to the recovery of upstream and downstream operations from losses or lower earnings in previous years, leading to a substantial increase in overall net income."}

This overall decrease in average loan balances partially counteracted the increase in net interest income that was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds [12].  The decline in net interest income by 3 percent versus the prior year was largely attributed to decreased net interest yields because of higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [2].  Despite a 21 percent increase in Card Member loans, this growth was less than the billed business growth due to these higher paydown rates, further explaining the pressure on net interest income [10].  Despite these shifts in loan dynamics and net interest income, the company's total revenues net of interest expense still increased by 17 percent year-over-year, indicating robust growth in non-interest revenue lines [2].  This growth was significantly propelled by a 26 percent year-over-year increase in discount revenue, the largest revenue line, which was fueled by increased Card Member spending [2].  Furthermore, net card fees also contributed positively, growing by 9 percent, particularly due to the expansion of premium card portfolios [1].

Rural Development Projects, on the other hand, were almost exclusively executed through implementing agencies, suggesting a strategy of leveraging specialized expertise and local networks for sustainable rural development. This distinction in implementation underscores the adaptive and targeted nature of CSR spending, aligning project execution with the specific demands of crisis response versus long-term development.\n\nIn conclusion, while both COVID Relief and Rural Development Projects received significant CSR investment, COVID Relief projects tended to be larger in scale and focused on immediate crisis response, often implemented through agencies across wider geographical areas, whereas Rural Development Projects were more geographically localized, consistently agency-implemented, and aimed at long-term sustainable development in specific rural regions."}

This downturn was accompanied by an increase in cost per tonne from US\\$67.59 to US\\$81.81, emphasizing the combined pressure of reduced revenue and increased costs on profitability ![Comparison of financial and operational performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC, illustrating revenue and EBITDA declines for Queensland Coal](image8).  Conversely, nickel experienced a positive price impact; the average realized sales price for nickel increased to US\\$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 from US\\$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 [6]. This price surge, driven by strong end-use demand and supply disruptions, contributed to an increase in Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West by US\\$296 million, reaching US\\$259 million in FY2021 [9].  The sensitivity of BHP's financials to commodity price changes is quantified; for every US\\$1 per tonne decline in iron ore price, the estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation is US\\$163 million, while a US\\$1 per barrel decline in oil price would impact profit by US\\$24 million [4]. A table explicitly outlines these impacts across various commodities, showing that a US$1 per ton increase in energy coal price affects profit after taxation by US\\$9 million, and a US¢1 per pound increase in nickel price impacts profit after taxation by US\\$1 million ![Table showing the financial impact of commodity price changes on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA](image5).  These figures underscore the direct and quantifiable relationship between commodity price fluctuations and BHP's financial performance.\n\nChanges in commodity prices significantly impact BHP's financial results, with lower coal prices decreasing EBITDA and higher nickel prices increasing it, driven by factors like market demand, supply disruptions, and operational costs."}

Despite the slight increase in long-term debt and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt), the company is actively pursuing a debt reduction strategy, as evidenced by an overall decrease in total debt by $1,361 million from 2019 [3].  ![Total company debt decreased from 2019 to 2020](image7).  This is further reinforced by the company's statement of intent to continue deleveraging and aiming for a single A credit rating, leveraging its strong cash flows [5].  The reduction in debt is even more pronounced when considering the period since June 2019, with a decrease of $11.5 billion [5].  Notably, Global Financing debt saw a significant decrease of $3,560 million, contrasting with an increase of $2,199 million in Non-Global Financing debt [9, 8].  This shift might reflect a strategic refocusing of the Global Financing business and a broader initiative to optimize capital structure [10]. The company's financial strategy in 2020 appears to balance controlled growth in noncurrent assets and liabilities with a clear priority on reducing overall debt and enhancing financial flexibility."}

At the end of 2019, the total ACL stood at $590 million, which then rose to $1,231 million by the end of 2020 ![ACL increased significantly from 2019 to 2020.](image5). This significant change is further detailed, showing the breakdown between ACL for loans and lending commitments, with loans accounting for $835 million and lending commitments at $396 million in 2020 ![Table detailing the changes in ACL and contributing factors.](image5).  One notable adjustment was the effect of adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard, which initially reduced the ACL by $41 million [5]. However, this was more than offset by a provision for credit losses amounting to $762 million, reflecting a significant increase in anticipated credit losses [2, 6, 7, 11].\n\nExamining the components of this change, gross charge-offs amounted to $105 million, while recoveries were $8 million, resulting in net charge-offs of $97 million ![Table detailing the changes in ACL and contributing factors.](image5).  These charge-offs were primarily associated with Commercial real estate and Corporate loans within the Institutional Securities business segment [2]. The economic impact of COVID-19 played a crucial role, leading to increased provisions for credit losses across the Institutional Securities business segment [2, 11]. This was due to actual and anticipated shifts in asset quality trends, coupled with uncertainties in sector outlooks because of the pandemic [2].\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of CECL at the beginning of 2020 led to an initial increase of $131 million in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly impacting employee loans [5].  In contrast, the ACL for loans was $297 million and for lending commitments was $236 million at the close of 2019, totaling $533 million ![Table showing ACL for loans and lending commitments in 2019 and 2020 by categories.](image2).

This change is partly reflected in the fluctuations within retained earnings, which decreased from $11,881 million to $11,495 million over the same period [image3]. This decrease in retained earnings could be influenced by several factors, including net income, dividends, and accounting principle changes as presented in the statement of changes in equity ![shows changes in shareholders' equity components over several years](image5). While net income contributes positively to retained earnings, other factors such as cash dividends and share repurchases can offset these gains [image5].\n\nFurthermore, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) plays a significant role in shareholders' equity. In 2021, the total AOCI was $(2,945) million, a slight decrease from $(2,895) million in 2020 [image3].  AOCI includes items like net unrealized debt securities gains and losses, foreign currency translation adjustments, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits.  Notably, foreign currency translation adjustments, which arise from translating foreign subsidiaries' financial statements into U.S. dollars, are a component of AOCI [9].

One significant fact is the **increasing world population**, which is doubling every 35 to 40 years [7].  This population growth exacerbates another critical challenge, which is the **increasing energy demand** [image1], as more people require more resources and energy for their daily lives and development.  Coupled with this rising demand is the issue of **limited energy supplies** [image1], particularly finite resources like crude oil, whose availability is shown to be decreasing over time [image3]. Finally, the **environmental effects of energy use** [image1] pose a major global challenge; the greenhouse effect, intensified by pollutants from human activities such as driving and manufacturing [9], leads to global warming and associated problems like rising sea levels and potential mass flooding [11],  and also contributes to health issues such as respiratory problems and lung diseases [2, 4].

Initially, the population dramatically increased in the late 1800s [1]. This surge, evident from a mere 130 residents in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890, was spurred by the transformation of Nebraska through the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act [5]. These acts facilitated westward expansion and converted Nebraska into a thriving agricultural region [5].\n\n![Population of Hamilton County from 1870 to 2000](image2)\n\nThe rapid population growth was also associated with the arrival of diverse groups of settlers, including those from Missouri, Iowa, and European countries like Germany and Sweden, who established distinct ethnic communities throughout the county [2, 7]. These communities often centered around religious institutions, such as the Zion Lutheran Church, reflecting the cultural fabric of the settlements [4].\n\n![St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg, a focal point for the Danish community](image5)\n\nHowever, after the peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population started a gradual decline [1]. This decrease mirrors broader trends in the Midwest and Great Plains, where many small towns reached their population zenith between 1900 and 1940 [9].  The shift is attributed to evolving agricultural practices, particularly the mechanization of farming, leading to farm consolidation and a reduction in the number of farms [6].

For instance, Galician to English translation shows substantial gains with pre-training, highlighting its effectiveness in bootstrapping translation models when data is limited  [2, image3].\n\nInterestingly, the effectiveness of pre-training seems tied to the initial performance of the translation system.  Pre-training is most beneficial when the baseline BLEU score is in a moderate range; systems that are already performing well or are extremely poor may not see as much improvement [11, 9].  Furthermore, the similarity between the source and target languages influences the degree of benefit from pre-training. Language pairs that are more similar tend to exhibit larger gains [10],  and aligning embedding spaces of similar languages can further boost BLEU scores in multilingual systems [10, image2, image4].\n\nThe impact of pre-training also varies with the size of the training dataset.  The advantages of pre-training are more pronounced when the training data is smaller, and these benefits tend to diminish as the dataset size increases, indicating that pre-training is particularly valuable when data is scarce [image7].\n\n![BLEU scores for GL-EN show large gains with pre-training](image3)\n\n![Language pairs with higher similarity show larger BLEU score gains from pre-training](image2)\n\n![Alignment affects BLEU scores differently for various language pairs](image4)\n\n![BLEU score gains from pre-training are higher with smaller training datasets](image7)\n\nPre-training enhances BLEU scores, with the extent of improvement depending on factors like language resource availability, baseline translation quality, language similarity, and training data size."}

This is partly because the questions can sometimes be answered without needing to consider all the provided paragraphs, especially when weak distractors are present [12]. However, the performance of single-hop models diminishes in open-domain settings [5, 10].  Standard TF-IDF retrieval methods often fail to retrieve the necessary gold paragraphs, hindering the model’s ability to answer questions effectively [1, 5, 11].\n\n![F1 score increases significantly when gold paragraphs are added in the open-domain setting](image4)\n\nThe table demonstrates a clear trend: F1 scores are notably lower in open-domain settings compared to distractor settings, but the inclusion of gold paragraphs in open-domain retrieval significantly boosts the F1 score [image4]. For instance, in open-domain with 500 paragraphs, the F1 score is 39.12, which jumps to 53.12 when gold paragraphs are added [image4].  This highlights that the retrieval of relevant evidence, such as gold paragraphs, is crucial for achieving higher accuracy in question answering, particularly in multi-hop scenarios.  Even with a large set of 500 distractor paragraphs, the F1 score remains lower than in the distractor setting, indicating that simply increasing the number of distractors is not sufficient to overcome the challenges of open-domain question answering if the relevant paragraphs are not retrieved [11].\n\n![Comparison of F1 scores between Distractor and Open settings across different models](image7)\n\nAs illustrated in the table comparing different models, the F1 scores in the open setting are consistently lower than in the distractor setting across various models [image7].

The substantial improvement in F1 score upon adding gold paragraphs demonstrates that access to relevant evidence is a primary factor influencing model performance in multi-hop question answering.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of gold paragraphs significantly improves F1 scores, while the presence of distractors, especially if poorly chosen or insufficient, can negatively impact the performance of multi-hop question answering models, emphasizing the critical role of evidence retrieval quality in model accuracy."}

This approach leverages the strengths of both character-level details and word-level semantics to achieve robust performance.  The model first processes characters through bidirectional LSTMs to capture morphological nuances and then elevates this representation to the word level, further refining contextual understanding [image2].\n\nThe components labeled 'Word LSTM-F' and 'Word LSTM-B' in this architecture are integral for processing word sequences within a sentence.

However, for extremely low-resource languages, the effect is more pronounced, with gains ranging from very small to very large, suggesting pre-training is crucial for bootstrapping models in such conditions [2].\n\nInterestingly, the effectiveness of pre-training isn't uniform across all baseline system performances.  It appears most effective when the baseline system is moderately effective, specifically when the baseline BLEU score is in the range of 3-4 [4]. This indicates that a certain level of initial translation capability is needed for pre-training to significantly enhance the model [4].  In scenarios with very low baseline BLEU scores, there might be larger room for improvement, but this improvement is not always realized through pre-training alone, and might be influenced by language similarity [3].  For instance, translation pairs with more similar languages might see smaller gains compared to pairs with very different languages when using pre-training, if the initial system performance is already relatively high [3].\n\nWhen pre-trained embeddings are applied and aligned across source languages in multilingual NMT, the gains in BLEU scores tend to be related to the similarity of the languages. Language pairs like Galician/Portuguese (GL/PT), which are more similar, show larger gains compared to less similar pairs like Belarusian/Russian (BE/RU) [6]. This is because aligning embeddings of similar languages in a shared vector space simplifies the learning process for a single encoder [6].\n\nQualitative analysis reveals that pre-training not only helps in capturing rarer vocabulary but also improves the grammatical correctness of generated sentences [5].  This is particularly evident in low-resource language pairs where pre-training assists the model in better representing less frequent concepts [5]. Further analysis into n-gram generation shows that pre-training is helpful for both low-frequency words and function words, indicating a broad improvement across different word types [8].\n\nLooking at the quantitative impact, pre-training improves translation accuracy across the vocabulary, but especially for words that are less frequent in the training data. ![Pre-training particularly improves translation accuracy for low-frequency words](image5).  However, examining the effect of alignment on translation scores, we can observe that aligning word embeddings does not always lead to improvements in BLEU scores across all datasets.  In fact, for the GL → EN dataset, there was a decrease in BLEU score after alignment. ![GL → EN dataset experienced a decrease of 1.3 in BLEU score after alignment](image8).\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training word embeddings generally enhances NMT performance, particularly for low-resource languages and infrequent words, but the benefits can be influenced by factors like baseline system quality, language similarity, and alignment strategies. The GL→EN dataset experienced the largest decrease in BLEU score after alignment."}

Initially, in the Problem Formulation stage, a large language model (LLM) is prompted to convert the problem, presented in natural language, into a task-specific symbolic language [2]. This crucial step involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules within the problem statement to create a structured symbolic representation [12].  For instance, consider a problem about Netflix shows and popularity, where conditions are given about Karen's viewing habits [image3]. The Problem Formulator module would translate this natural language problem into symbolic predicates and premises, like `Popular(stranger_things)` and `watches(Karen, stranger_things) :- Popular(stranger_things)` [image3].\n\nFollowing the formulation, the Symbolic Reasoning stage takes over, employing a deterministic symbolic solver to process the symbolic representation [2]. This solver, which could be a logic programming engine or a first-order logic prover, executes logical inference on the formulated problem to derive a symbolically represented answer [2, image5].  Different types of logical reasoning problems, such as deductive reasoning or constraint satisfaction problems, necessitate different symbolic formulations and solvers, like Pyke for deductive reasoning or python-constraint for constraint satisfaction [5, image6].\n\nFinally, the Result Interpreter module comes into play, translating the symbolic answer back into natural language, providing a human-readable solution to the original problem [2, 12].  For example, in the Netflix problem, after symbolic reasoning, the solver might conclude that \"Black Mirror is not popular,\" and the Result Interpreter would present this conclusion as the answer, like option (B) False [image3]. This modular approach allows LOGIC-LM to leverage the strengths of both LLMs for understanding natural language and symbolic solvers for reliable reasoning, effectively shifting the burden from LLMs \"solving the problem step-by-step\" to \"representing the problem in symbolic language\" [2, 9].\n\nIn summary, the LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first translating it into a symbolic form using an LLM, then employing a symbolic solver for reasoning, and finally interpreting the symbolic result back into natural language."}

This cropping focuses the model on individual objects within bounding boxes, resizing them to a consistent proportion before embedding [8].  Such manipulation is vital because object detection datasets often contain multiple objects of varying sizes and positions, unlike image classification where objects are typically central and prominent [8]. Furthermore, employing a blurring technique on areas surrounding the objects of interest directs the Multi-modal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) attention to the relevant objects, facilitating their identification [8]. This pre-processing is not just about object detection; even for region-level recognition, techniques like blurring and adaptive crop scales are employed to improve classification accuracy by maintaining context while highlighting the foreground object [7]. Ultimately, pre-processing steps, such as cropping and blurring, are essential for adapting models pre-trained on full images to region-level recognition, significantly improving the system's ability to align regions with textual class descriptions in zero-shot object recognition tasks [3, 7].

The development of \"Prediction-based models\" in 2013 and the use of \"Word embeddings\" like \"word2vec\" in 2014 [10] revolutionized the field by providing more effective tools for tracing semantic shifts.  By 2015, \"Models alignment\" became a focus, and the use of corpora like \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" in 2016 [8] expanded the resources available for analysis.  2017 saw insights into the \"Laws of semantic change\", considerations that \"Local measures are better for cultural shifts\", and the use of the \"Gigaword corpus\" [8], alongside explorations of \"Diachronic relations\", \"Criticism of semantic change laws\", and \"Joint learning across time spans\". These milestones highlight the evolution of methodologies and resources used to study how word meanings change over time.\n\nKey milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include advancements in models, corpora usage, and theoretical insights."}

To effectively measure these contributions, a structured approach using metrics and analytics is essential [2, 8]. Dashboards, like the Leads Dashboard, offer a detailed view of lead sources and their progression through the sales funnel, tracking metrics from total leads to won opportunities [image1]. This allows for the identification of high-performing sources and areas needing improvement.  Analyzing conversion rates at each stage of the funnel is crucial; industry averages suggest a 45-75% conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) [image7].\n\nHowever, real-world data can significantly deviate from these averages. For example, one dataset indicates a much lower MQL to SAL conversion rate of just 1.50% [image4]. This stark contrast suggests a potential bottleneck in the lead handoff process between marketing and sales in this specific instance. Possible reasons for such a low conversion rate could include overly strict sales acceptance criteria, misalignment between marketing's lead qualification and sales' expectations, or issues with lead quality from marketing. Optimizing this handoff is vital because efficient lead progression through stages like MQL to SAL is a key aspect of overall revenue performance management [1, 3, 5].\n\nIn conclusion, the observed MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50% is substantially lower than the industry average of 45-75%, highlighting a significant performance gap that warrants investigation into the lead qualification and sales acceptance processes to identify and address potential inefficiencies."}

These laws describe how our minds group visual elements. For example, the principle of proximity suggests we perceive objects close to each other as belonging to a group [1].\n\n![The word \"GESTALT\" demonstrates various Gestalt principles through its letter design.](image2)\n\nAs illustrated, the design of the word \"GESTALT\" ingeniously embodies several of these principles.  'Proximity' is shown in the letter 'E' which uses closely grouped rectangles to create unity. 'Closure' is demonstrated by the 'GE' combination, where we perceive a complete shape even though parts are missing. 'Similarity' is evident in 'TA', which share a striped pattern, causing us to group them together [10].  Furthermore, 'Continuity' is represented by the flowing contour of the 'S' [3]. These principles, among others, guide our visual perception and are cleverly incorporated into the word's design to illustrate the core concepts of Gestalt psychology [5, 9, 12].\n\nThe design of the word \"GESTALT\" visually manifests Gestalt psychology principles through the manipulation of letter forms to represent concepts like proximity, closure, similarity, and continuity."}

At its core, Gestalt theory posits that when the mind perceives a form, the whole entity possesses a reality that is distinct from its individual components [3]. This perspective is visually represented by the principles that make up the word \"GESTALT\" itself, showcasing concepts such as proximity, closure, and similarity ![The word GESTALT depicted using Gestalt principles like Proximity, Closure, Similarity, Continuity, Segregation, Prägnanz, and Unity.](image7). For example, the principle of proximity suggests that elements that are visually close tend to be seen as part of a group [4], while similarity leads us to group objects with similar shapes and colors together [11].  Continuity suggests we group elements that form regular, simple, and orderly patterns [7, 10], and closure explains our tendency to perceive incomplete objects as whole by filling in missing visual gaps [8]. These laws highlight how our minds naturally organize and simplify visual information, eliminating complexity to observe reality in its simplest form [10].  This is evident in how we perceive patterns in arrangements like grids of circles and dots ![A grid of circles forming a checkerboard pattern.](image6), ![A table of dots arranged in rows and columns.](image3), where we see groupings and wholes rather than just individual elements. This meaning-making process implies a global regularity that our perception prioritizes [12], integrating elements into perceptual wholes [1]. Ultimately, Gestalt psychology is the study of how our minds organize and interpret visual information by grouping elements into meaningful wholes based on principles of perceptual organization."}

This is because concentrating solely on one choice in standard consumption can be unfavorable [6]. For instance, as depicted in ![Diminishing utility from each hot dog as consumption increases](image8), the utility derived from each subsequent hot dog diminishes, eventually turning negative, reflecting a typical consumption pattern.  We can envision an initial positive experience, like ![A child enjoying a hot dog](image4), but this enjoyment wanes with continued consumption.\n\nHowever, in competitive scenarios, the concept of diminishing marginal utility takes on a different dimension. Focus becomes a valuable asset, and its accumulated impact can be advantageous [9].  Dedicated practice, as visualized in ![Accumulated practice hours of violinists over time](image6), leads to enhanced skills and improved results, which can, in turn, increase utility from the activity [11]. This contrasts with standard consumption, where excessive focus might be seen as detrimental.  Indeed, the significance of focus in achieving mastery is a key question to consider ![Questioning the importance of focus for mastery](image2).  Consider the illustration of hot dog consumption in a competitive eating context ![Diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome in hot dog consumption, illustrating a competitive eating context](image1), where despite the likely diminishing utility from each hot dog consumed, the focus on quantity can lead to a \"differential outcome\"—a significantly elevated utility, such as winning a championship.\n\nThus, while diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption drives a preference for variety, in competitive contexts, focused practice and striving for mastery can redefine this concept, potentially leading to increased utility through improved skills and outcomes, even in scenarios like hot dog consumption."}

This cycle is broadly divided into two major stages [5, 12]. The first stage, known as interphase, is characterized by the duplication of cellular contents, a period of significant growth and preparation for cell division [2]. Interphase itself is further subdivided into distinct phases: G₁, where the cell grows and increases its cytoplasm; S phase, critical for the duplication of chromosomes; and G₂, during which the cell continues to grow and prepares for the upcoming division [2].\n\nFollowing interphase, the cell enters the mitotic phase, the stage of actual division [4]. This phase comprises two key processes: mitosis, the division of the nucleus ensuring each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes, and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, ultimately resulting in two separate daughter cells [4].\n\n![Diagram of the cell cycle with Interphase and Mitotic Phase, detailing sub-phases like G1, S, G2, Mitosis, and Cytokinesis](image1)\n\nThis cyclical progression, from interphase to the mitotic phase, ensures the accurate duplication and distribution of cellular components, leading to the formation of new cells [11].  As visualized, interphase sets the stage for division, followed by the dramatic events of mitosis and cytokinesis in the mitotic phase, completing the cycle [image1].\n\n![Stages of cell division illustrating Interphase, Prophase, and Prometaphase, showing chromosome condensation and spindle formation](image6)\n\nIn summary, the cell cycle is primarily composed of interphase, which includes G1, S, and G2 phases, and the mitotic phase, encompassing mitosis and cytokinesis [2]."}

Following reporting, the next step in this value chain is analysis, where deeper insights are derived from the data and information.  This analysis phase is key to understanding \"why\" something is happening, moving beyond just \"what\" is happening as described in reporting [3].  Ultimately, this analysis leads to actionable steps and decisions, driving value from the initial data.
