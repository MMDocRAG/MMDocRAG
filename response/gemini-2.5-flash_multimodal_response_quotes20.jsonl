Those with a four-year college degree also show a preference for the Democrat (53% vs. 40%) [8]. Voters without a college degree are more divided in their preferences [8]. This distribution of party preference by education and other demographics is detailed [!['All registered voters' party preference breakdown by demographic groups including education and party affiliation.]()(image3)].\n\nUnsurprisingly, political affiliation is the most powerful determinant of party preference [!['All registered voters' party preference breakdown by demographic groups including education and party affiliation.]()(image3)]. Among Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters, 90% prefer the Republican Party candidate compared to 5% for the Democrat [!['All registered voters' party preference breakdown by demographic groups including education and party affiliation.]()(image3)]. Conversely, Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters show overwhelming support for the Democratic Party candidate (92% vs. 4% Republican) [!['All registered voters' party preference breakdown by demographic groups including education and party affiliation.]()(image3)].\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards for political parties vary significantly by education level and political affiliation, while party preferences are strongly linked to both education and political affiliation."}

For the first time, more Americans rate the government's performance negatively (52%) than positively (46%), representing a substantial 26-point drop in positive ratings since earlier in the year [4]. This decline in ratings is noted as an across-the-board phenomenon [7]. The trends over the past decade and a half show fluctuating support for government anti-terror efforts, with a notable decline across all major political affiliations in 2015. ![Positive ratings of government anti-terror efforts by party affiliation from 2001 to 2015 show a sharp decline for all groups in 2015.](image1)\n\nReflecting a shift in public sentiment, a majority of Americans are now more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) than that they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%) [8].

Nearly three-in-ten Americans (29%) now cite terrorism, national security, or ISIS as the most important problem facing the country, a significant increase from just 4% a year prior, reaching the highest level since February 2003 [10].

Four-in-ten (41%) Republicans cite these issues, compared to fewer Democrats (23%) [9]. This partisan difference is stark when looking at specific problems; for instance, 24% of Republicans list terrorism as the most important problem, versus 16% of Democrats [image7 is a table showing partisan differences in citing various issues as the most important problem, including Terrorism, Defense/National security, and ISIS/War in Iraq/Syria, and Economy]. Conversely, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to cite partisan gridlock and division as a top problem [8].\n\nRegarding economic issues (general economy), Democrats (6%) and Republicans (7%) cite it as the most important problem at similar, relatively low rates compared to terrorism [image7 is a table showing partisan differences in citing various issues as the most important problem, including Terrorism, Defense/National security, and ISIS/War in Iraq/Syria, and Economy].

Education level also plays a role; Americans with higher levels of education are more likely to think the country's global influence will recede [10]. This can be seen in the data, where 45% of postgraduates believe U.S. influence will be less, compared to only 21% of those with a high school education or less.\n\n![A bar chart shows how views on future U.S. influence differ by education level and political party, indicating Democrats and those with higher education are more likely to expect less influence.](image1)\n\nRegarding the European Union, majorities among both Republicans and Democrats believe its international influence will remain unaffected by the coronavirus outbreak [3]. While there is a difference, it is less pronounced than for the U.S. or China, with 57% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans expecting the EU's influence to be about the same [Image 8].\n\n![A bar chart shows views on future EU influence broken down by political party, indicating majorities in both parties expect influence to remain about the same.](image8)\n\nFor China, opinions also diverge along partisan lines.

Although the growth rate of smartphone adoption among seniors has been relatively modest since 2011 (from 11% to 18%) [5], the overall trend for internet and broadband adoption shows a clear upward trajectory, even if still trailing the pace of adoption among the general adult population [image4].\n\nDevice ownership, particularly of smartphones, and online activity levels are lower among seniors than the general adult population, but internet adoption among seniors has increased significantly over the past several years."}

Roughly one-quarter of seniors use online social networks [9]. This translates to 27% of the total older adult population using social networking sites such as Facebook [1].

While views on fairness and effectiveness often align, there are notable exceptions, which seem to influence public acceptance and indicate levels of trust.\n\nThe survey evaluated opinions on four specific automated systems: automated personal finance scores, automated video analysis of job interviews, automated resume screening of job applicants, and automated scoring of people up for parole [12].\n\nPerceptions of effectiveness are somewhat split across these systems [9]. For instance, a majority, 54% of Americans, believe the personal finance score algorithm would be effective at identifying good customers [8], [9]. Similarly, about half think algorithms for parole rating (49%) and resume screening (47%) would be effective [9]. The automated video job interview analysis receives the lowest effectiveness rating, with only 39% believing it would be a good way to identify successful hires [9].\n\n![Chart showing effectiveness and fairness percentages for four automated systems.](image8)\n\nHowever, perceptions of fairness are considerably lower for some systems and do not always correlate with effectiveness views [1]. Notably, only around one-third of Americans think the video job interview (33%) and personal finance score (32%) algorithms would be fair to job applicants and consumers, respectively [2], [4]. This contrasts with the criminal risk score algorithm, which about half (50%) of Americans consider fair to those up for parole [8]. The automated resume screening algorithm is viewed as fair by 43% of Americans.\n\n![Bar chart showing public perceptions of fairness for four types of automated scoring systems, indicating the automated personal finance score and video analysis of job interviews are viewed as least fair.](image3)\n\nThe personal finance score system stands out as a significant exception where the perceived effectiveness (54%) is much higher than the perceived fairness (32%) [1], [11]. This 22-percentage point difference is the largest among the four scenarios [11]. While the automated criminal risk score is seen as less effective than the personal finance score (49% vs 54%), it is viewed as substantially fairer (50% vs 32%) [8].\n\nThis divergence between perceived fairness and effectiveness, coupled with low overall fairness ratings for several systems, appears to strongly influence public acceptance. A majority of the public finds the use of the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable (68%), and a similarly high share (67%) finds the computer-aided video job analysis algorithm unacceptable [2]. The automated resume screening (57% unacceptable) and criminal risk assessment (56% unacceptable) are also met with majority opposition [2].\n\n![Bar chart showing public acceptability ratings for four types of automated systems, with the personal finance score and automated video analysis having the lowest rates of acceptability.](image2)\n\nBroad public concern about the fairness of these algorithmic decision-making processes contributes to this skepticism [5]. Reasons cited for opposing these systems include concerns about their inherent unfairness [7], the removal of the human element from important decisions [7], and the systems' inability to capture the nuance and complexity of individual human situations [6], [7]. Specifically for automated personal finance scores, concerns about privacy and the system not representing a person accurately or being discriminatory are major reasons for finding it unacceptable [6].\n\n![Reasons cited for not accepting automated personal finance scores, with concerns about privacy and unfairness being prominent.](image6)\n\nDifferences in the public's perception of fairness versus effectiveness, especially for systems like personal finance scoring, highlight areas of significant public skepticism and imply lower trust in systems perceived as effective but unfair."}

The historical data shows that while both parties' perceptions fluctuate, Republicans have generally held more positive views on job availability than Democrats, and the gap has widened under the Trump administration, reaching its highest point in the displayed data in 2019.\n\nPerceptions of job availability differ significantly by political affiliation, with Republicans holding more positive views than Democrats, a gap that has generally widened over time as positive perceptions have increased, particularly for Republicans."}

For instance, \"Mobile, Tablets & Accessories\" accounts for 35% of GMV but only 9% of transactions, suggesting a high average order value (AOV). Conversely, categories like \"Books\" represent a smaller 7% of GMV but a much larger 21% of transactions, indicating a low AOV but high volume of purchases. \"Fashion, Footwear & Accessories\" stands out with high shares in both metrics (28% GMV, 35% Transactions).\n\nThis disparity between transaction volume and GMV share across categories has direct implications for gross margin contributions and overall profitability, especially as there is a strategic shift from focusing solely on GMV to prioritizing profitability [1]. Categories with high transaction volume but low AOV (like Books, Home Decor, Babycare, and Health & Personal Care) likely have different cost structures and potentially tighter margins per item compared to high-AOV categories like Mobile/Electronics or Jewellery. Managing profitability for these high-volume, low-AOV categories necessitates efficient operations, particularly in logistics [12].\n\nThese category differences significantly impact the e-commerce two-sided business model `![This diagram illustrates the two-sided e-commerce business model connecting supply (warehouse, logistics) and demand (consumers via platform) with critical success factors like selection and experience.]()` (image5). On the demand side, consumers expect an \"ALL TO ALL EXPERIENCE\" [10] and access across various channels `![This image depicts various channels like web, mobile, tablet, social media, and physical stores suggesting an omnichannel experience.]()` (image1). The varied category performance shows diverse consumer needs, with high transaction volume categories indicating frequent, smaller purchases, while high GMV categories point to less frequent but higher-value acquisitions. Providing a \"Widest Selection\" `![This diagram illustrates the two-sided e-commerce business model connecting supply (warehouse, logistics) and demand (consumers via platform) with critical success factors like selection and experience.]()` (image5) requires managing inventory and fulfillment for this diverse mix. On the supply side, the operational challenges vary greatly. Handling high volumes of low-value items requires optimized, low-cost per-transaction logistics, while high-value items may require enhanced security or specialized handling. Logistics efficiency is a critical success factor `![This diagram illustrates the two-sided e-commerce business model connecting supply (warehouse, logistics) and demand (consumers via platform) with critical success factors like selection and experience.]()` (image5) and an area for entrepreneurial opportunity [12] to make the ecosystem robust.

For WikiHop, BiDAF achieves 42.9% (54.5% masked) accuracy in the standard setting and significantly improves to 57.9% (81.2% masked) in the gold chain setting. FastQA shows lower performance on WikiHop, with 25.7% (35.8% masked) standard accuracy and 44.5% (65.3% masked) gold chain accuracy [Image 3]. On MedHop, BiDAF's standard accuracy is 47.8% (33.7% masked), jumping to 86.4% (99.3% masked) in the gold chain setting. FastQA's performance on MedHop is 23.1% (31.3% masked) standard and 54.6% (51.8% masked) gold chain [Image 3]. The substantial performance increase in the gold chain scenario for both models, particularly for BiDAF, indicates that a significant challenge for these models lies in selecting relevant information from a larger set of documents [4, 9].\n\nBiDAF performs better than FastQA on both WikiHop and MedHop datasets under both standard and gold chain conditions."}

Experiments show that removing spatial positional encodings entirely leads to a significant drop in AP [6]. Passing spatial positional encodings at every attention layer results in better performance compared to passing them only at the input [6]. Both fixed sine and learned spatial encodings passed to attention layers yield similar results [6], [8]. Output positional encodings are required and cannot be removed [6].\n\n![Table showing AP results for various positional encoding configurations](image3)\n\nThe table above illustrates the impact of different spatial and output positional encoding strategies on AP and AP50. The baseline, using fixed sine spatial encodings passed at every attention layer in both encoder and decoder, and learned output positional encodings at every decoder attention layer, achieves the highest AP of 40.6. Not using spatial positional encodings at all results in a substantial 7.8 AP drop, achieving only 32.8 AP [8].\n\nRegarding loss components, ablation analysis shows their influence on performance [7]. The set-based loss in DETR, which matches predictions to ground truth objects, eliminates the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) [11]. While NMS can improve performance in early decoder layers where the model might make duplicate predictions, its benefit diminishes with deeper layers, and it can even slightly reduce AP at the final layers by removing correct detections [11].\n\n![Plot showing AP and AP50 improvement across decoder layers, with and without NMS](image4)\n\nThe plot shows how AP and AP50 improve with each successive decoder layer, highlighting the multi-layer refinement process. It also shows that applying NMS at the last decoder layer leads to a slight drop in AP compared to not using NMS, confirming that DETR's set-based loss handles duplicates effectively in later stages [11]. Additionally, the choice of bounding box loss, such as using a combination of $\\ell_1$ loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss, also affects AP, with using both leading to better results than using only $\\ell_1$ loss.\n\n![Table comparing AP results using different loss components](image7)\n\nThe table indicates that using both $\\ell_1$ and GIoU loss components results in a higher AP (40.6) compared to using only $\\ell_1$ loss (35.8 AP) or only $\\ell_1$ and GIoU for the loss but not as a training objective (39.9 AP).\n\nDifferent configurations of positional encodings, particularly how and where spatial encodings are applied, and the choice of loss components (like using both $\\ell_1$ and GIoU loss) significantly impact the Average Precision in DETR-DC5."}

Other reasons involve values not matching or the operation type being wrong [image6]. These highlight the challenge of precisely interpreting and calculating information from tables and claims [3].\n\n![Summary of reasons for refuted and NEI claims with proportions](image6)\n\nNEI claims are primarily due to insufficient evidence in the table (33.3%), lack of open-domain knowledge (25.0%), or lack of closed-domain knowledge requiring information from the paper (15.0%) [5, image6]. Additionally, vague pronouns or omitted specific information can contribute to ambiguity, making claims unverifiable [5, image6]. These reasons reflect the need for reasoning beyond simple table lookups, often requiring external knowledge or understanding contextual ambiguities [5].\n\nThe inclusion of these complex reasons and the NEI class significantly impacts model performance, particularly in the zero-shot 3-class classification setting, which is notably poorer than the 2-class setting [10]. The difficulty in distinguishing between refuted and NEI claims, a challenge even for human annotators, diminishes model confidence and tends to shift predictions towards NEI for ambiguous cases [10, 8].

Further increases in demonstrations (to 10 or 20) show more limited additional gains [1].\n\nCrucially, adding logical constraints provides stable performance improvements [1].\n![Micro-F1 and Logical Inconsistency metrics for Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT using different methods, including logical constraints](image3)\nTable 3 shows that strategies incorporating logical constraints, such as \"CoT w. logical constraints\", consistently result in higher Micro-F1 scores and lower Logical Inconsistency (LI) compared to vanilla approaches on both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets for fine-tuned models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT [3]. Similar trends are observed across different base models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 in Table 6, where \"CoT w. logical constraints\" generally outperforms \"vanilla ICL\" and \"vanilla ICL w. CoT\" [image6].\n![Micro-F1 and Logical Inconsistency metrics for various models using different logical constraint incorporation methods](image7)\nUsing different methods to utilize logical constraints, such as applying \"all logical constraints\" or \"retrieved logical constraints\", also typically improves Micro-F1 and reduces Logical Inconsistency compared to baseline methods without explicit logic [image7].\n\nThe combination of demonstrations and logical constraints is particularly effective. Incorporating logical constraints can achieve better performance even with fewer demonstrations compared to using more demonstrations without logic [12]. For instance, 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE can outperform 10 demonstrations without logical constraints [1]. This highlights the importance of providing LLMs with both examples (\"What\") and rules (\"How\") [1]. Providing relevant logic is beneficial, but injecting irrelevant logic can introduce fluctuations in results [4], [8]. Furthermore, LLMs themselves may generate inaccurate logical constraints [2].\n\nDifferent methods for obtaining and utilizing logic exist, including generative-based, retrieval-based, and pre-training-based approaches [7], [11]. Directly conveying constraints to LLMs is more effective than post-processing based on results [12]. Pre-training LLMs on datasets specifically designed for multi-hop logical reasoning (like LLM-LR) can lead to significant performance improvements, sometimes allowing smaller models to surpass larger ones [3], [6], [12].\n![Example illustrations of different approaches for utilizing logical constraints in LLMs: generative, retrieval, and pre-training](image2)\nThe different approaches illustrated in Figure 5 showcase how logical constraints can be integrated. However, complex reasoning tasks with an increasing number of logical hops pose a challenge, as performance degrades and logical inconsistency rises with increasing complexity [4]. Iterative retrieval of logical constraints in multi-turn conversations can reduce logical inconsistency but may not always boost overall Micro-F1, potentially due to \"overthinking\" [5], [12].\n\nIn summary, incorporating logical constraints significantly improves the performance of different models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets by increasing Micro-F1 and decreasing logical inconsistency, often complementing the benefits of demonstration samples and sometimes surpassing the performance achieved with demonstrations alone."}

While this guarantees zero logical inconsistency, the text notes a potential drawback: post-processing \"may severely affect the quality of the whole generation\" [1]. This is often reflected in the lower Micro-F1 scores for post-processing compared to methods that incorporate logical constraints, as seen in [image1]. The paper also indicates that directly conveying constraints to LLMs \"is more effective than adding post-processing operations based on the results\" in analyses [7].\n\nIn contrast, incorporating logical constraints into the LLM's instructions aims to guide the model during the generation process itself to produce more logically consistent answers. [1] observes that when using retrieval-based approaches to obtain and incorporate logic constraints, the \"logical inconsistency of LLMs’ answers is greatly reduced.\" This reduction in LI is evident in [image1], where methods like 'w. all logical constraints' and 'w. retrieved logical constraints' show significantly lower LI percentages compared to baselines without logic (implied contextually, although not shown in this specific table comparing these methods). The effectiveness of reducing LI varies depending on the model and whether all or retrieved constraints are used, but it generally leads to lower LI than the methods without explicit logic guidance (such as vanilla ICL or CoT shown in [image3]).\n\nThe direct integration of relevant logic into the LLM instruction is noted as very helpful for reasoning tasks [12] and providing stable improvements [6], which includes reducing logical inconsistency [1, 6, 10]. Unlike post-processing which enforces consistency externally, incorporating logical constraints aims to make the model internally more logically sound during generation.\n\nIn summary, post-processing is the most effective method for strictly reducing logical inconsistency to 0%, while incorporating logical constraints into the generation process significantly reduces logical inconsistency compared to baselines and is often more effective for overall performance."}

The typical flow involves indexing documents, retrieving relevant information based on a user query, and then using this retrieved information as context for a language model to generate a response [9].\n\n![The Naive RAG paradigm follows a simple sequential process from user query to output via indexing, retrieval, and prompt fed to a frozen LLM.](image4)\n\nAdvanced RAG builds upon the Naive approach by introducing specific improvements aimed at enhancing retrieval quality [10]. These improvements include pre-retrieval strategies, such as query optimization (routing, rewriting, expansion), and post-retrieval strategies, such as re-ranking, summarization, or fusion of retrieved results, before feeding them to the language model [10, image4]. This paradigm also refines indexing techniques [10].\n\n![The Advanced RAG paradigm adds pre-retrieval and post-retrieval steps to optimize the indexing and retrieval process before generating output.](image4)\n\nModular RAG represents the most advanced paradigm, offering enhanced adaptability and versatility [11].

These modules can include Search, Memory, Routing, Predict, Rewrite, Rerank, Read, and Task Adapter components, allowing for diverse strategies in retrieval and processing [6, image4]. The flexible orchestration of these modules enables adaptive retrieval flows, where the necessity and method of retrieval can be evaluated based on different scenarios, and supports integration with other technologies like fine-tuning [3]. This approach allows for complex patterns beyond simple sequential steps, such as iterative or recursive processes [image1, image7].\n\n![The Modular RAG paradigm consists of various interconnected modules that can be combined into flexible patterns like DSP and ITER-RETGEN.](image4)\n![The Adaptive RAG flow, a pattern within Modular RAG, allows for flexible and active control of retrieval and generation, including retrieving on demand.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the three RAG frameworks differ in their approach: Naive RAG uses a fixed \"Retrieve-Read\" sequence, Advanced RAG adds pre- and post-retrieval optimizations, and Modular RAG employs flexible, orchestratable modules for adaptive and diverse retrieval and processing flows."}

While CLIP excels at recognizing a wide array of candidates, it struggles with the precision needed to distinguish subtle differences in fine-grained items. Conversely, MLLMs are good at fine-grained classification but their performance degrades significantly as the number of categories increases due to context window limitations [8].\n\nRAR tackles this by integrating a multi-modal retriever (based on CLIP) to create an external memory of categories and using MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidates during inference [8, 10]. This process helps the model navigate large vocabularies effectively and improves prediction accuracy [8, 9].\n\nThe proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition performance compared to baseline models.

DSC, however, is noted to provide greater benefits on more imbalanced datasets [5].\n![BERT models fine-tuned with FL, DL, and DSC losses are evaluated across different data augmentation strategies (original, +positive, +negative, -negative, +positive & +negative) on the QQP dataset, showing varying F1 scores](image2)\n\nIt is important to note that the proposed dice loss functions (DL and DSC) are not accuracy-oriented and show slightly worse performance compared to Cross-Entropy (CE) on accuracy-focused tasks like sentiment classification (SST-2, SST-5) [10, 11].\n![BERT models using Cross-Entropy, DL, and DSC losses show accuracy results on the SST-2 and SST-5 sentiment classification datasets](image8)\n\nIn summary, BERT model configurations show notable performance differences across datasets and augmentation techniques, with DSC loss generally excelling on F1-oriented tasks, especially benefiting more imbalanced datasets, while standard CE loss performs better on accuracy-oriented tasks."}

This method can be computationally light and fast but often fails to capture semantic similarity beyond the word level [6, 7].\n\n[6] Historically, metrics for evaluating the quality of machine translation (MT) have relied on assessing the similarity between an MT-generated hypothesis and a human-generated reference translation in the target language. Traditional metrics have focused on basic, lexical-level features such as counting the number of matching n-grams between the MT hypothesis and the reference translation. Metrics such as B LEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) and M ETEOR ( Lavie and Denkowski , 2009 ) remain popular as a means of evaluating MT systems due to their light-weight and fast computation.\n\n[7] Classic MT evaluation metrics are commonly char- acterized as $n$ -gram matching metrics because, using hand-crafted features, they estimate MT qual- ity by counting the number and fraction of $n$ - grams that appear simultaneous in a candidate translation hypothesis and one or more human- references. Metrics such as B LEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ), M ETEOR ( Lavie and Denkowski , 2009 ), and CHR F ( Popovi c , 2015 ) have been widely stud- ied and improved ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ; Popovi c , 2017 ; Denkowski and Lavie , 2011 ; Guo and Hu , 2019 ), but, by design, they usually fail to recognize and capture semantic similarity beyond the lexical level.\n\nIn contrast, COMET is presented as a novel neural framework for MT evaluation, and COMET-RANK is one of its models, designed to optimize correlation with human judgments [3]. COMET models, including COMET-RANK, often incorporate the source language in addition to the reference and hypothesis during evaluation, which has been shown to improve performance, particularly for English-target language pairs [10, image4, image7].\n\n[3] In this paper we present C OMET , a novel neu- ral framework for training MT evaluation models that can serve as automatic metrics and easily be adapted and optimized to different types of human judgements of MT quality.\n\n![The COMET Estimator model architecture includes a pretrained encoder, pooling layer, and feed-forward network, taking hypothesis, source, and reference as input.](image7)\n\nComparisons across various language pairs consistently show that COMET-RANK achieves higher Kendall's Tau correlations with human judgments compared to BLEU. For English-source language pairs, COMET-RANK significantly outperforms BLEU and other metrics [4].\n\n[4] Table 1 shows results for all eight language pairs with English as source. We contrast our three C OMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task winning metric Y I S I -1, as well as the more recent B ERTSCORE . We observe that across the board our three models trained with the C OMET framework outperform, often by signiﬁcant margins, all other metrics. Our DA RR Ranker model outperforms the two Estima- tors in seven out of eight language pairs. Also, even though the MQM Estimator is trained on only 12K annotated segments, it performs roughly on par with the HTER Estimator for most language-pairs, and outperforms all the other metrics in en-ru.\n\n![Table 1 presents Kendall's Tau correlations for English-source language pairs, showing COMET-RANK achieving the highest scores compared to other metrics including BLEU.](image1)\n\nThis trend of COMET models outperforming BLEU is also evident in English-target language pairs [8, 11] and non-English language pairs [12].\n\n[8] For analysis, we use the DA RR corpus from the 2019 Shared Task and evaluate on the subset of the data from the top performing MT systems for each language pair. We included language pairs for which we could retrieve data for at least ten different MT systems (i.e. all but kk-en and gu-en). We contrast against the strong recently proposed B ERTSCORE and B LEURT , with B LEU as a base- line. Results are presented in Figure 3 . For lan- guage pairs where English is the target, our three models are either better or competitive with all oth- ers; where English is the source we note that in general our metrics exceed the performance of oth- Table 2: Kendall’s Tau $(\\tau)$ correlations on language pairs with English as a target for the WMT19 Metrics DA RR corpus. As for B ERTSCORE , for B LEURT we report results for two models: the base model, which is comparable in size with the encoder we used and the large model that is twice the size.\n\n[11] Table 2 shows results for the seven to-English lan- guage pairs. Again, we contrast our three C OMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task winning metric Y I S I -1, as well as the recently published metrics B ERTSCORE and B LEURT . As in Table 1 the DA RR model shows strong correlations with human judgements out- performing the recently proposed English-speciﬁc B LEURT metric in ﬁve out of seven language pairs. Again, the MQM Estimator shows surprising strong results despite the fact that this model was trained with data that did not include English as a target. Although the encoder used in our trained models is highly multilingual, we hypothesise that this pow- erful “zero-shot” result is due to the inclusion of the source in our models.\n\n![Table 2 presents Kendall's Tau correlations for English-target language pairs, showing COMET-RANK with high correlations, generally above BLEU.](image6)\n\n![Table 3 presents Kendall's Tau correlations for non-English language pairs, showing COMET-RANK achieving the highest correlations compared to other metrics including BLEU.](image2)\n\nThe performance trends shown in figures further illustrate that COMET models, including COMET-RANK, consistently maintain a higher Kendall's Tau correlation with human judgments across varying numbers of top MT systems for both English-source and English-target language pairs.\n\n![Figure 3 displays Kendall's Tau correlation trends for various metrics across different numbers of top MT models, showing COMET models consistently outperform BLEU for English-source and English-target language pairs.](image8)\n\nCOMET-RANK demonstrates significantly higher correlation with human judgments compared to BLEU across various language pairs."}

DS-DST is a dual-strategy model that can handle both non-categorical (span-based) and categorical (picklist-based) slots simultaneously [2, 4]. In contrast, DS-Picklist assumes a full ontology is available and treats all domain-slot pairs as categorical, predicting values from a candidate list [5].\n\nIn terms of overall performance, DS-Picklist generally achieves higher joint accuracy compared to DS-DST [2, 6]. The joint accuracy metric requires all domain-slot-value triplets to be predicted correctly for a turn to score 1.0 [1].\n\n![Table showing joint accuracy for various models on MultiWOZ 2.1, including DS-DST and DS-Picklist.](image7)\n\nTable 3 and 7 show the joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.1 test set. DS-Picklist achieves 53.30% joint accuracy, which is higher than DS-DST's 51.21% [image6, image7].\n\nLooking at slot-level accuracy, DS-DST and DS-Picklist both significantly improve performance over purely span-based methods like DS-Span, particularly for slots whose values are often not directly extractable from the dialog context [3, 7]. These often include categorical slots such as `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` [3].\n\n![Table showing slot-level accuracy for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist on MultiWOZ 2.1, indicating categorical and non-categorical slots for DS-DST.](image2)\n\nTable 4 details the slot accuracy for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist. For slots categorized as categorical in DS-DST, both DS-DST and DS-Picklist show substantial gains over DS-Span, and their accuracies are often very close [image2]. For example, `hotel-internet` accuracy is 97.48% for DS-DST and 97.26% for DS-Picklist; `attraction-type` is 96.86% for DS-DST and 96.91% for DS-Picklist [image2].\n\nHowever, for slots categorized as non-categorical (span-based) in DS-DST, such as time-related slots like `taxi-leave at` or `train-arrive by`, DS-DST and DS-Span perform poorly if the value is not present for extraction [7]. DS-Picklist, by leveraging the full ontology (picklist) and treating these slots as categorical, can dramatically reduce errors and achieve much higher accuracy on these specific slots when the value is in the candidate list [7].\n\n![Table showing error analysis for top-10 slots where DS-Span fails, comparing DS-DST and DS-Picklist accuracy for these slots.](image5)\n\nTable 5 illustrates this point, showing that for `taxi-leave at`, DS-Span has a high unfound ratio (73/364), DS-DST achieves only 0.00% accuracy on these specific cases, while DS-Picklist reaches 43.84% accuracy [image5]. Similarly, for `train-arrive by`, DS-DST gets 9.60% and DS-Picklist gets 79.20% on the cases where DS-Span fails [image5]. This demonstrates the strength of DS-Picklist for slots that are difficult for span extraction but have values present in an ontology.\n\nIn summary, DS-Picklist achieves higher joint accuracy than DS-DST, primarily due to its ability to leverage a full ontology to predict values for all slots, including those poorly handled by span extraction in DS-DST, although this relies on the availability of such an ontology."}

The DS-Picklist model, which utilizes a full ontology by treating all slots as categorical and selecting from candidate value lists [4, 5], shows a further improvement over DS-DST [6].\n\nWhen examining performance across individual slots, as shown in Table 4 [12], the accuracy between DS-DST and DS-Picklist is very close for many slots [image2]. However, DS-Picklist shows notable improvements over DS-DST for certain slots where span-based methods struggle because the ground-truth values are not easily found as spans in the dialogue context [2, 7]. These include time-related slots like `train-arrive by` (DS-Picklist 96.59% vs. DS-DST 95.78%) and `taxi-leave at`/`train-leave at` (DS-Picklist 93.91% vs. DS-DST 93.30%) [image2]. For such slots, having access to the ontology allows DS-Picklist to predict values from candidate lists, which can significantly reduce errors compared to span matching failures [2, 7, image6]. Other slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` also show improvements for both DS-DST and DS-Picklist compared to a span-only baseline, although the difference between DS-DST and DS-Picklist on these specific slots is often smaller than for the time slots [7, image2]. Conversely, for some slots, DS-DST performs marginally better than DS-Picklist, although these differences are generally small (e.g., `hotel-area`, `attraction-area`, `hotel-internet`, `hotel-parking`) [image2].\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs slightly better than DS-DST on MultiWOZ 2.1, with more significant gains observed in specific slots, particularly time-related slots, where leveraging the ontology through a picklist approach is highly beneficial when span matching fails."}

In contrast, CHAI involves navigation within a 3D house environment and includes simple manipulation tasks like moving objects and opening containers. CHAI instructions often require breaking down the task into multiple intermediate goals and achieving each goal may require various actions beyond simple movement [2]. The CHALET environment used for CHAI is larger and features more complex manipulation possibilities compared to similar environments [7]. This increased complexity in CHAI is also reflected in dataset statistics, where CHAI instructions have a higher average number of actions per instruction compared to LANI [Image 4].\n\nPerformance is measured using different metrics adapted to the task complexities. For LANI, the primary metrics are Stop Distance (SD) and Task Completion (TC) [11]. For CHAI, which includes manipulation, the metrics are Stop Distance (SD) and Manipulation Accuracy (MA) [11]. Comparing results from the test dataset [Image 3], models generally achieve higher Task Completion rates on LANI (e.g., our approach achieves 36.9% TC) compared to Manipulation Accuracy rates on CHAI (e.g., our approach achieves 39.97% MA), although Stop Distance might be lower for CHAI. Textual analysis also confirms that models perform poorly on CHAI, \"especially on manipulation (MA)\" [12].\n\nHuman performance also highlights the differences. On a sample, humans achieved 63% Task Completion on LANI but 100% Manipulation Accuracy on CHAI [10]. While this suggests humans can perform the manipulation aspect of CHAI perfectly in certain cases, the overall imperfect human performance on both tasks indicates inherent ambiguity [4, 10]. However, despite some human success, the gap between current model performance and human-level performance remains large for both tasks [4]. The difficulty of CHAI's manipulation is further evidenced by the fact that providing models with oracle goals significantly improves navigation performance but the model still largely fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior [3], as seen in the limited improvement in MA on CHAI with oracle goals compared to the large jump in TC on LANI [Image 7].\n\nIn summary, the key differences are that CHAI includes complex manipulation and multi-goal instructions whereas LANI is primarily single-goal navigation, evaluated with Task Completion for navigation vs. Manipulation Accuracy for CHAI's manipulation component, with models generally performing worse on CHAI's manipulation despite observed perfect human manipulation on a sample."}

LANI instructions typically involve a single primary goal, whereas CHAI instructions often necessitate achieving multiple intermediate goals to complete a sequence [3]. For example, a CHAI instruction might require several steps like opening a cupboard, picking up items, moving them, and closing the cupboard [3].

On the development dataset, Our Approach has an MA of 37.53% [7]. On the held-out test dataset, Our Approach shows a slight improvement in MA to 39.97% [8]. However, C HAPLOT 18 also achieves a similar MA (39.76%) on the test set, and baselines like STOP and MOSTFREQUENT also have high MA, which likely indicates a limitation in the metric or task complexity rather than effective manipulation behavior [7, 8]. The results are overall weaker on CHAI compared to LANI, illustrating the complexity of the task, especially concerning manipulation [6]. The fact that even with oracle goals, the model fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior highlights the planning complexity of this domain [7].\n\nInsights drawn from the comparison are that the proposed decomposition approach significantly improves instruction execution performance on the LANI navigation task compared to baseline methods [6]. However, the CHAI task, particularly regarding manipulation, remains challenging for all evaluated methods, indicating the complexity of manipulation and potentially limitations in the evaluation metrics or task formulation [3, 6, 7]. The gap to human performance, where humans achieve 100% manipulation accuracy on CHAI, also remains large [11].\n\nThe proposed approach outperforms compared methods on LANI task completion but performs similarly to baselines on CHAI manipulation accuracy, highlighting the greater challenge of the CHAI manipulation task."}

It achieves the lowest Stop Distance (SD) of 8.43 and the highest Task Completion (TC) rate of 36.9 [image6]. This outperforms baselines like STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT, as well as prior methods such as MISRA17 and CHAPLOT18 [image6], [5]. The decomposition into goal prediction and action generation significantly improves instruction execution performance on LANI [8].\n\nOn the CHAI dataset, which involves more complex manipulation tasks, overall performance is weaker across all models [5], [8]. Our approach achieves a Stop Distance (SD) of 3.34, which is an improvement over baselines and competitive with CHAPLOT18 (SD 3.59) [image6]. While our approach shows some improvement on Manipulation Accuracy (MA) compared to others (39.97 vs e.g., CHAPLOT18's 39.76) [image6], all models perform poorly on manipulation [5], illustrating the significant planning complexity of this domain [2]. Focusing only on navigation instructions within CHAI, our approach yields a stop distance of 3.24, a 17% reduction in error compared to the STOP baseline [11].\n\nPotential factors influencing the performance of 'Our Approach' include the explicit separation of goal prediction and action generation [4], which is beneficial, especially for LANI [8]. However, limitations exist, such as cascading errors where action generation relies solely on the predicted goal [4]. The model also struggles with instructions that include constraints on the execution trajectory itself [4], which are common in the datasets [image1]. The inherent ambiguity in instructions makes exact goal identification difficult, contributing to performance limitations [8], as demonstrated by imperfect human performance benchmarks (e.g., human TC of 63% on LANI and MA of 100% but SD of 1.34 on CHAI) [6], [8]. Access to oracle goals (perfect goal prediction) significantly improves performance, particularly on LANI [2], [image8], suggesting that current goal prediction accuracy is a limiting factor. Dataset characteristics, such as the prevalence of temporal coordination, trajectory constraints, and co-reference in instructions, also pose challenges [image1].\n\nIn summary, the 'Our Approach' method outperforms baseline and prior methods in terms of Stop Distance (SD) and Task Completion (TC) on the LANI dataset and shows improved Stop Distance (SD) on the CHAI dataset, although manipulation remains challenging for all models due to task complexity and inherent limitations in the approach."}

This suggests that multi-hop inference provided by the R-GCN is beneficial [12]. Text [1] notes that simply using ELMo alone (`No R-GCN`) yields only marginal improvements over a baseline, indicating the R-GCN is important. Furthermore, when using GloVe embeddings instead of ELMo, removing R-GCN leads to a substantial 8.0 point drop in accuracy on the unmasked validation set, highlighting its impact [4].\n\nIf relation types are not distinguished, effectively treating all edges the same (`No relation types` in Table 3), the performance is 62.7% unmasked and 63.9% masked [image4], which is similar to removing R-GCN entirely [1]. This indicates that merely having connections without type information is not much better than having no R-GCN layers at all [1].\n\nAblating specific edge types reveals their individual contributions [6]. Removing connections between mentions in the same document (`No DOC-BASED`) causes a drop to 62.9% unmasked and 65.8% masked [image4]. Removing connections based on exact matching (`No MATCH`) results in 64.3% unmasked and 67.4% masked [image4]. Removing predicted coreference links (`No COREF`) gives 64.8% unmasked [image4] (masked results are not available). Text [7] indicates that `DOC-BASED` connections are the most impactful because they are frequent and provide crucial co-occurrence information, while `MATCH` and `COREF` links play a more marginal role, particularly as the `MATCH` heuristic captures easy coreference cases.\n\nFinally, replacing the heuristic edge assignment with a learned prediction mechanism (`Induced edges` in Table 3) significantly degrades performance to 61.5% unmasked and 56.4% masked [image4], suggesting the model struggles to learn these dependencies on its own [9].\n\nRemoving components like R-GCN, not distinguishing relation types, and ablating specific edge types generally reduces performance in both unmasked and masked settings, with the R-GCN and DOC-BASED edges appearing particularly important."}

Consequently, the coreference resolution system is not applied in the masked setting [5].\n\nFor the unmasked setting, mentions of the same entity can have different surface forms (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\"), requiring a coreference resolution system to link them [5]. While the `MATCH` heuristic captures easy coreference cases, the external coreference system handles others [8].\n\nThe table shows the performance comparison of the single Entity-GCN model with and without the inclusion of the coreference system.\n![Table comparing Entity-GCN performance with and without the coreference system in unmasked and masked settings.](image8)\nFor the unmasked validation set, including the coreference system slightly improves accuracy (65.3 vs 64.8), while for the unmasked test set, performance surprisingly degrades (66.4 with coreference vs 67.6 without) [8]. This degradation on the test set suggests the coreference system might struggle with test documents [8].

The 'GloVe with R-GCN' model achieved 59.2% accuracy in the unmasked setting and a significantly lower 11.1% accuracy in the masked setting [Image 3]. The large drop in the masked setting for the GloVe model is likely because, as discussed in the text, in the masked case, mentions become 'unknown' tokens with GloVe, leading to predictions equivalent to a random guess [9].\n\n![Table showing accuracy and precision metrics by relation type for ensemble and single models](image6)\nThis table provides a breakdown of accuracy and precision (P@2, P@5) for the overall ensemble and single models, as well as highlighting the best and worst performing relation types.

Ablation studies reveal the specific effects of these layers [1], [4].\n\n![Table showing ablation study results on the ACE05 development set, comparing DyGIE, -CorefProp, -RelProp, and Base models for entity and relation extraction performance (P, R, F1).](image1)\n\nFor ACE05, coreference propagation is primarily beneficial for entity extraction, showing a slight increase in Entity F1 when present (68.2 for full DyGIE vs 68.0 for -CorefProp) [4], [1]. However, it appears to slightly decrease relation extraction performance (42.0 for full DyGIE vs 41.2 for -CorefProp) [4], [1].

Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction on SciIE (87.1 Entity F1 and 58.4 Relation F1 for DyGIE vs 86.9 and 58.0 for -RelProp) [4].

As the percentage of document examples increases from 0% to 100%, the accuracy generally improves consistently across all four datasets [4].\n\n![Two plots showing the change in Accuracy and Macro-F1 percentage as the percentage of document-level training examples increases from 0 to 1 on four datasets.](image3)\n\nFor macro-F1 scores, the improvements are stable for datasets D1 and D2, but datasets D3 and D4 show sharp increases in Macro-F1 when the percentage of document examples changes from 0 to 0.4 [4].\n\n![A table showing dataset statistics, including the number of positive, negative, and neutral examples in training and test sets for four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4).](image2)\n\nThis sharp increase in Macro-F1 for D3 and D4 at lower document data percentages may be related to their extremely unbalanced nature [3, 4], where even a small improvement in correctly identifying examples from minority classes can significantly impact precision and recall for those classes, thus affecting the macro-F1 score more substantially [3].\n\nIn summary, transferring knowledge from document-level data through pretraining, particularly of the embedding and LSTM layers, consistently improves performance, and increasing the amount of document-level data used further boosts accuracy and Macro-F1, with the greatest relative impact on Macro-F1 observed for datasets with unbalanced class distributions like D3 and D4 at lower percentages of document data."}

[10] This surpasses previous models like MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr. [10, 7] A key advantage of TRADE is that it learns to track states without needing a predefined domain ontology, unlike models like MDBT, GLAD, and GCE, which can hinder their performance. [10, 11] When evaluated on the single restaurant domain from MultiWOZ, TRADE also shows strong performance with 65.35% joint accuracy. [10]\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios, where the model is expanded to a new domain after pre-training on existing ones, the TRADE model benefits from transfer learning. [3] Pre-training followed by fine-tuning on a small amount of new domain data generally achieves better results on the new domain compared to training from scratch on that domain. [2, 5] For example, using only 1% of new domain data, fine-tuning TRADE resulted in 59.83% joint accuracy on the Train domain, significantly outperforming training from scratch (44.24%) with the same data amount.

The paper compares naive fine-tuning with two continual learning techniques, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) [12]. These strategies aim to adapt the model to the new domain while preserving performance on the domains it was initially trained on, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting [5, 10].\n\nGEM is shown to be more effective than both naive fine-tuning and EWC in preserving performance on the original four domains after fine-tuning on a new domain. For instance, when fine-tuning on a new domain, the joint accuracy on the original four domains dropped by only 5.44% (from 58.98% to 53.54%) with GEM, compared to a 22.9% drop (to 36.08%) with naive fine-tuning in the hotel domain [1].\n\n![Table showing evaluation metrics for the base model and different fine-tuning strategies on four original domains and one new domain.](image3)\n\nAs shown in the table above, GEM consistently outperforms Naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of maintaining performance on the four pre-trained domains across various new domains (e.g., Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, Taxi) [5, 10]. Furthermore, fine-tuning from the base model generally achieves better results on the new domain compared to training from scratch on the new domain alone [5]. In some cases, fine-tuning with GEM on the new domain also outperforms naive fine-tuning on that same new domain, suggesting that retaining the tracking ability learned on original domains can benefit performance on the new one [4]. For example, GEM achieved 34.73% joint accuracy on the attraction domain compared to 29.39% for naive fine-tuning [4].\n\nThe ability of the TRADE model to perform knowledge transfer across domains affects its performance, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where it encounters domains not seen during training [3, 9]. Knowledge transfer is facilitated by sharing parameters across domains and is more successful for slots that are similar or shared across different domains [3, 9].\n\n![Bar charts showing the relative success rate for various slots within the Hotel and Restaurant domains during zero-shot analysis.](image4)\n\nAnalysis of zero-shot performance in domains like Hotel and Restaurant reveals that knowledge about slots common to other domains, such as `people`, `area`, `price range`, and `day`, is successfully transferred [2]. However, slots unique to a specific domain that were not encountered during training are difficult to track correctly [2]. For instance, slots like `parking`, `stars`, and `internet` are unique to the hotel domain, and the `food` slot is unique to the restaurant domain [2]. This indicates that while the model leverages shared knowledge effectively, handling completely novel slot types without prior exposure remains a challenge. Image4 illustrates the varying success rates across different slots within the Hotel and Restaurant domains, likely reflecting this difference between shared/transferable slots and unique/difficult slots.\n\nFine-tuning strategies like GEM are more effective than naive approaches and EWC in preserving performance on original domains while adapting to new ones, and knowledge transfer is successful for shared slots across domains but challenging for unique, unseen slots."}

The study analyzed four widely used commercial MT systems (Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN) and two recent state-of-the-art academic models across eight target languages with grammatical gender: Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK), Hebrew (HE), Arabic (AR), and German (DE) [1].\n\nThe evaluation used a challenge set based on Winogender and WinoBias, devising an automatic method to assess gender bias without needing additional gold translations [2]. Metrics calculated for each system and language include overall gender accuracy (Acc), the difference in F1 score between masculine and feminine translations (ΔG), and the difference in F1 score between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments (ΔS) [1, 9]. A higher ΔG or ΔS indicates stronger bias [1].\n\nOverall system accuracy in preserving the gender of the entity from the original English sentence was often quite poor across many tested languages [7]. However, performance varied considerably by system and language.\n\n![This table compares the accuracy and two metrics of gender bias (Delta G and Delta S) for four commercial machine translation systems across eight different languages.](image4)\n\nFor instance, in French (FR), Google Translate achieved the highest accuracy (63.6%) among the commercial systems shown, while Microsoft Translator had the best accuracy for German (DE) at 74.1% and Ukrainian (UK) at 41.3%. Amazon Translate performed best in terms of accuracy for Spanish (ES) at 59.4%, Italian (IT) at 42.4%, and Arabic (AR) at 49.8% [Image 4]. German was noted as an exception to the generally poor accuracy, with three out of four systems achieving their best performance in that language, possibly due to its similarity to English [7].\n\nA consistent finding across all tested systems and languages was significant gender bias [2, 4, 6, 9]. This bias is particularly evident when comparing performance on stereotypical versus non-stereotypical gender role assignments [11]. Systems perform significantly better when translating pro-stereotypical roles (e.g., female nurse) compared to anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., male receptionist) [11].\n\n![This bar chart compares the accuracy of Google Translate for translating stereotypical versus non-stereotypical gender roles across eight different languages.](image1)\n\nImage 1 illustrates this for Google Translate, showing consistently higher accuracy (blue bars) for stereotypical examples compared to non-stereotypical examples (red bars) across all languages tested, with the difference being substantial in many cases (e.g., ES, FR, IT, HE). The ΔS metric quantifies this difference in performance between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical assignments [1, 11]. As seen in Image 4, ΔS values are relatively high across the board, indicating a strong tendency to favor stereotypical translations. Similarly, ΔG measures the bias towards masculine or feminine forms [1], also showing considerable variation across systems and languages in Image 4. While some systems or languages might show a slightly lower bias on one metric, all demonstrate significant bias overall.\n\nFor example, Microsoft Translator showed the lowest ΔG and ΔS for German (0.0 and 30.2 respectively), indicating relatively lower gender bias in that language compared to others for this system [Image 4]. Amazon Translate generally showed competitive or lower ΔS values across several languages, but also had lower overall accuracy in some cases [Image 4].\n\nThe evaluation concluded that all tested machine translation systems are significantly gender biased, varying in their accuracy and the degree and type of bias across different target languages."}

To address this, an adversarial dataset was constructed. This dataset was created by leveraging the structure of ARCT examples (Reason + Warrant -> Claim) where R Λ A → ¬C. For each data point, a copy was created with the claim negated and the label inverted [8]. This process, which essentially involves negating the claim and swapping the warrant with the alternative, effectively mirrors the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, thereby eliminating the misleading signal [8, 9].\n\n![Example showing an original ARCT instance and its adversarial counterpart with negated claim and swapped alternative/warrant](image6)\n\nWhen models, including BERT, were trained and evaluated on this adversarial dataset, their performance dropped significantly [6].

Older baseline models like LSTM-s and CKBG demonstrate very high novelty rates (86.25% N/T sro for both) but achieve relatively low classifier scores (60.83% and 57.17%) and human evaluation scores (63.86% and 53.95%) [Image 5].\n\n![Comparison of different models on the ConceptNet dataset showing performance metrics including perplexity, classifier score, novelty, and human evaluation.](image5)\n\nIn contrast, the full COMET model achieves a much higher classifier score (95.25%) and human evaluation score (91.69%), indicating high quality and correctness, while still generating a substantial percentage of novel tuples (59.25% N/T sro) [1, 11, Image 5].

These models often predict UNK for rare or unseen words, leading to the proposal of different backoff strategies: Pass-through (leaving UNK-predicted words unchanged), Neutral (mapping UNK to a fixed word like 'a'), and Background (falling back on a generic word recognizer trained on a larger corpus) [1, 2, 4]. The effectiveness of these strategies, and thus the robustness of the overall system, depends not only on reducing Word Error Rate (WER) but also on lowering the model's sensitivity [5, 9]. Sensitivity is a metric quantifying the number of unique predictions a word recognizer outputs when a single word in the input sentence is perturbed with all possible variations; lower sensitivity provides fewer options for the attacker [3, 5, 11].\n\n![Illustration of background and foreground models in a semi-character representation](image1)\n\nDifferent backoff strategies impact WER and sensitivity differently. In terms of WER, backing off to a background model trained on a larger corpus generally results in the lowest WER (e.g., 6.9% 'all' WER compared to 10.2% for Pass-Through and 10.6% for Neutral on a 10K vocabulary) [10, image7]. This is particularly helpful for recovering words unseen in the foreground training corpus [10].\n\n![Table showing sensitivity values for different backoff strategies and model types under various attacks](image6)\n\nSensitivity, however, behaves differently, particularly when comparing closed vocabulary (word-only) and open vocabulary (char-only, word+char, word-piece) models [6, 8]. For closed vocabulary models, the Pass-through variant is less sensitive than the background variant because the downstream classifier treats all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) character combinations identically [6]. The Neutral backoff variant consistently shows the lowest sensitivity across most attack types for both closed and open vocabulary models [3, 8, image6]. This is because it maps all UNK predictions to a single, fixed word, drastically reducing the number of unique outputs [1, 8]. For open vocabulary models, the Pass-through variant is more sensitive than the background variant, as the downstream classifier considers every unique combination of characters differently [6, 8].\n\n![Plot showing the trade-off between Word Error Rate (WER) and Sensitivity for different backoff variants](image3)\n\nWhile achieving a low WER is desirable, it is not always sufficient for robustness; low sensitivity is also crucial [5]. There is often a trade-off between low WER and low sensitivity, visualized in Figure 2 [12, image3]. Background backoff might offer the best word recognition performance (lowest WER), but Neutral backoff typically offers the lowest sensitivity [3, 10, 12, image3, image7]. Sensitivity is generally the more dominant factor for improving robustness when the error rates are already reasonably low [12].\n\nSensitivity and Word Error Rate (WER) differ between closed and open vocabulary models primarily in how the Pass-through and Background backoff strategies affect sensitivity relative to each other, while the Neutral backoff generally achieves the lowest sensitivity regardless of vocabulary type, and Background backoff typically yields the lowest WER."}

In the masked gold chain setting, BiDAF achieves particularly high scores, including 99.3% on MEDHOP, indicating capability when only relevant, masked information is presented [1, image3]. This large improvement in the gold chain setup also highlights that the models' performance in the standard setting is limited by their ability to select relevant documents [1, 9].\n\nExperiments where documents *not* containing candidate mentions were discarded (\"rem\") showed performance drops for BiDAF, suggesting it leverages information from these documents [6].

Standard Seq2Seq models are known for producing shorter sentences with more common words than humans [1, 8]. As seen in image4, Seq2Seq has the lowest average word count (11.7), character count (40.5), and rare word percentages (0.4% for <100 frequency, 5.8% for <1k frequency) among the tested methods. The RetNRef and RetNRef+ models show some improvement in these metrics, but RetNRef++ demonstrates statistics much closer to human utterances, with a word count of 12.7, character count of 48.1, and rare word percentages of 2.3% (<100) and 10.9% (<1k), nearing the human stats of 13.0, 54.6, 3.0%, and 11.5% respectively [8]. This improvement in using rare words is considered encouraging for generating more engaging conversations [8].\n\n![A table showing average word count, character count, and percentage of rare words for different dialogue models and human responses.](image4)\n\nPerformance metrics measured through human evaluation also show significant differences. RetNRef variants generally show superior engagingness scores compared to Seq2Seq [4]. Specifically, RetNRef++ achieves the highest engagingness score (3.80) among all models, including Memory Network (3.66) and Seq2Seq (2.70-2.76) (image3). While RetNRef++ maintains high scores in Fluency (3.74) and Consistency (3.80), similar to or better than other models, it scores lower on Persona (0.65) compared to Seq2Seq (0.85-0.90) or RetNRef (0.90) [4].\n\n![A table showing human evaluation scores for Engagingness, Fluency, Consistency, and Persona for different dialogue models.](image3)\n\nWord overlap analysis indicates how much models utilize the retrieved text. Seq2Seq, which doesn't retrieve, rarely overlaps significantly with retrieved output (3% >80% overlap) (image2, [9]). RetNRef also shows limited overlap (8% >80% overlap), suggesting it might sometimes ignore the retriever [9]. In contrast, RetNRef++ shows substantial overlap (53% >80% overlap), indicating it actively uses the retriever, while still capable of generating novel content [9].\n\n![A table showing the percentage of generated sentences with different levels of word overlap with the retrieved sentence for various models.](image2)\n\nFurther evaluating human-like conversational abilities through A/B tests against other models shows RetNRef++ winning against both Memory Network and Seq2Seq with statistically significant win rates (54.5% vs Memory Network, 53.7% vs Seq2Seq) (image6, [6]). RetNRef+ also shows a win rate over Memory Network (51.63%) [2, 6]. While A/B tests against humans indicate models are still weaker than humans (RetNRef++ wins 30.13% of the time against humans, Seq2Seq wins 26.84%) [10, 11], the retrieve and refine models, particularly RetNRef++, show improved performance in generating more human-like and engaging responses [1].\n\n![A table comparing win rates between different dialogue models and humans in A/B tests.](image6)\n\nExample dialogues illustrate these differences. For instance, in image1, RetNRef+ provides a shorter, more direct answer to \"do you enjoy dance?\" (\"i do. i enjoy dance.\") compared to Seq2Seq's less relevant response (\"i am sorry. i am so scared of twins.\") or MemNet's persona statement (\"hello george my name is pink\"). RetNRef models are designed to avoid issues like short, non-engaging sentences [1]. However, some challenges remain, such as repeated phrases or copying the speaking partner [3].\n\n![Example dialogues comparing responses from Seq2Seq, MemNet, RetNRef+, and human participants to highlight differences in conversational style and relevance.](image1)\n\nPerplexity, while a common automated metric (image5), is noted as particularly flawed for retrieve and refine models and dialogue systems in general, as equally valid responses may have low word overlap with the \"true\" label [7, 12].\n\nThe main differences lie in RetNRef++'s improved word statistics closer to human text, its higher engagingness score in human evaluations, its strategic use of retrieval while still being able to generate, and its superior win rates against baseline models in human judgments, demonstrating enhanced human-like conversational ability despite some remaining issues like persona consistency or repetition."}

QCT revenues increased by $64\\%$ in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, largely due to higher demand for 5G products, reflecting a recovery from COVID-19 impacts, and increased automotive and IoT revenues [10], [11]. This resulted in $10.4$ billion in higher equipment and services revenues from the QCT segment [11]. Additionally, QTL revenues increased by $26\\%$ in fiscal 2021, driven by increased sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, also benefiting from COVID-19 recovery [10], [11]. The QSI segment also saw earnings before income taxes increase by $927$ million compared to the prior year, mainly due to higher net gains on investments [10].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income items, also showed a similar upward trend. For fiscal year 2021, comprehensive income was $9.0$ billion, compared to $5.3$ billion in fiscal 2020 and $4.3$ billion in fiscal 2019 [7].\n![Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income show Comprehensive Income increasing from $4.3 billion in 2019 to $5.3 billion in 2020 and $9.0 billion in 2021.](image7)\nThe difference between net income and comprehensive income is primarily due to other comprehensive income/(loss) items, such as foreign currency translation gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments [7]. In 2021, total other comprehensive loss was $(79)$ million, slightly reducing the comprehensive income below the net income figure [7].\n\nIn summary, QUALCOMM's net income and comprehensive income significantly increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020 and 2019, largely driven by robust revenue growth in the QCT and QTL segments due to increased demand for 5G and other products, along with higher investment gains."}

Although overall claim liabilities increased, estimates for prior years' claims were reduced by $1.8 billion in 2021, which positively impacted pre-tax earnings [9]. Liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts decreased from $40,966 million to $38,256 million [Image 1], primarily due to a $974 million reduction in estimated ultimate liabilities for these contracts [12]. Notes payable and other borrowings across the company decreased from $116,895 million (sum of Insurance & Other and Railroad, Utilities and Energy) in 2020 to $114,262 million in 2021 [Image 1].

The increase in equity was partially offset by the acquisition of treasury stock, which reduced equity by $26,942 million in 2021 [Image 4].\n\nOverall, liabilities increased moderately, while shareholders' equity grew significantly, largely due to strong net earnings driven by investment gains.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.'s total liabilities increased from $422.4 billion in 2020 to $443.9 billion in 2021, and total shareholders' equity increased from $451.3 billion to $514.9 billion, primarily driven by substantial net earnings from investment gains."}

Income tax expense went from a $5.3 billion expense in 2019 to a $5.6 billion *benefit* in 2020 [9], [image1]. This relative benefit and the significant drop in the effective tax rate from 34 percent in 2019 to 17 percent in 2020 were primarily driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020 and a change in the mix of results from different tax jurisdictions [9].\n![Summary of income taxes, effective tax rate, and total other taxes and duties for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image1)\n\nThe financial implications of these changes are closely tied to the difficult industry conditions in 2020.

The decrease in taxes, specifically the income tax benefit, directly reflects the lower profitability and asset impairments experienced in 2020 [9]. To further address liquidity needs, the Corporation also issued $23 billion of long-term debt in 2020 [2], which contributed to an increase in the debt to capital ratio from 19.1 percent in 2019 to 29.2 percent in 2020.\n![Debt to capital and net debt to capital ratios for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image7)\n\nExxonMobil's capital expenditures and total taxes decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, reflecting lower profitability and asset impairments in a difficult market environment, leading the company to reduce spending and rely on debt to manage liquidity."}

The primary factor for the decline in total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues was sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment, largely due to the impact of COVID-19 [5].

Specifically, restructuring and impairment charges negatively impacted the reported growth by 10%, while inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges positively impacted it by 2% [image6].\n\nThe core non-GAAP growth was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth. APAC net revenue growth was 18% on a reported GAAP basis, with organic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure [5], contributing 8 percentage points [image4]. This organic revenue growth consisted of 5 percentage points from organic volume growth and 3 percentage points from effective net pricing [image4].

The Firm's effective tax rate for 2020 was 22.5%, compared to 18.3% in 2019 [image5]. This increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 was primarily due to a higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits compared to the prior year [3, 4].\n\n![Table showing effective tax rates and net discrete tax provisions/benefits for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image5)\n\nNet discrete tax provisions resulted in a benefit of \\$122 million in 2020 [4], which was a substantial decrease from the \\$475 million net discrete tax benefits recognized in 2019 [8, 10].\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses were \\$20,854 million in 2020, an 11% increase from 2019 [1].

Diluted earnings per common share decreased 20% (20% in constant currencies) to $6.31 [2]. Operating income, a key component of net income, decreased 19% (20% in constant currencies) [9]. This reduction in operating earnings contributed significantly to the decrease in cash provided by operations [5].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the change in net income. Operating income was impacted by factors including $268 million of net strategic gains primarily related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock in 2020, compared to $74 million of net strategic charges in 2019 [9]. The sale of McDonald's Japan stock also reflected $274 million of pre-tax strategic gains [7]. The decrease in income before income taxes from $8,018.1 million in 2019 to $6,140.7 million in 2020, as shown in the income statement, directly led to a lower provision for income taxes [Image6].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss), also decreased. It went from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020. ![A table showing net income, other comprehensive income, and comprehensive income for 2020, 2019, and 2018 in millions of dollars.](image1) This decrease of $1,525.8 million was driven by the decline in net income and a less favorable result from other comprehensive income components. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, changed from a gain of $126.8 million in 2019 to a loss of $104.1 million in 2020 [Image1]. This change in other comprehensive income was primarily due to larger cash flow hedging losses in 2020 ($123.3 million loss) compared to 2019 ($20.4 million loss), and larger defined benefit pension plan losses in 2020 ($43.9 million loss) compared to 2019 ($27.1 million loss), partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments resulting in a larger net benefit in 2020 ($63.1 million) compared to 2019 ($174.3 million net expense) [Image1]. Cumulative cash flow hedging losses, after tax, totaled $111.3 million at December 31, 2020 [6].\n\nNet income decreased from $6,025.4 million to $4,730.5 million, and comprehensive income decreased from $6,152.2 million to $4,626.4 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to a decline in operating income, strategic gains/charges differences between the years, and unfavorable changes in other comprehensive income components, particularly cash flow hedges and pension plans."}

[4]\n\n![Table displaying PepsiCo's Net Revenue and Operating Profit by division for 2018, 2019, and 2020](image2)\n\nAnalyzing division performance reveals varied trends. In terms of net revenue from 2018 to 2020, FLNA, PBNA, Europe, and APAC showed consistent growth. QFNA also grew, with a stronger performance in 2020. AMESA saw significant growth in 2020 after being stable in 2019. LatAm was the exception, growing in 2019 but declining in 2020.\n\nOperating profit trends differed from revenue. FLNA and Europe showed consistent profit growth. QFNA's profit declined in 2019 but recovered strongly in 2020, exceeding 2018 levels. PBNA, despite revenue growth, saw its operating profit decline consistently from 2018 to 2020. LatAm's profit mirrored its revenue, growing in 2019 and declining in 2020. AMESA's profit grew in 2019 but declined sharply in 2020. APAC's profit saw a significant drop in 2019, a partial recovery in 2020, but remained below 2018 levels.\n\nPepsiCo's performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food and snack products [2]. The mix of beverage and food/snack sales varies by international division and contributes differently to revenue and profit dynamics.\n\n![Table showing the percentage breakdown of Net Revenue from Beverage and Food/Snack categories for international divisions and total PepsiCo from 2018 to 2020](image6)\n\nFor international divisions where data is provided [2], the beverage and food/snack mix shows varying stability. LatAm and APAC maintained a consistent mix, heavily weighted towards Food/Snack (90% and 75%, respectively). Europe also maintained a stable mix (55% Beverage / 45% Food/Snack). AMESA, however, saw a significant shift towards Food/Snack, moving from a 45% Beverage / 55% Food/Snack mix in 2018 to 30% Beverage / 70% Food/Snack in 2020.\n\nChanges in operating profit are influenced by factors like net revenue growth, productivity savings, operating cost increases, advertising and marketing expenses, and restructuring/impairment charges [6, 7, 9, 11]. In 2020, charges related to the COVID-19 pandemic also significantly impacted operating profit across divisions [5]. For example, COVID charges reduced operating profit growth in AMESA by 4 percentage points and in APAC by 3 percentage points [9, 11]. PBNA's operating profit was reduced by 4 percentage points due to COVID charges, and while it had revenue growth, its profit decreased [11]. The consistent decline in PBNA's operating profit despite revenue growth, unlike FLNA and QFNA (for which mix data isn't provided but are significant domestic divisions), suggests different underlying cost structures or market dynamics, potentially related to its primary category focus or competition. The significant 2020 revenue growth in AMESA occurred alongside a major shift towards the Food/Snack category, yet profit declined, partly due to COVID charges [9]. Divisions with more stable category mixes like LatAm, Europe, and APAC showed trends more likely influenced by macro-environmental factors, costs, and COVID-specific impacts rather than shifts in the beverage/food balance.\n\nOverall, changes in divisional net revenue and operating profit from 2018 to 2020 were influenced by a combination of revenue growth dynamics, cost structures, market conditions, and significant impacts from COVID-19-related charges, with shifts in the beverage/food mix playing a notable role in divisions like AMESA, while other divisions saw trends irrespective of mix stability."}

This financing included inflows from borrowings from the Siemens Group amounting to USD 10.0 billion and an additional financing of €850 million in fiscal year 2021 [9]. The acquisition financing also involved issuing new shares of Siemens Healthineers AG in March 2021, which led to an increase in equity, specifically issued capital and capital reserve [11].\n![The table shows the change in equity components from September 30, 2020 to September 30, 2021.](image5)\nThe net debt also increased significantly from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021, reflecting the borrowings undertaken partly for the acquisition.\n![The table details the components of net debt as of September 30, 2021 and 2020.](image8)\nThese inflows were partly offset by cash outflows such as the repayment of matured loans [9], dividend payments to shareholders (€856 million in 2021 compared to €798 million in 2020) [4], and an increased number of treasury shares repurchased (€203 million increase) to fulfill share-based payment programs [10].\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, Siemens Healthineers' cash flows from investing activities saw a large increase in outflows primarily due to the Varian acquisition and capacity investments, while cash flows from financing activities shifted to a large inflow mainly driven by borrowings and share issuance to finance the Varian acquisition, partially offset by loan repayments, dividends paid, and treasury share repurchases."}

Upstream operations primarily involve exploring, developing, producing, and transporting crude oil and natural gas, while Downstream operations focus on refining crude oil into products, marketing, and transporting refined products and petrochemicals [4].\n\nEarnings performance between the two segments varied significantly.\n![Segment earnings for Upstream, Downstream, and All Other activities are presented for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image6)\nIn 2021, the Upstream segment reported substantial earnings of $15,818 million, a dramatic improvement from a loss of $(2,433) million in 2020.

Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment, with the price of crude oil being the most significant factor affecting its results [3]. Downstream earnings are closely tied to margins on refining, manufacturing, and marketing, which can be volatile and affected by supply-and-demand balance and crude oil prices [5].\n\nExamining the asset values also reveals differences between the segments.\n![Segment assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are detailed for Upstream, Downstream, and All Other segments.](image8)\nAt the end of 2021, the Upstream segment's total assets were valued at $184,412 million, a slight decrease from $191,309 million at the end of 2020 [Image8].

This decrease was predominantly related to intangible assets, specifically patents and licences not yet available for use [Text 10], which are subject to annual impairment testing [Text 12, 6]. The impairment in 2020 resulted from Management's review of expectations related to these assets [Text 10]. In 2020, the entire impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognised within research and development costs [Text 10], aligning with the nature of the impaired assets being patents and licences related to R&D projects [Text 6].

This increase indicates more intangible assets became available for use and started being amortised during 2020 [Text 12]. The amortisation for Patents and licences alone increased from DKK 312 million in 2019 to DKK 889 million in 2020 [Image 5].\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) also incurs depreciation and impairment losses.

Changes in shareholders' equity over a period are impacted by comprehensive income, as well as transactions with owners (like issuing stock or paying dividends).\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income clearly show the components of comprehensive income for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Comprehensive income is calculated as Net income plus Other comprehensive (loss) income.\n![Comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income or loss](image5)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the comprehensive income was $8,010 million, derived from Net income of $8,060 million and Other comprehensive loss of $50 million. In 2020, comprehensive income was $2,977 million (Net income $3,135 million, Other comprehensive loss $158 million), and in 2019, it was $6,619 million (Net income $6,759 million, Other comprehensive loss $140 million) [5].\n\nComprehensive income directly affects the balance of shareholders' equity. Net income flows into Retained Earnings, while Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) accumulates in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), both of which are components of total shareholders' equity. The Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity show how these items, along with other transactions affecting equity, reconcile the beginning and ending balances of shareholders' equity [3, 4].\n![The statement shows the changes in total shareholders' equity, reconciling the beginning and ending balances through net income, other comprehensive loss, share repurchases, dividends, and other items](image7)\nAs seen in the statement, net income for each year increases the Retained Earnings balance, while the Other comprehensive loss (income) for each year impacts the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) balance. For example, in 2021, net income of $8,060 million increased retained earnings, while the $50 million other comprehensive loss contributed to the change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), which moved from a loss of $2,895 million at the end of 2020 to a loss of $2,945 million at the end of 2021 [7, 4].\n\nComprehensive income, composed of net income and other comprehensive income, contributes to the changes in shareholders' equity over the period from 2019 to 2021."}

Text [11] confirms WAIO production increased to a record 252 Mt (equity share) in FY2021, reflecting strong operational performance and new production from South Flank.\n\nComparing the two, WAIO significantly outperformed Escondida in FY2021 in terms of both revenue (over 3.6 times higher) and Underlying EBITDA (over 4 times higher), largely due to its much larger production and sales volumes, despite Escondida having achieved a favourable copper price of US$3.81/lb [7] and WAIO an average realised iron ore price of US$130.56/wmt [2].\n\nCommodity prices are highlighted as a key driver of value and significantly impact financial results [4].

This table illustrates the substantial sensitivity of the company's financial performance to fluctuations in the prices of its key commodities like copper and iron ore.\n\nIn FY2021, WAIO was a significantly larger operation than Escondida by revenue, EBITDA, and volume, and both operations' financial performances were highly sensitive to changes in their respective commodity prices, with iron ore price changes having a larger per-unit impact on EBITDA and profit than copper price changes."}

This swing represents a total increase in the foreign tax provision of \\$1,054 million.\n\nThis substantial increase in foreign income and the related swing in the foreign tax provision can be attributed to several factors. While not explicitly stated as the *cause* of the income increase, the company did undertake restructuring activities in fiscal 2018 and 2019 to better align profits with activities [1]. Changes in foreign tax credit regulations also impacted the effective tax rate [5]. The company is also dealing with significant unrecognized tax benefits, including expected refunds of Korean withholding tax, which can affect U.S. foreign tax credits [2, 7]. Ongoing tax examinations in numerous foreign jurisdictions [12] also present the possibility of adjustments to the tax provision.\n\nThese changes have several potential impacts on the company's financial strategy. The significant increase in foreign profitability suggests that international operations are a growing and important part of the business, requiring robust foreign tax compliance and planning. The shift to a large foreign tax expense impacts net income and cash flows, necessitating careful management of foreign tax obligations, including potential cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits [2, 3] and navigating foreign tax audits [12]. The company's strategy must also consider the implications of future changes in tax laws, both in the U.S. (like potential changes to the FDII deduction) and abroad [1]. Managing foreign tax credits and the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of certain foreign deferred tax assets (as indicated by valuation allowances) are also key strategic considerations [7, 5, 9].\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, foreign income before taxes increased significantly from \\$439 million to \\$1,493 million, and the foreign tax provision changed from a benefit of \\$524 million to an expense of \\$530 million, highlighting the growing importance and tax complexity of the company's international operations which requires careful strategic tax management."}

This decline in profit, despite revenue growth, was primarily driven by a substantial increase in expected credit losses (ECL) [Image 1]. Adjusted ECL were $4.8bn in 2020 [Image 3], which was $3.6bn higher than in 2019, reflecting the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the UK and Asia [9]. Operating expenses for this segment decreased slightly [Image 1].\n\nWithin the segments contributing to the Net Operating Income shown in Image 2, Global Markets saw a significant increase in revenue of $1,562m, or 27%, largely driven by strong performance that offset the impact of lower global interest rates and adverse valuation adjustments [Image 2, 8]. In contrast, other areas experienced declines: Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue decreased by $701m or 26% [Image 2], Securities Services revenue fell by $234m or 12% [Image 2], Global Banking revenue decreased by $71m or 2% [Image 2, 12], Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) revenue decreased by $33m or 4% [Image 2, 7] due to reduced global trade volumes [7], and Principal Investments revenue was down $147m or 56% [Image 2].\n\nFor the Ring-fenced bank (RFB) segment, Adjusted Net Operating Income was negative at $(262)m$ in 2020, but this represented a significant improvement of $392m compared to $(654)m$ in 2019 [Image 8]. Adjusted Profit Before Tax for the RFB segment increased substantially by $387m, or 42%, reaching $1,311m in 2020 from $924m in 2019 [Image 8, 5]. This profit growth was significantly aided by Share of profit in associates and JVs, which contributed $2,054m in 2020, and a decrease in operating expenses [Image 8]. The change in expected credit losses for the RFB segment was minimal at $1m [Image 8].\n\nAnother view of revenue for what appears to be the Non-Ring-fenced bank (NRFB) shows a Net Operating Income decrease of $1,852m, or 12%, to $13,312m [Image 6]. Within this view, Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue decreased significantly by $1,754m or 30% [Image 6], and Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other revenue decreased by $427m or 21% [Image 6, 6] due to factors including lower interest rates and reduced revenue from Insurance and Investments [6]. Credit and Lending revenue increased by $219m or 4% [Image 6].\n\nIn summary, while some segments like Global Markets experienced significant revenue growth, others like Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Securities Services, and Markets products faced declines in 2020. The overall impact on profit before tax was negative for a major segment primarily due to higher credit losses, whereas the Ring-fenced bank segment saw a significant profit increase driven by associate income and cost reductions, despite negative operating income."}

This net change resulted from differing movements within portfolio segments [8]. Commercial loans saw an increase primarily driven by higher demand and originations, partially offset by paydowns and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness [8]. Conversely, Consumer loans decreased, mainly due to paydowns in the residential mortgage portfolio reflecting the low interest rate environment and transfers of first lien mortgage loans to held for sale, although partially offset by new originations [8]. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans decreased significantly by 30%, reflecting improved portfolio credit quality and better economic forecasts [2].\n\nTurning to deposits, there was a more substantial increase overall.\n![Total deposits and composition changes from Dec 31, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021](image3)\nTotal deposits rose from $\\S1,404.4$ billion at December 31, 2020, to $\\S1,482.5$ billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $\\S78.1$ billion, or 6% [7], [image3]. This increase was concentrated in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which grew by 13%, and savings deposits, which increased by 9% [image3]. In contrast, time deposits decreased significantly by 41%, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined by 44% [image3]. The estimated amount of uninsured deposits also increased from $\\S560$ billion to $\\S590$ billion [3]. Non-U.S. time deposits are noted as uninsured [1].\n\nA key strategic inference can be drawn from the changes in deposit mix. The decline in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of deposit (CDs), and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, is explicitly linked to actions taken to manage under the asset cap [10]. This suggests a strategic move to optimize the composition of the balance sheet, potentially favoring lower-cost or less regulated funding sources while managing overall asset size constraints. While total loans increased modestly and showed better credit quality, the significant growth in total deposits, particularly in core domestic noninterest-bearing and savings accounts, alongside the targeted reduction in certain deposit types, highlights a strategic focus on balance sheet structure and regulatory compliance.\n\nFrom December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, total loans saw a modest increase driven by commercial growth offset by consumer declines, while total deposits increased substantially, with a strategic shift away from time and non-U.S. deposits linked to asset cap management."}

Derivative exposure amounts were calculated using SA-CCR at December 31, 2020, and the current exposure method at December 31, 2019 [1, 8, 12].\n\nTotal loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt [10].

The dividend rate per share increased from $3.21 in 2019 to $3.72 in 2020 [4, 8]. However, the total dividends paid decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, likely influenced by share repurchases [12]. In 2020, approximately 109 percent of free cash flow ($5.5 billion) was returned to shareholders through share repurchases ($2.6 billion) and dividends [10, 12]. The significant increase in retained earnings from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by net income exceeding dividends and other equity movements. The relatively flat retained earnings from 2019 to 2020 resulted from net income being largely offset by dividends paid and other factors impacting equity.\n\n![Total dividends paid for 2019 and 2020]().\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the company's net income saw a slight increase, while its retained earnings increased significantly from 2018 to 2019 before remaining relatively stable through 2020, primarily influenced by net income, revenue fluctuations, and the level of dividends paid and share repurchases."}

This resulted in a decrease in individuals served through the commercial business [3, 10].\n\nConversely, the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage increased [3, 7, 10].

Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, an increase in the discount rate decreases the plan obligations [6]. For 2022, the actuarial gain for both pension and other retiree benefits was primarily related to increases in discount rates [8]. This reduction in benefit obligations due to higher discount rates leads to an improvement in the funded status (plan assets minus benefit obligation) [6].\n\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption impacts the defined benefit expense calculation [4], specifically the expected return component of the net periodic benefit cost [Image 3]. A decrease in the expected return rate for Pension Benefits from 6.5% to 5.5% would generally increase the net periodic benefit cost (or decrease the net periodic credit) for the period, while the constant rate for Other Retiree Benefits (8.4%) would have a more consistent impact on this component year-over-year. However, the significant increase in discount rates had a more substantial impact on the actuarial gain recognized in AOCI and the overall change in benefit obligation [8, Image 6, Image 8].\n\nThe net amount recognized on the balance sheet, which represents the funded status, is significantly impacted by the change in the benefit obligation. An increase in discount rates leads to actuarial gains, which reduce the benefit obligation and improve the funded status [8, Image 6]. For Pension Benefits, the net amount recognized (funded status) improved from an underfunded status of $(5,428) million in 2021 to $(2,435) million in 2022. For Other Retiree Benefits, the funded status improved from a surplus of $2,238 million in 2021 to $3,819 million in 2022. ![Classification of net amount recognized and amounts recognized in AOCI](). This improvement in funded status is largely attributable to the decrease in the benefit obligation resulting from the increased discount rates [6, 8, Image 6].\n\nThe increase in discount rates for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits from 2021 to 2022, coupled with a decrease in the expected return assumption for Pension Benefits and a stable rate for Other Retiree Benefits, resulted in a significant actuarial gain primarily due to the higher discount rates, which improved the net amount recognized (funded status)."}

The Media segment also includes the operations of Peacock, which generated significant revenue in 2021 ($778 million) compared to 2020 ($118 million) but also incurred substantial operating costs and expenses ($2.5 billion in 2021 vs $781 million in 2020) as the company invested in content and grew its customer base [6, 4].\n*   **Studios:** Revenue increased as film and television production operations returned to full capacity [6].\n*   **Theme Parks:** Revenue increased dramatically (141.2%), and Adjusted EBITDA shifted from a significant loss in 2020 to a gain in 2021, reflecting the impact of temporary closures and capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 in the prior year and the opening of a new park in Beijing [6].\n\nExpenses were impacted by various factors including costs incurred in response to COVID-19 and severance charges in prior periods, partially offset by costs related to new initiatives like Sky Glass and XClass TV [3]. Cost savings from prior year initiatives like severance were being realized, although some might be reinvested [3].\n![Corporate and Other segment revenue, operating costs, and Adjusted EBITDA performance from 2019 to 2021](image7)\n\nWhile total customer relationships for the overall company remained relatively consistent from 2020 to 2021 with decreases in some areas offset by increases in others [11], this metric primarily relates to broadband, video, and voice customers and does not directly represent the performance of NBCUniversal's core media and theme park customer bases. Expected declines in network subscribers and audience ratings are anticipated due to competition and changing consumption patterns [4]. Peacock continued to grow its customer base [6].\n\nOverall, revenue recovery and growth, particularly in Theme Parks and Studios as operations returned to normal, and the growth of Peacock revenue in the Media segment, significantly impacted NBCUniversal's financial performance positively in 2021 compared to the heavily impacted 2020, despite higher costs associated with investments and the Olympics broadcast impacting Media Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nRevenue trends, driven by post-COVID-19 recovery and segment-specific performance, had a significant positive impact on NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2020 to 2021."}

In 2020, Credit risk RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. This increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities resulting from the E*TRADE acquisition, growth in Lending commitments, and higher Equity investments [3].\n\n![Table showing changes in Credit Risk RWA, Market Risk RWA, and Operational Risk RWA from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 under Standardized and Advanced approaches.](image4)\n\nAs shown in the table, Credit Risk RWA increased significantly from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, rising from $342,684 million to $387,066 million under the Standardized approach and from $228,927 million to $284,930 million under the Advanced approach. This substantial increase in RWA means that, assuming capital levels remained constant, the institution's risk-based capital ratios would decrease, as RWA is the denominator in these ratios [1], [2].\n\nThe External TLAC (Total loss-absorbing capacity) buffer requirements are also partly calculated as a percentage of total RWA [7].

Despite this minor percentage decrease, the nominal amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, indicating the institution increased its loss-absorbing capacity in dollar terms. The decrease in the ratio is primarily due to the increase in the RWA denominator [4], [6]. Maintaining sufficient TLAC buffers is crucial to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and executive bonuses [7].\n\nThe increase in RWA required the financial institution to hold more capital to maintain its capital ratios or risk those ratios declining.

The net effect for 2018 to 2019 was an increase in net interest income of $8,190 million [image2]. The difference highlights that while rate changes impacted both periods, the sharp drop in interest rates in 2020 had a much larger negative impact on interest income than the corresponding decrease in interest expense, resulting in a significant decline in Net Interest Income for 2020, whereas favorable volume growth and rate impacts on expenses led to an increase in Net Interest Income in 2019.\n\nThe reported results of operations are structured around four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, plus remaining operations in \"All Other\" [4], [11].\n\n![Diagram showing Bank of America's organizational structure by business segments](image1)\n\nThe changes in net interest income and expense filter through these segments based on the activities they manage [4], [6], [7], [8].

Similarly, Global Wealth & Investment Management's net interest income also decreased [image8], contributing to the overall trend. Business lending revenue, primarily driven by lower interest rates, also decreased [10], impacting the Global Banking segment. The organizational structure provides the framework for reporting and evaluating how these macro-level changes in interest income and expense affect the performance of different parts of the bank.\n\nThe major difference in the changes was that net interest income decreased significantly by approximately $5.6 billion from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates, whereas it increased by approximately $8.2 billion from 2018 to 2019 due to favorable volume and rate effects, and these changes are reflected in the financial performance of the bank's various business segments."}

The significant increase in cash and short-term investments, despite low interest rates negatively impacting income, reflects a continued emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and prioritizing safety over yield [4]. The large increase in equity security holdings contributes to the overall growth in invested assets driven by increased float but also introduces greater volatility into reported earnings due to unrealized gains and losses from market price changes [7]. The decline in interest income from cash and fixed income holdings, as shown by the overall decrease in net investment income [7], directly impacts the profitability of the insurance business's investment portfolio, although pre-tax underwriting earnings were generated in each of the past three years, resulting in a negative cost of float [8].\n\nNet investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower interest rates, while the asset composition shifted towards higher balances of cash/short-term investments and equity securities, reflecting liquidity preference and market value changes."}

As such, it is added back to net income in the calculation of net cash provided by operating activities because it reduced net income but did not require an outflow of cash in the current period [Image 4]. This add-back increases the reported cash flow from operating activities.

A significant portion of this increase stems from financing activities with the Siemens Group, which provided substantial inflows from borrowings, including US$10.0 billion and an additional €850 million in fiscal year 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian [12]. This led to a sharp rise in Liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities, increasing from €2,982 million to €11,708 million [Image1]. Siemens Healthineers also utilized credit facilities granted by the Siemens Group, with the utilized amount rising from €166 million to €311 million [10]. Remaining current liabilities also increased from €1,936 million to €3,104 million [Image2], and remaining non-current liabilities rose from €969 million to €2,686 million [Image5], with deferred tax liabilities being a significant component [Image5].\n\nEquity also saw a substantial increase during this period.\n![Table summarizing key balance sheet items, including a large increase in Total equity and Net debt (including pensions) in 2021](image3)\nTotal equity rose by €3,828 million to €16,339 million [7], or from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021 [Image3]. This increase was primarily a result of issuing new shares of Siemens Healthineers AG in March 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian [7]. The capital increase resulted in an increase in issued capital by €53 million [4, 7, Image6] and a significant rise in the capital reserve by €2,284 million [4] or €2,275 million (including effects from transaction costs and taxes) [7], increasing from €13,476 million to €15,818 million [Image6]. Other factors influencing equity included net income for the year, which increased unappropriated net income, more than offsetting the negative effect of the dividend distribution for fiscal year 2020 (€856 million) [4, 9], resulting in an increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million overall [4].\n![Table detailing the components of equity, showing increases in Issued capital, Capital reserve, and Treasury shares, resulting in higher total equity attributable to shareholders](image6)\nConversely, treasury shares increased significantly from €36 million to €240 million [Image6], representing a €203 million increase [1], mainly due to repurchases for share-based payment programs and the use of capital reserves [1, 4]. Despite the absolute increase in equity, the equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, mainly because of the significant increase in loan liabilities, which was offset by the capital increase [4].\n\nSiemens Healthineers' liabilities increased significantly primarily due to borrowings from the Siemens Group to finance the Varian acquisition, while equity increased substantially due to a capital increase from issuing new shares for the same acquisition."}

This decrease was primarily offset by a substantial increase in Card Member loans and receivables [9]. On the liabilities side, the decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in customer deposits and debt maturities, partially offset by the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities [9].\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows detail the activities that resulted in the overall change in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n![Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image7)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $10,937 million [image7]. This was influenced by significant investing activities, particularly a $27,557 million increase in Card Member loans and receivables, partially offset by sales, maturities, and redemptions of investment securities totaling $20,032 million [image7]. Financing activities also showed a large net use of cash ($14,933 million), driven primarily by share repurchases ($7,652 million) and payments of long-term debt ($11,662 million), partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt ($7,788 million) [image7]. Operating activities provided $14,645 million in cash [image7].\n\nComprehensive income, while contributing to the change in shareholders' equity, was significantly smaller in magnitude than the changes in total assets and liabilities.

Comprehensive income increases equity, which, along with changes in liabilities, balances the changes in assets. The large shifts in assets and liabilities shown on the balance sheet are primarily explained by the significant movements detailed in the cash flow statement related to operating, investing (like receivables and investments), and financing (like deposits and debt) activities, rather than comprehensive income alone.\n\nTotal assets decreased by $2,819 million and total liabilities decreased by $2,012 million from 2020 to 2021, a change primarily driven by shifts in Card Member receivables, investment securities, customer deposits, and debt, as reflected in cash flow activities, with comprehensive income being a smaller component of the overall change in equity."}

Factors contributing to the change during the year include additions to right-of-use assets (representing new leases), re-measurement of lease liabilities (due to changes in lease terms like extensions), depreciation and impairment charges, and the effect of movements in exchange rates [![Consolidated balance sheet extract showing the cost, accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and carrying amounts of right-of-use assets for the year ended 28 June 2020.]()](image6) [6].

A major observation is the fluctuation in the effective tax rate, driven by specific events and ongoing tax positions.\n\nIn 2019, the company reported a high effective tax rate of 41% [image2]. This rate was significantly impacted by specific items disclosed in the tax reconciliation. Notably, there was a substantial charge of $2,472 million related to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property [image2]. This derecognition occurred as a result of changes in U.S. Treasury regulations regarding the deductibility of dividend income from foreign corporations, which led the company to relinquish a federal tax basis step-up [8]. Partially offsetting this was a benefit of $570 million from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets, stemming from \"check-the-box\" elections by foreign subsidiaries [image2], [8].\n\n![Reconciliation of expected income tax provision to effective tax rate showing significant items](image2)\n\nFollowing the events of 2019, the effective tax rate dropped sharply to 9% in 2020 and increased slightly to 12% in 2021 [image2].

The total tax benefits realized from share-based awards also increased significantly over the period [1].\n\n![Income tax expense related to share-based compensation](image8)\n\nAnother notable trend is the substantial increase in unrecognized tax benefits, which rose from $1,705 million at the end of fiscal 2019 to $1,901 million in 2020 and $2,136 million in 2021 [image5], [10]. This increase in 2021 was primarily attributed to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes where licensees withheld taxes at a higher rate than the company believes is owed [10]. The company is also under examination by various tax authorities globally, primarily regarding transfer pricing [10].\n\n![Changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits](image5)\n\nThe significant changes and trends in Qualcomm's tax provisions include a volatile effective tax rate influenced by large, specific tax events in 2019, followed by lower rates in 2020 and 2021, coupled with an increasing balance of unrecognized tax benefits and rising tax benefits from specific items like share-based awards and R&D credits."}

This was primarily driven by lower interest rates [4], [6].

The objective is to optimize the capital structure, improve returns to shareholders, and offset the dilutive effect of share-based awards [11]. In 2020, the company repurchased 14 million shares at an aggregate cost of $4,250 million [5]. This was a decrease compared to 2019, when 22 million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $5,500 million [5].\n\n![Table showing common share repurchases in shares, average price, and aggregate cost for 2020 and 2019.](image1)\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the company had authorization to purchase up to 58 million shares [7].\n\nConcerning gross unrecognized tax benefits, the balance at the end of the period increased from $1,423 million as of December 31, 2019, to $1,829 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n![Table detailing the changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, showing beginning and ending balances and changes from current and prior year tax positions, settlements, and statute of limitations lapses.](image5)\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits represent potential future tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate [12]. The company classifies associated interest and penalties as income taxes, accruing $128 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $76 million in 2019 [12]. While the balance increased, the company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [6].\n\nThe implications for the financial position are that share repurchases reduced cash and equity on the balance sheet, contributing to optimizing the capital structure and potentially improving shareholder returns (like EPS) [11]. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits represents a growing potential long-term liability on the balance sheet, reflecting uncertain tax positions, and could impact future tax expenses and cash flows depending on resolution through settlements or audits [12].\n\nThe company's common share repurchases decreased from 2019 to 2020, while gross unrecognized tax benefits increased, impacting equity (via repurchases) and potentially liabilities (via unrecognized tax benefits) on the financial statements."}

SG&A/R&D expenses increased due to higher labor costs resulting from increased headcount and investments aligned with the company's growth strategy, including acquisition-related expenses [7, 12].\n\nIn summary, sales volume and operating profit both increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization despite headwinds from increased manufacturing and operating costs."}

The core results for 2020 were USD 13,158 million for Net Income and USD 5.78 for Basic EPS. Core results were significantly higher than IFRS results in 2020.\n\nFor the year 2021:\n![Summary of Novartis's 2021 IFRS and Core financial results, including Net Income and Basic EPS from continuing operations.](image8)\nIn 2021, the IFRS Net Income was USD 24,018 million and Basic EPS was USD 10.71. The core results for 2021 were USD 14,094 million for Net Income and USD 6.29 for Basic EPS. In contrast to 2020, core results were significantly lower than IFRS results in 2021.\n\nThe difference between IFRS results and core results is due to specific adjustments made to exclude items that are considered non-core or significant infrequent events. These adjustments are detailed in the reconciliation tables.\n\n![Detailed breakdown of adjustments from IFRS to Core results for 2021 and 2020, categorized by type and financial statement line item.](image4)\nThe table above shows the adjustments made from IFRS to core results. The total adjustments reconcile the IFRS and core figures. Several categories of adjustments contribute to the overall difference.\n\nThe most significant adjustments impacting the difference between IFRS Net Income and Core Net Income generally include:\n1.  **Amortization of intangible assets:** These are non-cash expenses from acquired intangible assets. Adding these back increases core results relative to IFRS [1].\n2.  **Impairments:** Charges related to the reduction in value of assets. These are often specific events and are added back for core results [1].\n3.  **Adjustments related to income from associated companies:** As seen in Image 4, these adjustments can be very large and significantly impact the pre-tax income reconciliation. For example, in 2021, a large negative adjustment of USD 14,556 million was made to income from associated companies, significantly lowering the core income before tax compared to IFRS [12]. A similarly large negative adjustment (-14,346 million) is shown in Image 4 for 2020, although other reconciliations suggest a different magnitude for 2020. The specific nature of the items included or excluded from core income from associated companies drives this significant difference.\n4.  **Income taxes on adjustments:** Taxes are adjusted to reflect the tax impact of the core adjustments [1, 12].\n\nLooking at the magnitude of the adjustments in Image 4 for 2021, the adjustment related to income from associated companies (-14,556 million) was the largest single item impacting the difference between IFRS and Core results, driving Core Net Income substantially below IFRS Net Income. In 2020, while amortization (3,764 million) and impairments (1,335 million) were significant positive adjustments, the income from associated companies adjustment also played a substantial role, leading to core results being higher than IFRS results overall.\n\nThe most significant adjustments affecting Net Income and Basic EPS were Amortization of intangible assets, Impairments, and adjustments related to income from associated companies."}

They remain opportunistic, accelerating plans in new or existing markets when opportunities arise [11].\n\nThe impact of this strategy is clearly reflected in the growth of their international store network.\n\n![A bar chart showing Lovisa's gross margin percentage from FY16 to FY20.](image1)\n\nImage 2 outlines the international expansion as a primary growth pillar, highlighting strategies like rolling out stores in large international markets such as the USA, France, and the UK, and considering franchise partners [image2].\n\n![A table summarizing Lovisa's growth pillars, including international expansion, supply chain, store performance, brand proliferation, and trend analysis, along with strategies, risks, and achievements.](image2)\n\nThe success of the international expansion strategy is quantitatively demonstrated by the increase in the total number of stores and the specific growth in various international territories between 2016 and 2020.\n\n![A table showing Lovisa's store count broken down by country from 2016 to 2020.](image8)\n\nAs seen in the data, the total store count grew from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020 [image8]. Several new territories saw substantial increases: the United Kingdom grew from 3 stores in 2016 to 42 in 2020, France from 0 to 21, and the USA from 0 to 48 [image8]. Other territories like Spain saw initial growth before store counts were reduced, while the Middle East and Vietnam (which includes franchised stores) also expanded their presence [image8, 3].\n\nLovisa Holdings Limited's international store expansion strategy significantly increased its store count in new territories between 2016 and 2020, contributing substantially to the overall growth in its global footprint."}

Both acquisitions resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill being recorded [1, 8]. For both, this goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities expected from integrating the acquired business's technology with the Company’s existing offerings [1, 6]. A shared characteristic is that the majority of the recorded goodwill for both acquisitions is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes [1, 6]. Additionally, the fair values assigned in both allocations are based on management's estimates and assumptions and are considered preliminary, expected to be finalized within one year from the acquisition date [1, 8].\n\nThe fair value allocation of net assets acquired differed significantly in total value and the specific categories of assets and liabilities recorded between the ClickSoftware and Salesforce.org acquisitions, although both included substantial goodwill attributed similarly and classified as non-deductible for U.S. income tax purposes."}

The strategy involves the timely and profitable opening of new stores overseas [3], focusing on securing quality retail sites in high pedestrian traffic locations, typically in prime shopping centres and malls [8]. Lovisa has refined a global store model with a target size and a homogenised layout to facilitate quick and low-cost roll-outs, often taking only about 14 days to fit out a new store [8].\n\n![Table showing the number of Lovisa stores by country from 2016 to 2020, indicating significant international expansion](image1)\n\nAs evidenced by the data, Lovisa substantially increased its store count across numerous international markets from 250 total stores in 2016 to 435 in 2020 [image1]. This expansion included significant growth in existing markets like the United Kingdom (from 3 to 42 stores) and South Africa (from 36 to 62), and successful entry into new major markets such as France and the USA, reaching 21 and 48 stores respectively by 2020, after starting from zero or single digits in 2016 [image1, image2].

Specifically, achievements highlighted include opening a net total of 47 stores outside of Australia in a year, with significant numbers in key international markets [image2]. The ability to quickly establish a presence in new markets, leveraging a standardised store design, is crucial to this success [8].\n\n![Image of a Lovisa store interior showcasing multiple displays of jewellery](image6)\n\nHowever, this expansion takes place within a highly competitive fast fashion jewellery sector which has relatively low barriers to entry [2]. Challenges include the costs and time required to replicate Lovisa's existing network and systems [2, 5]. Risks explicitly associated with international expansion include intense competition, general retail and economic conditions, the potential failure to successfully implement growth strategies, and the critical challenge of securing appropriately sized sites in good locations [image2]. Lovisa mitigates these risks by leveraging local networks and being nimble and opportunistic when assessing and entering new markets, also closely monitoring conditions like those impacted by COVID-19 [12].\n\nLovisa's international store expansion strategy from 2016 to 2020 has focused on rapid, standardised roll-outs into key global markets, resulting in significant store growth and proven international profitability despite facing competition and site acquisition challenges."}

Excluding the favourable impact of significant items and adverse foreign currency effects, net interest income decreased by $2.7\\mathsf{b n}$ or $9\\%$ [7].

The decrease in net charge-offs and past-due loans in the credit card portfolio was linked to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19 [11], implying that while some consumers faced financial challenges, government aid helped mitigate widespread defaults and delinquencies.\n\nThe home equity portfolio also saw a decrease in outstanding balances.

This indicates that consumers were less inclined to apply for new home equity loans or lines of credit and were actively paying down existing balances, suggesting a preference for debt reduction and reduced leveraging of home equity during this period of economic uncertainty.\n\nOverall, changes in both credit card and home equity metrics between 2019 and 2020 suggest a consumer behavior shift towards reduced borrowing, increased debt repayment, and a preference for using debit cards over credit cards for purchases, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and related government stimulus and support programs."}

Given the company's policy of selling products at prevailing market prices, fluctuations in these prices directly affect financial performance [4]. Significant variations, especially if adverse, can even impact the feasibility and timing of project development or the continuation of existing operations [1].\n\n![Table showing estimated impact of commodity price changes on profit and EBITDA](image5)\nThe estimated impact of commodity price changes is substantial, as illustrated by the table showing that a mere US$1 per tonne decline in the iron ore price could impact FY2021 profit after taxation by US$163 million [4, image5]. Similarly, changes in coal and nickel prices also have quantifiable effects on profit and EBITDA [image5].\n\nFocusing on coal, lower average realised prices for metallurgical coal partially offset revenue increases from other commodities in FY2021 [7]. Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$1.3 billion, with lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, contributing US$0.7 billion to this decrease [2]. The average realised price for metallurgical coal in FY2021 was US$106.64 per tonne, down from US$130.97 in FY2020 [image6]. Challenges such as uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China also impact market conditions and guidance [3].\n\n![Table showing Coal's financial performance and average realised prices](image6)\n\nFor nickel, the average realised sales price increased significantly in FY2021 to US$16,250 per tonne, up from US\\$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 [6]. This higher price was a primary contributor to the overall increase in revenue [7] and directly led to a US$296 million increase in Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West [9]. The nickel price benefitted from factors including positive investor sentiment, a strong rebound in end-use demand across various regions, supply disruptions in multiple regions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks [6]. However, this positive impact was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs driven by the stronger nickel price [9].\n\nKey drivers behind these impacts include global economic and geopolitical factors, commodity supply and demand dynamics (including inventory levels), technological changes, product substitution, tariffs, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations [4, 5]. For nickel specifically, investor sentiment, end-use demand, and supply disruptions played significant roles [6].

These changes resulted in a notable increase in total revenue.\n\nThe net interest income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 [7]. This decline was primarily due to factors such as lower interest rates, reduced loan balances resulting from soft demand and elevated prepayments/refinancing, the sale of the student loan portfolio, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization [7]. This decrease in net interest income negatively impacted total revenue [9].\n\nConversely, noninterest income increased dramatically, rising from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, a 104% change.\n![Income Statement showing changes in revenue and expenses from 2020 to 2021](image2)\nThis substantial increase in noninterest income was driven by several factors, including higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities, higher realized gains on equity security sales, lower impairment of equity securities [9], and gains from the sales of certain businesses, such as the Corporate Trust Services business, the student loan portfolio, and WFAM [9]. However, this increase was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the sale of WFAM [9], lower lease income resulting from a $268 million impairment of certain rail cars [1, 9], and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk [9]. Despite the offsets, the positive drivers significantly outweighed the negative ones, leading to the large increase in noninterest income.\n\nThe combination of lower net interest income and substantially higher noninterest income led to an overall increase in total revenue in 2021 compared to 2020 [12].

The total equity, including non-controlling interests, increased from €9,782 million to €16,339 million over the same period.\n\nA major driver of this increase was the issuance of new shares. The Issued capital increased from €1,000 million to €1,128 million [1, 11].\n![Consolidated statements of changes in equity detail shows Issued capital changes](image6)\nImage 6 illustrates increases from the \"Issuance of new shares,\" adding €75 million in fiscal year 2020 and €53 million in fiscal year 2021.

These shares were placed with institutional investors at a premium [9]. Similarly, 75,000,000 new shares were issued in September 2020 [6].\n\nCorresponding to the issuance of new shares at a premium, the Capital reserve saw a significant increase.\n![Consolidated statements of changes in equity detail shows Capital reserve changes](image6)\nImage 6 indicates the Capital reserve grew from €10,801 million to €15,818 million, primarily due to the premiums from the issuance of new shares (shown as increases of €2,629 million in FY2020 and €2,275 million in FY2021 in the table).

The International Operated Markets segment saw a significant decrease of 31% in operating income, falling from $4,789 million in 2019 to $3,315 million in 2020, largely as a result of sales declines due to COVID-19, coupled with marketing support, COVID-19 related expenses, lower gains on restaurant sales, and higher closing costs [10, 5].

In 2019, operating activities provided $14,770 million, which rose to $18,197 million in 2020 [10]. This increase was $3,426 million year-over-year [4, 10]. The primary driver for this increase was the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables [10], including sales of financing receivables totalling $3,076 million [1]. Other factors contributing to the increase included payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief programs related to COVID-19 [1]. These positive impacts were partially offset by increased workforce rebalancing payments, a net increase in cash payments for income taxes, and performance-related declines within net income [1].\n\n![This table shows IBM's consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, detailing net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as the effect of exchange rates and the net change in cash.](image1)\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased substantially in 2020. In 2019, investing activities used $26,936 million, which dramatically decreased to a usage of only $3,028 million in 2020 [image1]. This represents a decrease in net cash used for investing activities of $23,908 million [6]. The main reason for this significant decrease in cash used was a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions by $32,294 million, primarily due to the large Red Hat acquisition occurring in the prior year (2019) [9]. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($6,245 million decrease), driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations, and an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($896 million increase) [9].\n\nFinancing activities transitioned from being a source of cash in 2019 to a significant use of cash in 2020. In 2019, financing activities provided $9,042 million, whereas in 2020, they used $9,721 million [image1]. This change from a net source to a net use represents an $18,763 million shift year-to-year [2]. The decrease in total equity in 2020 was primarily influenced by dividends paid, which totalled $5,797 million in 2020 [3, 10], and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by net income and common stock increases [3]. Total debt also decreased by $1,361 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to early retirements and maturities partially offset by issuances [11].\n\nOverall, the combined impact of these changes resulted in a positive net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to a negative change in 2019. In 2019, there was a net decrease of $3,290 million, while in 2020, there was a net increase of $5,361 million [image1]. The significant decrease in cash used for investing activities, primarily due to the absence of a large acquisition like Red Hat, coupled with the increase in cash from operating activities, more than offset the shift of financing activities from being a source of cash to a use of cash.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, IBM saw increased cash from operations, significantly reduced cash usage in investing activities due to fewer acquisitions, and a shift in financing activities from providing cash to using cash, resulting in an overall increase in cash balances."}

The recognition of these premiums involves complex factors such as CMS risk adjustment methodology, MLRs, and quality bonuses, which can impact revenue and earnings [9, 10]. While overall revenue and earnings increased, factors like reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements due to COVID-19 partially offset some gains [4].

Interest income decreased, primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans [5]. This decline in yield and the resulting decrease in net interest income were primarily driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [5, 8]. The decline in net interest income was also described as being driven by lower revolving Card Member loan balances, which were partially offset by lower cost of funds [10]. Although overall Card Member loans increased, this growth was less than the growth in billed business, a phenomenon attributed in part to higher paydown rates driven by the continued liquidity and financial strength of the customer base [2].\n\nThe net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, primarily influenced by lower interest income resulting from higher paydown rates and lower revolving loan balances."}

Earnings from operations saw an even larger increase of 14% in 2020, including a 20% increase at United Healthcare and 7% at Optum [1]. Revenue and earnings growth at OptumHealth were particularly driven by organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery, although reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements due to COVID-19 partially offset these gains [12].

This represents a total decrease of 72 basis points from 2020 to 2022.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decrease in gross margin percentage. The gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by decreases in core merchandise categories, predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries [5]. A significant factor in 2022 was a 19 basis-point decrease due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs [5], reflecting the impact of inflation [4, 10]. Increased 2% rewards also negatively impacted gross margin [3, 5].\n\nThe company's merchandising and pricing strategies in response to increased merchandise costs due to inflation also played a role, as these strategies may involve reducing prices or holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of fully passing them on to members, which negatively impacts gross margin percentage [10].\n\nWarehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, positively impacted gross margin [3, 5]. However, the gasoline business generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to non-gasoline business, and rising gasoline prices, while benefiting net sales growth, tend to negatively impact the gross margin percentage [12]. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively impacted gross margin [5].\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, LIFO charges from higher merchandise costs, increased 2% rewards, and the impact of pricing strategies in an inflationary environment, partially offset by benefits from ancillary businesses like gasoline and ceasing COVID-19 related incremental wages."}

This line item increased to USD 15.3 billion in 2021 from USD 673 million in 2020, an increase of USD 14.7 billion. [2]. This substantial rise was mainly due to a gain of USD 14.6 billion recognized on the divestment of the investment in Roche [2].\n\nOperating income also showed improvement, increasing by 53% (or 48% in constant currencies) [7], mainly driven by lower legal settlements, lower impairments, and lower amortization, partly offset by unfavorable gross margin and lower sales [7].\n\n![Table showing Core operating income from continuing operations by segment (Innovative Medicines, Sandoz, Corporate) for the years ended Dec 31, 2021, and Dec 31, 2020, along with the percentage of net sales to third parties and the percentage change in USD and constant currencies.](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the Group repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares during 2021, leading to a decrease in the total number of shares outstanding by 21.9 million versus December 31, 2020 [10]. A reduced number of outstanding shares generally results in higher earnings per share if net income increases or remains stable.\n\nThe percentage increase in total basic earnings per share (USD) from 2020 to 2021 was 202%, driven primarily by a significant gain from the divestment of the investment in Roche, improved operating income, and a decrease in the number of outstanding shares due to repurchases."}

The total debt is significantly higher than the committed credit facilities, indicating a primary reliance on longer-term financing rather than drawing heavily on credit lines for core funding. The debt is primarily fixed-rate [11], suggesting a strategy to lock in financing costs and mitigate interest rate risk. The maturity profile of the long-term debt shows substantial amounts due in 2026 and thereafter [Image6], indicating a focus on long-term financing with staggered maturities.\n\nFurthermore, the company maintains a conservative approach, predominantly working with investment-grade financial institutions [4], which is supported by their own investment-grade credit ratings from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch [Image7]. They also successfully meet financial covenants associated with their credit facilities, such as the consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense ratio [7], indicating a healthy financial position capable of supporting their debt levels. While committed credit facilities provide backup liquidity, the company also has access to a commercial paper program [6] and utilizes the sale of accounts receivable as a source of cash flow [10, 12], diversifying their liquidity sources.

This rapid growth was heavily influenced by congressional acts in the mid-1800s, particularly the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered pioneers 160 acres of land if they settled and improved it [5]. This policy spurred a \"great tide of emigration for the west and especially Nebraska,\" which saw the largest number of land acquisitions under the Act by 1900 [5].\n\nAnother crucial factor was the development of transportation infrastructure. The Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862 led to the rapid construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, which transformed Nebraska into a \"booming agricultural state\" and a corridor for westward expansion [5]. Town development became heavily reliant on rail connections, as towns without a rail line often did not survive [10]. Settlers and immigrants, including groups from the Midwest, New England, Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, arrived and often settled in ethnic clusters across the county [2, 7]. These groups formed strong religious congregations which served as cultural and community focal points [12].\n![A white church with a steeple and stained glass windows sits among trees and gravestones on a cloudy day.](image5)\nFollowing the peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population slowly declined, although it remained significantly higher than pre-boom levels throughout the 20th century [1, image2]. This decline and subsequent fluctuation were influenced by changes in the agricultural economy. Mechanization altered the scale of farming, leading to farm consolidation, where the number of individual farms declined significantly while the average farm size increased [6].\n![A tall concrete grain elevator labeled FARMERS CO-OP GILTNER NEB stands against a cloudy sky.](image1)\n![A large concrete grain elevator complex with multiple silos and conveyor systems is shown next to railroad tracks.](image4)\nThese changes had \"significant impacts on rural life\" [6] and contributed to population struggles in many of the county's smaller towns, most of which peaked in population between 1900 and 1940 before experiencing declines [8, 9].\n\nHamilton County's population surged dramatically in the late 1800s due to policies like the Homestead Act and the development of the railroad, reaching a peak in 1890, after which it gradually declined and fluctuated through 2000, partly due to changes in agriculture leading to farm consolidation."}

Comparing different pre-training configurations shows that the increase is much more significant when using pre-trained source language embeddings, indicating that the primary gain comes from a better encoding of the source sentence [12].\n\n![BLEU scores for several language pairs translating to English, comparing standard training and pre-training with standard or pre-trained source/target embeddings.](image3)\n\nThe impact of pre-training varies significantly between language pairs, particularly when considering their resource levels. For higher-resource languages, the gains are consistent but relatively smaller, around 3 BLEU points for all three language pairs tested [2]. In contrast, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains can be either quite small or very large [2]. For instance, GL→EN, an extremely low-resource pair [6, image6], sees a substantial gain of up to 11 BLEU points [2], while AZ→EN and BE→EN, also low-resource [6, image6], show only small gains [2]. This suggests that pre-trained embeddings are particularly useful for bootstrapping models for languages that are \"on the threshold of being able to produce reasonable translations\" [2].\n\nWhen translating into Portuguese, the gains also vary depending on the source language. Languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), which have very low baseline BLEU scores, see larger accuracy gains from pre-training compared to languages like French (FR) or Italian (IT) which are more similar to Portuguese [9].\n\n![BLEU scores for several source languages translating to Portuguese, showing standard training and pre-training results with BLEU gain.](image2)\n\nIn multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder, pre-training also affects BLEU scores. When training on pairs of similar low-resource and higher-resource languages and evaluating on the low-resource language, the gains from pre-training tend to correlate with the similarity of the language pairs [10]. For example, the GL/PT pair, which has the highest similarity, shows the largest gains from pre-training in a multilingual setup, while the BE/RU pair, with the lowest similarity, shows a small decrease [10, image5].\n\n![BLEU scores for multilingual systems trained on pairs of languages (GL+PT, AZ+TR, BE+RU) evaluating on the low-resource language, comparing bilingual, standard multilingual, pre-trained multilingual, and aligned pre-trained multilingual systems.](image5)\n\nBeyond quantitative improvements, pre-training leads to qualitative enhancements in translations. It helps models capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [1]. Examples show that the best systems, benefiting from pre-training, can successfully translate specific entities like person's names and multi-word phrases, indicating better representations of less frequent concepts [1].\n\n![Qualitative comparison of a Spanish source sentence translated to English by a standard bilingual system and a pre-trained multilingual system, showing better translation of names and phrases in the latter.](image8)\n\nFurthermore, the gain from pre-training is often highest when the baseline system's performance is poor but not excessively so, typically within a BLEU score range of 3-4 [11]. This suggests that a minimally effective system is needed for pre-training to be highly effective [11].\n\nPre-training generally increases BLEU scores for various language pairs, with more significant gains observed for low-resource languages or those with lower baseline performance, and it also improves the quality of translations by better handling vocabulary and grammar."}

It operates differently from previous methods that often treated these tasks as independent components in a pipeline, instead sharing parameters and leveraging cross-sentence context through coreference links [2].\n\nOn the SciERC dataset, created specifically for scientific information extraction, the SciIE model demonstrates strong performance across the three main tasks: entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution [8, 9].\n\n![SciIE multi-task model performance on SciERC dataset tasks](image4)\nAs shown in Table 2, the SciIE model achieves competitive F1 scores: 68.1 for entity recognition (Test F1: 64.2), 39.5 for relation extraction (Test F1: 39.3), and 58.0 for coreference resolution (Test F1: 48.2) on the Dev set, outperforming baseline models like E2E Rel and LSTM+CRF configurations on the F1 metric for entity and relation extraction [9]. It also outperforms previous state-of-the-art scientific IE systems on entity and relation extraction [1, 8]. The model is also better at predicting span boundaries [1, 8], which contributes to improved span identification performance [12].\n\nOn the SemEval 17 dataset, which focuses on keyphrase extraction and relation extraction from computer science, physics, and material science articles, the SciIE model also shows strong results compared to previous systems [3, 12].\n\n![SciIE model performance on SemEval 17 tasks compared to baselines](image7)\nTable 4 shows that SciIE achieves an overall F1 score of 44.7 on the SemEval 17 test set, outperforming the best reported system in the SemEval leaderboard (43.0 Overall F1) and a prior state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction model (45.3 F1 for relation extraction, but no overall score provided) [11, 12]. Notably, SciIE shows more significant improvement in span identification (58.6 F1) compared to previous models, which the authors attribute to its ability to enumerate spans rather than relying on standard BIO tagging [12]. The model also has competitive results in relation extraction [12]. The gain observed on SemEval 17 is less than on SciERC, mainly because SemEval 17 does not include coreference links, and the relation types are less comprehensive [12].\n\nThe impact of coreference links on performance is significant, particularly for downstream tasks like knowledge graph construction [1, 8]. Human evaluation indicates that propagating coreference significantly improves the quality of the automatically constructed knowledge graph [8].\n\n![Precision-recall curves showing benefit of coreference linking for knowledge graph construction](image3)\nFurthermore, the system with coreference linking shows significantly higher recall while maintaining high precision compared to a system without coreference linking when evaluating the knowledge graph construction process using precision/pseudo-recall curves [7]. This highlights the importance of coreference links in creating a dense and useful knowledge graph from extracted information [1].\n\nIn summary, the SciIE model outperforms previous state-of-the-art scientific IE systems on entity and relation extraction on the SciERC dataset and achieves competitive or superior results on SemEval 17 tasks like span identification, keyphrase extraction, and relation extraction, benefiting from its multi-task architecture and span enumeration capabilities, while coreference linking is shown to be crucial for improving knowledge graph quality and recall of extracted information."}

Furthermore, post-hoc correction is flexible and does not require modifying the parameters of the original language model [6].\n\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances output refinement by using feedback and knowledge from external sources to iteratively improve generated text after the initial creation."}

It begins by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on cosine similarity to the query. This process is then repeated for the children of the selected nodes, moving down through the layers until the leaf nodes are reached. The text from all chosen nodes is then combined [8, 9]. This approach allows control over the specificity and breadth of retrieved information by adjusting parameters like depth and the number of nodes selected at each layer, starting broad and progressively focusing [9].\n\n![Diagram illustrating Tree Traversal (A) and Collapsed Tree (B) retrieval methods.](image3)\n\nIn contrast, the **Collapsed Tree** approach simplifies the search by considering all nodes in the multi-layered tree simultaneously, effectively treating them as being on a single level for comparison [10, 11]. This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones [11].\n\nThe key difference lies in how they handle the tree hierarchy. Tree Traversal explores the hierarchy sequentially from top to bottom, potentially selecting nodes in a fixed ratio of abstract to granular information regardless of the question [3]. Collapsed Tree bypasses the layer-by-layer structure, allowing it to retrieve information at the specific level of granularity best suited for a given question by comparing all nodes at once [3, 10]. Experimental results indicate that the collapsed tree approach generally performs better than tree traversal [3].\n\n![Graph comparing the F1 scores of Collapsed tree and Tree Traversal retrieval methods against context length.](image4)\n\nTree Traversal retrieves information by navigating the tree layer by layer, while Collapsed Tree considers all tree nodes simultaneously for retrieval."}

The paper explores using conditional training and weighted decoding to control these attributes at the dialogue level [5, 12].\n\nWhile controlling question-asking through conditional training is effective in achieving a wide range of question rates [10], when repetition control is also introduced, the rate of question-asking is reduced [10]. This reduction is primarily attributed to features in the repetition control, specifically weighted decoding features like `extrep bigram`, which discourage the repetition of bigrams found in previous utterances. Since many common questions share bigrams (e.g., \"do you,\" \"what is\"), this feature inadvertently prevents the model from producing them, thereby lowering the overall question-asking rate [10].\n\n![Image showing the workflow from low-level controllable attributes to human judgments of conversational aspects and overall quality.](image2)\n\nImage 4 visually confirms this interaction, showing that for the same target question-asking control level (z), the line representing \"Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl\" produces a lower percentage of questions than the line for \"Question-controlled CT\" without explicit repetition control interaction [10].\n\n![Graph comparing the percentage of utterances containing '?' for different question-asking control levels, showing the impact of adding repetition control.](image4)\n\nIt's worth noting that the repetition-controlled baseline model itself has a question-asking rate of 50.0%, which is higher than the human-produced gold data's 28.8% but lower than the rate achieved by the most engaging question-controlled model (65.7%) [3, 11].

Three distinct approaches to retrieval within RAG are Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval.\n\n**Iterative retrieval** involves repeating the retrieve-generate process multiple times. This approach aims to provide more contextual information by using the output or intermediate steps of a previous generation as input for subsequent retrieval steps [3], [8]. As depicted, it cycles through retrieval and generation phases, iterating a specified number of times or until a threshold is met.\n\n**Recursive retrieval** focuses on breaking down complex problems or queries step by step [4], [11]. It often involves transforming or decomposing the initial query based on initial retrieval results, and then using these transformed queries to perform further retrieval. This process can traverse structured data or refine ambiguous parts of a query, gradually converging on the most relevant information [4], [11].\n\n**Adaptive retrieval** allows the Language Model (LLM) to exert flexible and active control over the retrieval process [12]. Instead of a fixed sequence, the LLM can decide whether and when to retrieve information based on the current state or the query, potentially transforming the query or generating special tokens to guide the process [8]. This approach evaluates the necessity of retrieval dynamically based on different scenarios [8].\n\nThese three retrieval processes are visually summarized below, illustrating their distinct flows:\n![Image showing flowcharts for Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval methods in RAG.](image2)\n\nIn summary, Iterative retrieval loops the process to gather more context, Recursive retrieval decomposes complex queries for refined search, and Adaptive retrieval gives the LLM dynamic control over when and how retrieval occurs."}

The type and selection method of these distractors significantly impact how challenging the question is and whether a multi-hop strategy is truly required [6, 9].\n\nIn the standard HotpotQA distractor setting, where TF-IDF is used to select distractors, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves a high F1 score of 67.08 [7, image4, image7]. This indicates that with these specific distractors, many questions can be answered using single-hop reasoning [7]. Weak distractors, such as those allowing answers based solely on entity type matching, contribute to this, accounting for around 35% of questions [12, image1].\n\n![A table showing different question types including multi-hop, weak distractors, redundant evidence, and non-compositional 1-hop.](image1)\n\nWhen more challenging, adversarially selected distractors are used, the performance of a model trained on original data drops significantly. For example, the F1 score for single-paragraph BERT decreases from 67.08 to 46.84 when evaluated on adversarial distractors [2, image2]. Similarly, accuracy drops to 40.73 F1 when using 'Type' distractors [8, image2].\n\n![A table comparing F1 scores of a model trained on original data versus adversarial data, evaluated on original, adversarial, and adversarial + type data.](image2)\n\nHowever, models can recover much of their performance when re-trained on these stronger distractors, achieving F1s of 60.10 on adversarial distractors and 58.42 on '+ Type' distractors [2, 8, image2]. This suggests that while these distractors are more challenging than standard TF-IDF, they may still be insufficient to force complex multi-hop reasoning in all cases [6].\n\nIn the open-domain setting, where the model must retrieve paragraphs from a large collection, the insufficiency of standard retrieval methods like TF-IDF becomes apparent [5, 11]. Failure to retrieve the necessary gold paragraphs severely impacts performance [5]. As shown in the results, the F1 score for single-paragraph BERT in the open-domain setting with 10 or 500 retrieved paragraphs is around 38-39 [10, image4, image7].\n\n![A table showing F1 scores for a single-paragraph BERT model in different settings: Distractor, Open-domain (10 paragraphs), Open-domain (500 paragraphs), and Open-domain with Gold Paragraph.](image4)\n\nCritically, when the two gold paragraphs are explicitly given in the open-domain setting, the F1 score increases significantly to 53.12 [5, image4]. This substantial improvement highlights the major impact of successful retrieval of the gold paragraphs on performance and underscores that retrieval is a significant bottleneck in open-domain multi-hop QA, often more so than the reading comprehension capability itself [5]. Even using a large number of 500 TF-IDF distractors is insufficient to reach the performance achieved when the gold paragraphs are provided [11].\n\nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs is essential for providing the necessary information, and the nature of distractors heavily influences model performance by determining how effectively single-hop strategies can bypass the need for multi-hop reasoning and highlighting the crucial role of effective retrieval in open-domain settings."}

Studies have shown that models capable of capturing sequential or positional information, such as LSTMs and CNNs, tend to perform better on sentiment analysis compared to models like SWEM which typically ignore word order [7, 9, 10]. This is intuitively reasonable because the sentiment conveyed by a sentence can change drastically based on the arrangement of words, as exemplified by phrases like \"not really good\" versus \"really not good\" [7].\n\nTo further investigate the importance of word order, researchers conducted an experiment using an LSTM model trained on shuffled versions of datasets, including the Yelp Polarity dataset, a sentiment analysis task [5, 9]. The rationale was to remove word-order features from the training set and observe the impact on performance [9].\n\n![A table showing the accuracy of LSTM on Yahoo, Yelp P., and SNLI datasets with original and shuffled training data.](image4)\n\nAs shown in the table, training the LSTM on the shuffled Yelp Polarity dataset resulted in a noticeable drop in accuracy from 95.11% to 93.49% [11].

The performance of the LSTM on the shuffled Yelp dataset was observed to be very close to the results obtained with the SWEM model, indicating that the primary difference in performance between LSTM and SWEM on sentiment tasks is due to LSTM's ability to leverage word-order features [12]. This is consistent with observations that SWEM yields inferior accuracies on sentiment analysis datasets compared to CNN/LSTM models [10].\n\nWord-order information significantly impacts the accuracy of LSTM models for sentiment analysis, with performance decreasing when this information is removed from the training data."}

By selecting data that is hard to discriminate using contrastive learning, it effectively identifies typical data points [4, 10] which contributes to label diversity [1].\n\nEvaluation across various datasets shows that selecting hard-to-contrast data consistently yields high performance [5, 6].

Specifically, the claim is negated, and the label indicating whether the warrant supports the claim is inverted [3]. This process is designed to mirror the distribution of statistical cues over both possible labels, effectively eliminating the signal these cues provide [3].\n![An example showing an original argument data point and its corresponding adversarially transformed version where the claim is negated and the alternative warrant is swapped.](image3)\nOn the original Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT) dataset, BERT achieved a peak test set accuracy of 77% [1, 10], which was only three points below the average untrained human baseline [1, 10]. This performance was significantly higher than other models like BoV and BiLSTM, which had peak accuracies around 59% and 59% respectively on the original dataset [image1]. The authors found this high performance surprising given the lack of world knowledge required for the task [10], suggesting BERT was exploiting something other than true argument comprehension [1, 6]. Probing experiments indicated that 71% of BERT's performance came from just considering the warrant (W), and the remaining points from combinations with reason (R, W) and claim (C, W) cues [4, 9], strongly suggesting reliance on spurious statistical cues [1, 4, 9].\n\nWhen models were trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets and evaluated on the adversarial test set, the picture changed dramatically [5]. On this adversarially transformed dataset, BERT's peak performance dropped to 53% [3, 5], with mean and median accuracies around 50% [5, image6]. This level of performance is essentially random accuracy [1, 3, 5, 6]. Other models like BoV and BiLSTM also showed random accuracy on the adversarial dataset, with peak performances of 51.8% and 51.8% respectively [image6]. This indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminated the spurious cues that BERT had been exploiting [5]. The dramatic drop in BERT's performance from near the human baseline on the original dataset to random chance on the adversarial dataset, while other models also perform at random, highlights that BERT was uniquely effective at exploiting the spurious cues present in the original data, and the adversarial transformation neutralizes this ability for all models [1, 6].\n\nThe adversarial transformation caused BERT's peak performance to fall from 77% to 53%, demonstrating that its high accuracy on the original dataset was due to exploiting spurious cues rather than genuine argument comprehension, and reducing its performance on the task to the same random level as other models on the transformed dataset."}

The \"Relation\" ($r_t$) and \"Parent Entity\" ($p_t$) in the annotation explicitly represent the factual connections from this knowledge graph that justify the mention of the entity ($e_t$) at that token position [1, 4, 10].

The benchmark includes a wide variety of image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, and medical images, totaling 30 different types [6, 2].\n\n![Statistics of the MMMU benchmark, including total questions, disciplines, subjects, subfields, and image types](image3)\n\nThis comprehensive coverage across diverse domains and image types contrasts with many prior benchmarks that focus heavily on daily knowledge, common sense, or are limited to specific domains like mathematics [1, 6].\n\n![Comparison of MMMU with other benchmarks based on breadth (Knowledge) and depth (Reasoning), showing MMMU positioned high on both axes](image4)\n\nRegarding **depth**, MMMU requires significantly more complex skills than typical benchmarks. While previous evaluations often test basic perception or simple physical/temporal reasoning based on commonsense knowledge, MMMU demands expert-level understanding, requiring deliberate reasoning with college-level subject-specific knowledge [1, 6, 10]. Problems often require applying complex theories or performing step-by-step derivations [2].\n\n![Examples of complex multimodal questions from different disciplines in the MMMU benchmark](image5)\n\nMMMU introduces challenges from processing various heterogeneous image types and integrating domain-specific knowledge to perform deep understanding and complex reasoning [10].

Its breadth necessitates models capable of handling diverse data types and domains, while its depth requires models to possess and utilize specialized knowledge and sophisticated reasoning abilities beyond simple perception or commonsense. Current models, even advanced ones like GPT-4V, show substantial room for improvement on MMMU, particularly in domains requiring complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge [8, 12]. This indicates that MMMU is a demanding benchmark for assessing the progress towards models with expert-level multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities.\n\nThe MMMU benchmark provides a comprehensive and deep evaluation by covering a wide range of college-level subjects and image types while requiring expert-level reasoning, posing a significant challenge for current LMMs and highlighting areas for future development."}

It utilizes a two-way linear mapping on the contextualized representations obtained from a BERT model that jointly encodes the dialogue context and the domain-slot pair to find the start and end positions of the relevant text span [6, 8].\n\nA key aspect of DS-DST is its design to enable direct and strong interactions between the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs, which is shown to be crucial for performance improvements over models that encode them separately [5, 10, 11].\n\nThe DS-DST model determines the matching by using cosine similarity for selecting values from candidate lists for categorical slots and span matching within the dialogue context for non-categorical slots."}

Here, an LLM is prompted to translate the natural language description of the problem and the goal into a task-specific symbolic language [2, 12]. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the natural language statement [12]. Logic-LM utilizes different symbolic formulations tailored to common types of logical reasoning problems like deductive reasoning, first-order logic, constraint satisfaction, and analytical reasoning [5]. The LLM focuses on representing the problem accurately in this symbolic language [2, 9].\n\n![Example of a natural language problem translated into symbolic formulations including predicates, premises, and a conclusion.](image3)\n\nThe second stage is **Symbolic Reasoning**. Once the problem is formulated symbolically, a deterministic symbolic solver is called upon to perform inference on this symbolic representation [2, 12]. This offloads the complex, precise reasoning burden from the LLM to external, reliable symbolic solvers [9]. Examples of solvers include logic programming engines, first-order logic provers, and constraint solvers, depending on the chosen formulation [5, image5]. The reasoning is guaranteed to be faithful in this stage because deterministic algorithms are used [2].\n\nFinally, the third stage is **Result Interpretation**. An LLM or a rule-based module takes the symbolic answer obtained from the solver and translates it back into natural language [2, 12].\n\nAdditionally, Logic-LM incorporates a self-refinement module. This module uses error messages provided by the symbolic solver to iteratively revise the generated symbolic formulation, aiming to improve the accuracy of the symbolic parsing [10, 12].\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first using an LLM to formulate the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, then employing a deterministic symbolic solver to perform the reasoning, and finally using an interpreter to translate the symbolic result back into natural language, optionally refining the initial formulation using solver feedback."}

These pre-processing steps, including cropping and blurring, enhance the model's ability to perform region-level recognition tasks [7], contributing to improved classification accuracy by directing the model's attention to the relevant objects and ensuring sufficient context [7, 8].\n\nThe pre-processing step in the provided diagram contributes to zero-shot object recognition by isolating and preparing object regions for effective feature extraction and model focus."}

This is attributed to specific questions providing clearer instructions and more explicitly targeting the required knowledge [3].\n\nLooking at citation evaluation metrics under different settings, GPT-4 generally outperforms ChatGPT. [1] For example, in the specific setting, GPT-4 achieves a higher Correctness (97.6 vs 94.8), Precision (36.0 vs 29.9), and F1 score (39.4 vs 37.2) compared to ChatGPT [6].\n\n![Comparison of citation and text quality metrics for GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific question settings](image6)\n\nHowever, ChatGPT exhibits higher Recall in both settings (47.4 vs 42.1 in general, and 49.0 vs 43.6 in specific) [6]. This aligns with the observation that LLaMA-based models, including those conceptually similar to ChatGPT in generating more extensive responses, tend to have higher recall by producing longer answers with more citations, whereas GPT-4 generates shorter, more precise answers [1]. The text-citation alignment is also generally better for OpenAI models compared to others, and GPT-4 shows higher alignment scores than ChatGPT [11]. Image 1 also demonstrates that OpenAI models like ChatGPT have significantly higher alignment scores than LLaMA or Vicuna models.\n\n![Table comparing the alignment score of ChatGPT, LLaMA-7B, and Vicuna-13B models](image1)\n\nFor text quality evaluation, OpenAI models generally have better quality across metrics like Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, and Relevance compared to models from the LLaMA family [4]. Image 4 provides a detailed breakdown of these metrics for various models, showing higher scores for GPT-4 and ChatGPT across the board compared to LLaMA models.\n\n![Table comparing text quality metrics (Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, Relevance) for OpenAI and LLaMA family models](image4)\n\nWithin the general and specific settings, Image 6 shows that text quality metrics for GPT-4 and ChatGPT are relatively close, with ChatGPT (specifically ChatGPT 0.5 in the specific setting) sometimes scoring slightly higher in metrics like Consistency, Fluency, and Relevance. However, there is a noted limitation in text quality evaluation where using ChatGPT as the evaluator might introduce bias, potentially leading to its own generated answers receiving higher scores than those from GPT-4 [6].\n\nThe implication for citation evaluation is that specific questions lead to more accurate and well-aligned citations for both models, with GPT-4 generally providing higher precision and correctness while ChatGPT provides higher recall. For text evaluation, specific questions can also lead to slightly better quality, though the differences between GPT-4 and ChatGPT are less pronounced and subject to potential evaluation bias.\n\nGPT-4 and ChatGPT perform better on specific questions than general ones across most citation and text quality metrics, with GPT-4 generally excelling in correctness and precision and ChatGPT in recall."}

Further along the coast, the local history museum for Ytre Arna focuses on the industrialisation that began there in 1846, detailing the history of Arne Fabrikker, once Norway's biggest textile factory, and the development of the local community, alongside a visit to the currently operating Oleana textile factory [9].\n\nAnother unique cultural site is the island and villa associated with violinist Ole Bull. Built in 1873, the villa is described as unique in Norwegian architectural history and resembles a fairy-tale castle, situated amidst fantastic scenery and walking trails [8].\n![A large house with a prominent gable and small tower displaying a flag](image8)\n\nFor military and natural history, the museum on Herdla island is notable. It focuses on the island's dramatic role in World War II, featuring a German fighter aircraft as its main attraction, alongside exhibitions on local fauna and birdlife [10].\n\nFinally, Bryggens Museum serves as the starting point for experiencing Bergen's history at the UNESCO World Heritage site, Bryggen [12]. The museum details the area's history and leads visitors through the site's historical layers, including the ruins of the city's first town hall and the Schøtstuene assembly rooms [12].\n![A UNESCO logo](image4)\n\nMuseums in Bergen associated with historical or cultural heritage include Bergen's oldest Latin School, Old Bergen Museum, Osterøy Museum, KODE Art Museums of Bergen, Haakon’s Hall, Salhus Tricotagefabrik, the local history museum for Ytre Arna, the Ole Bull Museum, the museum on Herdla island, and Bryggens Museum."}

Effective lead scoring [6] is crucial for ensuring leads are properly qualified before being passed to sales. This low conversion rate implies a need to analyze the criteria used for MQL qualification and the process by which these leads are accepted (or rejected) by the Sales team, highlighting a potential disconnect between marketing and sales operations that hinders revenue performance management [1].\n\nThe MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50% in the data is significantly lower than the industry average range of 45% to 75%, implying a potential issue with lead quality, sales acceptance criteria, or the handoff process between marketing and sales."}

Various challenges hindered its implementation, while certain applications were identified as crucial for improving healthcare outcomes.\n\nThe most significant barriers to implementing IT in healthcare in 2006 compared to 2005 involved several factors [2]. Lack of financial support remained a top barrier, though it slightly decreased in perceived importance from 20% in 2005 to 18% in 2006. Lack of staffing resources also decreased slightly (13% to 17%). The vendor's inability to effectively deliver product increased in perception from 12% to 18%. Proving IT's benefits and ROI, difficulty achieving end-user acceptance, and lack of clinical leadership all saw small increases in importance as barriers [8].\n\n![Bar chart showing Lack of Financial Support, Lack of Staffing Resources, and Vendor's Inability to Effectively Deliver Product as top barriers to implementing healthcare IT, with percentages for 2005 and 2006.](image8)\n\nSecurity concerns were also a major challenge [3]. The leading security concern in both years was Internal Breach of Security, which slightly decreased from 56% in 2005 to 51% in 2006. Inadequate Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery was the second-highest concern at 39% in 2006. Limits of Existing Technology and HIPAA Compliance also ranked highly, with HIPAA Compliance perceived as a greater concern in 2006 (35%) than in 2005 (18%) [5].\n\n![Bar chart showing Internal Breach of Security, Inadequate Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery, and Limits of Existing Technology as top security concerns, with percentages for 2005 and 2006.](image5)\n\nTop business issues facing healthcare organizations also influenced IT adoption [7]. Improving Patient (Customer) Satisfaction and managing Medicare Cutbacks were the top issues in 2006. Reducing Medical Errors remained a significant concern, ranking third in 2006 at 44%, though it was the top concern in 2005 at 57% [3]. Implementing IT solutions was seen as a way to address some of these issues, such as reducing medical errors [9].\n\n![Bar chart showing Patient (Customer) Satisfaction, Medicare Cutbacks, and Reducing Medical Errors as top business issues facing healthcare, with percentages for 2005 and 2006.](image3)\n\nRegarding important applications, the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) was consistently seen as the most important application in both 2005 (62%) and 2006 (61%) [12, 10, 11]. Other important applications included Bar Coded Medication Management, Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE), and Enterprise-Wide Clinical Information Sharing [6].\n\n![Bar chart showing Electronic Medical Record, Bar Coded Medication Management, and Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE) as the most important applications in healthcare IT, with percentages for 2005 and 2006.](image6)\n\nSpecific technologies saw varying levels of reported adoption between 2005 and 2006. Single Sign On/Identity Management was the most adopted, reported by 79% of respondents in 2006. Bar Code Technology and Speech Recognition also showed high levels of adoption [2].\n\n![Bar chart showing the adoption rates of technologies like Single Sign On/Identity Management, Bar Code Technology, and Speech Recognition, with percentages for 2005 and 2006.](image2)\n\nAn example of a healthcare IT system in use during this period is a SOAPware Active Physician system, used for managing patient information, including history, vital signs, and visit details [10].\n\n![Screenshot of a SOAPware Active Physician system interface displaying patient demographic, history, vital signs, and visit encounter notes.](image1)\n\nIn 2006 compared to 2005, major challenges in healthcare IT included persistent financial and staffing resource limitations, growing vendor delivery issues, and significant security concerns like internal breaches and HIPAA compliance, while the Electronic Medical Record remained the most important perceived application."}

This chain typically involves stages such as Data, Reporting, Analysis, Action, and ultimately, Value [Image 2]. It emphasizes that simply performing analysis is not enough; value is only created when insights lead to decisions and subsequent actions that result in a measurable impact [1, 2].\n\n![The Analytics Value Chain illustrates the steps from data to business value](image2)\n\nWithin this value chain, the Levels of Analytics detail the increasing sophistication and \"Degree of Intelligence\" applied during the Reporting and Analysis phases [Image 7]. These levels progress from descriptive reporting (\"What happened?\") to more advanced techniques like statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modelling, and optimisation (\"What's the best that can happen?\").\n\n![Levels of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics demonstrate increasing sophistication leading to higher business value](image7)\n\nBasic reporting focuses on summarizing data, answering descriptive questions about what occurred [Image 5]. Analysis, however, delves deeper, aiming to understand \"Why?\" things happened and providing forward-looking insights and recommendations [Image 5].\n\nInsights derived from these increasingly sophisticated levels of analysis then feed into the \"Action\" stage of the Analytics Value Chain [Image 2]. A data-driven culture where managers expect and rely on these insights to make informed decisions ensures that the analysis translates into meaningful actions [12]. Strong data leadership also plays a crucial role in evangelizing data's strategic asset status and supporting the analytics organization to maximize its impact [3, 4]. By moving through the value chain and leveraging higher levels of analytics, organizations can transform data into actionable insights that drive significant business value [Image 7, Image 2].\n\nThe Analytics Value Chain provides the process framework, while the Levels of Analytics define the types of activities performed within the analysis stage of that process to generate increasingly valuable insights."}

It consists of two consecutive divisions, Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Metaphase I is a crucial stage within Meiosis I [Image 2].\n\nLeading up to Metaphase I, during Prophase I, chromosomes coil and become compact. Homologous chromosomes pair up through synapsis, forming structures called tetrads, each containing four chromatids. Non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material through crossing over [1]. These duplicated chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere, are visible [9].\n\nDuring Metaphase I, the homologous chromosome pairs (tetrads) align at the center of the cell, along the metaphase plate [Image 6]. The mitotic spindle, made of microtubules, is required for this alignment and the eventual separation of chromosomes [6]. Microtubules from opposite poles attach to the kinetochores of the homologous chromosomes, positioning them on the metaphase plate [Image 6]. Unlike mitosis, where individual chromosomes align, in Metaphase I of meiosis, it is the homologous pairs that are aligned, and sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere [Image 6].\n\n![Diagram showing chromosomes aligning at the metaphase plate in Meiosis I, with homologous chromosomes paired](image6)\n\nThe key process during Metaphase I of meiosis is the alignment of homologous chromosome pairs at the metaphase plate."}

The process of cell division includes mitosis, the division of the nucleus, and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm [2]. Cytokinesis often begins while telophase is still in progress [8].\n\nIn telophase, the chromosomes, which separated during the previous stage, arrive at opposite poles of the cell. Nuclear envelopes reform around these sets of chromosomes, creating two new nuclei within the single cell [image2]. Nucleoli, the sites of ribosome assembly, which had disappeared earlier in the division process, also reappear [image2]. The chromosomes begin to uncoil, returning to a less condensed state.\n\nAs telophase concludes, cytokinesis proceeds to divide the cytoplasm. In animal cells, this involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, which pinches the cell into two [image2, image3]. This furrow is created by a contracting ring of microfilaments located just inside the plasma membrane, gradually constricting the cell [image6].\n\n![Diagram shows metaphase, anaphase, and telophase with forming nuclear envelopes and cytokinesis via cleavage furrow](image2)\n\n![Electron micrograph shows a cell dividing via a cleavage furrow](image3)\n\n![Diagram illustrates animal cell cytokinesis with a contracting ring forming a cleavage furrow and resulting in daughter cells](image6)\n\nIn plant cells, which have rigid cell walls, cytokinesis proceeds differently.

He demonstrated that parents pass heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [4]. Sexual reproduction involves the inheritance of unique sets of genes from each of the two parents, contributing to observed variations in traits [2]. Fertilization unites sperm and egg, resulting in a diploid zygote containing a set of chromosomes (and thus genes) from each parent [8].\n\nMendel conducted monohybrid crosses, such as breeding purple-flowered pea plants with white-flowered plants, representing the parental (P) generation [11, image4].\n\nAll plants in the resulting first filial (F1) generation had purple flowers [11, image4]. This led Mendel to wonder why the white trait seemed to disappear in the F1 generation [11]. When Mendel crossed the F1 plants with each other, the white trait reappeared in the second filial (F2) generation [11].\n\nThe visual representation of this cross shows the P generation (purple x white), resulting in all purple F1 plants, and the F2 generation displaying a mix of purple and white flowers. `![This image shows the progression of a monohybrid cross from the parental generation to the F2 generation, illustrating the purple and white flower phenotypes and their ratios.](image4)`\n\nMendel's explanation for these results, detailed by Mendelian inheritance, involves the concept of alleles and their segregation during gamete formation [image1]. The F1 plants are hybrids (heterozygous), possessing one allele for purple color (P) and one for white color (p) [image1].\n\nThis diagram illustrates how alleles for a trait segregate during gamete formation (sperm and eggs) and recombine during fertilization, leading to specific genotypic and phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation. `![This diagram explains the genetic makeup and gamete formation through the P, F1, and F2 generations, showing allele combinations, resulting genotypes (1PP:2Pp:1pp), and phenotypic ratio (3 purple:1 white) in the F2 generation.](image1)`\n\nAccording to Mendelian principles, each F1 plant produces gametes, half carrying the P allele and half carrying the p allele [image1]. When F1 plants are crossed, these gametes combine randomly during fertilization [image1]. This random combination results in an F2 generation with genotypes in the ratio of 1 homozygous dominant (PP) : 2 heterozygous (Pp) : 1 homozygous recessive (pp) [image1]. Because the purple allele (P) is dominant over the white allele (p), plants with either the PP or Pp genotype will express the purple phenotype, while only plants with the pp genotype will express the white phenotype [image1, image4]. This leads to the observed phenotypic ratio of 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant in the F2 generation [11, image1, image4].\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants by detailing how parental alleles segregate into gametes and randomly combine during fertilization."}

A primary obstacle is the siloed nature of many organizations and their approaches [4]. This leads to a lack of a single owner for the customer experience, resulting in misaligned goals across different business lines, products, or brands [Image 6]. Being too siloed by business unit is cited as a major barrier [Image 6]. Lack of leadership commitment and guidance is crucial for driving the necessary process, infrastructure, organizational, and cultural growth across all departments, including sales, finance, HR, and marketing [8].\n\nAdoption barriers are often related more to management and culture than solely to data and technology [11]. This includes a lack of top-down alignment of activities and efforts against metrics, as well as a lack of clear processes, roles, responsibilities, and skilled resources [2]. Image 6 shows that the lack of resources is a barrier for 36% of respondents. Furthermore, the absence of technical infrastructure and the inability to measure the influence of activities on customer behavior also pose significant hurdles [Image 6].\n\n![There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals is the top barrier to integrated customer management.](image6)\n\nTraditional marketing measurement methods also act as barriers. They fail to capture the full story by focusing too much on reach and not enough on engagement [1], [2]. There is often too much focus on quantitative data rather than essential qualitative data like satisfaction [2], [11]. The customer journey itself is complex, involving influences like recommendations and reviews that traditional linear models ignore [3], making comprehensive measurement difficult [11]. Over-attribution of campaign performance to the first or last click is a common problem [10], [12], and many organizations attribute activity primarily to the most recent touchpoint [Image 3].\n\n![Most companies attribute activity to the most recent touch point.](image3)\n\nThese issues highlight the challenges in understanding what data is needed to answer business questions and measure what matters most, such as customer engagement, conversion, and satisfaction [11]. While technical solutions exist, measurement requires investment in people, skills, roles, responsibilities, and processes, accounting for about 90% of the effort [11].\n\nThe major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include organizational silos, lack of leadership and cultural change, insufficient resources and skilled personnel, inadequate technical infrastructure, and significant challenges with metrics and measurement practices."}

In the image, the elements forming the letter 'E' are placed close together, allowing us to perceive it as a single letter.\n![Objects close together are perceived as a group.](image6)\nSimilarly, the design demonstrates the principle of Closure, where we tend to perceive incomplete objects as whole forms by filling in the visual gaps [11]. The letter 'G' in the image is not fully formed, yet we readily perceive it as a complete 'G'.\n![Incomplete shapes are perceived as complete forms.](image1)\nThe letter 'A' utilizes the principle of Similarity, grouping elements that share characteristics like pattern (stripes in this case) [10]. The letter 'S' also uses similarity (of color, red) and segregation to highlight certain parts while still being perceived as an 'S'.\n![Objects with similar characteristics are perceived as a group.](image7)\nFurthermore, the flow and connection of parts within letters like the 'T' illustrate Continuity, where elements are grouped if they tend to be aligned or connected [3]. The overall arrangement of the letters forms the complete word 'GESTALT', showcasing the principle of Unity and Pregnância (Good Gestalt), which favors perceiving the simplest and most stable organization [4].\n![The word 'GESTALT' is visually designed to demonstrate several Gestalt principles.](image2)\n\nThe principles of Gestalt psychology manifest in the design of the word 'GESTALT' by using visual cues like proximity, closure, similarity, continuity, and segregation to enable the perception of individual letters and the overall word as a unified, meaningful form."}

The current systems often fragment patient information, leading to redundant and inefficient efforts [9]. Goals for future systems include enhanced capabilities [4].\n\nSpecifically, functions such as \"Access to Patient Clinical Information\" and \"Physician Access for Clinical Orders\" via the intranet are expected to increase significantly. Currently, Physician Access for Clinical Orders is only at 44%, but is expected to rise to 57% within two years. Similarly, access to patient clinical information is expected to increase from 45% to 53%.\n\n![Intranet functions showing expected increases in clinical information access](image4)\n\nImplementing and supporting these advanced intranet functions directly relates to the current Health IT staffing needs. According to data on 2006 Health IT staffing needs [3], there is a high demand for skills that are crucial for building and maintaining such systems.\n\n![Bar chart showing Health IT staffing needs for 2006](image2)\n\nThe top staffing needs include Network Support (27%), Clinical Informaticists (24%), Process/Workflow Design (24%), and Application Support (22%). These roles are essential for ensuring the network infrastructure can handle increased traffic and data, designing efficient workflows for clinicians using the enhanced intranet, bridging the gap between clinical requirements and IT capabilities, and maintaining the intranet applications that provide clinical access.

A survey shows that 52% of marketers attribute activity to the most recent touch point.\n![Chart showing that 52% of marketers attribute activity to the most recent touch point.](image2)\nThis \"most recent touch point\" method aligns directly with Last Click attribution [5, 10].

The current system fragments patient information [12], and future systems aim to consolidate this information and unify efforts [3].\n\nThe expansion and transformation of these web and intranet-based systems will necessitate specific staffing increases.\n\n![A bar chart shows the percentage of organizations needing staffing in various Health IT roles in 2006.](image5)\n\nImage 5 indicates the most needed staffing areas in Health IT in 2006. High needs are identified for Network Support (27%), Clinical Informaticists (24%), Process/Workflow Design (24%), and Application Support (22%) [Image5]. Moderate needs exist for Programmers (16%) and Systems Integration (15%) [Image5]. These needs directly correlate with the trends: expanding web portals and clinical systems require robust Network Support and Application Support; integrating systems and implementing new clinical workflows necessitates Clinical Informaticists, Process/Workflow Design, and Systems Integration; developing and customizing applications requires Programmers.\n\nThe projected trends in web and intranet functions towards broader access, enhanced communication, and implementation of dedicated clinical systems will necessitate significant staffing increases, particularly in areas like network support, application support, clinical informatics, process/workflow design, programming, and systems integration."}

The process is similar to normal EPROM programming in some aspects, but with distinct settings for certain pins, particularly P2.6 and P3.7, to differentiate between programming Lock Bit 1 (LB1) and Lock Bit 2 (LB2). The device must be running with a 4 to 6 MHz oscillator during programming [1].\n\nThe general setup involves applying the appropriate voltage levels to various pins as indicated in programming tables.\n![Diagram showing the pin configuration for programming the 875XBH](image1)\n\nAccording to the programming mode table, for programming either LB1 or LB2, several pins must be held at specific logic levels: RST must be 1, PSEN must be 0, P2.7 must be 1, and P3.6 must be 1 [Image5].\n\nThe EA/Vpp pin receives the programming supply voltage [10]. For the Quick Pulse Programming Algorithm, this voltage (Vpp) must be 12.75 ± 0.25 Volts [11]. This range is confirmed in the electrical characteristics table [Image2]. During lock bit programming, the EA/Vpp pin is held at Vpp [Image5]. Normally, EA/Vpp is raised to Vpp just before ALE/PROG is pulsed [4].\n\nThe ALE/PROG pin is pulsed low to initiate the programming of the code byte into the addressed location [1]. For the new algorithm used for programming features like lock bits, the ALE/PROG pin is pulsed low 25 times [11]. Each pulse has a nominal width of 100 µs with minimum spacing of 10 µs [11, Image3].\n![Timing diagram showing 25 pulses on ALE/PROG](image3)\n![Table listing programming mode pin configurations including Lock Bits](image5)\n\nThe specific pin configurations for programming LB1 (x=1) and LB2 (x=2) differ on pins P2.6 and P3.7:\n*   To program LB1 (x=1): RST=1, PSEN=0, ALE/PROG=0* (pulsed low), EA/Vpp=Vpp, P2.7=1, **P2.6=1**, P3.6=1, **P3.7=1** [Image5]. [12] notes P2.6 is held high for programming the locking bit, likely referring to LB1.\n*   To program LB2 (x=2): RST=1, PSEN=0, ALE/PROG=0* (pulsed low), EA/Vpp=Vpp, P2.7=1, **P2.6=0**, P3.6=1, **P3.7=0** [Image5].\n\nAfter programming, verification of lock features is done by observing that their intended functions are enabled, as they cannot be directly verified like program code [11]. Programmed lock bits disable external access to the program memory in different ways [Image4].\n![Table showing the functions enabled by programmed Lock Bits LB1 and LB2](image4)\n\nThe specific pin and signal configurations required for programming the lock bits (LBx) in the 875XBH include a 4-6 MHz oscillator, RST=1, PSEN=0, P2.7=1, P3.6=1, EA/Vpp=12.75±0.25V, and ALE/PROG pulsed low 25 times, with specific settings for P2.6 and P3.7 determining whether LB1 or LB2 is programmed."}

Focusing on consuming a single item excessively is generally seen as bad because of this diminishing utility [6].\n\nHowever, the concept changes significantly in competitive contexts. While the physical act of consuming (like eating the 64th hot dog in a contest) might still involve diminishing physical enjoyment, the *overall utility* is not solely derived from the act of consumption itself but heavily influenced by the potential outcome [4].\n\n![A table shows diminishing marginal utility for hot dogs on the left, similar to standard consumption, while a table on the right shows a 'Differential outcome' in a competitive scenario where the utility from consuming later hot dogs becomes extremely high, leading to a positive outcome like tying a championship.](image1)\n\nIn a competitive setting, focus and practice can lead to improved skill and performance [12], which in turn can increase the utility gained from the activity itself (due to accumulated skill or \"consumption capital\") and, more importantly, from the improved outcomes (due to \"human production capital\") [11].

A key step in this process is the transition from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) [4].\n\n![Dashboard showing lead conversion rates through funnel stages](image4)\nOne dataset indicates a MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50% [image4].\n\n![Benchmark conversion rates for different funnel stages](image7)\nHowever, benchmark data suggests that the conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) should typically fall within a range of 45% to 75% [image7].\n\nComparing the 1.50% rate [image4] to the 45% to 75% benchmark range [image7] reveals a significant discrepancy. Such a low conversion rate from MQL to SAL implies that a very small percentage of leads qualified by marketing are actually being accepted by the sales team [4]. This could indicate several issues:\n1.  **Lead Quality:** Marketing may be qualifying leads that sales deems unsuitable or not ready for sales engagement. This points to a potential misalignment in the definition of an MQL between marketing and sales [4, 10].\n2.  **Sales Acceptance Criteria:** Sales may have stricter criteria for accepting leads than marketing uses for qualification.\n3.  **Process Issues:** There might be breakdowns in the handover process between marketing and sales, leading to leads not being properly passed or followed up on.\n4.  **Sales Capacity/Focus:** The sales team might be overwhelmed or focusing on leads from other sources, leading them to reject or ignore marketing-qualified leads.\n\nThe implication of a low MQL to SAL conversion rate is that marketing efforts aimed at generating qualified leads are not effectively contributing to the sales pipeline [4, 12], resulting in wasted resources and missed opportunities. Addressing this gap requires close collaboration between marketing and sales to refine lead qualification criteria, improve lead quality, and streamline the acceptance process [4, 10].\n\nThe observed MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50% is significantly lower than the benchmark range of 45% to 75%, indicating potential issues with lead quality, sales acceptance criteria, or the handover process between marketing and sales."}
