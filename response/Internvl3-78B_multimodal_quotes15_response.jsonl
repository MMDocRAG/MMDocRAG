Additionally, 34% of STEM workers attribute the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics to a lack of belief in their ability to succeed, while 32% point to the absence of role models and racial/ethnic discrimination in recruitment and promotions [4]. Many Americans also believe that limited encouragement from an early age is a major reason, with 39% for women and 41% for blacks and Hispanics [5]. Furthermore, 42% of Americans see limited access to quality education as a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics, a view particularly strong among black STEM workers (73%) [6].\n\nImage evidence supports these findings.

This aligns with the broader concern among this age group that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, with 71% expressing this view [10]. In contrast, younger adults (18-29) are more divided, with 46% giving the government a negative rating and 53% a positive one [4]. This age group is also split on whether policies restrict civil liberties too much (43%) or do not go far enough to protect the country (44%) [10].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these differences. Among those aged 18-29, there is a notable concern that policies restrict civil liberties too much (43%), while those aged 65+ are more worried about security, with only 15% feeling policies are too restrictive [image5]. The table in image4 shows that 58% of those aged 65+ believe the government is not doing well, whereas 53% of 18-29-year-olds think it is doing well.

Image2 illustrates that 72% of Latinos feel they are better off financially, while only 16% feel about the same, and 5% feel less well off. \n\nIn contrast, the unemployment trends for Latinos have been more volatile. Image5 shows that the Hispanic unemployment rate peaked during the recession, reaching around 13% in 2010, significantly higher than the non-Hispanic rate. However, by 2015, the Hispanic unemployment rate had declined to 6.4%, though it remained above the non-Hispanic rate of 4.8%. Despite this decline, the rate is still higher than its pre-recession low of 5% in 2006 [6].\n\nIn summary, while Latino optimism about financial prospects has risen, unemployment rates, though improving, remain a challenge compared to non-Hispanic rates.\n\n![72% of Latinos feel better off financially](image2)  \n![Hispanic unemployment rate has declined but remains above non-Hispanic rates](image5)  \n\nThe perceptions of financial well-being among Latinos have improved significantly, with 72% feeling better off, while unemployment rates, though declining, remain higher than those of non-Hispanics."}

During the recession, the Hispanic rate peaked at around 13%, while the non-Hispanic rate peaked at approximately 9%. Post-recession, the Hispanic rate has declined but remains above pre-recession levels, as noted in [2] and [6]. This persistent higher unemployment rate contributes to economic instability and lower income levels for Hispanic households.\n\n**Economic Perceptions:**\n- Image4 indicates that Hispanics are more likely to perceive economic conditions as good or excellent compared to the general public, with 76% of Hispanics holding this view in 2015, compared to 61% of the general public. This optimism is reflected in [9], where 35% of Hispanics view current economic conditions positively, higher than among whites (25%). Despite this optimism, [3] reveals that median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, significantly lower than the general population's median income of $53,700, as shown in image2.\n\n**Income and Wealth Disparities:**\n- Image2 illustrates that Hispanic households have a median income of $42,500, compared to $53,700 for all households, and a net worth of $13,700, far below the $81,400 for all households. This disparity is exacerbated by the fact that Hispanic households experienced the largest decline in net worth post-recession, as mentioned in [3]. The combination of higher unemployment rates and lower income contributes to a higher poverty rate of 23.6% among Hispanics, compared to a peak of 26.5% in 2010.\n\n**Impact on Financial Well-being:**\n- Image3 shows that 72% of Hispanics believe their children will be better off financially, indicating a strong belief in upward mobility. However, [4] highlights that personal financial satisfaction varies, with only 23% of those with less than a high school education rating their finances as excellent or good, compared to 56% of those with some college experience.

By the first quarter of 2016, it had improved to 5.6%, though it remained above the pre-recession low of 5% in 2006. In contrast, the unemployment rate for non-Hispanic workers was lower in the fourth quarter of 2015. Image5 illustrates this trend, showing that while both groups experienced significant increases during the recession, the Hispanic unemployment rate was consistently higher than that of non-Hispanic workers throughout the period.\n\n**Income**: \n- Median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, as noted in [7]. This is lower than the median income for all households, which was $53,700 in the same year, as depicted in image2. The graph in image2 highlights the disparity, with Hispanic household income significantly below the national average.\n\n**Poverty Rate**: \n- The Hispanic poverty rate was 23.6% in 2014, down from a peak of 26.5% in 2010 but still above pre-recession levels, as stated in [7]. This rate is higher than that of the general U.S. population, indicating a slower recovery for Hispanic households.\n\n**Wealth**: \n- Hispanic households experienced the largest percentage decline in net worth through 2009 of any major racial or ethnic group, and unlike white households, their net worth continued to fall after the recession, as mentioned in [7]. Image2 also shows that the net worth of Hispanic households was $13,700 in 2013, far below the $81,400 for all households, underscoring the wealth gap.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic households faced more pronounced economic challenges compared to the general U.S. population, with higher unemployment rates, lower incomes, higher poverty rates, and significant declines in net worth from 2000 to 2015.\n\n![Hispanic unemployment"}

Image1 shows that younger users (ages 18-49) are more accepting of friend recommendations (66%) compared to older users (ages 65+), who are less accepting (36%) [9]. This age-related difference might also reflect generational comfort levels with data usage.\n\nThe implications for social media platforms are significant. Platforms might consider segmenting their user base by gender and age to tailor content and advertisements. For instance, given that men are more likely to see negative behavior, platforms could focus on creating safer spaces or moderating content more strictly for male users. For women, who see more kind or supportive behavior, emphasizing community and positive interactions might be more effective.\n\nMoreover, since younger users are more accepting of friend recommendations, platforms could leverage this by enhancing social features for this demographic. Conversely, for older users, focusing on event recommendations or local content might be better received, as shown in image1 where older users are more accepting of event recommendations (67% for ages 65+).\n\nIn summary, understanding these differences allows social media platforms to create more personalized and acceptable experiences, potentially increasing user satisfaction and engagement.\n\n![Men are more likely than women to see bullying and deceptive behavior on social"}

This distribution is depicted in ![STEM workers are predominantly in private, for-profit sectors](image3), showing that engineering and computer jobs have the highest concentration in private, for-profit settings.\n\nOver time, the representation of women in STEM fields has shown mixed trends. While women make up 50% of all STEM jobs, they are underrepresented in computer and engineering roles [2]. The graphs in ![Women's representation in STEM fields has varied over time](image1) and ![Trends in life and physical science employment](image4) show that the percentage of women in computer jobs has decreased from 32% in 1990 to 25% in 2016, while in engineering, it has slightly increased from 12% to 14% over the same period. In contrast, women's representation in life sciences has increased from 34% to 47%, and in physical sciences from 22% to 39% [image4].\n\nIn summary, STEM workers generally have higher educational attainment and are more likely to work in private, for-profit sectors compared to non-STEM workers.

According to the data, Mountain View and Palo Alto have seen significant ridership growth, with Mountain View experiencing a 16% increase and Palo Alto a 38% increase from 2012 to 2014 [image3]. This rapid growth is driven by the underlying trends of urbanization and the desire for transit-oriented living, particularly among millennials who prefer areas where they do not need a car [10]. \n\nThe images of crowded train interiors [image1] and platforms [image5] visually confirm the strain on current capacity. The table showing train load percentages [image4] reveals that many trains are operating at or above 100% capacity, with some reaching as high as 158% during peak times. This overcrowding highlights the urgent need to address capacity issues to accommodate the growing demand. The map [image2] further illustrates the geographic concentration of growth in these areas, emphasizing the pressure on transit systems to expand and improve services.\n\nTo keep up with this growth, solutions such as grade separations and increased frequency are necessary, as mentioned in the text [6][9].

In contrast, ![Television access frequency](image5) reveals that 32% of respondents access television, which is higher than internet access but still lower than radio access at 46%. This suggests that television is more commonly accessed than the internet but less so than radio.\n\nThe disparity in access frequency between television and the internet can be attributed to several factors. Rural areas, which make up 83% of the respondents, may have limited internet infrastructure, leading to lower internet access. Television, being a more traditional and widely available medium, is more accessible, especially in rural settings. The higher radio access (46%) further supports the idea that traditional media remains prevalent in areas with limited internet connectivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the surveyed population predominantly accesses traditional media like television and radio more frequently than the internet. This pattern indicates that in regions with limited internet infrastructure, traditional media continues to be the primary source of information and entertainment. The low internet access frequency highlights the digital divide and the reliance on conventional media in rural areas.\n\nThe frequency of accessing television is higher than accessing the internet among the surveyed population, indicating a stronger reliance on traditional media.

This aligns with text quote [2], which states that Voice ARPU will continue to flatten, SMS ARPU will decrease, and Data ARPU will initially fall but later pick up due to increased data consumption. The decline in Voice and SMS ARPU can be attributed to the shift towards data-based communication tools like IM and VoIP, as mentioned in text quote [4], leading to reduced usage of traditional voice and SMS services, thus lowering ARPU as noted in text quote [5].\n\nThe influence of these changes can be linked to the growing adoption of smartphones and data services.

For instance, [8] highlights that strategies like Entropy, Margin, and VAAL tend to select data biased towards majority classes, leading to poor label diversity. This is further supported by [1], which mentions that Figure 2 shows the querying strategy proposed in the study yields better label diversity compared to other dominant strategies. \n\nImage1 visually supports this by showing the class distribution selected by different strategies. In both OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST, VAAL shows significant bias, often selecting very few or no samples from certain classes (e.g., femur-left and basophil in OrganAMNIST, and basophil in BloodMNIST). This indicates that VAAL tends to ignore minority classes, resulting in poor label diversity.\n\nAdditionally, [5] states that the proposed strategy covers the majority of classes, including tail classes, better than existing strategies. This suggests that VAAL, among others, struggles with label diversity.\n\nIn summary, the evidence from both text and images points to VAAL as a strategy that generally yields the worst label diversity across the datasets.\n\n![VAAL shows significant bias towards certain classes, often ignoring minority classes, leading to poor label diversity](image1)\n\nThe querying criteria that yields the worst label diversity generally on all the datasets is VAAL."}

This encoding, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into the **LSTM Dialogue State** component [4]. The dialogue state maintains a continuous representation of the conversation, updating after each turn by incorporating the user's utterance and the system's previous action [7]. This dialogue state is crucial for understanding the user's goals and context.\n\nNext, the **Dialogue State Tracking** component uses the dialogue state to estimate the user's goal, represented as slot-value pairs. A probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot is maintained, allowing the system to track the user's intent dynamically [7]. This tracking is essential for generating accurate queries to the **Knowledge Base** [4], as shown in image2, where the system tracks the date as \"Thursday\" and time as \"none.\"\n\nThe system then formulates a query command using the tracked goal slots and sends it to the Knowledge Base to retrieve relevant information [5]. The encoding of the query results is passed to the **Policy Network**, which determines the next system action based on the dialogue state, estimated user goal, and query results [9]. Image3 illustrates how the policy network integrates these inputs to decide the system action at each turn.\n\nFinally, the **Natural Language Generator (NLG)** combines the state tracker outputs and retrieved Knowledge Base entities to produce a natural language response [6]. In image2, the system responds with \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" after understanding the user's request for a movie the day after tomorrow. The NLG uses templates, replacing delexicalized tokens with values from the user's goals or Knowledge Base entities [6].\n\n![The system architecture shows the flow from user input to response generation](image2)\n\nThe system's ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses relies on the seamless integration of these components, enabling it to assist users effectively in task-oriented dialogues.\n\nThe system generates a response by encoding user input, tracking dialogue state, querying a knowledge base, and using a policy network and natural language generator to produce a coherent reply."}

Other functions like \"Closed-domain knowledge\" (12.1%) and \"Open-domain knowledge\" (5.3%) require extracting information from context or external sources, adding layers of complexity.\n\nThe complexity of reasoning steps is further illustrated by image5, which shows that a significant portion of claims require 5 to 7 reasoning steps, with 20% of claims needing 6 steps. This indicates that while basic functions are common, the dataset also demands multi-step reasoning, such as performing arithmetic operations (e.g., \"Subtract,\" \"Divide\") or determining trends, which are less frequent but crucial for more complex claims.

It involves basic indexing and retrieval processes, where documents are indexed, and relevant documents are retrieved based on a user query. The retrieved information is then fed into a frozen language model (LLM) to generate an output. This simplicity is illustrated in ![Naive RAG](image1), where the process is linear, with no additional preprocessing or postprocessing steps. The focus is on direct retrieval and generation without sophisticated optimizations.\n\n**Advanced RAG** introduces enhancements to address the limitations of Naive RAG, as described in [1] and [4]. It incorporates pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies, such as query rewriting and result summarization, to improve retrieval quality. The framework refines indexing techniques using methods like sliding window approaches and metadata incorporation. ![Advanced RAG](image1) shows these additions, where pre-retrieval steps like query expansion and post-retrieval steps like summarization and fusion are integrated. This results in more refined and contextually relevant outputs by optimizing both the retrieval and generation phases.\n\n**Modular RAG** represents a significant leap by offering a flexible architecture, as outlined in [5] and [10]. It allows for dynamic module integration and reconfiguration, enabling tailored solutions for specific tasks.

This is crucial because detection datasets often contain multiple objects of varying sizes and positions, and cropping helps isolate the objects of interest while blurring non-target areas directs the model's attention more effectively. \n\n![Pre-processing involves cropping and blurring to focus on relevant objects](image4)\n\nOnce the image is pre-processed, the system uses an encoder to generate embeddings for each cropped region, as shown in image4. These embeddings are then indexed and stored in a memory bank, allowing for efficient retrieval of similar categories based on the input image's features. The retrieval phase identifies the top-k most similar categories, narrowing down the possibilities to those most relevant to the image content, as explained in [10].\n\n![Embedding and retrieval process for detection datasets](image4)\n\nAfter retrieval, the system integrates the retrieved category labels with the image embeddings and sends them to the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ranking. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on retrieval order, the MLLMs analyze the contextual appropriateness of each category using advanced linguistic and semantic analysis, as mentioned in [4]. This ranking process ensures that the final predictions are both accurate and contextually aware, enhancing the system's ability to handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision.\n\n![Ranking prompt example demonstrating the selection of top categories](image1)\n\nThe ranking phase is further enhanced by fine-tuning the MLLMs on a small-scale classification dataset to improve their ranking ability, as noted in [7]. This fine-tuning helps the MLLMs follow ranking formats and return results more accurately, addressing potential errors and misalignments.\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes detection datasets by pre-processing images, embedding and retrieving relevant categories, and leveraging MLLMs for contextual ranking, significantly improving recognition accuracy.\n\nThe multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by pre-processing images to focus on relevant objects, embedding and retrieving similar categories, and using MLLMs to rank them contextually."}

The \"+positive\" and \"+negative\" techniques adjust the positive-negative ratios to study their effects on model performance.\n   - Image5 shows the results of these techniques on the QQP dataset, where \"+positive\" creates a balanced dataset, \"+negative\" increases imbalance, and \"-negative\" reduces the number of training examples.\n\n2. **Impact on Performance**:\n   - Image5 demonstrates that \"+positive\" outperforms the original dataset, aligning with expectations as it balances the labels.

On CHAI, the same approach shows a stop distance of 2.75 and manipulation accuracy of 37.53%, which is an improvement over other methods but still indicates challenges in manipulation tasks [4].\n\nThe complexity of CHAI is further illustrated by the example scenario, which requires multiple intermediate goals such as opening cupboards, moving items, and closing the dishwasher [9]. This complexity is reflected in the lower manipulation accuracy across methods compared to the navigation-focused LANI [5]. Additionally, human performance on CHAI is perfect in terms of manipulation accuracy but has a higher stop distance error, showing the inherent ambiguity in task execution [2].\n\nIn summary, the LANI dataset is primarily a navigation challenge with simpler instructions, while CHAI combines navigation with manipulation, leading to more complex task requirements and lower performance metrics in manipulation accuracy.

However, on the SciERC dataset, where pronouns are uniformly labeled as Generic, CorefProp has a minimal impact [6].

It is noted that relation annotations are not available for these datasets, so the coreference propagation layer is included, but not the relation layer. This indicates that coreference plays a crucial role in these experiments. \n\nThe text [10] further elaborates on the challenge of disambiguating entity classes for pronominal mentions in the ACE2005 dataset, which requires cross-sentence context.

According to the text, when models are trained and validated on the original data and then evaluated on the adversarial test set, their performance drops to random levels due to overfitting on spurious cues [6]. This indicates that BERT's initial high performance (77%) on the original dataset is largely due to exploiting these cues rather than understanding argument comprehension [8]. When trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets, BERT's peak performance reduces to 53%, with mean and median scores around 50% [6]. This aligns with the conclusion that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension and is merely relying on statistical cues [7].\n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set shows a significant drop to random levels](image4) illustrates the results of BERT models on the adversarial test set, confirming that their performance is essentially random, with a mean of 0.504 and a maximum of 0.533.

According to the text, sensitivity refers to the number of unique predictions a model makes when faced with perturbations, while WER measures the rate of incorrect word predictions. The neutral backoff strategy is noted for having the lowest sensitivity, as it maps unknown words to a fixed neutral word, reducing the number of unique outputs. This is crucial for robustness, as lower sensitivity limits the attacker's options. \n\nIn closed vocabulary models, the neutral backoff strategy shows a WER of 17.5 for swap attacks and 19.7 for drop attacks, which is lower than the pass-through strategy (17.6 for swap and 19.7 for drop) and the background strategy (19.5 for swap and 22.3 for drop) [2]. This suggests that the neutral backoff maintains a balance between low WER and sensitivity. \n\nFor open vocabulary models, the neutral backoff strategy also demonstrates lower WERs compared to pass-through and background strategies.

In 2020, an immediate 5% increase or decrease in key currencies versus EUR and DKK would impact the operating profit, as shown in image3, where the total impact on other comprehensive income was (1,594) DKK million for a 5% increase and 1,594 DKK million for a 5% decrease. This indicates substantial sensitivity to currency fluctuations.\n\nImage2 provides a detailed breakdown of the reserve changes over the years, showing that the reserve at the end of 2020 was (911) DKK million, reflecting adjustments for exchange rate differences and cash flow hedges. The negative impact on the reserve suggests that unfavorable exchange rate movements affected the company's financial position. Additionally, the table in image5 highlights the year-end changes in exchange rates, such as a 9.3% decrease for USD and a 7.2% decrease for CAD, which likely contributed to these financial impacts.\n\nNovo Nordisk's credit risk is considered low [2][5], and the company manages this risk by engaging with financial counterparties with satisfactory credit ratings [5]. Image4 shows the distribution of cash and derivatives among different credit ratings, with the majority held in AA and A ranges, indicating a conservative approach to credit risk management. However, the primary financial risk remains foreign exchange, as evidenced by the high risk level in image1.\n\nIn summary, the significant exchange rate fluctuations in 2020 led to notable impacts on Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges, as reflected in the financial data and reserve adjustments.\n\nThe changes in exchange rates and financial risks impacted Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020 by causing a total impact of (1,594) DKK million on other comprehensive income for a 5% currency increase, as shown in image3. ![The table shows the impact of exchange rate changes on comprehensive income](image3) and ![the reserve adjustments reflect these impacts](image2)."}

The cash inflows from financing activities were strongly influenced by the financing of the acquisition of Varian, changing by €12,087 million to €11,839 million in 2021 [5]. This was partly due to inflows from borrowings in the amount of $10 billion and an additional financing of €850 million provided by the Siemens Group, which was partly offset by repayments of matured loans [8]. On the other hand, cash outflows from investing activities increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million in 2021, primarily due to the payout for the acquisition of Varian and investments for capacity expansions [6].\n\n![Cash flows from operating activities increased from €1,928 million in 2020 to €2,933 million in 2021, while additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment decreased from €557 million to €674 million](image2)\n\n![Cash flows from investing activities decreased significantly from -€1,912 million in 2020 to -€14,140 million in 2021, while cash flows from financing activities increased from -€249 million to €11,839 million](image4)\n\nIn summary, the key factors driving these changes were the acquisition of Varian, which led to substantial financing inflows and investing outflows, and increased investments in capacity expansions."}

This amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada, as shown in image3, which details the Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation. This change reflects the company's strategy to accommodate potential future issuances of common stock, possibly to raise capital or facilitate mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdditionally, the subsidiary structure of Brazil Minerals, Inc. includes several entities, as listed in image1. Key subsidiaries such as BMIX Participações Ltda. and Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. are based in Brazil, with significant ownership percentages, indicating a focus on Brazilian mineral exploration. The presence of subsidiaries in the Marshall Islands, like Jupiter Gold Corporation and Apollo Resources Corporation, suggests international diversification and possibly tax or regulatory advantages.\n\nThe issuance of common stock to Lancaster Brazil Fund on March 11, 2020, as mentioned in [1] and [5], highlights transactions with related parties, which resulted in a loss on exchange of equity. This indicates active capital restructuring and potential shifts in ownership dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, the conversion of debt into stock options, as described in [3], shows the company's approach to managing debt and aligning interests with key stakeholders, such as the Chief Executive Officer.

In 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized, primarily related to patents and licenses, with none related to marketable products [3]. This indicates a significant reduction in impairment losses compared to 2019, where DKK 982 million was recognized, largely due to changes in management's expectations regarding patents and licenses not yet in use [3].\n\nThe image data provides a detailed breakdown of these changes. Image4 shows that the total amortization/depreciation and impairment losses for intangible assets in 2020 amounted to DKK 20,657 million, compared to DKK 50,269 million in 2019. This substantial decrease is primarily due to lower impairment losses, as the impairment loss for the year in 2020 was DKK 60 million, down from DKK 792 million in 2019 [4].

This reduction indicates a more controlled approach to stock-based compensation, possibly aligning with the company's financial strategy to manage expenses effectively. The decrease in expenses could be attributed to various factors, including changes in the number of awards granted or the fair value of the awards at the date of grant, as mentioned in [6].\n\nConcurrently, net earnings per share (EPS) have shown an upward trend. According to image4, diluted EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022, representing a 17% increase over the period. This growth in EPS is primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, as highlighted in [7], which mentions a $0.4 billion increase in net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. The reduction in shares outstanding, as noted in image4, also contributed to the EPS growth, as fewer shares dilute the earnings available to common shareholders.\n\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, alongside the increase in net earnings and reduction in shares outstanding, suggests that Procter & Gamble has been effective in enhancing shareholder value. The company's ability to manage its stock-based compensation while improving net earnings reflects a balanced approach to financial performance and shareholder returns.\n\n![Stock-based compensation expenses decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022](image3)  \n![Diluted EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022](image4)\n\nIn summary, Procter & Gamble's financial trends from 2020 to 2022 show a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses and an increase in net earnings per share, indicating improved financial performance and effective management of stock-based incentives."}

The cost per tonne increased to US$14.82 from US$12.63, reflecting higher production costs and inflation impacts [image2]. The total iron ore production reached 254 Mt, up from 248 Mt in FY2020, driven by record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C [2].

This indicates a significant increase in net income over the two-year period. Similarly, Mars had a net income of $154 million in 2018, which increased to $231 million in 2020. \n\nThe increase in net income for both entities can be attributed to several factors. According to the Statements of Income, Amberjack's total revenues rose from $204 million in 2018 to $315 million in 2020, while total operating expenses increased from $47 million to $73 million. For Mars, total revenues increased from $241 million in 2018 to $282 million in 2020, and total operating expenses rose from $87 million to $104 million. Despite the rise in operating expenses, the growth in revenues outpaced the expenses, leading to higher net incomes.\n\nAdditionally, the balance sheets show that Amberjack's total assets increased from $860 million in 2018 to $892 million in 2020, and Mars's total assets grew from $230 million to $231 million. This suggests that both entities may have invested in assets that contributed to higher revenues. The increase in equity for Amberjack from $824 million to $892 million and for Mars from $200 million to $231 million also indicates improved financial health, which could have supported higher net incomes.\n\nFurthermore, the company's overall financial strategy, such as managing debt and interest rates, could have influenced these changes. For instance, the amendment of the Five Year Revolver due July 2023 to a lower interest rate of 2.06% in 2020 [3] might have reduced interest expenses, contributing to higher net incomes. The company's ability to manage its debt and capitalize on favorable market conditions, as reflected in the fair value of total debt [10], could also have played a role.\n\nIn summary, the net income for Amberjack and Mars increased"}

In 2021, the Adjusted EBITDA was $34,708 million, a decrease from $34,258 million in 2019, as shown in image5. This decrease can be attributed to various factors, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, as highlighted in [5], which mentions the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, as well as the impact of the Tokyo Olympics on accounts receivable and deferred revenue. Additionally, the increase in the number of sporting events in 2021, partially offset by theme park operations, contributed to these changes.\n\nIn the Cable Communications segment, capital expenditures increased due to scalable infrastructure and line extensions, as noted in [2], which likely impacted the Adjusted EBITDA. The expenses in this segment also rose due to programming and technical costs, as detailed in [3]. However, the overall revenue increase in 2021, driven by market recovery and Comcast Spectacor's performance, as mentioned in [1] and [6], helped offset some of these expenses.\n\nThe decrease in Corporate and Other expenses in 2021, primarily due to severance charges in the prior year, as stated in [3] and [7], also influenced the Adjusted EBITDA positively.

These acquisitions contributed significantly to the rise in income from equity method investments, which increased by $44 million. However, there was a decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14 million due to changes in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019.

The overall Total UnitedHealthcare — medical segment experienced a slight decrease of 715,000 individuals. \n\nThese changes can be attributed to several factors. The decrease in the Commercial segment is primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition, as well as underwriting discipline, which led to fewer people being served through commercial and Global benefits businesses [10]. The increase in Medicare Advantage is attributed to growth in individual Medicare Advantage plans, while the Medicaid increase is driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in Dual Special Needs Plans [10].

This turnaround is attributed to higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes of $760 million, and higher asset sales gains of $640 million [3].\n  - ![Upstream segment earnings improved significantly in 2021](image5)\n\n- **Downstream Segment:**\n  - The Downstream segment reported earnings of $2,914 million in 2021, compared to a loss of $47 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million [5].\n  - ![Downstream segment earnings also improved in 2021](image5)\n\n**Total Assets Analysis:**\n- **Upstream Segment:**\n  - Total Upstream assets in 2021 were $184,412 million, a decrease from $191,309 million in 2020.

Specifically, the Credit Risk RWA under the Standardized Approach rose from $342,684 million in 2019 to $387,066 million in 2020, while under the Advanced Approach, it increased from $228,927 million to $284,930 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities mainly from the E*TRADE acquisition, and higher lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments [4]. Additionally, the increase in Credit Risk RWA under the Advanced Approach was also attributed to Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) due to increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility [4]. These changes indicate a higher perceived credit risk, necessitating more capital to be held against potential credit losses.\n\n![Credit Risk RWA increased in 2020 under both approaches due to market volatility and increased exposures](image2)\n\nSecondly, the External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. Despite this decrease, the actual amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million. This suggests that while the institution's capacity to absorb losses in the event of failure has grown in absolute terms, the proportion relative to RWA has diminished, possibly due to the larger increase in RWA compared to the growth in TLAC. The regulatory minimum requirement for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%, and the required ratio is 21.5%, indicating that the institution remains above the required threshold but has seen a relative decline in this buffer [5].\n\n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% to 47.7%](image5)\n\nIn terms of the overall capital structure"}

This reduction is primarily due to a decrease in the current tax expense from $17,264,000 in 2019 to $8,775,000 in 2020. The deferred tax expense also decreased from a benefit of $1,791,000 in 2019 to a benefit of $393,000 in 2020. The reconciliation of the effective tax rate indicates that the profit before tax from continuing operations was $20,862,000 in 2020, compared to $52,618,000 in 2019, leading to a lower tax base. Additionally, the utilization of carried-forward tax losses and non-deductible expenses contributed to the lower tax expense in 2020.\n\nSecondly, impairment charges were a significant factor in 2020. According to text quote [7], impairment charges of $6,117,000 (after tax: $5,434,000) were recognized in 2020, primarily due to the decision to exit the Spanish market and write-downs of fixed assets, key money, and lease right-of-use assets. This is reflected in image4, which shows impairment charges of $3,360,000 related to the Spanish market exit and $2,757,000 for other store impairments, totaling $6,117,000. In contrast, no impairment charges were recognized in 2019.\n\nIn summary, the major changes include a significant reduction in tax expenses and the recognition of substantial impairment charges in 2020, primarily due to the exit from the Spanish market and lower taxable profits.\n\n![Total income tax expense decreased from $15,575,000 in 2019 to $9,641,000 in"}

This decrease was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent. The decline in net interest income was significant across various categories, as shown in image4, where the net change in interest income was a decrease of $5,627 million, with a notable impact from lower rates on loans and leases, particularly residential mortgage and credit card segments.\n\nIn contrast, from 2018 to 2019, net interest income increased by $714 million, driven by higher volumes and rates, as indicated in image4. The net change in interest income was a positive $2,693 million, with increases in interest income from loans and leases, particularly due to higher volumes in commercial and consumer segments.\n\nRegarding net interest expense, from 2019 to 2020, there was a net decrease of $5,245 million, primarily due to lower interest rates on deposits, as shown in image4. Savings and money market deposit accounts saw a significant reduction in interest expense, reflecting the lower rate environment. However, from 2018 to 2019, net interest expense increased by $3,738 million, driven by higher rates on U.S. interest-bearing deposits, particularly savings and demand deposits.\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in image2. The Consumer Banking segment, which includes deposits and consumer lending, was significantly impacted by the lower interest rate environment, leading to reduced net interest income. The Global Banking and Global Markets segments also experienced changes in interest income and expense, influenced by shifts in interest rates and volumes. The allocation of capital and management of interest rate risk, as mentioned in [3], played a crucial role in navigating these changes.\n\nThe organizational structure, with its focus on consumer and commercial banking"}

This decline is primarily attributed to lower interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [image2]. The decrease in interest income is consistent with the broader trend of declining short-term interest rates, which have remained low through 2021, impacting the income from cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills [6].\n\nIn terms of asset composition, the total invested assets increased from $363.117 billion in 2020 to $446.277 billion in 2021 [image1]. This growth was driven by a significant rise in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, which grew from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021 [image1]. Equity securities also saw a substantial increase from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 [image1]. However, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 [image1].\n\nThe shift towards holding more cash and cash equivalents, along with the increase in equity securities, suggests a strategy prioritizing liquidity and safety over yield [6]. This approach may be a response to the uncertain economic environment and the need to maintain ample liquidity [6]. The higher allocation to equity securities, despite their volatility, indicates a potential for higher returns, but also increased exposure to market risks [9].\n\nThe implications of these changes include a more conservative investment stance, which may provide stability during economic uncertainty but could result in lower immediate returns due to the low interest rate environment. The increased equity holdings could offer long-term growth potential but also introduce volatility in earnings due to market fluctuations [9].\n\n![Net investment income decreased by 4.6% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower interest income](image2)  \n![Invested assets increased"}

This turnaround was primarily due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and higher sales volumes [5]. Internationally, upstream earnings also surged to $8.5 billion in 2021 from a loss of $825 million in 2020, driven by higher realizations and the absence of impairments, though offset by higher tax charges and depreciation expenses [6]. These improvements in upstream operations were pivotal, as the upstream segment is a major contributor to Chevron's overall profitability [3].\n\nDownstream operations, however, experienced a decline in earnings. International downstream earnings decreased to $525 million in 2021 from $618 million in 2020, mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses, although foreign currency effects provided some offset [2]. In contrast, U.S. downstream operations improved, reporting earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020, largely due to higher margins and sales volumes [9].\n\nThe overall net income attributable to Chevron Corporation reflected these trends, with a net income of $15,625 million in 2021, a significant increase from a net loss of $5,543 million in 2020 and a net income of $2,924 million in 2019 [image1].

For instance, a 30% increase in hypothetical prices resulted in a minimal change in fair value, while a 30% decrease led to a significant reduction, indicating sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, image2 provides a detailed breakdown of how different interest rate changes (100 bp, 200 bp, 300 bp increases) affect the fair values of various assets and liabilities, including equity index put option contracts. The data shows that as interest rates increase, the fair value of these contracts decreases, aligning with the text's explanation.\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings, image5 highlights the differences between 2020 and 2021. In 2021, non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings was $955 million, whereas in 2020, it was a loss of $764 million. This significant shift from a loss to a gain indicates a favorable change in foreign currency exchange rates impacting net earnings positively in 2021 compared to 2020.

According to the text, the total shipment volume in Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.6% from 72,592 million units in 2019 to 64,200 million units in 2020, primarily due to declines in cigarette shipments by 11.8% and a 50.8% increase in heated tobacco units [10]. This shift reflects broader industry trends towards smoke-free alternatives, as PMI continues to optimize its global manufacturing infrastructure, which included asset impairments and exit costs in 2019 [3].\n\nThe financial summary highlights a substantial decrease in net revenues from $2,206 million in 2019 to $1,701 million in 2020, a change of -22.9%, with an unfavorable currency impact of -15.5% [4]. Operating income saw a stark increase of 100% from $235 million in 2019 to $564 million in 2020, driven by factors such as cost savings and the exclusion of 2019 non-cash charges [6]. However, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and asset impairment costs [7].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends.

This decline is evident in the financial data provided, where the net income for 2020 was $1,538 million, showing a year-over-year decrease in 2021. The key changes in the selected balance sheet data for Consumer Banking and Lending from 2019 to 2021 include:\n\n- **Total Loans**: There was a decrease in total loans from $379,766 million in 2019 to $333,885 million in 2021, a reduction of $45,881 million or 12%. This decline is primarily due to paydowns exceeding originations, as well as actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations [9]. The image data shows a consistent decrease in loans across various categories, with Home Lending loans decreasing by $44,140 million from 2020 to 2021, and Auto loans increasing slightly by $2,833 million [image4].\n\n- **Total Deposits**: Total deposits increased from $48,000 million in 2019 to $84,000 million in 2021, a significant rise of $36,000 million or 75%. This increase is attributed to higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, driven by government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. The image data confirms this trend, showing a substantial increase in total deposits from 2020 to 2021, with a $12,654 million increase in period-end total deposits [image4].\n\n- **Net Interest Income**: Net interest income for Consumer Banking and Lending decreased from $2,184 million in 2019 to $1,178 million in 2021, a reduction of $1,006 million or 46%.

Meanwhile, the net interest income rose from $6,660 million in 2019 to $6,674 million in 2021, indicating a marginal increase of 0.2%. This suggests that despite a slight reduction in the loan base, the company managed to maintain its net interest income, primarily due to lower costs of funds and improved portfolio quality. The net interest yield on average Card Member loans remained relatively stable at 11.2% in 2019 and 11.2% in 2021, reflecting effective management of interest margins. However, the decrease in average loans and the slight increase in net interest income highlight the company's focus on maintaining profitability through cost management and reserve releases rather than loan growth. The reserve releases in 2021, driven by improved macroeconomic outlook and portfolio quality, contributed to a net benefit, offsetting the impact of lower loan balances. This strategic approach helped the company sustain financial performance despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and changing economic conditions.\n\n![Average Card Member loans and net interest income from 2019 to 2021](image2)  \n![Net interest income and provisions for credit losses](image5)\n\nThe average Card Member loans slightly decreased, but net interest income remained stable, supporting the company's financial performance through effective cost management and reserve releases."}

This increase is primarily attributed to higher cash and cash equivalents, which rose from $9,352 million to $9,254 million, and an increase in receivables and inventories, as shown in image3. The rise in total assets suggests a strengthening balance sheet, potentially enhancing the company's financial stability and capacity for future investments.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, the consolidated segment saw a significant increase from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021, as detailed in image2. This improvement was largely driven by higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including increased accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for these compensations, as mentioned in [2] and [9]. Despite increased working capital requirements, favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset the negative impacts from inventory and accounts receivable changes.\n\nThe implications of these changes are positive for business operations.

Specifically, in 2020, the company saw a $416 million increase from current year tax positions and a $120 million increase from prior year tax positions, while decreases included $130 million from prior year tax positions and no settlements or statute of limitations lapses.

This reduction is evident in the image showing WFAM's asset flows, where outflows of $90.5 billion and a market impact of $11.6 billion led to a total decrease of $587.1 billion in assets under management after the sale [![WFAM assets under management decreased due to the sale](image5)].\n\nThe sale also had broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet. The company recorded a net gain of $269 million from the sale, which contributed to the noninterest income for 2021. However, this gain was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the sale, as WFAM was a significant contributor to such fees prior to its divestiture [2]. The income statement highlights a decrease in noninterest income by 14% in 2021 compared to 2020, partly due to the lower fees from WFAM [![Noninterest income decreased by 14%](image4)].\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale led to a reduction in assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets, which were $19 billion and $582 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. These assets are being administered under a transition services agreement that terminates in June 2022 [4].

The net interest expense also decreased, but the overall net interest spread was impacted by these changes. The net interest spread for 2020 was 1.90%, a decrease from 2.45% in 2019, reflecting the lower net interest income relative to the average earning assets [5].\n\n![Net interest income and expense changes](image2) shows the detailed breakdown of changes in interest income and expense. The decrease in net interest income was largely driven by a $19,747 million decrease in interest income from U.S. interest-bearing deposits, primarily due to lower rates [2]. The decrease in net interest expense was $714 million, mainly from reduced costs on U.S. interest-bearing deposits [3].\n\n![Earning assets and interest income details](image5) highlights the yield on earning assets, which decreased from 3.45% in 2019 to 2.61% in 2020, contributing to the lower net interest spread.

This is reflected in the total shares held by the promoter group, which remained at 2,703,542,000 shares both at the beginning and end of the year. This stability suggests a strong control by the promoter group over the company's equity structure.\n\nOn the other hand, public institutions, as shown in image1, exhibited slight variations in their shareholding. For instance, mutual funds/UTI and financial institutions/banks saw minor changes in their shareholding percentages, with mutual funds/UTI increasing from 2.5% to 2.6% and financial institutions/banks remaining at 0.1%. The total number of shares held by public institutions increased from 93,357,668 to 95,698,803, indicating a marginal growth in their investment. This suggests a cautious yet slightly increased participation by public institutions in the company's equity.\n\nAdditionally, foreign institutional investors and foreign portfolio investors (corporate) showed a significant presence in the public shareholding, with foreign institutional investors holding 15.7% and foreign portfolio investors (corporate) holding 0.3% at the end of the year, as seen in image2.

The final lease liability balance at 28 June 2020 was $167,154,000, with $36,019,000 classified as current and $131,135,000 as non-current [image1].\n- The transition also affected how prepaid rent and lease incentives were accounted for, now included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability rather than as separate provisions [image4].\n\n**Employee Benefit Liabilities:**\n- Employee benefit liabilities, including annual and long-service leave, increased from $4,054,000 in 2019 to $4,092,000 in 2020 [image3]. These liabilities are calculated based on expected payments and related costs, recognized at undiscounted amounts [1].\n- The increase in liability for annual leave from $2,992,000 to $2,848,000 and long-service leave from $703,000 to $837,000 reflects ongoing employee service obligations [1].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe adoption of AASB 16 resulted in a substantial increase in recognized lease liabilities and a slight increase in employee benefit liabilities, reflecting the new on-balance sheet treatment of leases and updated calculations for employee obligations.\n\n![The initial recognition of lease"}

According to the text, the Annual Total Remuneration for each executive is determined by a formula that considers consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance evaluations [1][3]. This approach ensures that remuneration is aligned with corporate performance while also reflecting individual responsibilities and performance [2].\n\nThe image1 highlights the key components of the evaluation: consolidated operating income, volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance evaluation. These factors serve as indicators for assessing Toyota's efforts in business performance and shareholder value. Specifically, consolidated operating income is used to evaluate the company's operational success, while share price volatility reflects the corporate value from the perspective of shareholders and investors.\n\nImage3 provides further detail on the evaluation process, showing that consolidated operating income and share price volatility each carry a 50% weight in the evaluation. The consolidated operating income is assessed against a reference value of 1 trillion yen, set for sustainable growth, while share price volatility is evaluated using Toyota's share price and the Nikkei stock average as benchmarks. This dual focus ensures that remuneration is tied to both operational achievements and market performance.\n\nAdditionally, image2 illustrates the breakdown of remuneration by type, showing a mix of fixed and performance-linked components. Performance-linked remuneration, which includes bonuses and share-based compensation, is directly influenced by the evaluation results of business performance and share price volatility. This structure incentivizes executives to focus on both short-term and long-term goals that benefit the company and its shareholders.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration system is designed to promote alignment with corporate performance and shareholder interests by using consolidated operating income and share price volatility as primary evaluation indicators.\n\n![Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation includes consolidated operating income and share price volatility as key indicators](image1)  \n![The evaluation process assigns equal weight to operating income and share price volatility, using specific reference values](image3)  \n![Performance-linked remuneration is structured to reflect business and shareholder value outcomes](image2)\n\nToyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance and shareholder value by using consolidated operating income and share price volatility as primary indicators, ensuring alignment with corporate and market performance."}

According to the data, credit risk RWA increased significantly under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to higher derivatives exposures and investment securities, as well as increased lending commitments and equity investments [5]. Market risk RWA also rose due to higher market volatility [6]. These increases in RWA would typically dilute the TLAC ratio, as the denominator (RWA) grew larger.\n\nHowever, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, as shown in image5. This decline indicates that while the absolute amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, the growth in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC, leading to a lower percentage. The increase in RWA components, particularly credit and market risk, contributed to this outcome.\n\n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image5)\n\nThe decrease in the External TLAC ratio reflects the combined effect of rising RWA and the proportional increase in TLAC, which was not sufficient to maintain the previous ratio.

For nickel, the Underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, primarily due to higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year [1]. The average realized sales price for nickel in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, driven by positive investor sentiment and strong demand [10]. However, this was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs due to the stronger nickel price [1].\n\nFor coal, the Underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, mainly due to lower prices and volumes. The decrease in prices had a substantial impact, with lower price impacts net of price-linked costs amounting to US$0.7 billion [2]. The average realized prices for metallurgical coal dropped from US$130.97 per tonne in FY2020 to US$106.64 per tonne in FY2021, and for thermal coal from US$57.10 per tonne to US$58.42 per tonne [image2]. Additionally, controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million due to higher maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and increased stripping volumes, although cost reduction initiatives partially offset this [2]. Queensland Coal's unit costs are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by higher diesel prices, though mine plan optimization and efficiency uplifts are expected to mitigate increased stripping requirements [6].\n\nThe sensitivity of BHP's financial results to commodity price changes is illustrated in image1, which shows the impact on profit after taxation and Underlying EBITDA from changes in prices.

This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Operating Income Growth**: The operating income rose from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, contributing significantly to the higher cash flow. This is supported by the improved performance across various segments, such as the Media and Theme Parks segments, which saw substantial revenue increases due to factors like the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics and the reopening of theme parks [10].\n\n2. **Depreciation and Amortization**: There was a slight increase in depreciation and amortization expenses from $13,100 million in 2020 to $13,804 million in 2021, which is a non-cash expense that adds to the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n3. **Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities**: The changes in operating assets and liabilities had a positive impact, moving from a negative $178 million in 2020 to a negative $1,499 million in 2021. This shift was primarily due to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, as well as increased production spending, which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue [2].\n\n4. **Interest and Tax Payments**: Payments of interest decreased from $3,878 million in 2020 to $3,908 million in 2021, while payments of income taxes decreased from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021. The reduction in income tax payments was notably due to tax deductions from the senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in 2021 [1].\n\n5. **Proceeds from Investments**: Proceeds from investments and other sources increased from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021, contributing to the higher net cash provided by operating activities [5].\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $24,737 million"}

Additionally, text [5] mentions that divestiture impacts related to the sale of the Polyfoam business in the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a net year-on-year operating income margin reduction of 0.6 percentage points, and incremental strategic investments further decreased margins by 1.0 percentage point.

However, there were increases in other components such as loss and other carryforwards ($556 million) and pension and other retiree benefits ($116 million) [3].\n\n**Deferred Tax Liabilities:**\n- The total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. This increase is largely driven by higher liabilities related to goodwill and intangible assets, which rose from $5,761 million to $5,783 million, and lease right-of-use assets, which increased from $191 million to $244 million. Additionally, there was a significant increase in foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated, from $108 million to $70 million [5].\n\n**Impact on Financial Position:**\n- The net increase in deferred tax liabilities compared to the decrease in deferred tax assets suggests a higher future tax obligation for the company. This could indicate potential cash outflows in future periods to settle these liabilities, affecting the company's liquidity. Moreover, the changes in deferred tax positions may influence the effective tax rate and net income in future periods, as adjustments to these positions are recognized [4].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe company's deferred tax liabilities have increased, while its deferred tax assets have decreased, leading to a net increase in future tax obligations. This shift could impact the company's cash flow and effective tax rate in subsequent periods.\n\n![Deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022](image3)\n![Deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022](image5)\n\nThe deferred tax liabilities have increased, while the deferred tax assets have decreased, leading to"}

The earliest settlement in the county was linked to the overland trails, notably the Nebraska City-Fort Kearny cut-off, which provided a shorter route west by avoiding the Platte River's northward bend [1]. This trail was later followed by explorers such as General Stephen Kearney in 1835 and General John C. Fremont in 1842, and it became a popular route for settlers and travelers, including the Mormons heading to Utah [4]. \n\nThe arrival of the railroad in 1879 further transformed the county, with the Burlington & Missouri line extending from York to Aurora and later to Grand Island. By 1890, Hamilton County had 66-1/3 miles of railroad lines, connecting it to major cities like Omaha and Lincoln, which facilitated the transport of agricultural products [2][6]. \n\nIn terms of modern transportation, Hamilton County is served by several major automobile routes. State Highway 14 connects Central City to Aurora and continues south, while US Highway 34 runs east to west from York to Grand Island. Interstate 80, a critical east-west route, bisects the county just south of Aurora, having been completed in Nebraska by 1974 [8]. \n\nThe map of Hamilton County highlights key communities such as Aurora, Hampton, Phillips, and Stockham, among others. Aurora, marked prominently on the map, is a central hub connected by these routes, underscoring its importance in the county's transportation network [image5]. \n\n![Hamilton County map showing key communities and major routes](image5)\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County is traversed by historical trails, railroads, and modern highways, with Aurora being a pivotal community in its transportation infrastructure."}

Initially, the population surged from 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890, driven by the Homestead Act of 1862, which attracted settlers with the promise of land [9]. This period saw rapid growth as pioneers established farms and communities, leading to the creation of numerous rural school districts and churches, such as the Zion Lutheran Church, which became focal points for German settlers [1, 5, 6]. \n\nHowever, after 1890, the population began a slow decline, reaching 9,403 by 2000. This decline was largely due to farm consolidation and mechanization, which reduced the number of farms while increasing their size, making small-scale farming economically unviable [4]. The consolidation trend continued, impacting rural towns outside Aurora, which struggled to maintain populations as farming operations became more centralized [2, 3]. \n\nAurora, however, experienced population gains, peaking at 4,225 in 2000, contrasting with the decline in smaller towns [2]. The map of Hamilton County highlights the distribution of ethnic settlements, with Danish, Swedish, and German communities clustering in different areas, contributing to localized population dynamics [7, 8, 10]. \n\n![Hamilton County's population peaked in 1890 and declined thereafter](image3) illustrates the population data, showing the initial boom and subsequent decline.

The church's continued presence ![St. John’s complex remains a community focal point](image4) reflects the cultural persistence of ethnic groups like the Danes, who maintained strong community ties [7].\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population trends were shaped by initial settlement incentives, agricultural evolution, and economic centralization, leading to a decline in rural populations and growth in larger towns like Aurora.\n\nThe population of Hamilton County increased dramatically from 1870 to 1890 due to settlement incentives but declined afterward due to agricultural"}

The main components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Function**: The multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm. This component addresses the challenge of efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images/text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval [8].\n   - **Image Reference**: ![The multimodal retriever encodes images and text into embeddings, indexes them, and retrieves top-k categories](image3)\n\n2. **Retrieval Process**:\n   - **Function**: Upon receiving an input image, the retriever retrieves the top-k class names most similar to the image from the memory bank. This retrieval phase is crucial for narrowing down potential categories before ranking [1].\n   - **Image Reference**: ![The retrieval process involves encoding the input image, retrieving top-k categories, and combining them for ranking](image3)\n\n3. **Ranking by MLLMs**:\n   - **Function**: The retrieved category labels and image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction, enhancing the accuracy and contextually aware classification [4][5].\n   - **Image Reference**: ![The ranking prompt example shows how retrieved categories are sorted and ranked by the MLLM](image4)\n\n4. **Pre-processing for Object Detection**:\n   - **Function**: For object detection datasets, additional pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring are applied. Cropping focuses on regions of interest based on bounding box coordinates, while blurring non-target areas directs the MLLMs' focus toward relevant objects, facilitating their identification [3].\n   - **Image Reference**: ![Pre-processing involves cropping and blurring to focus on relevant objects](image5)\n\n5. **Index Construction**:\n   - **Function**: To enhance retrieval speed, an index system using the HNSW algorithm is implemented.

This method, as described in [7], systematically narrows down the search by focusing on finer details as it moves deeper into the tree. The process is controlled by parameters such as depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer, allowing for a balance between specificity and breadth [9].

The decoder processes these queries in parallel, allowing the model to globally reason about all objects together using pairwise relations between them while considering the entire image as context [5].

This method achieves a 32% relative error reduction over the vanilla semi-character model [3]. The most accurate variant involves backing off to the background model, resulting in a lower error rate of 6.9%, leading to the best performance on word recognition [5]. \n\nImage1 shows the performance of BERT and its variants under different attack settings.

If the response is not satisfactory, the system iterates by retrieving more context information and regenerating the response. This process continues until a maximum number of iterations or a threshold is reached. ![Iterative retrieval involves looping through retrieval and generation until a threshold is met](image5)\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**:\n- Recursive retrieval breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-queries.

This continues until a maximum depth or threshold is reached, effectively handling nuanced or complex queries by addressing them step-by-step. ![Recursive retrieval decomposes queries into simpler parts](image5)\n\n**Adaptive Retrieval**:\n- Adaptive retrieval introduces flexibility by allowing the system to judge whether retrieval is needed based on the query.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which was close to the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance was attributed to the exploitation of statistical cues rather than true argument comprehension [1][9]. When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's accuracy dropped to 53%, with a mean and median of 50% [3][5]. This indicates that BERT's high performance was not due to understanding the arguments but rather exploiting cues in the original dataset [9].\n\nIn contrast, other models like BoV and BiLSTM also showed reduced performance on the adversarial dataset, but their reliance on cues was less pronounced. The adversarial dataset was constructed by adding a copy of each data point with the claim negated and the label inverted, effectively mirroring the distribution of cues over both labels [3]. This transformation ensured that all models, including BERT, performed randomly, demonstrating the robustness of the evaluation [3][5].\n\nThe adversarial dataset provides a more accurate assessment of argument comprehension by removing the influence of spurious cues. BERT's reduced performance highlights the need for controlling such cues in NLP tasks to ensure models are evaluated based on their actual understanding rather than statistical exploitation [4][9]. The adversarial setup aligns with the intuition that without genuine comprehension, high performance should not be achievable [5].\n\n![BERT's performance on the original dataset](image1) shows its reliance on cues, with a peak of 77% accuracy.

Each of these mechanisms addresses different types of DNA damage, ensuring the integrity of the genetic material.\n\n- **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: As described in [5], BER is the most frequent pathway used for single-strand point mutations.

It excises a segment of DNA containing the damage and replaces it with the correct sequence.\n\n- **Direct Reversal Repair**: [9] explains that this mechanism directly reverses specific types of DNA damage, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, without incising the DNA strands.\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: [6] describes MMR, which corrects errors during DNA replication by recognizing and repairing mismatched bases, ensuring high fidelity in DNA replication.\n\n- **Recombination Repair**: [10] details this mechanism, which is vital for repairing double-strand breaks.

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement. For example, in deductive reasoning, the LLM converts statements like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing\" into symbolic logic: `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [4][5]. This step is crucial as it shifts the LLM's focus from solving the problem to accurately representing it in a symbolic language [1][2].\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**: Once the problem is formulated symbolically, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on this representation. Depending on the type of logical reasoning problem, different solvers are used, such as Pyke for deductive reasoning or Z3 for analytical reasoning [4][5]. The solver applies logical rules and constraints to derive a symbolic-represented answer. For instance, in the example of determining whether \"Nails cannot conduct electricity,\" the symbolic reasoner evaluates the rules and facts to conclude `ConductElectricity(Nail, False)` [5].\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**: The final stage involves translating the symbolic answer back into natural language using an LLM or rule-based interpreter. This ensures the output is understandable and correctly maps to the problem's answer. For example, the symbolic result `ConductElectricity(Nail, False)` is interpreted as \"The statement 'Nails cannot conduct electricity' is false\" [5].\n\nThis framework enhances logical reasoning by leveraging the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic solvers, ensuring faithful and transparent reasoning [1][2][6]. The self-refinement module further improves accuracy by iteratively revising the symbolic formulation based on error feedback from the solver [6][10].\n\n![LOGIC-LM's three-stage process](image5) illustrates how the model integrates these modules to solve problems effectively.\n\n**Answer**: The LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first translating it into a symbolic representation using an LLM, then applying a symbolic solver for logical inference, and finally interpreting the result back into natural language."}

According to [1], the model consists of a character-level neural network, which can be either an RNN or a CNN, designed to capture subword information such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. This is important because subword information can help the model understand variations in word forms and improve its ability to recognize entities even when they appear in different contexts or with different capitalizations. \n\nAdditionally, the model includes a word-level neural network, typically an RNN, which consumes word representations and produces context-sensitive hidden representations for each word. This allows the model to leverage the context in which words appear, enhancing its understanding of the sentence structure and the relationships between words. The combination of these two levels of embeddings ensures that the model can handle both the internal structure of words and their contextual usage, leading to more accurate entity recognition.\n\n![The model architecture includes both character and word embeddings to capture subword and contextual information](image5)\n\nThe use of both embeddings is further supported by the architecture described in [5], where the model concatenates character representations with word embeddings to form a comprehensive input representation for each word. This dual approach allows the model to benefit from the granularity of character-level features and the broader context provided by word-level features, improving its performance in NER tasks.\n\nIn summary, the model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to capture subword and contextual information, enhancing its ability to recognize named entities accurately."}

As described in text quote [4], the methodology involves cropping and blurring techniques to address the challenges posed by images containing multiple objects of varying sizes and positions. The cropping step isolates the regions of interest based on bounding box coordinates, ensuring that the model concentrates on the specific objects intended for detection. This is visually demonstrated in image2, where different bounding boxes (bbox1, bbox2, bbox3) are applied to separate parts of the image, each containing distinct objects like a flower arrangement, saltshaker, and vase. By cropping these regions, the model can process each object individually, improving the accuracy of recognition.\n\nAdditionally, the blurring technique is employed to obscure non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This strategy directs the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to focus more effectively on the relevant objects, as non-blurred regions are more likely to be the focus of the model's attention. Image2 illustrates this by showing the blurring effect applied to areas outside the bounding boxes, which helps in reducing distractions and enhancing the model's ability to identify the objects accurately. The subsequent embedding and retrieval process, as shown in image2, relies on these pre-processed images to generate embeddings that are stored in the memory bank. These embeddings are then used during the inference phase to retrieve the most similar categories, which are later ranked by the MLLMs to make the final prediction.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing step of cropping and blurring is integral to the system's design, as it prepares the images in a way that aligns with the model's capabilities, thereby improving the precision of zero-shot object recognition.\n\n![The pre-processing step involves cropping and blurring to isolate and highlight relevant objects for improved recognition](image2) \n\nThe pre-processing step contributes to the zero-shot recognition system by isolating relevant objects through cropping and reducing distractions with blurring, enhancing the model's focus and accuracy in object detection tasks."}

This laid the groundwork for subsequent developments. In 2011, the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" became a pivotal resource, enabling researchers to analyze word usage and meaning changes across decades [9]. The following year, 2012, saw the emergence of \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" which allowed for more nuanced understanding of word meanings in different time periods [1].\n\nBy 2013, \"Prediction-based models\" such as word2vec were introduced, significantly advancing the field by providing robust methods to capture semantic shifts quantitatively [7]. The year 2014 witnessed the development of \"Word embeddings with incremental updates,\" enhancing the ability to track changes over time [7]. In 2015, \"Models alignment\" techniques were refined, improving the accuracy of comparing word vectors across different time spans [7].\n\nThe timeline continues with the use of the \"NYT corpus\" in 2016, which provided rich, yearly data for detailed analysis of semantic shifts [10]. The same year, the \"COHA corpus\" was also employed, offering insights into cultural semantic drift [10]. In 2017, significant advancements included the exploration of \"Laws of semantic change\" and \"Local measures of semantic change,\" which provided theoretical frameworks for understanding these shifts [6]. Additionally, the \"GigaWord corpus\" was utilized to study cultural shifts related to specific events like armed conflicts [10].\n\nThe image illustrates these milestones chronologically, highlighting the progression from foundational concepts to sophisticated models and corpora usage, culminating in the identification of semantic change laws and cultural shifts by 2017 ![Timeline of key milestones in diachronic semantic shifts research from 2010 to 2017](image1).\n\nIn summary, the key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of time tensors, the use of Google Ngrams, prediction-based models, incremental updates, model alignment, and the application of various corpora, leading to the formulation of semantic change laws."}

According to the ablation study in [10], removing the abstract from the input leads to a substantial decrease in performance, indicating that the abstract is a crucial component for the model's effectiveness. Adding authors as an input, however, hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and suboptimal tokenization by Wordpieces, which may introduce noise. Adding venues slightly decreases performance except in document classification, where venues are more relevant. This suggests that while some metadata can be beneficial, others may introduce noise or reduce the model's ability to generalize. The use of hard negative distractors is also critical, as shown in image4, where removing them results in a noticeable drop in performance across tasks. The choice of the initial language model is important too; starting with BERT-Large instead of SciBERT reduces performance, as SciBERT is pretrained on scientific text, making it more suitable for the tasks evaluated.

This is visually represented in image5, which shows the formation of the nuclear envelope and nucleolus during this stage ![Nuclear envelope and nucleolus forming](image5). \n\nCytokinesis, which often overlaps with telophase [1], involves the division of the cytoplasm. The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the cell, creating a cleavage furrow that eventually divides the cell into two daughter cells [2]. This process is illustrated in image3, where the cleavage furrow is visible, indicating the physical separation of the cell ![Cleavage furrow forming](image3). \n\nThe spindle fibers, which were responsible for moving the chromosomes during mitosis, disassemble as the chromosomes reach their respective poles and begin to de-condense into chromatin [6].

The parental (P) generation consisted of plants that were homozygous for these traits: PP (purple) and pp (white) [5]. When these plants were crossed, all offspring in the F1 generation were heterozygous (Pp) and displayed the dominant phenotype (purple flowers) [5].\n\n![Parental generation cross](image5) illustrates this initial cross, showing that all F1 plants have purple flowers. This is because the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p) in the heterozygous condition.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the F1 plants (Pp) are self-fertilized or crossed with each other. Each gamete produced by the F1 plants has an equal chance of receiving either the P or p allele. The possible combinations of alleles in the offspring are PP, Pp, and pp. According to Mendel's law of segregation, the alleles separate during gamete formation, and each gamete receives only one allele [4].\n\n![F2 generation cross](image4) shows the genetic makeup and resulting phenotypic ratios. The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp, while the phenotypic ratio is 3 purple : 1 white.

Gestalt psychology, originating from the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology, focuses on understanding how we perceive and organize visual elements into meaningful wholes [1]. The design of \"GESTALT\" incorporates principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and figure-ground segregation to create a cohesive and unified visual experience.\n\n**Proximity** is demonstrated by the arrangement of letters and shapes close to each other, making them appear as a single group. This is shown in the image where the letters are positioned near one another, enhancing the perception of a unified word ![Proximity is shown by the close arrangement of letters](image1).\n\n**Similarity** is evident through the use of consistent shapes and colors, such as the repeated use of geometric patterns and lines, which group elements together visually. The image highlights this by using similar shapes and colors to unify different parts of the word ![Similarity is shown by the use of consistent shapes and colors](image1).\n\n**Continuity** is achieved by the flow of lines and shapes that guide the eye smoothly across the word, creating a sense of movement and connection between elements. The image illustrates this with lines that lead the viewer’s eye through the design ![Continuity is shown by the flow of lines](image1).\n\n**Closure** is applied by allowing the viewer to perceive complete forms even when parts are missing. The design uses incomplete shapes that the mind fills in to recognize the full letters, as seen in the image where gaps are mentally completed ![Closure is shown by incomplete shapes perceived as whole](image1).\n\n**Figure-Ground Segregation** is used to distinguish the word from the background, ensuring it stands out clearly. The image effectively separates the design from its background, making \"GESTALT\" easily recognizable ![Figure-Ground Segregation is shown by the clear distinction from the background](image1).\n\nThese principles work together to create a harmonious and organized visual representation of the word \"GESTALT,\" reflecting the core ideas of Gestalt psychology.\n\nThe principles of Gestalt psychology manifest in the design of the word \"GESTALT\" by using proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and figure-ground segregation to create a unified and meaningful visual experience."}

This is a critical step where the chromosome number is reduced by half, from diploid to haploid. The homologous pairs, which consist of two sets of chromosomes, are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. This separation is depicted in image1, where homologous chromosomes are shown moving apart during anaphase I. The text [7] confirms that homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis I, reducing the chromosome number by half.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis I results in two haploid cells, each containing a single set of chromosomes. The process involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, as shown in image3, leading to the division of the cell into two daughter cells. The text [3] mentions telophase I and cytokinesis, which are part of this division.\n\n**Meiosis II:**\n- **Chromosome Separation:** In meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. Unlike meiosis I, the chromosome number remains the same during this stage. Sister chromatids, which are identical copies of each other, are pulled to opposite poles. This is illustrated in image3, where sister chromatids are shown separating during anaphase II. The text [4] and [7] indicate that sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, maintaining the haploid number.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis II results in four haploid cells, each with a unique set of chromosomes. The division is similar to mitosis, as the sister chromatids are separated, and the cell divides again. Image4 shows the progression from anaphase II to telophase II, where the final separation occurs, leading to the formation of four haploid cells.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Meiosis I** focuses on the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half.\n- **Meiosis II** involves the separation of sister chromatids, resulting in four haploid cells without changing the chromosome number.\n\n![Meiosis I shows homologous chromosomes separating](image1)\n![Meiosis II shows sister chromatids separating](image3)\n![Meiosis II results in four haploid cells](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, meiosis I reduces the chromosome number by separating homologous chromosomes, while meiosis"}

This is illustrated in image4, where the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases progressively, eventually becoming negative. For example, the utility from the first hot dog is +10, but by the fourth hot dog, it drops to -1, indicating a loss of satisfaction [4].\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the utility calculation changes significantly. Image5 shows a scenario where Joey Chestnut competes in a hot dog eating contest. Here, the marginal utility of each hot dog consumed initially decreases, but at a critical point (64th hot dog), the utility spikes dramatically due to the competitive outcome. Consuming the 64th hot dog grants a utility of +5000, reflecting the high reward of tying for the championship, and the 65th hot dog provides +10000 utility for winning. This demonstrates that in competition, the focus and potential for mastery can override diminishing marginal utility, as the ultimate goal (winning) provides substantial utility despite the discomfort of consumption [5][7][10].\n\nThus, while standard consumption emphasizes decreasing satisfaction with more intake, competitive contexts can transform utility through the lens of achievement and reward, where the focus on winning alters the utility landscape.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption shows decreasing satisfaction with each additional hot dog](image4)  \n![Competitive context alters utility, with high rewards at critical consumption points](image5)\n\nIn competitive contexts, diminishing marginal utility is overshadowed by the potential for large rewards, making focused effort valuable despite decreasing immediate satisfaction."}

This mode ensures that the overall scene is well-balanced, preventing overexposure or underexposure in any particular area. ![Matrix metering measures light across the entire frame; ideal for shooting natural landscapes.](image5)\n- **Center Metering** focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is perfect for portraits. It ensures the subject's face is well-lit while allowing the background to be slightly darker or lighter. ![Center metering focuses on light near the center of the screen; ideal for shooting portraits.](image5)\n- **Spot Metering** targets light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes. This is useful in scenarios where precise exposure control is needed, like in backlit situations or when the subject is a small part of the frame. ![Spot metering focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes.](image5)\n\n**Focus Modes:**\n- **AF-S (Single)** is best for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus on non-moving objects. ![AF-S (single) is used for stationary subjects.](image1)\n- **AF-C (Continuous)** tracks moving subjects, maintaining focus as they move, which is essential for action shots or sports photography. ![AF-C (continuous) is used for moving subjects.](image1)\n- **MF (Manual)** allows manual focus by touching the subject of interest, providing control over focus points, especially useful for close-ups or macro photography. ![MF (manual) allows touching the subject of interest to focus, such as the subject's face.](image1)\n\nIn Pro Mode, these settings can be adjusted directly through the interface, as shown in the camera app layout. ![The Pro mode interface allows adjusting ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, focus mode, and white balance.](image2) By selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, photographers can achieve optimal results tailored to their specific shooting conditions.\n\n**Answer:** Different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by allowing precise control over exposure and focus, adapting to various scenarios like landscapes, portraits, and action shots."}

Marketing communications are customized to match the prospect's characteristics and degree of sales-readiness. Every activity the prospects or lead does is given a score. When the scores reach a pre-determined threshold, the prospector lead is deemed Marketing Qualified and therefore sales-ready and transferred to the sales team.\n- **[4]** Displays how many of your Leads are converting into Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs), how many of your MQLs are converting into Sales-Accepted Leads (SALs), how many of your SALs are converting into Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs), and how many of your SQLs are becoming actual Sales Won Opportunities (SWOs).\n- **[10]** Lead Funnel Progression\n\n### Visual Evidence:\n- **![image4](image4)**: This image shows the conversion rates at different stages of the lead funnel.

This indicates a potential issue in the lead qualification process or sales acceptance criteria.\n   - **Lead Quality**: The low conversion rate suggests that the leads being qualified as MQLs may not meet the sales team's criteria for acceptance. This could be due to misalignment between marketing and sales teams on what constitutes a qualified lead.\n   - **Process Review**: There may be a need to review the lead scoring methodology [1] to ensure that MQLs are genuinely sales-ready."}
