Immigrant Hispanics often retain a strong connection to their ancestral national origins [9] and are more inclined to use terms related to their country of origin to describe themselves, as shown in the image illustrating the preferred self-identification as country of Hispanic origin/heritage or Latino ![Country of Hispanic/\norigin/heritage Latino](image1). As generations progress, this preference shifts. Second-generation Hispanics, born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent, show a growing tendency to identify as American, and this trend becomes even more pronounced in the third generation and beyond [7, 8].  This is visually supported by data showing the increasing percentage of Hispanics identifying as \"American\" across generations ![=Often Sometimes Rarely — Never](image6). While half of U.S. Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, this feeling is more prevalent among later generations [2, 8].\n\nLanguage use is another key area influenced by generational differences. Spanish is often linked to Latino identity, but most Latinos, even immigrants, do not believe speaking Spanish is a prerequisite for being Latino [4, 5].  This view is even stronger among U.S.-born Latinos, with the vast majority of second and third generations stating that Spanish proficiency is not necessary for Latino identity [4].  In fact, Spanish dominance decreases sharply across generations; it is high among immigrants but becomes very rare in the second and practically nonexistent in the third generation [11].  This generational shift in language dominance is depicted in the data highlighting Spanish and English language preferences across generations ![Second](image7).  Despite the decreasing use of Spanish, the data also indicates that a large majority of Hispanics across generations still believe having a Spanish last name is not necessary to be considered Hispanic ![Speak Spanish](image4).\n\nIn conclusion, generational progression among Hispanics in the U.S. leads to a stronger American identity and a decline in Spanish language dominance, although a Spanish last name and Spanish language proficiency are generally not considered essential for Hispanic identity across all generations."}

During this period, there was a general increase in mobile subscribers across Indonesia [8].  Observing subscriber data for Telkomsel, we can see the scale of their operations in comparison to other providers in both years ![Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat subscriber, smartphone, Blackberry, Android, and data user numbers in 2013](image6).  This growth in subscriber numbers occurred alongside evolving usage patterns.  Trends in the industry indicated a decline in revenue from traditional services like SMS and voice calls, contributing to reduced overall Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) [2]. This was partially due to users increasingly adopting data-based communication methods such as instant messaging and VoIP, which diminished the reliance on SMS and voice calls [9, 10].  However, despite the pressure on traditional revenue streams, there was anticipation that data ARPU would eventually compensate for these declines as mobile internet usage grew [5] ![Projected trends for Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data ARPU from 2013 to 2017](image2).  Price competition, potentially sparked by government initiatives and the competitive actions of CDMA operators, also played a significant role in shaping the ARPU landscape during this time, putting downward pressure on tariffs [6, 7].\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, Telkomsel likely experienced growth in its subscriber base, but faced challenges in maintaining ARPU due to price competition and the evolving shift in user preferences towards data-based services."}

By 2014, Telkomsel's smartphone users grew to 65 million, and XL's impressively increased to 38 million [image3].\n\n![In 2013, Telkomsel had 43 million and XL had 13.8 million smartphone users.](image7)\n\nThis rapid growth in smartphone adoption occurred during a period where overall mobile subscribers in Indonesia were already substantial and continuing to grow [10].  However, alongside the rise of smartphone users, there was a shift in how these users utilized their mobile services. People increasingly favored data-based applications like instant messaging and VoIP, leading to a decrease in traditional SMS and voice call usage [4]. This behavioral change directly impacted the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). As illustrated, Voice and SMS ARPU were on a declining trend, while Mobile Data ARPU was expected to eventually rise, though potentially after an initial dip [image1, 5].\n\n![Voice and SMS ARPU were decreasing, while Mobile Data ARPU was expected to increase.](image1)\n\nInitially, the reduction in ARPU was exacerbated by intense price competition, possibly triggered by government actions and the strategies of CDMA operators that pushed GSM operators to lower their tariffs [8, 11]. However, by late 2014, it was noted that tariffs had reached a rock-bottom level, suggesting an end to the price war [2].  The overall trend indicated a continuous decline in ARPU until around 2015. It was anticipated that the increased consumption of mobile data on smartphones would eventually lead users to subscribe to larger data plans, which would then compensate for the diminishing revenues from voice and SMS, leading to a stabilization or even increase in overall ARPU [5].\n\nThe number of smartphone users for both Telkomsel and XL significantly increased from 2013 to 2014, likely influenced by the broader trend of smartphone adoption and shifts in user behavior towards data services, while ARPU trends were characterized by declining voice and SMS revenue, initially compounded by price wars, but with an anticipated future recovery driven by growing data consumption."}

These diverse reasons are visually summarized, highlighting that calculation errors account for a significant portion (41.7%), followed by approximation errors (33.3%) and partially correct claims (10.0%) as reasons for refutation. ![Refuted claims are often due to calculation errors, approximation inaccuracies, or partial correctness](image6).\n\nNEI claims also display diverse reasoning patterns, with the most common features being insufficient evidence within the table and a lack of necessary background knowledge [5].  Further reasons for NEI include the absence of closed-domain knowledge, vague pronouns within the claim, and instances where additional information beyond the table is required for verification [5].  These varied reasons for NEI claims, including insufficient evidence (33.3%) and lack of open-domain knowledge (25.0%), contribute to the complexity of the dataset. ![NEI claims often lack sufficient table evidence or domain knowledge](image6).\n\nThis complexity significantly impacts the performance of models in zero-shot 3-class classification.  Models generally perform worse in the 3-class setting compared to the 2-class setting, indicating the difficulty in handling the NEI class [10].  This is evident in the performance metrics, where models like Vicuna-7B achieve 63.62 in 2-class but only 32.47 in 3-class settings, and FLAN-T5-XL shows 52.41 in 2-class and 38.05 in 3-class. ![Model performance is notably lower in 3-class classification compared to 2-class](image1).

Confusion matrices for both models in the 3-class setting indicate that both struggle with the \"Not Enough Information\" (NEI) class [6]. InstructGPT tends to be \"less confident,\" frequently misclassifying supported and refuted claims as NEI. In contrast, GPT-4 exhibits \"overconfidence,\" often incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [6]. This difference in confidence and error distribution is visually represented in their respective confusion matrices ![Confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4, showing different error distributions](image8).\n\nSeveral error types contribute to these performance differences, particularly in the challenging context of scientific fact-checking. Error analysis on SCITAB highlights grounding errors, ambiguity errors, calculation errors, and program errors as key challenges [5].  Indeed, the difficulty in accurately referencing specific cells in tables (grounding errors) and handling ambiguous scientific claims are unique challenges posed by SCITAB [5]. These error types are further categorized to understand the proportions of different errors in program-based methods ![Proportion of different error types in program-based methods](image3).

This is visually represented in speed-up ratios, where GPT-J consistently outperforms GPT2-XL across datasets like SST-2, TREC, AGNews and EmoC [Image7].\n\nFurther analysis into classification accuracies can be gained by examining confusion. For instance, when analyzing category confusion, models like GPT2-XL display varying levels of confusion between categories, especially on datasets like TREC [5]. Predicted confusion scores correlate strongly with actual model confusion, indicating that ICL errors tend to occur in categories with similar label anchors [12]. This is supported by confusion matrices that visualize the predicted confusion between categories such as 'Description' and 'Entity' [Image5] and the actual confusion [Image8]. The 'Confusion' metric accurately identifies highly confusing cases, demonstrating that classification inaccuracies are linked to the similarity of label anchors between categories [12].\n\nIn conclusion, GPT-J generally exhibits better speed-up ratios than GPT2-XL, and confusion matrices reveal that classification accuracy in both models is influenced by the degree of category confusion, particularly arising from similar label anchors."}

This robust safety performance is attributed to specific training methodologies, including the incorporation of safety-specific data annotation and tuning, alongside red-teaming and iterative evaluations [7].  The training process, visualized as a loop involving human feedback and reward models, directly refines the model's safety [image6]. This iterative process of retraining with human feedback and safety reward models is crucial for enhancing the safety features of Llama 2-Chat.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of more safety data during the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) phase demonstrably improves Llama 2-Chat's ability to respond safely to unsafe prompts [3].  As more safety data is integrated, the model becomes more adept at refusing to generate offensive content and exhibits more conservative behavior when encountering sensitive terms, even within safe contexts [3].

The total carbon emission for training the LLaMA 2 family of models is estimated to be 539 tCO2eq, an amount that was completely offset by Meta’s sustainability initiatives [7].  This dedication to environmental responsibility is coupled with the intention of the open release strategy to prevent other organizations from needing to repeat these pre-training costs, contributing to global resource conservation [7].  The carbon footprint varies across different model sizes within the LLaMA 2 family, as detailed in the training emission data. ![Table summarizing the training time, power consumption, and carbon emissions for different LLaMA 2 model sizes](image8).

Compared to models like Falcon and MPT, Llama 2 generally performs better across different benchmarks, though specific code-related benchmarks may vary [3].  A key strength of Llama 2-Chat models is their enhanced truthfulness and significantly reduced toxicity compared to the base Llama 2 models, achieving the lowest toxicity among the models compared [5, 6].  As illustrated in ![Llama 2-Chat demonstrates superior truthfulness and minimal toxicity compared to other models](image5), these fine-tuned models excel in safety-related metrics.

As demonstrated, removing required knowledge notably reduces both citation precision and recall, although it minimally affects correctness [9]. This decline is further illustrated in the experimental results, where precision, recall, and F1-Score all decrease as more knowledge is removed from the knowledge graph ![Table showing metrics decrease as removed knowledge increases](image2).  However, under the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting, a different trend emerges. Recall remains relatively stable, while precision and F1-Score show an upward trend as more knowledge is identified as absent from the knowledge graph ![Graph showing precision and F1-score increase, recall stable](image1). This suggests that when the model is aware of its knowledge limitations, it can more accurately pinpoint and utilize the available knowledge, even as the knowledge base becomes less comprehensive [10].\n\nIn essence, the degradation of precision and recall with general knowledge removal indicates a vulnerability in models when faced with incomplete information. Conversely, the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting enhances the model's ability to discern and adapt to knowledge gaps, leading to improved precision and stable recall in scenarios with increasing knowledge scarcity.

Furthermore, the inclusion of logical constraints in the instructions given to Large Language Models (LLMs) yields consistent improvements in performance, especially when used in conjunction with a greater number of demonstrations [1].

In fact, employing logical constraints with a smaller set of demonstrations can even surpass the performance of prompts that rely solely on a larger number of demonstrations [1]. Broadly, the incorporation of relevant logic into LLM instructions proves to be highly beneficial for enhancing performance in reasoning tasks [8].

Incorporating logical constraints, especially through retrieval-based approaches, demonstrably reduces logical inconsistency and enhances overall performance in tasks such as event relation extraction [1].  This method improves performance by explicitly teaching LLMs logical boundaries [2].  However, while post-processing can guarantee the elimination of logical conflicts, achieving a Logical Inconsistency (LI) of $0\\%$, it may come at the cost of answer quality, potentially deviating from the ground truth due to random selection and potentially requiring extensive operations [1].  As shown in the result table, models using post-processing achieve zero LI but often exhibit lower Micro-F1 scores compared to those using retrieved logical constraints across both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, exemplified by the 'w. post-processing' rows consistently having 0% LI but lower Micro-F1 than 'w. retrieved logical constraints' rows in both tasks. ![Post-processing achieves zero logical inconsistency but generally lower performance compared to retrieval-based logical constraints](image1). This observation is further supported when comparing different approaches across various models in MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank and Proof Writer, where post-processing, while effective at removing inconsistencies, does not lead to the highest performance [image3]. In contrast, directly integrating logical constraints into LLM instructions is generally more effective than applying post-processing after results are generated [7]. Ultimately, while post-processing can eliminate logical inconsistencies, leveraging logical constraints during the generation process appears to be a more balanced approach for enhancing both logical consistency and overall performance in LLMs. In conclusion, logical constraints offer a more effective balance between reducing logical inconsistency and maintaining model performance compared to post-processing methods across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

To effectively guide the model's attention, a blurring technique is applied to non-target areas surrounding objects of interest, alongside cropping image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates [5]. This is crucial as objects in detection datasets can be small and variably positioned, unlike in image classification where objects are typically central and large.\n\nDue to the small size of cropped sub-images in object detection, traditional image-to-image retrieval becomes less effective. Instead, the system leverages CLIP's inherent image-text interaction capabilities to perform image-to-text retrieval [12]. This approach allows the system to identify top-k category information with the highest similarity by comparing image features with text descriptions. The system architecture, as illustrated, incorporates a multimodal retriever to build and access a feature index from a database of image feature embeddings, which is essential for efficient retrieval of relevant categories [11, Image 6]. ![The multimodal retriever efficiently retrieves relevant categories using a feature index.](image6)\n\nFollowing retrieval, category labels and image embeddings are combined and processed by MLLMs. The MLLMs then rank these retrieved results, utilizing their linguistic and semantic analysis capabilities to assess the contextual appropriateness of each category name with the input image [4, 7]. This ranking step is vital as it goes beyond simple retrieval order to ensure a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.  For instance, bounding boxes containing objects like 'flower_arrangement', 'saltshaker', and 'vase' are processed individually to retrieve and rank relevant category labels [Image 7]. ![Individual bounding boxes are processed for category retrieval and ranking.](image7)\n\nThe multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by pre-processing images with cropping and blurring, employing image-to-text retrieval, and utilizing MLLMs to rank the retrieved categories for enhanced accuracy."}

This approach is designed to improve performance in complex multi-step reasoning tasks where even state-of-the-art models struggle.  When evaluating Step-Back Prompting on Knowledge QA tasks such as TimeQA and SituatedQA, it shows significant performance improvements over baseline models and other prompting techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Take a Deep Breathe (TDB) [8].  For instance, on TimeQA, baseline models like GPT-4 and PaLM-2L achieve around 45.6% and 41.5% accuracy respectively, while Step-Back + RAG remarkably boosts accuracy to 68.7% [3]. Retrieval augmentation (RAG) alone improves the accuracy to 57.4%, but Step-Back prompting further enhances the effectiveness of RAG by guiding it with a high-level concept, leading to more reliable information retrieval [3].\n\nThe effectiveness of Step-Back Prompting is also evident in comparison to other methods across various benchmarks.  Looking at performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry, PaLM-2L with Step-Back prompting outperforms PaLM-2L alone, CoT, and TDB significantly, approaching and even surpassing the performance of GPT-4 in some cases `![Performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry](image4)`.  Similarly, on MuSiQue and StrategyQA datasets which require multi-hop reasoning, Step-Back + RAG achieves higher accuracy compared to PaLM-2L with CoT, TDB, or RAG alone `![Performance on MuSiQue and StrategyQA](image5)`.  The method's robustness is also highlighted by its consistent performance across different numbers of few-shot examples, indicating sample efficiency in learning abstraction skills `![Accuracy with varying few-shot exemplars](image1)` [5].\n\nError analysis reveals that Step-Back Prompting effectively rectifies errors made by baseline models.  Compared to baseline PaLM-2L predictions, Step-Back Prompting corrects approximately 39.9% of incorrect predictions while introducing only about 5.6% new errors [6].  Furthermore, it also helps in refining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fixing 21.6% of errors originating from RAG, with a relatively low error introduction rate of 6.3% to RAG [6].  However, error analysis on TimeQA identifies specific failure points for Step-Back, including cases where the step-back question is unhelpful, RAG fails to retrieve relevant information despite a good step-back question, or scoring errors occur during evaluation `![Ablation and error analysis on TimeQA](image7)` [7].  Despite these error sources, Step-Back prompting generally proves to be a beneficial strategy by promoting abstraction before directly tackling the original question [6].  The method's advantage lies in its ability to guide models towards more accurate reasoning paths by initially focusing on broader concepts relevant to the given task, as illustrated in examples for both physics questions and knowledge-based queries `![Step-Back prompting enhances reasoning](image3)`.\n\nIn summary, Step-Back prompting demonstrates superior performance and error reduction compared to baseline models and other prompting techniques across a range of knowledge-intensive and reasoning-based tasks, making it an effective approach for improving the accuracy of large language models."}

Furthermore, within the reasoning step, 'Reasoning Error' and 'Scoring Error' are notable contributors to the overall error rate [9].  The robustness of STEP-BACK PROMPTING against the number of exemplars used suggests that teaching abstraction skills is sample-efficient, yet the reasoning step remains a bottleneck for tasks requiring complex reasoning [4, 6].\n\nIn conclusion, Step-Back Prompting, especially when combined with RAG, generally outperforms GPT-4 and other prompting methods across various QA tasks, with the predominant errors stemming from reasoning and information retrieval rather than the abstraction step itself."}

LANI, set in a 3D navigation environment, focuses on navigation between landmarks with simpler instructions, often containing a single goal [2]. In contrast, CHAI, utilizing the CHALET 3D house environment, involves more complex instructions that combine navigation with object manipulation and frequently require multiple intermediate goals [2].  This complexity is reflected in the performance metrics used for evaluation; LANI is assessed using stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC), while CHAI is evaluated with stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA) [11].\n\nHuman performance benchmarks further illustrate these differences. On LANI, humans achieve a stop distance error of 5.2 and a task completion rate of 63%, whereas on CHAI, the stop distance error is significantly lower at 1.34, and manipulation accuracy reaches 100% [10].  This suggests that while navigation in LANI might be more ambiguous or challenging for humans to complete fully, manipulation in CHAI is handled with high accuracy, indicating different types of task demands.  The statistical breakdown of the datasets emphasizes these differences; CHAI instructions are longer in terms of mean instructions per paragraph (7.70 vs 4.7) but shorter in mean tokens per instruction (8.4 vs 12.1) compared to LANI, reflecting more complex, multi-step instructions in CHAI, albeit described more concisely per instruction [![Dataset statistics highlighting the differences in instruction length and complexity between LANI and CHAI datasets.](image4)].\n\nWhen evaluating automated approaches, results consistently show weaker performance on CHAI compared to LANI [4].  For instance, comparing the performance of different methods on held-out test datasets reveals that across STOP, RANDOMWALK, MOSTFREQUENT, MISRA17, CHAPLOT18 and 'Our Approach', all methods generally achieve better stop distance and task completion on LANI compared to stop distance and manipulation accuracy on CHAI [![Performance comparison of different methods on LANI and CHAI test datasets, showing varied success across metrics.](image3)].  This performance gap underscores the increased difficulty of CHAI, particularly in handling manipulation tasks and the complexities of household instructions.  The inherent ambiguities and the need for more sophisticated planning in CHAI contribute to the observed performance disparities when contrasted with the navigation-centric tasks in LANI [4, 10].\n\nIn summary, the key differences between LANI and CHAI datasets lie in the complexity of instructions, the nature of tasks (navigation vs. navigation and manipulation), and consequently, the performance metrics that highlight these distinctions, with CHAI presenting a more challenging environment for instruction following and manipulation compared to LANI's navigation-focused tasks."}

It's hypothesized that when translating between linguistically similar languages, semantic neighborhoods are more alike, potentially leading to greater gains from pre-training [3].  For instance, when translating into Portuguese (PT) from languages within its family tree, like Spanish (ES), French (FR), and Italian (IT), varying degrees of improvement are observed, as shown in the table ![The table shows BLEU score improvements for language pairs with varying linguistic similarity when pre-training is applied](image1). These improvements are quantified by BLEU scores, a common metric for translation quality [1].  Interestingly, languages less similar to Portuguese, such as Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), exhibit even larger accuracy gains with pre-training, possibly because systems translating these pairs initially have more room for improvement due to lower baseline scores [1].\n\nHowever, pre-training efficacy isn't solely determined by language similarity; the amount of training data also plays a crucial role.  It appears there's an optimal point where pre-training is most beneficial: when the initial translation system has captured basic language characteristics but still has room for improvement.  This suggests that a system needs to be at least moderately effective for pre-training to take hold [4].  This concept is further illustrated by the graph ![The graph displays the increase in BLEU score with pre-training across different training set sizes for Portuguese-English, Turkish-English, and Russian-English translation pairs](image2), indicating that the benefit of pre-training fluctuates with the size of the training dataset.  Qualitative analysis reveals that pre-training aids in capturing rarer vocabulary and producing grammatically sound sentences, particularly in low-resource scenarios. For example, in Galician-English translation, pre-training helps in correctly translating names and multi-word phrases, showcasing its utility in representing less frequent concepts [6].  Analysis of word frequency further demonstrates that pre-training enhances translation accuracy across the vocabulary, but its impact is most pronounced for less frequent words in the training data ![The graph shows the F-measure improvements for words bucketed by frequency in the training corpus, indicating that pre-training particularly enhances the accuracy of low-frequency words](image4) and ![The table shows examples of translations from a bilingual standard system compared to a multilingual pre-aligned system, highlighting improvements in translating specific words and phrases with pre-training](image7).  Moreover, pre-training the source language embeddings appears to contribute more significantly to BLEU score increases than pre-training target language embeddings, suggesting that improving the encoding of the source sentence is paramount [8].  In multilingual translation systems, pre-training and aligning embedding spaces become even more advantageous, especially when sharing an encoder across multiple languages, as it ensures that word embeddings from different source languages reside in a semantically similar space, facilitating more effective learning [11].  Despite the benefits of pre-training, aligning embeddings a priori might not be necessary in bilingual scenarios, but it proves beneficial in multilingual training setups [12].\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training significantly improves translation accuracy, particularly for language pairs with moderate dissimilarity and in scenarios with limited training data, with language similarity and training dataset size acting as crucial moderating factors in its effectiveness."}

This R-GCN component improves mention representations by considering their relationships with others [4].\n\nEven when employing ELMo embeddings, simply connecting all nodes in the graph without differentiating edge types yields only minor improvements compared to using ELMo alone [1].

While coreference and match edges seem less impactful individually, integrating all these relation types collectively gives Entity-GCN a distinct advantage [7].

Interestingly, the model appears to benefit more from document-based connections (DOC-BASED) than from explicit coreference (COREF) or exact match (MATCH) connections [8].  It's also noted that using a coreference system can sometimes degrade performance on test sets, possibly because these datasets are more challenging for coreference resolution [8]. Comparing Entity-GCN models with and without coreference further illustrates this point, showing a minor difference in development set performance and even a slight degradation in test set performance when coreference is included in some cases ![Table comparing Entity-GCN models with and without coreference](image8).

This is crucial in datasets like ACE05 where cross-sentence context is needed for disambiguation [12].  However, for relation extraction on ACE05, coreference propagation appears to be less helpful and can even slightly decrease performance [8].  In contrast, relation propagation (`RelProp`) consistently benefits both entity and relation extraction on both ACE05 and SciERC datasets [8]. This is highlighted in sentences with multiple relation instances, where `RelProp` leverages broader context to improve performance [8, 9]. We can see that relation propagation improves relation scores, especially in sentences with more entities. ![Relation propagation improves relation scores with increasing number of entities in a sentence on ACE05](image6).\n\nOn SciERC, the effect of coreference propagation on entity F1 is less pronounced compared to ACE05 [5].

As illustrated in ![Relation scores as a function of number of entities in sentence](image2), the improvement from relation propagation becomes more pronounced as the number of entities per sentence increases [8]. This is likely because a broader context becomes more crucial for discerning relations when multiple entities are present within a sentence, and relation propagation effectively leverages this context [8, 9].

This discrepancy might arise because sentiment analysis, especially in short texts, relies more on word order and nuanced contextual understanding which CNNs and LSTMs are better equipped to capture due to their compositional architectures [5, 6].\n\nDespite this, SWEM's strength lies in its parameter efficiency and computational speed.  As models are trained within constrained subspaces, SWEM demonstrates significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a wide range of lower subspace dimensions [10].  This parameter efficiency can be observed in scenarios with varying subspace dimensions, where SWEM achieves comparable accuracy to CNN with fewer parameters, especially at lower dimensions, as depicted in ![Graph comparing SWEM and CNN accuracy across subspace dimensions](image5).  This suggests that SWEM can reach a decent solution with less model complexity, making it a computationally attractive option when resources are limited or rapid prototyping is needed [9, 10].

Domains share knowledge more effectively for common slots like 'people', 'area', 'price range', and 'day', facilitating easier transfer. Conversely, unique slots specific to a domain, such as 'parking', 'stars', and 'internet' for hotels, or 'food' for restaurants, are considerably harder for the model to track accurately in zero-shot scenarios [2].  This implies that the model more readily transfers knowledge related to semantically similar slots across domains.  Analyzing slot categories reveals groupings like slots related to booking details (time, day, people), location (area, destination, departure), and preferences (price range, food type), highlighting the semantic relationships that likely influence transferability. ![Semantic relationships between slots](image8).  The varying error rates across different slots further underscore that some slots are inherently more challenging to track than others, possibly due to their domain-specificity or complexity [image6].\n\nIn conclusion, GEM fine-tuning strategy is more effective than naive and EWC approaches in adapting models to new domains by reducing catastrophic forgetting and improving performance on new tasks, and the success of knowledge transfer is heavily dependent on the similarity of slots between the old and new domains, with shared slots leading to better adaptation."}

Retraining the model on these adversarial distractors leads to a recovery in performance, with the F1 score increasing to 60.10 on the same adversarial distractors [4]. Further experiments involving type distractors, which filter paragraphs based on entity type, show a similar pattern.  The original model's accuracy decreases to 40.73 F1 with type distractors, but retraining on adversarially selected distractors helps regain accuracy, reaching 58.42 F1 [1].\n\n![Table showing F1 scores of models trained and tested on original and adversarial distractors, with and without type filtering.](image8)\n\nThe table visually summarizes these effects, demonstrating how adversarial training can mitigate the performance degradation caused by challenging distractors. In open-domain settings, the single-hop model struggles, achieving only 39.12 F1 with 500 retrieved paragraphs, but improves to 53.12 F1 when gold paragraphs are included, emphasizing the critical role of evidence retrieval [8].\n\nDifferent training and evaluation strategies, particularly the use of adversarial distractors and type filtering, significantly modulate the F1 scores in question answering tasks."}

However, this impressive result was misleading because BERT was exploiting superficial statistical cues present in the dataset, particularly cue words like \"not\" in the warrant [2].  To address this issue and provide a more reliable evaluation, an adversarial dataset was created [1, 4]. This new dataset was designed to eliminate these spurious cues by mirroring the distributions of cues across both labels [8, 9].  ![The adversarial dataset is created by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, effectively removing statistical cues.](image6)\n\nWhen models, including BERT, were trained and evaluated on this adversarial dataset, a significant drop in performance was observed.  In fact, BERT's peak performance plummeted to approximately 53%, essentially achieving random accuracy [6, 8].  This stark reduction, illustrated in the performance metrics on the adversarial test set, strongly suggests that the original high performance was not indicative of genuine argument comprehension [6]. ![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set, showing a significant drop to around 50% accuracy, indicating random performance after the removal of spurious cues.](image3)  The creation and adoption of this adversarial dataset is crucial for future research, offering a more robust and accurate assessment of argument comprehension models [3, 8].  The findings highlight that while BERT is a powerful learner capable of capturing subtle distributional information [12], its initial success on ARCT was primarily due to the exploitation of dataset biases rather than true understanding of argumentation [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup drastically reduced BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset, revealing that its initial high scores were due to exploiting statistical cues rather than actual argument comprehension."}

However, across both open and closed vocabulary models, the neutral backoff strategy consistently exhibits the lowest sensitivity because it replaces unknown words (UNK) with a fixed neutral word, thus reducing the number of unique outputs from the word recognizer [8].  This is quantitatively supported in the sensitivity values shown for different backoff methods across closed and open vocabulary models. ![Sensitivity values for closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies.](image6)\n\nIn contrast, background backoff often achieves a lower WER, as it leverages a larger corpus for word prediction, which is particularly beneficial for recovering rare or unseen words [3, 10].

These shifts in deposit types suggest a strategic focus on managing deposit costs and optimizing funding sources.\n\nThese adjustments in loan and deposit portfolios from December 2020 to December 2021 indicate a financial entity strategically adapting to market conditions by increasing commercial lending while managing consumer loan exposure and optimizing deposit composition, likely in response to economic factors and regulatory constraints."}

This decrease in 2020 and partial recovery in 2021 can be attributed to various factors, including the impact of COVID-19 on sporting events and entertainment programming [10].  Specifically, expenses in Sky decreased in 2021 due to lower costs associated with Serie A and entertainment programming, although this was partially offset by an increased number of sporting events as schedules normalized after COVID-19 delays [10].\n\nConversely, the Theme Parks segment consistently reported negative Adjusted EBITDA across the three years, although there was improvement in 2021 compared to 2020.  ![Theme Parks consistently showed negative Adjusted EBITDA, but with some improvement in 2021.](image8)  Adjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks was $(1,358) million in 2021, compared to $(1,785) million in 2020 and $(820) million in 2019 [Image8].

This overall rise in net income can be attributed to several factors evident in the financial statements.  Notably, income from equity method investments experienced a significant surge, climbing from \\$235 million in 2018 to \\$417 million in 2020 [image4]. This increase in equity investment income is partly explained by strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, and the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020, which collectively boosted equity earnings [11]. These investments, including holdings in entities like Explorer, Colonial and Mattox [image5], played a crucial role in enhancing the partnership's financial performance.\n\nDespite a decrease in operating income from \\$212 million in 2018 to \\$169 million in 2020, the substantial growth in income from equity method investments and an increase in investment, dividend, and other income effectively counteracted this decline [image4].

For Consumer Banking and Lending, total loans saw a decrease of $36,222 million [image6], primarily driven by a significant reduction in Home Lending loans by $39,535 million [image6]. This decline in home lending was attributed to loan paydowns due to the low interest rate environment and the strategic transfer of mortgage loans to loans held for sale [5].

The consolidated statement of income provides a detailed view of these fluctuations.\n\nIn the upstream sector, both U.S. and International operations experienced a dramatic turnaround. U.S. upstream earnings surged to $7.3 billion in 2021, a stark contrast to the $1.6 billion loss in 2020 [3].  Similarly, international upstream operations reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, recovering from a loss of $825 million in 2020 [10]. These increases were largely attributed to higher price realizations for crude oil and natural gas and the absence of significant impairments and write-offs that affected the 2020 results [3, 10].\n\nThe downstream sector also presented a mixed picture. U.S. downstream operations rebounded to a $2.4 billion profit in 2021 after a $571 million loss in 2020 [7]. This improvement was primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales and increased sales volumes [7]. However, international downstream earnings saw a slight decrease, from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, mainly due to reduced margins on refined product sales and increased operating expenses [8].\n\nThese trends in upstream and downstream operations directly influenced Chevron's overall net income. As visualized in tabular format, the net income attributable to Chevron Corporation dramatically improved, reaching $15.625 billion in 2021, recovering from a significant loss of $5.543 billion in 2020 and exceeding the $2.924 billion profit in 2019 ![Net income attributable to Chevron Corporation and its trend from 2019 to 2021](image4).

This is further illustrated by hypothetical scenarios, where a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of equity index put option contracts from $99 million to $105 million as of December 31, 2021, while a 100 basis point increase would decrease it to $94 million, as shown in the sensitivity analysis of fair values to interest rate changes ![Fair value of equity index put option contracts will decrease when interest rate increase and increase when interest rate decrease](image7).\n\nRegarding the effects of non-U.S. denominated debt, there was a notable shift between 2020 and 2021.

This new standard moved away from the previous classification of leases as either operating or finance leases for lessees, introducing a unified on-balance sheet model [4].  Consequently, the Group, acting as a lessee, recognized right-of-use assets, representing the right to use leased assets, and lease liabilities, reflecting the obligation to make lease payments [4].  Upon transitioning to AASB 16, lease liabilities, which were previously classified as operating leases under AASB 117, were initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments. This calculation was discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 July 2019 [9].\n\n![Lease liabilities significantly increased due to adopting AASB 16 and other factors in 2020.](image1)\n\nThe consolidated financial statement shows the impact of this transition, with a substantial recognition of lease liabilities upon the initial application of AASB 16, reaching $43,620,000 [image1].

Site restoration costs are now capitalized as part of the right-of-use asset and depreciated over the lease term, a change from prior periods where restoration provisions were linked to leasehold improvements [3]. Similarly, the straight-lining prepaid rent account was capitalized into the right-of-use asset, eliminating the recognition of separate provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives [7].\n\n![AASB 16 shifted the accounting for straight-lining prepaid rent and lease incentives into right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.](image7)\n\nIn contrast, the impact on employee benefit liabilities appears to be less dramatic.

Net cash provided by operating activities saw a decrease of $0.3 billion, primarily due to increased working capital needs and higher cash payments for asset impairment, despite higher net earnings [6].  The cash flow statement provides a detailed breakdown of operating activities, showing a decrease from $10,090 million in 2019 to $9,812 million in 2020, reflecting this change. ![Details of operating activities cash flow](image1)  In contrast, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion. This improvement was mainly driven by reduced cash outflows related to the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019 and lower capital expenditures in 2020, although this was partially offset by increased cash collateral for derivatives [2].  The investing activities section of the cash flow statement shows a move from net cash used of -$1,200 million in 2019 to -$551 million in 2020, indicating less cash used in investing activities year over year. ![Details of investing activities cash flow](image1)  However, net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and increased dividend payouts, which was only partially offset by debt activity [3].

A key indicator, net interest income (NII), saw a decrease from  $\\S30.462$ million in 2019 to $\\S27.578$ million in 2020, representing a 9.5% reduction. This decline in NII is clearly depicted in the financial data comparing 2020 with 2019, where NII dropped from 30,462 to 27,578 [image5].  This decrease in net interest income is further elaborated as being a result of lower average market interest rates in major currencies when contrasted with 2019 [9].\n\nSimultaneously, interest expense also decreased year-on-year, falling from $\\S24.233$ million in 2019 to $\\S14.178$ million in 2020 [image1].  Despite the decrease in interest expense, the more substantial reduction in interest income, from $\\S54.695$ million to $\\S41.756$ million [image1], led to the overall decline in net interest income.  The reduction in interest income was primarily attributed to lower average interest rates, although partly mitigated by growth in interest-earning assets [9].\n\nThe net operating income before changes in expected credit losses consequently decreased to $\\S50.429$ million in 2020 from $\\S56.098$ million in 2019 [image5].

Ultimately, the overall profitability, reflected in the reported profit before tax, was significantly impacted by these changes, decreasing by 34% [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the decrease in net interest income, driven by lower interest rates, coupled with a reduction in interest expense, resulted in a lower net operating income, which significantly impacted the overall profitability of the organization in 2020 compared to 2019."}

Despite the availability of parental leave for both genders and initiatives promoting gender diversity, the difference in entitlement numbers highlights a potential area for further examination in the context of gender balance within the bank's workforce.

Among these policies, the estimate of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates stands out as having a high estimation risk, as depicted in the overview of principal accounting policies and their associated estimation risks ![Principal accounting policies and estimation risks](image2). This is primarily because rebates, discounts, and allowances are inherently complex, necessitating significant judgment and estimation from management to establish appropriate accruals [1].  Such judgements are particularly challenging within the US healthcare sector, which is characterized by intensifying competitive pricing pressures and product discounting trends [1]. Sales deductions, including unsettled rebates, discounts, and product return obligations, require considerable judgement due to the uncertainties at the time of sale, such as total sales volume to a specific customer [6].

This negative change in AOCI is influenced by items such as foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits [Image3, Image6].

These adjustments, along with other comprehensive income components, impact the overall shareholders' equity.  Despite a substantial increase in net income in 2021, the slight decrease in total shareholders' equity indicates that factors like share repurchases, dividends, and negative adjustments in other comprehensive income partially offset the positive impact of net earnings on the company's financial position.

This growth is clearly illustrated in the census data, which shows a leap from a mere 130 residents in 1870 to 8,267 by 1880, and further escalating to 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This population boom coincided with the transformative impact of the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which reshaped the Nebraska landscape and spurred westward migration [5].\n\nThe Homestead Act, in particular, played a crucial role by offering pioneers 160 acres of land, contingent on building a permanent dwelling and residing there for five years [5]. This incentive triggered a substantial wave of emigration to the west, especially Nebraska, attracting diverse groups of settlers [5].  Many early inhabitants hailed from states like Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois, with later influxes from European countries including Germany, Sweden, and Russia, each group often settling in distinct geographical clusters within the county [2].\n\nHowever, the peak population of Hamilton County was reached in 1890, after which a gradual decline began [1].  Looking at the population figures, one can observe this trend, starting from 14,096 in 1890 and slowly decreasing to 9,403 by 2000 ![Table showing Hamilton County population from 1870 to 2000](image2). This decline occurred despite the initial boom driven by land availability and railroad expansion. Factors contributing to this shift likely include farm consolidation and evolving economic and transportation dynamics [6, 10].  While some smaller towns faced challenges, larger towns like Aurora demonstrated population increases, indicating varied trends within the county [8].\n\nThe population of Hamilton County, Nebraska, initially surged dramatically in the late 19th century before gradually declining from its peak in 1890 to 2000, influenced by westward expansion policies and subsequent agricultural and economic shifts."}

For instance, a significant majority of women in computer occupations, approximately three-quarters, report having faced gender discrimination at work, a stark contrast to the experiences of men in similar roles [9].  This disparity extends to perceptions of fairness in recruitment and promotion, as well as concerns about sexual harassment and workplace diversity ![This image shows that compared to men in STEM and non-STEM jobs, women in STEM jobs perceive less fairness in recruitment and promotion](image1).\n\nCompared to men in computer jobs, women are considerably more likely to perceive gender discrimination as a major issue within the technology industry and are less likely to believe it is not a problem [8].  Reports suggest that women in computer roles are not only more prone to experiencing discrimination but also to encountering pay inequities and feeling undermined in their competence due to their gender [7].  These challenges are further amplified for women in STEM workplaces where men are the majority, as they are more inclined to feel the need to consistently prove their abilities to gain respect from colleagues [10].

The increase in BLEU scores from pre-training is not uniform across all language pairs, it is observed that gains are more pronounced for low-resource languages such as GL, where improvements can reach up to 11 BLEU points, suggesting pre-training is highly beneficial for bootstrapping translation models in such scenarios [2].  Conversely, higher-resource languages experience consistent but smaller gains, around 3 BLEU points, across various language pairs [2].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also linked to the similarity between source and target languages.  As shown in the results, the gains from pre-trained embeddings tend to align with the similarity of language pairs, with GL/PT exhibiting the most substantial improvements and BE/RU showing the least [10]. This is further supported by observations across different datasets and language families, illustrating varying degrees of BLEU score enhancement through pre-training. ![This image shows BLEU score improvements for different language pairs, with varying gains depending on the dataset and pre-training application.](image2)\n\nMoreover, the initial performance of the translation system plays a role in the impact of pre-training.  The most significant gains are typically achieved when the baseline BLEU score of the system is moderately low, indicating that pre-training is most effective when it can elevate a system that is already capturing basic language characteristics but has room for improvement [11].  This is visually represented in the comparison of BLEU scores with and without pre-training for various language pairs. ![This image displays BLEU scores for different language pairs with and without pre-training, highlighting the improvements achieved through pre-training.](image3)  Furthermore, aligning embedding spaces between source and target languages can also influence BLEU scores, generally leading to increased scores by ensuring semantic consistency across languages [10].\n\nThe impact of pre-training is not only quantitative but also qualitative, as it aids in capturing rarer vocabulary and producing grammatically superior sentences [1].  For instance, pre-training enhances the translation of less frequent concepts and multi-word phrases, showcasing its ability to improve the representation of diverse linguistic elements [1].  This improvement is especially noticeable for words with low frequency in the training data, indicating that pre-training effectively boosts translation accuracy across the vocabulary spectrum [7].  The increase in BLEU score due to pre-training varies depending on the specific language pair and training set size, as visualized in performance graphs. ![This graph illustrates the BLEU score increase with pre-training for different language pairs across varying training set sizes.](image7)\n\nIn summary, pre-training generally enhances BLEU scores for various language pairs, with the extent of improvement being influenced by factors such as language resource availability, language similarity, and the initial performance level of the translation system."}

While effective in mitigating repetition, this feature inadvertently curtails question-asking capabilities when aiming for the highest control level [6]. As depicted in the graph, the 'Question-controlled CT' model, represented by the blue line, shows a question-asking rate below 80% at z=10, which is significantly lower than the intended 100% rate ![Graph illustrating question-asking rates against control levels](image2). This reduction happens because common question-related bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" are also penalized by the `extrep bigram` feature [6]. To address this, a boosted setting `z=10 (boost)` was introduced, which disables the `extrep bigram` feature during beam search but retains it for re-ranking, thereby allowing necessary question-asking bigrams to be generated and achieving a question-asking rate of 99.54% [6]. External repetition, which is repetition across utterances, is identified as a major form of repetition that the `extrep bigram` feature is designed to control [12].

As shown in ![BERT achieved high accuracy compared to other models](image1), BERT's performance was initially quite impressive.\n\nHowever, it was discovered that BERT's high accuracy was largely due to its ability to exploit spurious statistical cues present in the original dataset [4, 1].  To address this, an adversarial dataset was created by negating claims and inverting labels, which effectively mirrored the statistical cues across both labels, thus eliminating the exploitable signal [3].  When models trained on the original data were evaluated on this adversarial set, their performance dropped below random, indicating overfitting to the original cues [5].  Furthermore, when BERT was trained from scratch on this adversarial dataset, its peak performance significantly decreased to $53\\%$, with the mean and median accuracies hovering around $50\\%$ [3, 5].

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules within the problem statement and converting them into a symbolic form that a solver can understand [12]. For instance, consider a problem about \"Stranger Things\" being popular; LOGIC-LM formulates this into predicates and premises like `NetflixShow(strangerThings) ∧ Popular(strangerThings)` [image3], illustrating the conversion of natural language into a symbolic representation. This translation is crucial as it shifts the complexity from the LLM to the symbolic solver [9].\n\nFollowing problem formulation, the Symbolic Reasoning stage employs a deterministic symbolic solver [2]. This solver, such as a logic programming engine, operates on the symbolic representation derived in the previous stage to obtain a symbolic answer [2]. This step leverages the reliability and interpretability of symbolic solvers for logical inference [9]. Consider the example of reasoning with metals and insulators; the problem is transformed into symbolic rules and facts [image5, image6] which are then processed by the solver to deduce logical conclusions.\n\nFinally, the Result Interpretation stage translates the symbolic answer back into natural language [2, 12]. This step ensures that the solution is understandable and relevant in the original context of the problem.  The process ensures reasoning is faithful because the core logic is handled by deterministic algorithms within the symbolic reasoner [2].\n\n![The image shows an example of a logic problem, its symbolic formulation using predicates and premises, and the predicted answer, illustrating the Problem Formulation stage of LOGIC-LM.](image3)\n\n![The image provides an example of logical reasoning problem, showing how natural language rules and facts are converted into symbolic form for the solver and the final answer derived from symbolic reasoning.](image5)\n\n![The image presents examples of problem formulation across different logical reasoning types, demonstrating the translation of natural language sentences into symbolic formulations for various solvers and datasets.](image6)\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM solves problems by first translating natural language problems into symbolic forms, then reasoning using a symbolic solver, and finally interpreting the symbolic result back into natural language."}

It was observed that the standard LLaMa architecture faced divergences stemming from slow norm growth in later training stages [9].  This issue was attributed to the softmax operation's behavior when handling modalities with varied entropy, leading to competition and norm inflation across modalities [9]. The effects of query-key normalization (QK-Norm) on training stability are illustrated, where models trained without QK-Norm exhibited divergence after roughly 20% of an epoch, as shown in the training loss curves visualized ![Training loss curves showing divergence without QK-Norm](image4) [4]. Further investigation revealed that while QK-Norm and dropout were necessary to stabilize Chameleon-7B, Chameleon-34B required norm re-ordering to prevent divergence [6].  Training curves for both Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B over the initial 600,000 steps are depicted, demonstrating the impact of these stabilization techniques ![Training curves for Chameleon-7B and 34B](image6) [3].

This initial success suggested a strong capability in argument comprehension, but further investigation revealed a different picture [6]. The high performance was not due to genuine understanding but rather the exploitation of unintended statistical patterns present in the dataset [5, 10]. In fact, experiments showed that by only considering warrants (W), the model could already achieve a 71% accuracy, accounting for most of its peak performance [10].\n\nTo better understand BERT's performance relative to other models, we can look at a comparative table.\n\n![Table comparing BERT Large, BERT Base, and other models' test performance, highlighting BERT Large's maximum accuracy of 0.770.](image3)\n\nThis table illustrates BERT's initial test performance in comparison to other models and human baselines.  However, to rigorously test BERT's argument comprehension abilities and eliminate the influence of these statistical cues, an adversarial dataset was constructed [1, 12].  When evaluated on this new dataset, the performance of BERT and other models significantly dropped, demonstrating the impact of removing spurious cues [9].\n\n![Table showing BERT's test performance under different input configurations (W, R+W, C+W) and comparing it to BoV and BiLSTM.](image4)\n\nAs shown in this table, different input configurations were tested, such as using only warrants (W), reasons and warrants (R, W), or claims and warrants (C, W) [10].  The performance varied across these configurations, but the key finding was that the initial high accuracy was largely inflated by the dataset's inherent biases [5].  Furthermore, when trained and tested on the adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance dramatically reduced to approximately 53%, with mean and median accuracies around 50% [9].\n\n![Table demonstrating BERT's performance drop to around 50% median and 53% maximum on the adversarial test set.](image5)\n\nThese results from the adversarial dataset highlight that BERT's apparent success on the original ARCT dataset was misleading, and its performance in a more robust evaluation setting is significantly lower [7, 9].

As shown in ![Connection lines and component blocks](image1) and ![Diagram elements](image2), systems are represented by component blocks interconnected by lines that indicate the direction of information flow and control [1, 8, 10]. The ECU, also known as a Power-train Control Module (PCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM), is crucial for determining the fuel amount, ignition timing, and other parameters necessary for an internal combustion engine's operation [11].  Specifically, the ECU manages fuel injection by calculating the required fuel quantity based on parameters like throttle pedal position and engine temperature [4], and it precisely controls the opening of injectors [3, 7]. Furthermore, the ECU adjusts ignition timing for optimal power and fuel efficiency [5] and regulates idle speed, monitoring engine RPM via the crankshaft position sensor [6].  The ECU essentially monitors engine operating conditions and reports this information to the ECM [9], as seen in systems like the ![FUEL SYSTEM USING ANTI-SURGE TANK](image4). Ultimately, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) acts as the brain of the engine management system, overseeing and coordinating critical functions to ensure efficient and controlled engine performance."}

This is evident in the context of hot dog consumption, where the utility from each subsequent hot dog diminishes, even becoming negative after a certain point, as depicted in the utility table ![showing a table where the utility from each hot dog decreases and becomes negative with increased consumption](image1).  However, this contrasts with competitive scenarios where focus, rather than variety, becomes paramount for achieving mastery [12].  While focusing might be seen negatively in typical consumption patterns [6], it becomes a driving force in competitive settings where the cumulative effect of focused practice can be advantageous [9].  Focused practice can lead to increased utility by enhancing both the activity experience through skill accumulation and the outcome through cumulative experience [11].  This need for focus to attain mastery is questioned in the image inquiring about the importance of focus for achieving mastery in an area ![raising the question about the importance of focus for mastery](image2), and is further supported by the concept of extensive practice hours needed to achieve expertise, exemplified by violinists and professionals investing thousands of hours in practice ![demonstrating the relationship between practice hours and expertise level](image6).  Moreover, practice enhances enjoyment and the probability of winning, further influencing utility in competitive situations ![stating that practice enhances enjoyment and winning chances in competitive scenarios](image7).  Interestingly, the hot dog utility table also hints at a different utility dynamic in competitive eating, where, at extremely high consumption levels, utility can drastically increase, possibly due to the competitive aspect of breaking records, like surpassing Kobayashi's, as indicated by the utility spike at very high hot dog counts ![highlighting a sudden increase in utility at very high hot dog consumption levels, possibly due to competitive factors](image1).  Therefore, diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption promotes variety, whereas in competitive contexts, focused practice and the pursuit of mastery can alter or temporarily override the typical diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal utility leads to variety-seeking in standard consumption, but in competitive situations, focus and mastery can modify or temporarily overcome this effect."}

One of these key phases is interphase, a period of significant cellular activity where the cell diligently duplicates its contents in preparation for division [2].  This preparatory phase is further broken down into sub-phases: G1, marked by cell growth and cytoplasm increase; S, the critical stage for chromosome duplication; and G2, where the cell continues to grow and prepares specifically for division [2].\n\n![INTERPHASE G, S (DNA synthesis)](image1)\n\nFollowing interphase is the mitotic phase, the stage of actual division [4]. This phase itself is divided into mitosis, the process of nuclear division, and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, culminating in two separate cells [4].\n\n![Centrosomes Chromatinearly mitotic spindie¢Centrosome Fragments of (with centriole pairs) Nuclearenvelope  Kinetochore Centromere Spindle Microtubules Nuclear Envelope Membrane Chromosome, consisting mf turn cictar crhramatinge](image6)\n\nIn summary, the cell cycle primarily consists of Interphase and the Mitotic phase, each with their own sub-phases crucial for cell division."}

Metering modes, accessible through the 'M' option, play a crucial role in determining how the camera measures light to achieve optimal exposure [8]. For expansive scenes like landscapes, 'Matrix' metering is advantageous as it evaluates light across the entire frame to ensure balanced exposure [image5]. Alternatively, 'Center' metering concentrates on the screen's central area, making it well-suited for portraiture where the subject is centrally positioned [image5]. For scenarios requiring precise light measurement, such as focusing on a subject's eyes, 'Spot' metering is the ideal choice as it focuses on a very specific, small area [image5].\n\nFocus modes, adjusted via the 'AF' setting [6], also contribute significantly to capturing sharp images under different circumstances. When photographing subjects that are stationary, 'AF-S' (single) mode is appropriate, locking focus once on the subject [image4]. However, for dynamic subjects in motion, 'AF-C' (continuous) mode continuously adjusts focus, ensuring sharpness even as the subject moves [image4].  'MF' (manual) mode offers complete manual focus control, beneficial in situations demanding precise focusing or creative effects [image4].\n\nThese metering and focus modes in Pro Mode, indicated by icons on the screen ![Showing icons for photo, video and pro mode options](image3), empower photographers to adapt to varied lighting and subject movement scenarios, ultimately enhancing the quality and creative potential of their images. In conclusion, Pro Mode's diverse metering and focus modes significantly improve photographic outcomes by providing tailored settings for different shooting scenarios."}

Sometimes, the issue might be as simple as ensuring the dishwasher is turned on and properly closed or checking the power cord connection and water supply [image6].  If the dishes are not coming out clean, consider if you are using enough detergent or if items are blocking the spray arms' movement ![Guidance on resolving unclean dishes](image3).  Another common concern is if dishes are not drying properly, which could be due to selecting a program that is too short ![Troubleshooting drying issues](image8).  Unusual noises such as knocking or rattling during operation could be caused by items obstructing the spray arms or loose crockery [image7].
