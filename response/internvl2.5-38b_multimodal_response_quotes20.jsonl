Most prominently, they are roughly twice as likely to express worry (72%) than enthusiasm (33%) about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans. They are also around three times as likely to express worry (67%) than enthusiasm (22%) about algorithms that can make hiring decisions without any human involvement. By comparison, public views towards driverless vehicles and robot caregivers exhibit more balance between worry and enthusiasm. A majority of Americans are broadly familiar with the notion that automation may impact a wide range of human employment, and most consider the concept to be generally realistic. Fully 85% of the public has heard or read about this concept before, with 24% indicating they have heard or read “a lot” about it. A roughly comparable share (77%) thinks this idea is at least somewhat realistic, and one-in-five indicate that the concept seems extremely realistic to them. One-in-five Americans find the concept of machines doing most human jobs in the future to be extremely realistic. For the most part, Americans consider this scenario to be plausible; express more worry than enthusiasm about the prospect of machines performing many human jobs; and anticipate more negative than positive outcomes from this development. They strongly favor the notion that machines might be limited to jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans, and they offer somewhat more measured support for other types of interventions to limit the impact of widespread automation, such as the enactment of a universal basic income or national service program for displaced workers. And although they view certain jobs as being more at risk than others, a significant majority of today’s workers express little concern that their own jobs or careers might be performed by machines in their lifetimes. Beyond the examples noted above, Americans anticipate significant changes to the nature of jobs and work in the coming decades as a result of automation. Overall, roughly three-quarters of Americans (77%) think it’s realistic that robots and computers might one day be able to do many of the jobs currently done by humans, with 20% describing this prospect as extremely realistic. And substantial shares of Americans anticipate that automation will impact a number of specific career fields over the course of their lifetimes. Sizable majorities expect that jobs such as fast food workers and insurance claims processors will be impacted by automation. The 6% of Americans who have already been impacted by automation in their own careers (and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 1 of this report) respond to this concept in ways that are notably different from the rest of the population.

Additionally, there is a perception that these groups do not believe in their ability to succeed in these fields, and there is a lack of black and Hispanic role models in STEM. The Pew Research Center survey also finds that black STEM workers are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work because of their race or ethnicity. The survey also highlights that there is wide disagreement across racial and ethnic groups on how much discrimination contributes to these racial/ethnic disparities. Among those in STEM, 72% of blacks say a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in these jobs is because they face discrimination in recruiting, hiring, and promotions, compared with 27% of whites and 28% of Asians. Hispanic STEM employees also consider major underlying reasons for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in science, technology, engineering, and math occupations to be limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and a lack of encouragement to pursue these jobs from an early age. The survey also finds that around a third of people working in STEM attribute the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics to these groups not believing in their ability to succeed in these fields, the lack of black and Hispanic role models in these fields, and racial/ethnic discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions. The survey also highlights that people who are employed in a STEM job are more likely than those working in non-STEM jobs to cite lack of access to quality education, lack of encouragement to pursue subjects at an early age, and lack of black and Hispanic role models working in the field as major reasons why these groups are underrepresented in STEM jobs. The survey also finds that women are more likely to see discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions as a major reason behind the lack of gender diversity in STEM. The survey also highlights that Americans see a range of explanations for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs. The survey also finds that most blacks in STEM positions consider major underlying reasons for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in science, technology, engineering, and math occupations to be limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and a lack of encouragement to pursue these jobs from an early age.

It also highlights differences in these views among subgroups within the independent category, such as those who lean towards a party and those who do not lean towards any party.\n\n#### Trends Over Time\n- **General Trend**: The percentage of independents who view both parties unfavorably has fluctuated over the years. According to image7, this percentage was at 32% in 1994, decreased to a low of 6% in 1996, and then increased to 17% by 2018. This indicates a general rise in negative sentiment towards both parties among independents over the past two decades.\n- **Subgroup Trends**: \n  - **Leaners**: Independents who lean towards a party (either Republican or Democratic) have shown a more pronounced increase in unfavorable views towards both parties. For instance, in 1994, 15% of leaners viewed both parties unfavorably, which rose to 24% by 2018.\n  - **No Lean**: Independents who do not lean towards any party have also seen an increase in unfavorable views, from 22% in 1994 to 37% in 2018.\n\n#### Differences Among Subgroups\n- **Leaners vs. No Lean**: Independents who lean towards a party are more likely to have unfavorable views of both parties compared to those who do not lean towards any party. This is evident from the data in image7, where leaners consistently show higher percentages of unfavorable views than those who do not lean.\n- **Lean Rep vs. Lean Dem**: Among leaners, those who lean towards the Republican Party (Lean Rep) have slightly higher unfavorable views towards both parties compared to those who lean towards the Democratic Party (Lean Dem). For example, in 2018, 24% of Lean Reps viewed both parties unfavorably, compared to 22% of Lean Dems.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe data suggests that over time, there has been a growing sentiment of dissatisfaction with both major political parties among independents. This trend is more pronounced among those who lean towards a party, indicating a potential shift in political attitudes and a growing sense of disillusionment with the traditional party system. The differences among subgroups highlight the complexity of independent voters' views and the need for political parties to address the concerns of this increasingly influential demographic. \n\n### Direct Answer\nThe unfavorable views towards both major U.S. political parties among independents have increased over time, with leaners showing a more pronounced rise compared to those who do not lean towards any party.

Around 73% of Americans aged 50 and older believe that China's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak contributed a great deal to the global spread of the virus, compared to 54% of those aged 30 to 49 and 51% of those under 30. Similarly, 82% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think China has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus, while only 54% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents share this view. This indicates a clear partisan divide in the assessment of China's pandemic response. Additionally, the data shows that 50% of Americans think the U.S. should hold China responsible for its role in the outbreak, even if it means worsening economic relations, with Republicans being twice as likely as Democrats to hold this view. These differences highlight the varying perspectives on China's handling of COVID-19 based on age and political affiliation."}

Conservative Republicans have even less confidence (10%) than moderate or liberal Republicans (30%), though conservative and moderate Democrats (86%) are about as confident in Biden on dealing with China as liberal Democrats (81%).\n\nAmericans express substantial concern about various China-related issues. About three-quarters or more say that each issue is at least somewhat serious. Four problems stand out for being ones that half or more describe as very serious: cyber attacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights. The share who see the loss of U.S. jobs to China as a very serious problem has increased by 6 points since 2020, to 53%. A similar share sees China’s growing military power as a very serious problem (largely unchanged from the 49% who said the same last year). Concern about various China-related issues generally increased more among Republicans than among Democrats. For instance, while the share of Republicans who say the loss of U.S. jobs to China poses a very serious problem increased by 14 percentage points, there was no significant change among Democrats. On issues where concern rose overall, increases tended to be especially steep among conservative Republicans. Across age groups, older Americans express more concern about China-related issues. Americans ages 65 and older are at least 20 points more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to say most issues asked about in the survey are very serious problems. About four-in-ten Americans see the U.S. trade deficit with China – which decreased for the second year in a row – as a very serious problem, unchanged from 2020. Those with less than a college degree are more likely than those with a college degree or more education to see the trade deficit with China as a very serious problem. Similarly, those with lower levels of education are more likely to call the loss of U.S. jobs to China a very serious problem – but when it comes to other problems, people with different educational attainment levels largely agree.

This optimism is influenced by both their current financial situation and their educational level.\n\n**Current Financial Situation**:\n- Hispanics with a positive view of their current financial situation are significantly more likely to expect their family's finances to improve over the next 12 months. This is evident from the data in [4] and [5], which show that those who rate their economic circumstances as good are more optimistic about the future.\n- **image8** provides a visual representation of this trend, showing that those with excellent financial conditions are more likely to expect significant improvement in their financial situation.\n\n**Educational Level**:\n- Educational attainment also plays a role in financial expectations. According to [10], among those with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children to be better off financially, while 71% of those with less than a high school education share the same expectation. However, Latino high school graduates are even more optimistic, with 79% predicting that their children will be better off financially.\n- **image3** visually supports this, showing that higher educational levels correlate with higher optimism about children's financial future.\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn summary, both current financial situations and educational levels significantly influence the financial expectations of Hispanic adults for their children. Those with better current financial conditions and higher educational attainment are more likely to expect their children to be better off financially.\n\n#### Quote Citation\n- [1]: \"About seven-in-ten (72%) Hispanic adults expect their children will be better off financially than they themselves are.\"\n- [4]: \""}

Similarly, those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more per year are around four times as likely to own each device as those with a household income of less than $30,000 per year. This trend is consistent with the general population, where tablets and e-book readers are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans. \n\nWhen comparing this to the adoption trends of technology among different age groups over time, the data shows that the adoption of smartphones, tablets, and e-book readers has been steadily increasing. However, the rate of adoption among seniors is slower compared to younger age groups. For instance, the proportion of seniors who own either a tablet or an e-book reader is larger than the proportion owning a smartphone, indicating a preference for these devices over smartphones. The data also shows that the adoption of technology among seniors is influenced by factors such as age, gender, and education level, with younger seniors, women, and those with higher education levels being more likely to adopt technology. \n\nIn summary, education level plays a significant role in the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, and this trend is consistent with the general population.

Workers express more positive than negative views on the overall impact of technology on their careers, but they also express mixed opinions on how today's technologies have impacted their own jobs and careers. The survey finds that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment, and that workforce automation has already impacted a minority of today's workers in the form of lost jobs or wages. The current generation of workforce technologies has had widely disparate impacts on today's workers, with those with high levels of educational attainment viewing technology as a largely positive force that makes their work more interesting and provides opportunities for career advancement, while those who have not attended college are much less likely to view today's workforce technologies in such a positive light. The survey also finds that the current generation of workforce automation technologies often focus on their impact on manufacturing employment and productivity, but the coming wave of advances in automation offers the potential for even greater disruption of traditional modes of work. Developments in sensors and robotics may potentially reduce the need for humans in a variety of physical applications, from taxi and truck drivers to retail store employees, and multipurpose artificial intelligence and machine learning technology may dramatically alter or make redundant a wide range of white collar jobs. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have the potential to automate a wide range of human activities and to dramatically reshape the way that Americans live and work in the coming decades. A Pew Research Center survey of 4,135 U.S. adults conducted May 1-15, 2017, finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes, from the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.

When asked about four different policies that might blunt or minimize the impact of widespread automation on human workers, the public responds especially strongly to one in particular: the idea that robots and computers be mostly limited to doing jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans. Fully 85% of Americans favor this type of policy, with nearly half (47%) saying they favor it strongly. ![The public is evenly divided on whether government or individuals should be responsible for providing for displaced workers, but is more supportive of limits on how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines](image"}

Workers with higher levels of education, particularly those with college degrees, are more likely to view technology positively, reporting that it has made their work more interesting and increased their opportunities for career advancement. In contrast, workers with high school diplomas or less are less likely to express positive attitudes towards technology, with only 38% indicating that technology has made their jobs more interesting and 32% feeling that it has increased their opportunities for career advancement. This disparity is evident in the survey data, which shows that college graduates are substantially more likely than those without college degrees to say that various workforce technologies have had a positive impact on their jobs or careers. For instance, 64% of college graduates feel that technology has made their work more interesting, compared to 38% of workers with high school diplomas or less. Similarly, 53% of college graduates believe that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, compared to 32% of workers with high school diplomas or less. The survey also highlights that the benefits of workforce automation and technology are not evenly distributed, with workers lacking a college education being much less likely to express positive attitudes towards the current generation of workforce technologies. This suggests that the impact of workforce automation and technology is not only dependent on the technology itself but also on the educational background and skill level of the workers. The data also indicates that the impact of technology on the demands of work is mixed, with college graduates being more likely to say that technology has made their work more demanding (45% vs. 36%) but also more likely to say it has made their work less demanding (31% vs. 20%). This suggests that the impact of technology on the nature of work is complex and multifaceted, with both positive and negative effects depending on the specific context and the skills and education of the workers. Overall, the survey data suggests that the impact of workforce automation and technology is highly dependent on the educational background and skill level of the workers, with workers with higher levels of education being more likely to view technology positively and benefit from its impact on their jobs and careers. This highlights the importance of education and skill development in preparing workers for the challenges and opportunities of the modern workforce. The data also suggests that the impact of technology on the demands of work is complex and multifaceted, with both positive and negative effects depending on the specific context and the skills and education of the workers.

The data is derived from a survey that explores user attitudes towards the use of personal data by social media platforms.\n\n#### Key Findings\n\n1. **Age Group Differences in Acceptability**:\n   - **Younger Users (18-49)**: More accepting of data usage for recommendations and advertisements. For instance, 66% of users aged 18-49 find it acceptable for social media platforms to recommend people they might know, compared to 33% of users aged 65 and older.\n   - **Older Users (65+)**: Less accepting of data usage for recommendations and advertisements. Only 36% of users aged 65 and older find it acceptable for social media platforms to recommend people they might know.\n\n2. **General Acceptability of Data Usage**:\n   - **Events in Area**: 75% of social media users are comfortable with their data being used to recommend events they might like to attend.\n   - **Political Campaigns**: Only 37% of users are comfortable with their data being used to deliver messages from political campaigns.\n   - **Advertisements**: 52% of users find it acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to show advertisements for products or services, while 47% find it not acceptable.\n\n3. **Context-Dependent Comfort Levels**:\n   - Users' comfort levels with data usage are heavily context-dependent. For example, 75% of users are comfortable with data usage for event recommendations, but only 37% are comfortable with data usage for political messaging.\n\n4. **Concerns About Data Usage**:\n   - **Algorithmic Bias**: 78% of users think it is unacceptable for social media platforms to change the look and feel of their site for some users but not others.\n   - **Personalization**: Users are wary of data being used for political messaging but comfortable with it for event recommendations.\n\n5. **Survey Demographics**:\n   - The survey sample includes 4,594 participants, with a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points for the total sample. The sample is divided into age groups: 18-29, 30-49, 50-64, and 65+.\n\n#### Conclusion\nOverall, younger users are more accepting of social media platforms using their data for various purposes, while older users are more cautious. Users' comfort levels with data usage are highly context-dependent, with a clear preference for data usage in non-political contexts.

For instance, the personal finance score algorithm is viewed as effective by 54% of Americans but is considered fair by only 32%, resulting in a 22% difference. This suggests that while people believe the algorithm can identify good customers, they have concerns about its fairness. In contrast, the automated criminal risk score is seen as fair by 50% of Americans and effective by 49%, with a minimal 1% difference, indicating a more balanced perception of its fairness and effectiveness. The video job interview analysis and automated resume screening systems also show differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness, with the former being viewed as less fair and the latter as more balanced. These differences imply that public trust in these systems is influenced by concerns about fairness, which may be more pronounced in systems that directly impact individuals' financial or employment opportunities.

Democrats’ views are largely unchanged over that time period (74% in March, 72% today).\n- [7] There are much wider partisan differences in views of how public health officials, such as those with the CDC, are responding to the outbreak. Currently, 72% of Democrats and those who lean to the party say public health officials are doing well in responding to the coronavirus, little changed since March (74%).\n- [10] This shift has come almost entirely among Republicans; only about half of Republicans (53%) give CDC officials and other public health officials positive ratings for their response to the outbreak, 31 points lower than in late March (84%).

Republicans have shown a substantial decline in positive ratings for public health officials, while Democrats' views have remained relatively stable.

According to the data:\n\n- **Democrats**: A majority of Latino adults (71%) believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes. This perception is consistent across various demographic groups, including immigrants, Spanish-dominant Latinos, Catholics, and evangelicals. The support is particularly strong among older Latinos (ages 50-64 and 65+), with 45% and 46% respectively saying the Democratic Party works hard for them.\n\n- **Republicans**: In contrast, only about one-in-five Latinos (19%) say the Republican Party works hard to earn their votes. This perception is notably lower among Latino Democrats (13%) and independent Democrats (13%). However, a significant portion of Latino Republicans (40%) and Republican-leaning conservatives (47%) believe the Republican Party works hard for them.\n\n- **Generational Differences**: Among U.S.-born Latinos, the perception of the Democratic Party's efforts is higher among the second generation (46%) compared to the third generation or higher (30%). This suggests that newer generations of U.S.-born Latinos may have a more favorable view of the Democratic Party's outreach efforts.\n\n- **Educational Attainment**: Latinos with higher educational attainment (bachelor's degree or more) are more likely to perceive the Democratic Party's efforts positively (53%) compared to those with less education (high school or less, 40%). This could indicate that more educated Latinos are more aware of the Democratic Party's outreach efforts.\n\n- **Religious Affiliation**: Catholics and evangelicals are more likely to perceive the Democratic Party's efforts positively (42% and 42% respectively) compared to those with no religious affiliation (25%). This suggests that religious identity may play a role in shaping perceptions of political parties' outreach efforts.\n\n- **Gender and Age**: Men and women have similar perceptions of the Democratic Party's efforts (47% and 43% respectively). However, older Latinos (ages 50-64 and 65+) are more likely to perceive the Democratic Party's efforts positively (45% and 46% respectively) compared to younger Latinos (ages 18-29, 28%).\n\n- **Language Proficiency**: English-dominant Latinos are more likely to perceive the Democratic Party's efforts positively (52%) compared to bilingual Latinos (37%) and Spanish-dominant Latinos (47%). This suggests that language proficiency may influence perceptions of political parties' outreach efforts.\n\n- **Political Affiliation**: Among Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners, majorities of liberals (70%) and conservatives and moderates (61%) say the statement \"Democrats work hard to earn Latinos' votes\" describes their views well.

According to the Pew Research Center, in 2021, 45% of Latino voters saw a great deal of difference between the parties, while 36% saw a fair amount of difference, and 16% saw hardly any difference at all. This indicates a nuanced perception of party differences among Latino voters, with a significant portion recognizing substantial distinctions between the parties.\n\nThe impact of these views on party affiliations is complex. While a majority of Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (64%), the relatively high percentage of those who see a great deal of difference between the parties (45%) suggests that there is a segment of the Latino electorate that is more ideologically aligned with the Democratic Party's platform. However, the 36% who see a fair amount of difference and the 16% who see hardly any difference may be more susceptible to shifting their party affiliation based on specific issues or candidates.\n\nThe data also shows that Latino voters' future party affiliation remains uncertain, with substantial shares of Latino voters having soft ties to the political parties. This uncertainty could be influenced by various factors, including the parties' stances on key issues, the effectiveness of their outreach efforts, and the performance of their candidates in elections.\n\nIn summary, while the majority of Latino voters lean toward the Democratic Party, the evolving views on party differences suggest a dynamic and potentially volatile electorate that could be influenced by various factors in the coming years. This could lead to shifts in party affiliations, particularly among those who see a fair amount of difference or hardly any difference between the parties. The Democratic Party's efforts to engage with Latino voters and address their concerns could be crucial in maintaining and potentially increasing their support among this demographic."}

Women in STEM jobs are more likely to value jobs that help others, with 59% considering this important compared to 31% of men. This suggests that women may be drawn to STEM fields that offer opportunities to make a positive impact on society, which could be a motivating factor for them to pursue careers in these areas.\n\nHowever, despite this interest, women face significant barriers in entering the STEM workforce. The image shows that 39% of women believe that discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion is a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM jobs. This highlights the systemic issues that women encounter, which can deter them from pursuing STEM careers. Additionally, 39% of women feel that they are not encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age, indicating a lack of support and encouragement that could contribute to the gender gap in STEM fields.\n\nThe perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce are also reflected in the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women. Men in STEM jobs are more likely to value opportunities for promotion and high-paying jobs, with 57% and 59% considering these important, respectively. In contrast, women in STEM jobs are more likely to value jobs that help others, with 59% considering this important. This suggests that women may prioritize job characteristics that align with their values and interests, which could be different from those prioritized by men.\n\nOverall, the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM, as well as the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce, highlight the need for greater support and encouragement for women in STEM fields. By addressing these barriers and promoting a more inclusive and supportive environment, we can work towards increasing the representation of women in STEM and creating a more diverse and equitable workforce."}

According to the data:\n\n- **Language Proficiency**: A majority of immigrant Latinos (58%) believe that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, and this view is even more prevalent among second-generation (84%) and third or higher generation (92%) Latinos. This suggests that language proficiency is less of a determinant for self-identification as one moves further from immigrant roots.\n\n- **Cultural Ties**: The importance of cultural ties varies across generations. For example, 53% of self-identified Hispanics often identify with their Hispanic heritage, but this percentage drops to 33% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This indicates a decline in cultural ties as generations move further from their immigrant roots.\n\n- **Generational Distance**: The percentage of U.S.-born Hispanics who self-identify as Hispanic decreases with each generation. By the third generation, only 77% self-identify as Hispanic, and by the fourth or higher generation, this number falls to 50%. This trend suggests that generational distance from immigrant roots significantly influences self-identification.\n\n- **Upbringing and Contact with Relatives**: Some Hispanics do not identify as Hispanic due to their upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives. This factor is more prevalent among second and third or higher generation Hispanics, reflecting their birth in the U.S. and their experiences growing up in a non-Hispanic environment.\n\n- **Spanish Last Name**: While having a Spanish last name is seen as important to Hispanic identity by some, the majority of self-identified Hispanics (84%) say it is not necessary. This indicates that a Spanish last name is not a significant factor in self-identification across generations.\n\n- **Racial and Ethnic Identity**: Racial and ethnic identity in the U.S. is based on self-reports, meaning individuals define their own identity. This self-reporting system allows for a wide range of identities, including those who have Hispanic ancestry but do not identify as Hispanic.\n\nIn summary, the factors influencing self-identification as Hispanic in the U.S. vary across generations, with language proficiency, cultural ties, and generational distance from immigrant roots playing significant roles. As generations move further from their immigrant roots, the importance of these factors decreases, leading to a decline in self-identification as Hispanic."}

According to the Pew Research Center's 2015 National Survey of Latinos, experiences with discrimination related to being Hispanic are less frequent among higher generations of adults with Hispanic ancestry. For instance, 42% of self-identified Latino immigrants say they have experienced discrimination often or sometimes because of their Latino background, compared to 38% of second-generation Latinos and 29% of third or higher generation Latinos. This suggests that as generations progress, the experience of discrimination decreases.\n\nIn terms of racial identification, the survey also reveals that the perception of being seen as Hispanic by passersby falls across generations. While 78% of immigrant Hispanics say strangers on the street would think they were Hispanic or Latino, this share drops to two-thirds among second-generation Hispanics and 46% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This indicates a shift in how Hispanic identity is perceived and recognized by others as generations progress.\n\nMoreover, the composition of networks of friends varies widely across immigrant generations. Most immigrant Latinos (77%) say all or most of their friends are Latinos, but this share drops to 55% among second-generation self-identified Latinos and only 37% among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos. This suggests a trend towards assimilation and integration into broader social networks as generations progress.\n\nIn summary, generational differences impact the perception of discrimination and racial identification among Hispanics by showing a decrease in experiences of discrimination and a shift in how Hispanic identity is perceived and recognized by others as generations progress. This is further reflected in the changing composition of social networks across generations."}

Only 8% rarely and 12% never identify this way. This indicates a strong connection to their ancestral roots.\n- **Second Generation:** The second generation shows a slight decrease in identifying by country of origin (50% often, 27% sometimes, 13% rarely, 8% never).

In 2012, a majority of respondents agreed that traditional values are outdated and belong in the past, with 72% agreeing a lot or somewhat. However, by 2014, this number had dropped to 54%, indicating a decline in the preference for modern values. Conversely, the percentage of those who disagreed with the statement increased from 24% in 2012 to 34% in 2014, suggesting a growing appreciation for traditional values.\n\nThis trend is not uniform across all countries. For instance, in 2014, 54% of respondents from the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries agreed that traditional values are outdated, while 46% disagreed. In non-GCC countries, the numbers were 58% and 26%, respectively. This indicates that while there is a general trend towards embracing modern values, the intensity of this preference varies by region.\n\nThe data also shows that the influence of life factors on these views has changed over time. In 2011, 83% of respondents felt that traditional values were very or somewhat influential in their lives, but by 2014, this number had dropped to 54%. This suggests that as time has passed, the influence of traditional values on the lives of Arab youth has diminished, possibly due to increased exposure to modern values and lifestyles.\n\nIn terms of the sources of influence on these views, parents, family, and religion have consistently been the most influential factors, with 73%, 66%, and 69% of respondents, respectively, indicating that these factors are very or somewhat influential in 2013. However, by 2014, the influence of these factors had decreased to 67%, 58%, and 56%, respectively. This indicates that while traditional sources of influence remain important, their impact is waning over time.\n\nIn conclusion, the views on traditional values versus modern values among Arab youth have evolved over the years, with a growing appreciation for traditional values and a decline in the preference for modern values. However, the intensity of these views varies by country, with GCC countries showing a stronger preference for modern values compared to non-GCC countries. The influence of life factors on these views has also changed over time, with traditional sources of influence losing ground to modern ones."}

This encoding, along with the previous system action, is then used as input to a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state. Based on this state, the model generates a probability distribution over candidate values for each of the tracked goal slots. A query command is formulated with the state tracking outputs and issued to a knowledge base to retrieve requested information. Finally, the system produces a dialogue action, which is conditioned on information from the dialogue state, the estimated user’s goal, and the encoding of the query results. This dialogue action, together with the user goal tracking results and the query results, is used to generate the final natural language system response via a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG uses a template-based approach, where delexicalised tokens in the NLG template are replaced by the values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action. The system action is defined with the act and slot types from a dialogue act, and the slot types and values are from the dialogue state tracking output. The system action is then used to produce a system response in natural language format by combining the state tracker outputs and the retrieved KB entities. The model predicts the true user goal slot values and the next system action at each turn of a dialogue, optimizing the model parameter set by minimizing a linear interpolation of cross-entropy losses for dialogue state tracking and system action prediction. The dialogue state tracking maintains the state of a conversation, such as user’s goals, by accumulating evidence along the sequence of dialogue turns. The model maintains the dialogue state in a continuous form in the dialogue-level LSTM state, which is updated after the model processes each dialogue turn by taking in the encoding of user utterance and the encoding of the previous turn system output. This dialogue state serves as the input to the dialogue state tracker, which updates its estimation of the user’s goal represented by a list of slot-value pairs. A probability distribution is maintained over candidate values for each goal slot type. The dialogue policy selects the next system action in response to the user’s input based on the current dialogue state. The policy network emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act conditioning on these inputs. The emitted system action is finally used to produce a system response in natural language format by combining the state tracker outputs and the retrieved KB entities. The model uses a template-based NLG, where delexicalised tokens in the NLG template are replaced by the values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action. The model sends symbolic queries to the KB and leaves the ranking of the KB entities to external services, as entity ranking in real-world systems can be made with much richer features than just following entity posterior probabilities conditioning on a user utterance.

Here's a detailed analysis based on the provided text and image quotes:\n\n1. **Positional Encodings**:\n   - **Text Quote [6]** and **Image Quote 3** indicate that the model's AP is highly sensitive to the type of positional encodings used. The baseline model uses fixed sine positional encodings passed at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder. Removing spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, while passing them only in the decoder results in a minor AP drop. Learned spatial encodings passed to the attentions give similar results to the baseline.\n   - **Image Quote 3** shows a table comparing different positional encoding configurations. The model with fixed sine positional encodings at every attention layer achieves the highest AP of 40.6, while removing spatial positional encodings results in an AP of 32.8, a drop of 7.8 AP.\n\n2. **Loss Components**:\n   - **Text Quote [7]** and **Image Quote 7** discuss the impact of different loss components on the model's performance. The baseline model uses both class and bounding box loss components. Removing the bounding box loss component (GIOU) results in a slight decrease in AP, while removing the class loss component (ℓ1) leads to a more significant drop.\n   - **Image Quote 7** presents a table showing the AP values for different loss configurations. The model with both class and bounding box loss components achieves the highest AP of 40.6. Removing the bounding box loss component results in an AP of 39.9, while removing the class loss component results in an AP of 35.8.\n\n3. **Decoder Layers**:\n   - **Text Quote [11]** and **Image Quote 4** highlight the importance of multiple decoder layers in the model. Each additional decoder layer improves the AP, with a total improvement of +8.2/9.5 AP between the first and last layer. The self-attention mechanism in the decoder layers helps to inhibit duplicate predictions and improve the model's performance.\n   - **Image Quote 4** shows a graph plotting AP and AP50 against the number of decoder layers. The AP and AP50 values increase with each additional decoder layer, reaching their peak at the sixth layer.\n\n4. **Generalization to Unseen Numbers of Instances**:\n   - **Text Quote [2]** and **Image Quote 5** demonstrate the model's ability to generalize to unseen numbers of instances.

However, the demonstration selection strategy does have a notable effect, with \"embed\" and \"epr\" strategies outperforming random sampling. When compared with other models, LLMs generally perform better on the FewNERD dataset, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

This indicates that the models struggle more with identifying the necessary knowledge when it is absent, which is crucial for generating accurate citations. The F1-Score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, also decreases, reflecting the overall decline in the model's performance. The 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, which allows models to identify the need for supporting knowledge beyond the provided KG, shows an increasing role in improving citation quality as the coverage problem of the knowledge graph becomes more serious.

This is evident from the following points:\n\n1. **QASPER Dataset Performance**:\n   - **Tree Traversal vs. Collapsed Tree**: As shown in Figure 3, the collapsed tree approach consistently performs better than tree traversal. The collapsed tree method retrieves information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, unlike tree traversal, which maintains a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details regardless of the question.\n   - **RAPTOR with DPR**: The collapsed tree approach also outperforms RAPTOR with DPR, as illustrated in Figure 4. RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval allows it to choose nodes from different tree layers, matching the question's detail level, which often yields more relevant and comprehensive information for downstream tasks than DPR.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n   - **ROUGE, BLEU-1, BLEU-4, METEOR**: In Table 1, the collapsed tree approach with RAPTOR outperforms DPR and BM25 in terms of ROUGE, BLEU-1, BLEU-4, and METEOR scores.

Specifically, the RAR models achieve a 6.4% improvement on the LVIS dataset and a 1.5% gain on the V3Det dataset. These enhancements are attributed to the RAR's ability to effectively pool relevant information from external memory, providing the MLLMs with a richer context for rare class identification. The integration of the RAR with MLLMs ensures that even lesser-represented classes receive adequate attention during the classification process, significantly boosting the model's ability to discern and accurately classify objects that are infrequently encountered. This is particularly beneficial in addressing the challenges posed by long-tailed distribution datasets."}

Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Cropping and Blurring**: As shown in Fig. 3, the system begins by cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. This is crucial because object detection datasets typically contain multiple objects of varying sizes, and some objects may dominate a large portion of the image while others occupy minimal space. To help the MLLMs understand the objects to be detected, the system employs a blurring technique on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This blurring strategy directs the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks.\n\n2. **Retrieval Phase**:\n   - **Image Embedding Extraction**: The system uses a visual encoder to process the input image and obtain the corresponding image embedding. This visual encoder is identical to the encoder used in the multimodal retriever.\n   - **Memory Index Navigation**: The image embedding is then navigated through the previously constructed memory index and ranked by similarity to identify the top-k related images. Consequently, the memory yields the names of the retrieved top-k categories.\n\n3. **Ranking Phase**:\n   - **MLLM Ranking**: The top-k retrieved results serve as a preliminary filter, narrowing down the vast possibilities to those most likely relevant based on historical data and the semantic closeness of stored labels to the image content. The MLLMs, combining the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category. This ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning for Ranking**:\n   - **Improving Ranking Ability**: To fully exploit the ranking potential of MLLMs for downstream tasks, the system selects a small-scale classification dataset to fine-tune the MLLMs. The primary goal of fine-tuning is to enable MLLMs to improve their ranking ability, such as following the format of prompts and returning results as required.\n\n5. **Integration with MLLMs**:\n   - **Seamless Integration**: The system is designed to be seamlessly integrated into various MLLMs in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing the fine-grained few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs.\n\n6. **Performance Evaluation**:\n   - **Benchmark Results**: The system demonstrates significant improvements in performance on various visual recognition tasks, including fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, few-shot image recognition datasets, and object detection datasets under the zero-shot recognition setting.\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images/text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval, and then using MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions.

This is evident from the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2, which show SPECTER achieving the highest scores in most categories. For instance, in the classification task, SPECTER achieves an F1 score of 82.0 and 86.4 for MAG and MeSH datasets, respectively, outperforming all other models. In user activity prediction, SPECTER scores 83.6 and 91.5 for Co-View and Co-Read tasks, respectively, again surpassing other models. For citation prediction, SPECTER's performance is highlighted by scores of 84.5 and 92.4 for Cite and Co-Cite tasks, respectively. In the recommendation task, SPECTER achieves an nDCG score of 53.9, which is the highest among the models listed.\n\n#### Effects of Including Additional Metadata\n\nThe inclusion of additional metadata such as venue and author has varying effects on the performance of the SPECTER model. According to the ablation study results shown in Table 2, removing the abstract from the input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance. Adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and suboptimal tokenization using Wordpieces. Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification, where it makes sense as venues are expected to have high correlation with document topics.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the SPECTER model outperforms other models across various document-level tasks, with notable improvements in classification, user activity prediction, citation prediction, and recommendation tasks. The inclusion of additional metadata such as venue and author has mixed effects, with venues slightly improving performance on document classification but generally not contributing positively to other tasks. Authors, when included, tend to decrease performance, likely due to issues with tokenization and sparsity in the corpus. \n\n![SPECTER Model Performance Comparison](image1)\n![Metadata Effects on SPECTER Performance](image2)\n![SPECTER vs. SciBERT Embeddings](image3)\n![SPECTER Model Architecture](image4)\n![Ablation Study Results](image5)"}

Here's a detailed analysis based on the provided text and image quotes:\n\n1. **Pretraining Data**:\n   - **BooksCorpus and Wikipedia**: These sources perform well on tasks like QNLI and MNLI but less well on other tasks. The strategy of concatenating training examples into a single string and cropping blocks of 512 consecutive tokens did not improve performance compared to using the data as is (BWiki - sent) [1].\n   - **Common Crawl**: This data source benefits tasks like CoLA and RTE the most. Multi-sentence training examples are more effective for end-tasks based on sentence pairs, as shown by a 14-point accuracy gap on RTE between News Crawl and Common Crawl with 4.5B tokens [3].\n   - **News Crawl**: This data generally performs less well than Common Crawl, even on MRPC, which is newswire data. The reason is likely due to the individual sentences of 23 words on average, compared to several sentences or 50 words on average for Common Crawl [3].\n\n2. **Modeling Approaches**:\n   - **Cloze Loss vs. Bilm Loss**: The cloze loss performs significantly better than the bilm loss, and combining the two does not improve over the cloze loss alone. This suggests that individual left and right context prediction tasks are too different from center word prediction, and their learning signals are not complementary enough [4].\n   - **Stacking Methods**: Both ELMo-style stacking and fine-tuning methods outperform previous state-of-the-art results, with fine-tuning giving the biggest gain [9].\n   - **Pretraining on Larger Corpora**: More training data can significantly increase accuracy. Training on up to 18B Common Crawl tokens suggests that more training data is likely to further increase performance [7].\n\n3. **Experimental Analysis**:\n   - **Multiple Sentences in Training Examples**: Having multiple sentences in each training example is crucial for many tasks [11].\n   - **Pretraining Continues to Improve**: Pre-training continues to improve performance up to 18B tokens and would likely continue to improve with more data [11].\n   - **Cloze-Driven Training Regime**: This regime is more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately [11].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of pretraining data and modeling approaches plays a crucial role in the performance of NLP tasks. Multi-sentence training examples and larger training corpora are beneficial, while the cloze-driven training regime outperforms other methods. Fine-tuning and stacking methods also significantly enhance performance. The data suggests that more training data and effective pretraining strategies can lead to better results on NLP tasks. \n\n![Comparison of cloze, bilm, and cloze +"}

{"q_id": 424, "model": "OpenGVLab/InternVL2_5-38B", "in_tok": 0, "out_tok": 0, "total_tok": 0, "response": "### Answer\n\nPre-training has a significant impact on translation accuracy across different language pairs, with the effect being more pronounced in low-resource scenarios. The translation accuracy, measured by BLEU scores, generally improves with pre-training, especially when the baseline system is moderately effective but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that pre-training is most effective when there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, but not so much that the system is already highly accurate.\n\n#### Language Similarity\nThe similarity between the source and target languages plays a crucial role in the efficacy of pre-training. When the languages are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods are more similar between the two languages, leading to larger gains from pre-training. For instance, the translation pairs with higher linguistic similarity, such as GL/PT, show the largest gains in BLEU scores, while pairs with lower similarity, like BE/RU, show smaller gains or even a decrease.\n\n#### Training Set Size\nThe size of the training set also influences the effectiveness of pre-training. Pre-training is particularly beneficial when the training set size is small, as it helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences. This is evident from the qualitative analysis of translations from GL to EN, where pre-training not only helps in capturing less frequent concepts but also improves the overall grammatical structure of the translations.\n\n#### Multilingual Systems\nIn multilingual translation systems, pre-training and alignment of embeddings are more effective. When a single encoder is used for multiple languages, aligning the word embeddings ensures that the embeddings of the two source languages are in similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the languages are more similar, as it helps in maintaining the consistency of the embedding space.\n\n### Conclusion\nPre-training significantly enhances translation accuracy, especially in low-resource scenarios with moderately effective baseline systems. The effectiveness of pre-training is influenced by both the similarity between the source and target languages and the size of the training set. In multilingual systems, aligning the embeddings further improves the translation accuracy, particularly for more similar language pairs. \n\n![BLEU scores for different language pairs with and without pre-training](image1)\n![BLEU scores for different training set sizes with and without pre-training](image2)\n![Dataset sizes for different language pairs](image3)\n![F-measure for different frequency buckets in the training corpus](image4)\n![Translation examples with and without pre-training](image7)\n![BLEU scores for multilingual translation with and without pre-training and alignment](image8)"}

According to the data presented in Table 5, when pre-trained embeddings are aligned, there is a noticeable improvement in BLEU scores for all three tasks. This improvement is particularly evident in the translation pairs with higher similarity, such as GL/PT, where the gains are the largest. The alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are placed in similar vector spaces, facilitating easier learning for the model as if it were trained on a single language.\n\n#### Observed Differences in F-Measure Scores\n\nThe F-measure scores for target words, when bucketed by frequency in the training corpus, show that pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, with a more pronounced effect on low-frequency words. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where the F-measure scores for low-frequency words are significantly higher when pre-training is applied. This indicates that pre-trained embeddings are particularly effective in handling less frequent vocabulary, which is crucial for improving translation quality in low-resource scenarios.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe alignment of word embeddings enhances translation performance by placing the embeddings of different languages in similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn more effectively. Additionally, pre-training improves the translation accuracy of low-frequency words, which is beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the importance of pre-training and alignment in NMT systems, especially when dealing with languages that have limited training data."}

Coreference propagation significantly improves entity extraction, particularly in datasets with overlapping entities. For example, on ACE04-O and ACE05-O, DyGIE achieves substantial improvements of 11.6% and 11.3%, respectively, over the state of the art.

This indicates that the coreference layer benefits from multiple iterations to refine the span representations, leading to better entity extraction performance.\n\nFor RelProp, the F1 score for relation extraction also improves with the number of iterations, reaching its peak at the second iteration (M=2) as depicted in Figure 3b. This suggests that the relation propagation layer benefits from multiple iterations to enhance the interaction between tasks, resulting in improved relation extraction performance.\n\nIn comparison, the number of entities in a sentence has a more complex impact on the relation F1 score. As shown in Figure 5, the relation F1 score initially decreases as the number of entities in a sentence increases, reaching a minimum at 4-5 entities. However, it then increases again for sentences with 6-11 entities before decreasing for sentences with 12 or more entities. This indicates that the relation extraction performance is sensitive to the number of entities in a sentence, with an optimal range of 6-11 entities for the best performance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp positively affects the F1 scores for entity and relation extraction, respectively, with the best performance observed at the second iteration. In contrast, the number of entities in a sentence has a more nuanced impact on the relation F1 score, with an optimal range of 6-11 entities for the best performance. This highlights the importance of considering both the number of iterations and the number of entities in a sentence when optimizing the performance of the model for information extraction tasks."}

GEM outperforms naive fine-tuning and EWC in terms of maintaining performance on the original domains while adapting to new ones. This is evident from the results in Table 3, where GEM achieves higher joint accuracy on the new domain compared to naive and EWC fine-tuning. For instance, GEM achieves a joint accuracy of 34.73% on the attraction domain, while naive fine-tuning only achieves 29.39%.\n\nSlot similarities play a crucial role in the model's performance. Slots that are common across multiple domains, such as \"area,\" \"price range,\" and \"day,\" are successfully transferred from one domain to another. This is shown in Fig. 5, where these slots are effectively tracked in both the hotel and restaurant domains. However, slots that are unique to a single domain, such as \"parking,\" \"stars,\" and \"internet\" in the hotel domain, and \"food\" in the restaurant domain, are more challenging for the model to track correctly. This is reflected in the slot error rate bar chart, where these unique slots have higher error rates compared to the common slots.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGEM fine-tuning is more effective than naive and EWC fine-tuning in adapting the model to new domain data while maintaining performance on the original domains. Slot similarities significantly impact the model's performance, with common slots being more easily transferred across domains and unique slots posing greater challenges. \n\n### Cited Evidence\n\n- **Text Quote 1**: \"Fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains. Take the hotel domain as an example, the performance on the four domains after fine-tuning with GEM only drops from 58.98% to 53.54% (-5.44%) on joint accuracy, whereas naive fine-tuning deteriorates the tracking ability, dropping joint goal accuracy to 36.08% (-22.9%).\"\n- **Text Quote 4**: \"Finally, when considering hotel and attraction as new domain, fine-tuning with GEM outperforms the naive fine-tuning approach on the new domain.

The study presented in the text and images provides evidence that machine translation systems often exhibit gender bias, particularly when translating between English and other languages with grammatical gender. This bias is evident in the way these systems handle gendered pronouns and roles, often defaulting to stereotypical gender assignments.\n\n#### Evidence from Text and Images\n\n1. **Text [1]** and **Image1**:\n   - The text mentions that most tested systems perform poorly on preserving the gender of entities from the original English sentence. However, German translations show better performance, possibly due to the language's similarity to English.\n   - **Image1** shows the accuracy of different machine translation systems (Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, SYSTRAN) across various languages. The highest accuracy is observed in German (74.1%) and French (63.6%), indicating that these systems are better at handling gender in these languages.\n\n2. **Text [2]** and **Image4**:\n   - The text highlights that machine translation systems have better performance with pro-stereotypical gender role assignments and worse performance with anti-stereotypical roles.\n   - **Image4** illustrates this trend with a bar chart showing the accuracy of translations for stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across different languages. The chart shows that translations for stereotypical roles (e.g., a female nurse) are more accurate than those for non-stereotypical roles (e.g., a male nurse).\n\n3. **Text [3]** and **Image3**:\n   - The text discusses the performance of commercial MT systems on the WinoMT corpus, which includes metrics for gender accuracy and differences in performance between masculine and feminine scores.\n   - **Image3** provides a breakdown of the WinoMT corpus by gender, showing the number of instances for male, female, and neutral entities. This data helps in understanding the distribution of gendered roles in the dataset.\n\n4. **Text [4]** and **Image2**:\n   - The text states that all tested MT systems exhibit gender bias, as indicated by the metrics computed for each system and target language.\n   - **Image2** shows the accuracy and differences in performance for two specific languages (French and German) using different datasets (Ott et al., 2018, and Edunov et al., 2018).

This suggests that adversarial training can improve performance on multi-hop questions but may negatively impact single-hop questions.\n\n3. **Effect of Evaluation Data**:\n   - **Original Evaluation Data**: The text and image8 indicate that using original evaluation data results in an F1 score of 67.08 for single-hop questions and 46.84 for multi-hop questions.\n   - **Adversarial Evaluation Data**: When adversarial evaluation data is used, the F1 score for single-hop questions drops to 59.12, and for multi-hop questions, it increases to 60.10. This aligns with the findings from adversarial training data, showing that adversarial evaluation can improve performance on multi-hop questions.\n\n4. **Entity Type Matching**:\n   - The text and image8 show that filtering the initial list of paragraphs by entity type can help eliminate bias. However, this filtering results in a drop in F1 score to 40.73 for single-hop questions and 40.73 for multi-hop questions. This suggests that entity type matching can be beneficial but may also introduce challenges.\n\n5. **Open-domain Questions**:\n   - The text and image7 indicate that open-domain questions are challenging for models.

The factors contributing to these differences include:\n\n1. **Net Income**: The net income for 2020 was $4,730.5 million, which is lower than the net income of $6,025.4 million in 2019 and $5,924.3 million in 2018. This decrease in net income is a primary factor in the overall decrease in comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: The other comprehensive income (loss) for 2020 was a net loss of $104.1 million, which is a significant improvement compared to the net loss of $126.8 million in 2019 and a net loss of $431.1 million in 2018. This improvement is primarily due to gains in foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges.\n\n3. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: The foreign currency translation adjustments for 2020 resulted in a net gain of $63.1 million, which is a significant improvement compared to the net loss of $174.3 million in 2019 and the net loss of $453.6 million in 2018.

This improvement is due to favorable changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\n5. **Defined Benefit Pension Plans**: The defined benefit pension plans for 2020 resulted in a net loss of $43.9 million, which is a significant improvement compared to the net loss of $27.1 million in 2019 and the net loss of $26.4 million in 2018.

This decrease was largely attributable to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as indicated in the text quote [12]. The asset allocations reflect these changes, with a significant increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, as shown in image6. This shift in asset allocation towards more liquid and lower-yielding assets likely contributed to the decline in net investment income. Additionally, the decrease in fixed maturity securities from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 further supports the impact of lower interest rates on investment income. The decline in net investment income was partially offset by an increase in dividend income, which rose by 3.5% from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, as shown in image7. However, the overall decline in net investment income was still significant, reflecting the broader impact of lower interest rates on the company's investment portfolio. In summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to lower interest and other investment income, which was driven by lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.

The revenues dropped from $4,891 million in 2019 to $182 million in 2021, indicating a reduction of $4,709 million over the three-year period.\n\n2. **Unallocated Expenses:**\n   - There was an increase in unallocated expenses from 2019 to 2021. The expenses rose from $2,040 million in 2019 to $3,032 million in 2021, indicating an increase of $992 million over the three-year period.\n\n3. **Comparison with Net Assets Acquired:**\n   - The net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021 were $1,264 million. This amount is significantly lower than the decrease in unallocated revenues ($4,709 million) and higher than the increase in unallocated expenses ($992 million).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 show a substantial decrease in revenues and an increase in expenses. The net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021 were $1,264 million, which is a smaller amount compared to the decrease in unallocated revenues but higher than the increase in unallocated expenses. This suggests that the acquisition of NUVIA had a relatively smaller impact on the company's financials compared to the changes"}

The net loss in 2020 indicates that the company's earnings were not sufficient to cover its expenses, leading to a decrease in equity.\n\n2. **Dividends Paid**:\n   - **2019**: $14,652 million\n   - **2020**: $14,865 million\n\n   Despite the decrease in net income, the company continued to pay dividends, which further reduced the total equity.\n\n3. **Foreign Exchange Translation Effects**:\n   - **2019**: $1,400 million increase\n   - **2020**: $1,800 million increase\n\n   Although there was an increase in equity due to foreign exchange translation effects, it was not enough to offset the significant net loss and dividend payments.\n\n4. **Changes in Noncontrolling Interests**:\n   - **2019**: $7,288 million\n   - **2020**: $6,980 million\n\n   The decrease in noncontrolling interests also contributed to the reduction in total equity.\n\n5. **Common Stock Held in Treasury**:\n   - **2019**: $225,553 million\n   - **2020**: $225,776 million\n\n   The slight increase in common stock held in treasury indicates that the company repurchased more shares, which reduces total equity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total equity of ExxonMobil decreased by $29,847 million from 2019 to 2020.

Revenue increased by 26.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, and by 6.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, as shown in image6. This growth was driven by increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period. The introduction of Peacock programming into Sky video services also contributed to the revenue increase. However, the number of subscribers and audience ratings at NBCUniversal's networks continued to decline due to the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, as mentioned in [4]. Despite this, the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% in 2021 compared to 2020, and by 2.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, as shown in image8. This increase was driven by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky's customers.

Customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in Italy were offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany.

The increase in Credit Risk RWA, primarily due to market volatility and the E*TRADE acquisition, led to a higher risk-weighted asset base. This, in turn, required the institution to hold more capital to maintain its capital ratios. The increase in External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets indicates that the institution has been able to maintain a higher level of loss-absorbing capacity, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and financial stability. The combination of these changes suggests that the institution has been proactive in managing its capital structure to meet regulatory requirements and maintain financial health. However, the specific impact on the institution's overall capital structure would depend on various factors, including the institution's risk profile, business strategy, and market conditions. It is important to note that the institution's capital structure is a complex and dynamic system, and the changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets are just two of many factors that can influence it. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the institution's financial statements and regulatory filings would be necessary to fully understand the impact of these changes on the institution's overall capital structure."}

This increase is primarily due to the addition of new intangible assets, such as brands and patents, which are expected to generate future economic benefits for the company. The company's overall amortization expenses during this period were $312 million in 2022, as shown in image1, which is a decrease from $318 million in 2021. This decrease in amortization expenses is likely due to the fact that the company's intangible assets with determinable lives have a longer useful life, resulting in lower annual amortization expenses. The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively. ![Intangible assets with determinable lives increased from $8,628 million in 2021 to $9,012 million in 2022](image10) ![Overall amortization expenses decreased from $318 million in 2021 to $312 million in 2022](image1) ![Intangible assets with determinable lives have a longer useful life, resulting in lower annual amortization expenses](image1) ![The company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively](image1) ![The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively](image1) ![The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively](image1) ![The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively](image1) ![The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively](image1) ![The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively](image1) ![The increase in intangible assets with determinable lives and the decrease in amortization expenses suggest that the company is investing in long-term assets that will generate future economic benefits, while also managing its expenses effectively]("}

The adjusted profit before tax for 2020 was $1.9 billion, down from $7.2 billion in 2019. The decrease in adjusted revenue was mainly due to the impact of lower global interest rates, while the increase in adjusted ECL was a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. The adjusted operating expenses decreased by $1.1 billion or 3% as the company lowered performance-related pay and reduced discretionary expenditure while continuing to invest in its businesses. The return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was 6.7%, down from 9.8% in 2019. The company no longer expects to reach its RoTE target of between 10% and 12% in 2022, as originally planned. The decrease in profit before tax was also due to restructuring costs and charges from the impairment of intangibles, in part as a result of the company's strategic actions to address underperformance. The reported profit before tax for 2020 included the company's share of an impairment by its associate, The Saudi British Bank (SABB), of $462 million, while 2019 included a $0.8 billion dilution gain recognized on the completion of the merger of SABB with Alawwal bank.

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual.\n   - From 2018 to 2019, net interest income increased by $1.4 billion to $48.9 billion. This increase was due to higher interest rates and the deployment of excess deposits into securities.\n\n2. **Net Interest Expense:**\n   - From 2019 to 2020, net interest expense decreased by $1.4 billion to $14.1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates on deposits and borrowings.\n   - From 2018 to 2019, net interest expense increased by $1.1 billion to $15.5 billion. This increase was due to higher interest rates on deposits and borrowings.\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America in the following ways:\n\n1. **Segmentation:**\n   - The bank's results of operations are reported through four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets. The remaining operations are recorded in All Other. This segmentation allows for a detailed analysis of the performance of each segment and the overall impact on net interest income and expense.\n\n2. **Risk Management:**\n   - The bank utilizes a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. This approach helps in managing the risks associated with net interest income and expense, ensuring that the bank maintains a stable financial position.\n\n3. **Capital Allocation:**\n   - The bank allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. This allocation is based on the risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business, and operational risk components. This ensures that the bank's capital is allocated efficiently and effectively, taking into account the risks and opportunities in each segment.\n\n4. **Performance Indicators:**\n   - The bank presents certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. These indicators provide additional information about the segments' operational performance, customer trends, and business growth. This helps in understanding the factors driving the changes in net interest income and expense.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 reflect the bank's organizational structure, which is designed to"}

The R&D to asset ratio is a measure of how much a company is investing in research and development relative to its total assets. A higher ratio indicates that the company is investing more in R&D, which can lead to new products and services and potentially higher profits in the future. However, it is important to note that a high R&D to asset ratio may also indicate that the company is taking on more risk, as R&D investments are often uncertain and may not always result in successful products or services. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors, such as the company's financial health and market conditions, when evaluating the R&D to asset ratio."}

This significant rise is primarily due to the acquisition of Varian, which required substantial financing.\n- **Remaining Current Liabilities**: Increased from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021. This increase is mainly attributed to higher provisions and other current liabilities.\n- **Remaining Non-Current Liabilities**: Increased from €969 million in 2020 to €2,686 million in 2021. The growth is driven by deferred tax liabilities and other financial liabilities.\n\n#### Equity\n- **Total Equity**: Increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021. This increase is primarily due to the capital increase in March 2021, which raised the subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million.\n- **Issued Capital**: Increased from €1,075 million in 2020 to €1,128 million in 2021.\n- **Capital Reserve**: Increased from €13,476 million in 2020 to €15,818 million in 2021.\n- **Retained Earnings**: Decreased from €-1,276 million in 2020 to €-300 million in 2021, reflecting the dividend payout and net income for the year.\n- **Treasury Shares**: Increased from €-36 million in 2020 to €-240 million in 2021, indicating more treasury shares were repurchased.\n\n### Conclusion\nSiemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity saw significant changes from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian, capital increases, and changes in retained earnings and treasury shares.

This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021.

However, the company's cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased from $183,420 million in 2020 to $236,124 million in 2021, which could be attributed to the proceeds from the sale of WFAM. \n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, had a significant impact on the company's income and balance sheet, resulting in a reduction in total WFAM assets under management, a net gain of $674 million, a decrease in investment advisory and other asset-based fees, and a reduction in the company's overall asset base. However, the company's cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased, which could be attributed to the proceeds from the sale of WFAM. \n\n![Total WFAM assets under management decreased from $603.0 billion at the beginning of the period to $0 at the end of the period](image2)\n![Net gain of $674 million from the sale of WFAM](image1)\n![Decrease in investment advisory and other asset-based fees](image3)\n![Reduction in total assets and increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash](image7)"}

This could impact the company's future cash flows if these benefits are not realized.\n\n#### Common Share Repurchases\n- **2019**: 22 million shares repurchased at an average price of $245.97 per share, with an aggregate cost of $5,500 million.\n- **2020**: 14 million shares repurchased at an average price of $300.58 per share, with an aggregate cost of $4,250 million.\n\n**Implications**:\n- The decrease in the number of shares repurchased and the increase in the average price per share in 2020 compared to 2019 indicates that the company spent less on share repurchases despite paying a higher price per share. This could suggest a strategic decision to reduce the number of shares outstanding while maintaining a strong financial position.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased, indicating potential future tax liabilities or disputes. Meanwhile, the company reduced its share repurchases in 2020, which could be a strategic move to conserve cash or adjust to market conditions.

This is a significant increase, reflecting higher end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as favorable price realization.

This increase was driven by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility. Despite higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses, these were more than offset by the aforementioned factors.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\n1. **Higher End-User Demand:**\n   - The increase in sales volume and operating profit was primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services. This demand was driven by various sectors, including mining, heavy construction, and quarry and aggregates.\n\n2. **Favorable Price Realization:**\n   - The company experienced favorable price realization, which contributed to the increase in both sales volume and operating profit. This indicates that the company was able to maintain or increase prices despite the increase in demand.\n\n3. **Changes in Dealer Inventories:**\n   - Dealers decreased their inventories more in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the fourth quarter of 2021. This change in inventory levels contributed to the increase in sales volume, as dealers replenished their inventories in 2021.\n\n4. **Net Restructuring Income:**\n   - The gain on the sale of a facility provided net restructuring income, which positively impacted the operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n5. **Higher Manufacturing Costs and SG&A/R&D Expenses:**\n   - Despite the increase in operating profit, the company faced higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses. However, these were offset by the increases in sales volume and price realization.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe significant increase in sales volume and operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventories. The net restructuring income from the sale of a facility also contributed to the increase in"}

In 2019, the net cash provided by operating activities was $10,090 million, which decreased to $9,812 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs. The net cash used in investing activities decreased from $1,811 million in 2019 to $1,154 million in 2020, mainly due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures.

The evaluation weight for each indicator is 50%, ensuring a balanced assessment. The consolidated operating income is evaluated based on the degree of attainment of the required income set in 2011, which serves as a reference value for Toyota's sustainable growth. The volatility of Toyota's share price is comparatively evaluated using the share price of Toyota and the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year as reference values. This dual focus on financial performance and market valuation helps to align executive compensation with both business success and shareholder interests. The evaluation results for the current fiscal year are then used to determine the performance-linked remuneration component of the total remuneration for each executive. This approach ensures that executive compensation is directly tied to the company's financial health and market performance, thereby promoting alignment between executive incentives and shareholder value."}

The RWA increased from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in market risk RWA and credit risk RWA. Market risk RWA increased due to higher market volatility, while credit risk RWA increased due to an increase in derivatives exposures, investment securities, lending commitments, and equity investments. As a result, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. This decrease in the percentage indicates that the firm's ability to absorb losses in the event of a failure has decreased, which could have implications for its financial stability and regulatory compliance. The firm should monitor these changes closely and take appropriate actions to maintain its capital adequacy and regulatory compliance."}

In the U.S., the revenue decreased by 2% in 2020 compared to 2019, while the International Operated Markets segment saw a more substantial decline of 17%. The International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment also experienced a decrease of 10%. These changes were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in many markets. Additionally, the ability of each market to drive sales and revenue growth was impacted by the number of drive-thru restaurant locations. The revenue declines were driven by the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activity, along with growth in delivery, had a positive impact on comparable sales in the second half of 2020. However, the comparable sales decline in the International Operated segment was primarily driven by negative comparable sales in most markets as a result of COVID-19. The decline was partly offset by positive results in Australia. The company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales and resulting cash flow streams. As most revenues are based on a percent of sales, the company expects that government regulations as a result of COVID-19 resurgences will continue to have a negative impact on revenue in the near term. The company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees, and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand, and third-party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business. The company's reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\") and International Operated Markets (\"IOM\"). In addition, throughout this report, we present the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment (\"IDL\"), which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities.

This might indicate that the company's operational activities were affected by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decrease in cash provided by operations despite an increase in the number of systemwide restaurants. The decrease in cash provided by operations could be due to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19, as mentioned in the text.

The cost of revenues increased from RMB16,761 million in 2019 to RMB21,840 million in 2021, with a notable rise in other cost of revenues from RMB1,794 million in 2019 to RMB2,848 million in 2021. This increase could be attributed to higher agency fees and payment channel fees, as well as increased employee benefits expenses and advertising agency fees. The operating expenses also saw a rise, with total operating expenses increasing from RMB4,744 million in 2019 to RMB6,687 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses, which rose from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,009 million in 2021. The company's financial management appears to be focused on expanding its operations and improving its product and technology innovations, as indicated by the increase in R&D expenses and the management of selling and marketing expenses. However, the significant increase in operating expenses and cost of revenues may also indicate potential challenges in managing costs and maintaining profitability. The company's adjusted profit for the year, which excludes certain non-cash items, also saw a decrease from RMB4,903 million in 2019 to RMB4,332 million in 2021, which may be a cause for concern. Overall, the company's financial management appears to be focused on growth and innovation, but may need to address cost management and profitability challenges in the future. ![Cost of revenues and operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image6) ![Operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image2) ![Adjusted profit for the year decreased from 2019 to 2021](image4) ![Cost of revenues and operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image6) ![Operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image2) ![Adjusted profit for the year decreased from 2019 to 2021](image4) ![Cost of revenues and operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image6) ![Operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image2) ![Adjusted profit for the year decreased from 2019 to 2021](image4) ![Cost of revenues and operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021](image6) ![Operating expenses"}

The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million (adjusted for currency) was driven by an increase in deferred taxes of $4,060 million and an increase in prepaid pension assets of $745 million, partially offset by a decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,626 million and a decrease in net intangible assets and goodwill of $44 million. This increase in noncurrent assets indicates that IBM has invested more in long-term assets, which could potentially lead to higher future revenues and profits. However, the increase in long-term debt of $1,361 million (adjusted for currency) suggests that IBM has taken on more debt to finance these investments. This could increase the company's financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns. The decrease in total equity of $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, also indicates that IBM has reduced its equity base.

These changes might indicate a reduction in consumer spending and borrowing, possibly due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in credit card purchase volumes was driven by the impact of COVID-19, with spending for travel and entertainment remaining lower compared to 2019. However, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion, suggesting that while overall spending improved during the second half of 2020, spending patterns shifted towards debit card usage. The decrease in home equity production could be attributed to a decline in applications, reflecting a cautious approach by consumers towards taking on new debt during uncertain economic times.

For instance, a $1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and a $1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of $163 million and $24 million, respectively. This indicates that coal prices are a key driver of value for BHP.\n   - **Nickel**: The nickel price benefitted from positive investor sentiment amidst a strong, geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand. An announcement by a major nickel producer during the period that it intends to convert some nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia, thereby making it suitable for use in the battery supply chain, led to a brief correction in March. Prices subsequently rebounded supported by strong demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks.\n\n2. **Key Drivers Behind These Impacts**:\n   - **Coal**: The key drivers include global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, commodity supply and demand (including inventory levels), technological change, product substitution, tariffs, and exchange rate fluctuations.\n   - **Nickel**: The key drivers include investor sentiment, end-use demand, supply chain disruptions, and inventory levels.\n\n#### Image Analysis\n\n- **image5**: This image provides a table showing the impact of changes in commodity prices on BHP's financial measures.

This is evident from the data provided in image5, which shows the average spending for U.S. card members in 2020 and 2021. The increase in spending can be attributed to various factors, including the growth in the premium card portfolios and the overall increase in billed business. The data also indicates that the average spending for U.S. card members was higher than the average spending for card members outside the U.S. in both 2020 and 2021. This suggests that U.S. card members tend to spend more on their cards compared to card members in other regions. The increase in spending is a positive sign for the company, as it indicates that card members are using their cards more frequently and spending more money, which can lead to higher revenue for the company. However, it is important to note that the increase in spending may also be influenced by external factors, such as changes in consumer behavior and economic conditions. Therefore, it is important for the company to monitor these factors and adjust its strategies accordingly to ensure continued growth and profitability. ![Average proprietary basic card member spending for U.S. card members increased from $18,085 in 2020 to $22,477 in 2021, representing a 24% increase](image5) ![The average spending for U.S. card members was higher than the average spending for card members outside the U.S. in both 2020 and 2021](image5) ![The increase in spending can be attributed to various factors, including the growth in the premium card portfolios and the overall increase in billed business](image5) ![The increase in spending is a positive sign for the company, as it indicates that card members are using their cards more frequently and spending more money, which can lead to higher revenue for the company](image5) ![However, it is important to note that the increase in spending may also be influenced by external factors, such as changes in consumer behavior and economic conditions](image5) ![Therefore, it is important for the company to monitor these factors and adjust its strategies accordingly to ensure continued growth and profitability](image5) ![The average proprietary basic card member spending for U.S. card members increased from $18,085 in 2020 to $22,477 in 2021, representing a 24% increase](image5) ![The average spending for U.S. card members was higher than the average spending for card members outside the U.S. in both 2020 and 2021](image5) ![The"}

In 2022, the recorded basis for available-for-sale securities was $529, which was adjusted from the cost basis of $534 due to a net unrealized loss of $5. This adjustment reflects the fair value of the securities at the end of the year. The recorded basis is used to determine the carrying value of the securities on the balance sheet. The unrealized gains and losses are also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. The specific identification method is used to determine the unrealized gains and losses. The available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. Government and Agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. The unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are not material for the years ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. At those dates, there were no available-for-sale securities in a material continuous unrealized-loss position. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2022 or 2021. The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2022.

This amount includes various senior notes with different interest rates and maturity dates, as well as other long-term debt. The company also has short-term bank credit facilities with a borrowing capacity of $1,050 million, but the borrowings on these facilities were immaterial during 2021. The long-term debt is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. The company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,050 million and $967 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The total underwriting revenue was $5,196 million in 2020, compared to $3,618 million in 2019, representing a 44% increase. This growth was driven by higher volumes in both equity and fixed income underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues increased by 81% to $3,092 million, while fixed income underwriting revenues rose by 10% to $2,104 million. The increase in underwriting revenues was supported by a constructive market environment and elevated volumes in secondary block share trades, initial public offerings, and follow-on offerings. Additionally, the company experienced higher volumes in investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuances, partially offset by lower event-driven investment grade loan activity. The overall increase in underwriting revenues contributed to the growth in institutional securities net revenues, which rose by 27% from the prior year. This growth was primarily due to higher sales and trading revenues on strong client engagement and market volatility, combined with an increase in underwriting revenues on elevated volumes. The increase in underwriting revenues was also reflected in the company's total investment banking revenues, which increased by 26% from the prior year. The increase in underwriting revenues was driven by higher volumes in both equity and fixed income underwriting, as well as higher revenues from sales and trading and underwriting. The increase in underwriting revenues was partially offset by losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale and an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment.

The total liabilities are listed under the \"Liabilities\" section, and the consolidated totals are shown in the last column of the table. The value of 16,199 million RMB is the sum of the liabilities for the parent company, consolidated subsidiaries, WOFEs, and other subsidiaries, after eliminating any intercompany transactions. This value represents the total amount of debt and other obligations that the company has to pay in the future. It is an important financial metric that investors and analysts use to assess the company's financial health and risk profile. A high level of total liabilities may indicate that the company has a high level of debt and may be at risk of defaulting on its obligations if it is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt payments. On the other hand, a low level of total liabilities may indicate that the company has a strong financial position and is able to meet its obligations without relying heavily on debt financing. However, it is important to note that the level of total liabilities should be considered in the context of the company's overall financial performance and industry norms. ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)  ![Total liabilities for the consolidated totals as of December 31, 2021 is 16,199 million RMB](image2)"}

The net income rose from a loss of $5,561 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,689 million in 2021. This improvement was primarily due to higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs. The comprehensive income also saw a substantial increase, moving from a loss of $6,165 million in 2020 to a profit of $17,348 million in 2021. The financial activities that contributed to these changes include higher sales and other operating revenues, higher income from equity affiliates, and lower operating expenses. Additionally, the company's investments in lower carbon capital projects and its focus on short-cycle projects played a role in the improved financial performance. The company's ability to manage its assets and liabilities effectively, as well as its strategic decisions in the energy sector, also contributed to the positive financial results."}

The data also shows that 967 female employees returned to work after availing parental leave, while 1,941 male employees returned. This suggests that a higher percentage of male employees returned to work after availing parental leave compared to female employees. The data reflects on gender diversity policies in the workplace by highlighting the need for more inclusive policies that support both male and female employees in balancing work and family responsibilities. The bank's policies should aim to provide equal opportunities for both genders to avail parental leave and return to work without any discrimination.

This increase was driven by sales of receivables, including sales of financing receivables of $3,076 million. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 contributed to the increase. However, this was partially offset by an increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million primarily driven by withholding tax on intercompany dividends in the second quarter. The performance-related declines within net income also impacted the cash flow.\n\nIn terms of investing activities, there was a decrease of $23,908 million in net cash used in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year. However, this was partially offset by a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations and an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million.\n\nFor financing activities, there was a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by the factors mentioned above, including the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and the decrease in net cash used in investing activities.\n\nOverall, the changes in net cash provided by operating, investing, and financing activities for IBM between 2019 and 2020 had a significant impact on the company's overall cash flow. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and the decrease in net cash used in investing activities contributed to a positive cash flow, while the net use of cash in financing activities partially offset this positive impact. The company's ability to generate cash from operating activities and manage its investments and financing activities effectively allowed it to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities."}

This decline was compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market as a result of COVID-19. For 2021, ENBREL is expected to follow the historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification, and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, for 2021, volume and net selling price declines are expected to continue.

The increase in global Prolia sales for 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price. The increase in global Prolia sales for 2019 was driven by higher unit demand. Disruptions in patient visits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand during 2020 by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and by lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients.

The comprehensive income attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders was $10,469 million in 2018, $14,421 million in 2019, and $15,167 million in 2020. This represents a growth of 38% from 2018 to 2020.\n\n#### Factors Contributing to Changes in Comprehensive Income\n\n1. **Net Earnings**\n   - Net earnings, a key component of comprehensive income, have also increased over the years. In 2018, net earnings were $11,986 million, which grew to $13,839 million in 2019, and further to $15,403 million in 2020. This growth in net earnings is primarily due to increased revenues and improved earnings from operations.\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**\n   - Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items such as unrealized gains or losses on investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2018, other comprehensive income (loss) was $(1,517) million, which improved to $582 million in 2019 and further to $(236) million in 2020. The fluctuations in other comprehensive income (loss) are mainly due to changes in the value of investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n3. **Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities**\n   - The unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities have fluctuated over the years. In 2018, there was a net loss of $(227) million, which turned into a net gain of $933 million in 2019, and then to a net loss of $(227) million in 2020. These fluctuations are influenced by market conditions and changes in the fair value of investment securities.\n\n4. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**\n   - Foreign currency translation adjustments have also contributed to the changes in other comprehensive income (loss). In 2018, there was a net loss of $(1,242) million, which improved to $(271) million in 2019, and then to $(983) million in 2020. These adjustments are due to changes in exchange rates affecting the translation of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.\n\n#### Conclusion\nUnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income"}

The company uses these useful life spans to calculate the depreciation expense for each asset category, which is then deducted from the asset's cost to determine its book value. This process helps in accurately reflecting the asset's value on the balance sheet and in calculating the company's taxable income. Additionally, the useful life spans are important for investors and analysts to assess the company's asset management and capital expenditure strategies. By knowing the useful life spans, they can better understand the company's investment in long-term assets and its ability to generate future cash flows from these assets. Furthermore, the useful life spans can also impact the company's tax liabilities, as the depreciation expense is tax-deductible, reducing the taxable income and, consequently, the tax liability.

The decrease in the weighted average cost of deposits is likely due to the acquisition of E*TRADE, which brought in additional deposits and reduced the overall cost of funding for the company. Additionally, the decrease in the weighted average cost of deposits may also be due to the overall decrease in interest rates during the year.

This indicates a significant increase in the net financing cash flows over the years. The increase in net financing cash flows can be attributed to higher repayments of interest-bearing liabilities, higher dividends paid, and higher dividends paid to non-controlling interests. The higher repayments of interest-bearing liabilities were mainly due to bond repayments on maturity and early repurchase of hybrid bonds. The higher dividends paid were due to the record half-year dividend and higher profits achieved at Escondida. The higher dividends paid to non-controlling interests were driven by higher profits achieved at Escondida. The increase in net financing cash flows is a positive trend as it indicates that the company is generating more cash from its financing activities. This can be used to fund future growth initiatives or pay down debt.

In contrast, the 2007 fund had a more balanced distribution, with 35% of the investments being in the seed stage, 36% in the early stage, and 29% in the mid-stage. This shift in investment stages indicates a change in the focus of the fund over time, with a greater emphasis on later-stage investments in the 2007 fund.

[1]\n   - Women in STEM jobs are more likely than men to say they have experienced workplace discrimination due to their gender. [2]\n   - Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience discrimination than women in non-STEM jobs. [3]\n   - Women in STEM jobs face more frequent discrimination and sexual harassment compared to their male counterparts. [4]\n\n2. **Specific Experiences**:\n   - The most common forms of gender discrimination experienced by women in STEM jobs include earning less than a man doing the same job, being treated as if they were not competent, experiencing repeated, small slights, and receiving less support from senior leaders. [2, 8]\n\n3. **Subgroups of Women in STEM**:\n   - Women in computer jobs, those in workplaces where men outnumber women, and those with advanced degrees are particularly likely to have concerns about gender equity and to have experienced gender discrimination. [1, 6, 7]\n\n4. **Comparison with Non-STEM Jobs**:\n   - Women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience discrimination compared to women in non-STEM jobs. [3]\n\n5. **Racial and Ethnic Differences**:\n   - Black women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience discrimination and feel that their race/ethnicity has made it harder to succeed in their job. [2]\n\n#### Image Analysis\n1. **Gender Distribution in STEM Jobs**:\n   - Women are underrepresented in STEM jobs, especially in computer and engineering jobs. [image1, image7]\n\n2. **Experiences of Discrimination**:\n   - Women in STEM jobs are significantly more likely to experience gender-related discrimination compared to men in STEM jobs.

The survey was representative of the U.S. adult population by various demographics.\n\n2. **Analysis of Text Quotes**:\n   - **Text Quote [3]**: Democrats are more supportive of making Election Day a national holiday compared to Republicans. Specifically, 53% of Democrats strongly support this policy, while only 29% of Republicans do.\n   - **Text Quote [4]**: Black Americans are more likely to favor policies that make it easier to vote, including making Election Day a national holiday, compared to White, Hispanic, and Asian Americans.\n   - **Text Quote [11]**: White adults are less likely to favor making Election Day a national holiday compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults.\n\n3. **Analysis of Image Quotes**:\n   - **Image Quote [5]**: The survey was conducted to understand views on various voting policies, including making Election Day a national holiday.\n   - **Image Quote [6]**: Shows the percentage of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults who voted in person on Election Day, before Election Day, and voted absentee in 2020. This data can be used to infer general voting behavior but not directly related to views on making Election Day a national holiday.\n   - **Image Quote [7]**: Shows the percentage of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults who voted in person on Election Day, before Election Day, and voted absentee in 2020. Similar to Image Quote [6], this data is more about voting behavior than views on making Election Day a national holiday.\n   - **Image Quote [8]**: Shows the percentage of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults who voted in person on Election Day, before Election Day, and voted absentee in 2020. Again, this data is more about voting behavior than views on making Election Day a national holiday.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the text and image quotes, Black Americans are more likely to support making Election Day a national holiday compared to White, Hispanic, and Asian Americans. This is supported by the data showing that Black adults are more supportive of policies aimed at making it easier to vote.\n\n#### Bullet Points for List-Based Response\n\n- **Text Quote [3]**: Democrats (53%) vs. Republicans (29%) support for making Election Day a national holiday.\n- **Text Quote [4]**: Black Americans (85%) vs. White, Hispanic, and Asian Americans (70%) support for making Election Day a national holiday.\n- **Text Quote [11]**: White adults are less likely to support making Election Day a national holiday compared to Black, Hispanic"}

This change is also reflected in the dramatic changes in the European venture ecosystem, with Germany producing the highest number of venture-backed exits in Europe over the 18 months.

This indicates a growing trend of individuals identifying as Independents rather than aligning with a specific political party. The data also shows that the majority of Independents lean towards either the Democratic or Republican Party, with 17% leaning Democratic and 13% leaning Republican. This suggests that while there is an increase in the number of Independents, many still have a preference for one of the major political parties. The shift in political leanings among Independents may reflect changing attitudes and beliefs within the population, as well as the influence of political events and issues over time.

This suggests that as generations move further from their immigrant roots, the connection to Hispanic heritage diminishes, leading to a decrease in self-identification as Hispanic. The data also shows that the majority of self-identified Hispanics (50%) identify with their country of origin, while only 23% identify as Hispanic/Latino and 23% as American, highlighting the complex and varied nature of Hispanic identity across generations."}

This analysis will explore these changes using both textual data and visual representations.\n\n#### Textual Data Analysis\n1. **Historical Highs and Lows**:\n   - In early 2010, following the failed Christmas Day terrorist attack, 58% of Americans expressed concern that anti-terror policies did not go far enough to protect the country [1].\n   - By 2015, this concern had risen to 56%, indicating a growing sentiment that policies were insufficient [7].\n\n2. **Government Ratings**:\n   - In December 2015, only 46% of Americans rated the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism as very or fairly well, marking a significant drop from 72% in January of the same year [4, 6].\n\n3. **Civil Liberties Concerns**:\n   - Concern over government restrictions on civil liberties fell dramatically after Edward Snowden's NSA surveillance disclosures in 2013. In July 2013, 47% were concerned about civil liberties, compared to 35% concerned that policies did not go far enough [5].\n   - By December 2015, only 28% were concerned about civil liberties, while 56% were more concerned about insufficient protection [7].\n\n4. **Party Differences**:\n   - Republicans and Democrats have both become more likely to say that anti-terror policies do not go far enough since Snowden's disclosures. However, the shift has been more pronounced among Republicans, with 71% now expressing this concern, up from 57% in January and 38% in July 2013 [8, 9].\n\n#### Visual Data Analysis\n1. **Party Concern Trends**:\n   - ![Party Concern Trends](image1) shows that Republican concern about insufficient anti-terror policies has increased significantly from 2004 to 2015, reaching 71% in 2015. Democrats and Independents also show an increase, but less pronounced.\n\n2. **Government Ratings Over Time**:\n   - ![Government Ratings Over Time](image2) illustrates a decline in positive ratings of the government's anti-terror efforts from February 2015 to December 2015, with 35% rating the efforts as very or fairly well in December, down from 36% in February.\n\n3. **Top Concerns**:\n   - ![Top Concerns](image3) highlights that the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria (ISIS"}

Initially, in 2008, both Democrats and Republicans had a relatively high level of confidence in the U.S. economy, with 54% of Democrats and 49% of Republicans believing the U.S. was the world's leading economic power. However, by 2020, this perception had shifted dramatically. Only 44% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans now hold this belief. This indicates a decline in confidence among Democrats and a slight increase among Republicans, reflecting broader political and economic trends during this period. The data suggests that the economic challenges faced by the U.S. during this time, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, have influenced public opinion on the country's economic standing. The shift in perception is particularly notable among Democrats, who have become significantly less confident in the U.S. economy's global leadership. This change may be attributed to various factors, including the economic policies of the Trump administration, the global economic downturn, and the ongoing effects of the pandemic. The data also highlights a growing partisan divide in economic perceptions, with Republicans maintaining a more positive outlook on the U.S. economy compared to Democrats. This divide may reflect differing political ideologies and policy preferences, as well as varying levels of trust in government and economic institutions. Overall, the data provides insight into the evolving public perception of the U.S. economy and its global standing, as well as the role of political affiliation in shaping these views. The decline in confidence among Democrats and the increase among Republicans suggest a complex interplay of economic, political, and social factors that have influenced public opinion over the past decade. The data also highlights the importance of considering the broader context of economic and political developments when analyzing public perceptions of the U.S. economy. The shift in perception among Democrats and Republicans may have implications for future economic policy and political discourse, as well as the broader narrative around the U.S. economy's role in the global landscape.

Initially, the population was very small, with only 130 people in 1870. However, it surged to 8,267 by 1880 and reached its peak at 14,096 in 1890. This rapid increase was due to the influx of settlers from various ethnic backgrounds, including Germans, Swedes, Irish, Bohemians, and Russians, who settled in clusters across the county. The establishment of rural school districts and churches also contributed to the population growth.\n\nHowever, the population began to decline after 1890, with the number of people decreasing to 13,330 in 1900 and further dropping to 9,403 in 2000. This decline was influenced by several historical factors, including the mechanization of farming, which led to the consolidation of farms and a decrease in the number of farms. Additionally, the decline of small towns and the shift of populations to larger cities also contributed to the population decline in Hamilton County. The county's towns, outside of Aurora, struggled to maintain their populations as farm consolidation continued. The population gains in Aurora, which peaked in 2000, were an exception to this trend. Overall, the population trends of Hamilton County were shaped by a combination of factors, including immigration, settlement patterns, and economic changes. ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image2) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image8) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image3) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image4) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image5) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image6) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image7) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image1) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image2) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image3) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image4) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image5) ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image6)"}

About seven-in-ten Democrats (72%) say public health officials have done an excellent or good job in responding to the coronavirus, little changed since March (74%).\n   - **Text Quote [4]**: The public also is less positive about how public health officials are responding to the coronavirus, with virtually all of the decline in positive assessments coming among Republicans.\n   - **Text Quote [5]**: Since then, the share of Republicans who rate public health officials positively has fallen 31 points, from 84% to 53%. Democrats’ views are largely unchanged over that time period (74% in March, 72% today).\n   - **Text Quote [7]**: Positive views of hospitals’ response to COVID-19 cross party lines; wider differences on other officials, Trump.\n   - **Text Quote [8]**: There are much wider partisan differences in views of how public health officials, such as those with the CDC, are responding to the outbreak. Currently, 72% of Democrats and those who lean to the party say public health officials are doing well in responding to the outbreak.\n\n3. **Evidence from Image Quotes**:\n   - **Image Quote [image1]**: Shows a graph indicating the decline in positive views of public health officials among Republicans from 84% in March to 53% in August, while Democrats' views have remained relatively stable around 72%.\n   - **Image Quote [image5]**: Displays a comparison of approval ratings for public health officials, with 72% of Democrats and 53% of Republicans approving.\n   - **Image Quote [image6]**: Shows a trend line for Republicans' approval of public health officials, which has declined from 84% in March to 77% in August.\n\n4. **Analysis and Conclusion**:\n   - The data clearly shows a significant decline in the positive views of public health officials among Republicans, with a drop of 31 points from 84% in March to 53% in August. In contrast, Democrats' views have remained relatively stable, with 72% approving in August, similar to the 74% approval in March"}

The current scenario requires 25 cars, while the most ambitious scenario (increase frequency with HSR) requires 64 cars. The other scenarios fall in between these two extremes, with the Metrolink used cars scenario requiring 30 cars, the electrification scenario requiring 36 cars, and the longer platforms scenario requiring 48 cars.\n\nTherefore, the peak hour train car requirement changes with different scenarios for Caltrain service improvement, with more ambitious scenarios requiring more cars to accommodate increased demand. The specific number of cars required depends on the scenario, with the most ambitious scenario requiring the most cars. \n\nIn conclusion, the peak hour train car requirement for Caltrain service improvement scenarios ranges from 25 cars (current scenario) to 64 cars (increase frequency with HSR scenario), with intermediate scenarios requiring 30, 36, and 48 cars, respectively. \n\n![Caltrain service improvement scenarios and peak hour train car requirements](image4)"}

In 1880, there were 1,597 farms, and by 1950, the number had decreased to 1,453. This decline in the number of farms is likely due to the consolidation of smaller farms into larger ones, as well as the mechanization of agriculture, which allowed for more efficient farming practices and reduced the need for labor. Additionally, the Great Depression and World War II may have also contributed to the decline in the number of farms, as many farmers were forced to sell their land or abandon farming altogether.

Survey respondents were asked how well the statement “the Republican Party really cares about Hispanics” describes their views. A majority (63%) say the statement does not describe their views well, while 21% say somewhat well; only 14% say it describes their views very or extremely well. When it comes to the Democratic Party, the survey finds majorities of Latino adults express positive views of it. Some 71% say the Democratic Party works hard for Latinos’ votes, 63% say it “really cares about Latinos,” and 60% say the Democratic Party represents the interests of people like themselves. By contrast, shares of Latinos say the same of the Republican Party on each statement, though a somewhat greater share (45%) say that the GOP “works hard to earn the votes of Latinos.” Hispanic Democrats have generally positive views of the Democratic Party, though their enthusiasm is lukewarm – 46% say the statement “the Democratic Party really cares about Hispanics” describes their views somewhat well, and a similar share (41%) say it describes their views very or extremely well. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, about a third of conservatives and moderates (34%) and liberals (33%) say the statement “the Democratic Party really cares about Hispanics” describes their views very or extremely well.

This indicates a clear partisan divide in the perception of public health officials' response to the coronavirus outbreak. \n\n![Approval ratings for public health officials](image2) ![Approval ratings for public health officials](image5) ![Approval ratings for public health officials](image7) ![Approval ratings for public health officials](image8)"}

In 2004, about a third (31%) of Hispanics rated their financial condition as excellent or good, while about half (51%) of the general public had a positive view. By 2015, the share of Hispanics who expected their family's financial situation to improve in the next year was 81%, compared to 61% of the general public. This represents a 20 percentage point gap in financial expectations between Hispanics and the general public, which is the largest since the series began. The Pew Research Center's National Survey of Latinos has found that Latinos are consistently more optimistic about their next year's finances than the general public. The gains in economic optimism are similarly large among Latinos ages 30 to 49 and 50 to 64 (16 points for each group). Americans with more education fared better during the Great Recession and were the quickest to recover, a trend reflected in the changes in Latinos' expectations for their family finances. The survey also shows that Hispanics are more upbeat in their financial expectations for the upcoming year than they were in 2008. About eight-in-ten Hispanic adults (81%) say they expect their family's financial situation to improve in the next year, up from 67% who said the same in 2008. By comparison, the U.S. public is not as upbeat – 61% say they expect their family's financial situation to improve, up from 56% who said this in 2008. The 2015 reading includes 23% of Latinos who predict they will fare \"a lot\" better – the largest share of Hispanics to express this upbeat view since 2004 and an increase of 12 percentage points since December 2011. An additional 58% of Latinos expect \"some\" improvement in their family's financial health. Most Hispanics are confident their finances will improve in the next year and also see a bright financial future for their children. Those already prospering are the most likely to be optimistic in their expectations about the next year. Looking ahead, optimism about their family's future economic prospects has risen faster among Latinos than in the population as a whole. The share of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" in the coming year is up 14 percentage points, from 67% in 2008 – during the Great Recession – and in 2011 to 81% in 2015.

In 1992, only 46% of voters felt this way, but by 2016, that number had risen to 57%. This trend is evident in the data from the Pew Research Center, which shows a steady increase in the percentage of voters who believe the press had too much influence on the outcome of the election. The highest percentage was recorded in 2016, indicating a growing concern among voters about the role of the media in elections. This shift in perception could be attributed to various factors, including changes in media ownership, the rise of social media, and increased scrutiny of the press's role in political campaigns. The data suggests that the public's trust in the media's ability to report on elections impartially has diminished over the years. ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) ![The share of voters saying news organizations had too much influence on the outcome of the presidential election has increased over time.](image2) !["}

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **General Impact of Pre-training**:\n   - Pre-training generally improves BLEU scores across various language pairs. This is evident from the data in Table 5 and the results shown in image3. For instance, the BLEU score for GL to EN increases from 2.2 to 13.2 with pre-training, and for PT to EN, it increases from 26.2 to 30.3.\n\n2. **Effect on Low-Resource Languages**:\n   - The gains from pre-training are particularly large for low-resource languages. For example, GL to EN shows a gain of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating that pre-trained embeddings are especially useful for languages with limited training data.\n\n3. **Effect on High-Resource Languages**:\n   - For high-resource languages, the gains from pre-training are more consistent but smaller, typically around 3 BLEU points. This is seen in the data for PT to EN, where the gain is 4.1 BLEU points.\n\n4. **Impact of Language Similarity**:\n   - The similarity between source and target languages affects the efficacy of pre-trained embeddings. The highest gains are observed for language pairs with the highest similarity, such as GL/PT, while the lowest gains are for pairs with the least similarity, such as BE/RU.\n\n5. **Effect of Training Data Size**:\n   - Pre-training helps more when the size of the training data is small. This is demonstrated in image7, where the BLEU score increases more significantly with smaller training set sizes.\n\n6. **Multilingual vs. Bilingual Systems**:\n   - Pre-trained embeddings help more in multilingual systems compared to bilingual systems. This is shown in image5, where the BLEU score for GL to EN increases from 17.5 to 22.4 when using a multilingual system with pre-training and alignment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPre-training significantly improves BLEU scores for different language pairs, with the largest gains observed for low-resource languages and language pairs with high similarity. The impact of pre-training is more pronounced when the training data size is small, and it is particularly effective in multilingual systems.\n\n### Quote Citation\n\n- **Text Quotes**:\n  - [1]: \"Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the translations from GL to EN, which showed one of the largest increases in quantitative numbers.\"\n  - [2]: \"The gains from pre-training in the higher-resource languages are consistent: ≈3 BLEU points for all three language pairs.\"\n  - [3]: \"Our next series of experiments examines this effect in a more controlled environment by down-sampling the training data for the higher-resource languages to 1/"}

As the number of demonstrations increases, the Micro-F1 score generally improves, but the rate of improvement diminishes after a certain point. For instance, in MAVEN-ERE, the Micro-F1 score increases from 17.4% with 1 demonstration to 25.3% with 5 demonstrations, but the improvement is less pronounced beyond 5 demonstrations. Similarly, in CTB, the Micro-F1 score increases from 19.0% with 1 demonstration to 27.0% with 5 demonstrations, with a smaller increase beyond 5 demonstrations. The addition of logical constraints consistently enhances the Micro-F1 performance across different numbers of demonstrations, indicating that logical constraints are beneficial for improving model performance. However, the exact degree of improvement varies depending on the number of demonstrations and the specific dataset. For example, in MAVEN-ERE, the Micro-F1 score with logical constraints increases from 20.8% with 1 demonstration to 25.3% with 5 demonstrations, while in CTB, it increases from 20.0% with 1 demonstration to 27.0% with 5 demonstrations. Overall, the results suggest that a moderate number of demonstrations (around 5) combined with logical constraints can yield the best performance in terms of Micro-F1 score. However, the exact optimal number of demonstrations may vary depending on the specific dataset and the complexity of the task. Additionally, the results also highlight the importance of carefully selecting the number of demonstrations and incorporating logical constraints to achieve the best possible performance.  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image1)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image4)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image5)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image6)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image7)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image8)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image9)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image10)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image11)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image12)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image13)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image14)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations and logical constraints](image15)  ![Micro-F1 performance with different numbers of demonstrations"}

This is evident from the following observations:\n\n1. **Overall Performance**: The micro-F1 score increases from 31.9 to 40.7 with LLM reranking, as shown in image3. This represents an 8.8 point improvement, which is a substantial gain.\n\n2. **Confidence Level Analysis**: Image6 provides a detailed breakdown of the micro-F1 performance across different confidence levels for the FewNERD dataset. The graph shows that:\n   - For low confidence scores (0.15 to 0.35), the micro-F1 score with LLM reranking is consistently higher than without LLM reranking.\n   - For medium confidence scores (0.35 to 0.65), the improvement is more pronounced, with the micro-F1 score increasing significantly.\n   - For high confidence scores (0.65 to 0.95), the improvement is still noticeable, although the gap between with and without LLM reranking narrows slightly.\n\n3. **Detailed Confidence Score Breakdown**: The graph in image6 illustrates that the largest gains in micro-F1 score are observed in the medium confidence range (approximately 0.45 to 0.65). This suggests that LLM reranking is particularly effective in improving the performance on samples that are moderately difficult.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Datasets**: The performance improvement pattern observed in FewNERD is consistent with other datasets like TACREv and ACE05, as shown in image6. This indicates that LLM reranking is a robust strategy for enhancing micro-F1 performance across different datasets and confidence levels.\n\nIn conclusion, LLM reranking consistently enhances the micro-F1 performance across various confidence levels for the FewNERD dataset, with the most significant improvements observed in the medium confidence range. This demonstrates the effectiveness of LLM reranking in addressing the challenges posed by moderately difficult samples.\n\n![Micro-F1 performance across different confidence levels for FewNERD](image6)"}

For entity extraction, the F1 score improves with the number of iterations, reaching its peak at the second iteration (N=2) as shown in Figure 3a.

For relation extraction, the F1 score also improves with iterations, peaking at the second iteration (M=2) as depicted in Figure 3b. This suggests that relation propagation through multiple iterations refines the model's capability to detect relationships between entities. The graphs in Figure 3 illustrate these trends, showing that both entity and relation extraction tasks benefit from iterative processing, with the optimal number of iterations being two for both tasks.

This feedback is then used to refine the output, ensuring higher accuracy and relevance. The process involves a language model generating an output, which is then evaluated by a critic model. The critic model uses feedback from external sources such as knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines to identify errors or areas for improvement. This feedback is then used to refine the output, resulting in a more accurate and relevant final output. The strategy is particularly useful in tasks such as question answering, code generation, and toxicity detection, where factual accuracy and relevance are crucial. The use of external feedback also allows for more diverse and informative feedback, which can lead to better refinement of the output.

The tree traversal method, as outlined in [8], involves a layer-by-layer approach where the top-k most relevant root nodes are selected based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. This process is repeated at each subsequent layer, progressively focusing on finer details as it descends through the lower layers. The algorithm's steps are designed to offer control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved by adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer.\n\nIn contrast, the collapsed tree approach, described in [10], offers a simpler way to search for relevant information by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously. Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. This approach allows for a more flexible retrieval process, as it can retrieve information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question, unlike the tree traversal method which maintains a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details regardless of the question.\n\nThe differences between these two methods are visually represented in image3, which illustrates the Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval processes. The tree traversal method is shown to select nodes layer-by-layer, while the collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones. This visual comparison helps to highlight the unique advantages and trade-offs of each querying mechanism. The collapsed tree approach is generally found to perform better, as indicated in [3], due to its greater flexibility in offering the correct level of granularity for a given question. This is further supported by the performance metrics shown in image1, where models using the collapsed tree approach consistently outperform those using tree traversal.

This is done by using a self-attention module followed by an FFN block. The output of this module is fed to an output classifier which predicts the center token. The combination layers allow the model to access information about the entire input surrounding the current target token, which is beneficial for tasks that label each token, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). This is supported by the text in [5] and the visual representation in image6 and image7. The combination of forward and backward states is crucial for the model to predict each token of an input sentence given all surrounding tokens, as mentioned in [6]. The combination layers are part of the fine-tuning process for downstream tasks, as described in [3]. The model's ability to predict every single token in a sequence is a key feature that distinguishes it from other models like BERT, which multi-tasks between predicting a subset of masked input tokens and a next sentence prediction task. The combination layers are also important for the model's performance on tasks that require access to the full context, such as NER, as mentioned in [10]. The combination of forward and backward states is achieved by masking the states that contain information about the current target word in the final self-attention block during training, as described in [11].

{"q_id": 1309, "model": "OpenGVLab/InternVL2_5-38B", "in_tok": 0, "out_tok": 0, "total_tok": 0, "response": "### Answer\n\nThe relation extraction performance varies with the number of entities in a sentence, as shown in the provided figure. The performance of the model without relation propagation (DyGIE—RelProp) decreases as the number of entities in a sentence increases, while the performance of the model with relation propagation (DyGIE) remains relatively stable. This indicates that relation propagation helps the model to handle sentences with more entities, improving its performance in such cases.\n\nThe implications of utilizing relation propagation are significant. It allows the model to learn useful information from broader context, enhancing interaction across tasks. This is particularly beneficial in sentences with multiple relation instances across different entities, which is a common scenario in many datasets. The addition of relation propagation adds only a small computation cost to inference, making it a practical and effective approach for improving relation extraction performance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, relation propagation is a valuable technique for improving relation extraction performance, especially in sentences with more entities. It helps the model to learn from broader context and enhances interaction across tasks, leading to better performance in relation extraction tasks. The added computation cost is small relative to the baseline span-based model, making it a practical and effective approach for improving relation extraction performance. \n\n![Relation extraction performance varies with the number of entities in a sentence](image7) \n![Relation extraction performance with and without relation propagation](image8) \n\n### References\n\n- [1] Figure 4 shows relation scores as a function of number of entities in sentence for DyGIE and DyGIE without relation propagation on ACE05.\n- [2] We have introduced DyGIE as a general information extraction framework, and have demonstrated that our system achieves state-of-the-art results on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks across a diverse range of domains.\n- [3] Makoto Miwa and Mohit Bansal. 2016.

However, the presence of distractors, even when carefully selected, does not substantially improve the model's accuracy, suggesting that the model struggles with multi-hop reasoning when distractors are present. This implies that the model's performance is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the input data, and that further research is needed to develop more effective methods for distractor collection and multi-hop reasoning. The implications for model performance are that the model may not be able to generalize well to new, unseen data, and that it may require additional training or fine-tuning to improve its accuracy in real-world applications.

A larger LSTM size can potentially improve the model's performance, but it also increases the computational cost. Therefore, the choice of LSTM size should be carefully considered based on the specific requirements of the task and the available computational resources.

However, since these links are insufficient for capturing all mentions, additional links to Wikidata are identified using the neural-el entity linker, and coreferences are identified using Stanford CoreNLP to cover pronouns, nominals, and other tokens missed by the linker. This process ensures that the entities and their relationships are accurately represented in the annotation.

These modules utilize InstructGPT for in-context learning, as mentioned in the text quotes [2] and [7]. The claim verifier assesses whether sufficient information has been gathered to verify the claim, the question generator generates the next relevant question needed for verifying the claim, and the QA validator evaluates the usefulness of the generated (Q, A) pair. The use of InstructGPT in these modules allows the system to efficiently learn tasks and adapt to different fact-checking scenarios. The text quote [12] also highlights the importance of these modules in guiding the model's reasoning process and providing a transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process. The image quotes, particularly image2, illustrate the architecture of the system and the role of these modules in the overall process. The image quotes also show the different implementations of the QA module, including the retriever-reader model, the FLAN-T5 model, and the GPT3-based reciter-reader model, which further enhance the flexibility and robustness of the system. The text quote [11] mentions the user-friendly interface provided by the system, which allows users to customize the design of each module and visualize the detailed question-guided reasoning process. The image quotes, particularly image5, demonstrate the user interface and the step-by-step process of fact-checking a claim, including the generation of questions, retrieval of evidence, and validation of the QA pairs.

It covers 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, including Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, and over 183 subfields. The detailed subject coverage and statistics are detailed in Figure 3. The questions in our benchmark were manually collected by a team of 50 college students (including coauthors) from various disciplines and subjects, drawing from online sources, textbooks, and lecture materials. \n\nThe MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges to multimodal foundation models, as detailed in Figure 1. Among these, we particularly highlight the challenge stemming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge. This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model’s adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, calling for an advanced approach that integrates advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge. \n\nThe MMMU benchmark underscores both the progress and the challenges in multimodal understanding and reasoning. While GPT-4V leads in performance, the overall results indicate substantial room for improvement, especially in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge. \n\nIn terms of breadth and depth, the MMMU benchmark is unique in its comprehensive coverage of college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. In the depth aspect, the previous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, our benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. \n\nThe implications for its use in evaluating large multimodal models are significant. The MMMU benchmark provides a rigorous and demanding standard for evaluating the capabilities of large multimodal models. It highlights the need for models to have both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and the ability to reason with subject-specific knowledge. The benchmark also underscores the importance of evaluating models across a broad range of tasks and domains, rather than focusing on a narrow set of skills. \n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark is a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large multimodal models. It provides a rigorous and demanding standard for evaluating the capabilities of models, and highlights the need for models to have both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and the ability to reason with subject-specific knowledge.

This process is illustrated in Figure 2, where the model picks 'Super Mario Land' as the parent entity and follows the 'Publisher' relation to select 'Nintendo' as the entity to render. When rendering 'Nintendo' as a token, the model has an expanded vocabulary available to it, containing the standard vocabulary along with all word types in any of the aliases of the entity. This allows the model to generate the correct token for the 'published by' context. The model uses a distribution over the original vocabulary and a vocabulary containing all the tokens that appear in aliases of the entity to compute the scores over the original vocabulary. The scores are computed using a learned weight matrix that projects the concatenated vector into the same vector space as the hidden state. The model then selects the entity with the highest score as the entity to render. This process is described in detail in Section 4 of the paper. The model's ability to dynamically decide the facts to incorporate from the knowledge graph, guided by the discourse, is a key feature that allows it to generate coherent and factual text. The model's performance on fact completion tasks is evaluated using perplexity of held-out corpus, accuracy on fact completion, and an illustration of how the model uses the knowledge graph.

This ensures that the most relevant nodes are selected at each layer, forming a cohesive context for the query. \n\n![RAPTOR Tree Structure](image1)  \n![Tree Traversal Algorithm](image2)  \n![Collapsed Tree Algorithm](image4)  \n\nBy following this pseudo code, the tree traversal method effectively narrows down the relevant information from the RAPTOR tree, ensuring that the retrieved context is both specific and comprehensive. \n\n![Comparison of RAPTOR and DPR](image5)  \n![Retrieval Process](image6)  \n\nThis approach is particularly useful for multi-hop questions, as it allows for the retrieval of information from different layers of the tree, providing a more nuanced and detailed answer. \n\n!["}

The model then uses cosine similarity to calculate the relevance score between the aggregated representation of the dialogue context and the candidate values. This process is illustrated in the figure, where the dialogue context and domain-slot pairs are encoded by BERT, and the cosine similarity matching is used to find the most relevant candidate values. The model also employs a slot gate to handle special types of values, using a two-way linear mapping to find text spans for non-categorical slots and selecting the most plausible values from the picklists for categorical slots based on the contextual representation. This approach allows the model to effectively handle both categorical and non-categorical slots, improving its performance in dialog state tracking tasks. The effectiveness of this model design is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other BERT-related methods, as shown in the tables.

It involves the recognition of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, its removal, and the subsequent addition of new normal bases by a specific polymerase enzyme, followed by the restoration of the phosphodiester bonds and the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand by DNA ligase.\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This repair system is highly conserved among species and can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts of DNA. It is more complicated in higher eukaryotes than in prokaryotes.\n\n3. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly repairs UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyltransferase proteins, respectively. It does not involve incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA.\n\n4. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: The MMR system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins, and signal discrimination factors to recognize the mutated strand and locate the site of the mismatched pair. This is followed by removal of the mutated sequence by an endonuclease, addition of new pairs by DNA polymerase, and final regain of the DNA double-stranded structure by DNA ligases.\n\n5. **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism aims primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA, which are the most devastating mutation-induced lesions of DNA. It can lead to loss of genetic information and chromosomal instabilities, including chromosome breakage syndromes and carcinogenesis. Double-strand breaks can be caused either endogenously during DNA replication due to replication errors or exogenously by ionizing radiation. Recombination repair mechanisms consist of many various steps, including end resection, strand invasion, DNA repair synthesis, branch migration, and Holliday junction resolution. They include at least two different repair pathways: homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair. HR repair mechanism is the accurate pathway and makes use of undamaged homologous DNA as a template for repair. Non-homologous end-joining repair mechanism directly ligates two double-strand break ends together, although it is efficient, it is prone to loss of genetic information at the ligation sites. There are many anti-recombination mechanisms to suppress excessive recombination that might lead to loss of genetic information and genomic instability. \n\nIn summary, Figure 11 demonstrates the following DNA repair mechanisms: Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Direct Reversal Repair, Mismatch"}

Here's a detailed breakdown of each stage:\n\n1. **Problem Formulation**:\n   - **Input**: The model receives a logical reasoning problem described in natural language, along with a goal in the form of a multiple-choice or free-form question.\n   - **Process**: The model uses a large language model (LLM) to translate the problem and the goal into a task-specific symbolic language. This involves converting the natural language problem into a symbolic representation that can be understood by a symbolic solver.\n   - **Output**: A symbolic formulation of the problem.\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**:\n   - **Input**: The symbolic formulation generated in the Problem Formulation stage.\n   - **Process**: The model calls a deterministic symbolic solver, such as a logic programming engine, to obtain a symbolic-represented answer. This solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation to derive the answer.\n   - **Output**: A symbolic-represented answer.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - **Input**: The symbolic-represented answer from the Symbolic Reasoning stage.\n   - **Process**: An LLM or rule-based result interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into natural language. This step ensures that the final answer is understandable to humans.\n   - **Output**: The final answer in natural language.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model effectively solves logical reasoning problems by leveraging the strengths of both large language models and symbolic solvers. By translating natural language problems into symbolic representations, performing deterministic reasoning, and then interpreting the results back into natural language, the model achieves a high level of accuracy and faithfulness in its responses. This approach significantly improves performance over pure LLMs and chain-of-thought prompting techniques, as demonstrated by the results on various logical reasoning datasets. \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM Model Flow](image5) \n\n![LOGIC-LM"}

The improvements are statistically significant, as indicated by the asterisks in the table. This suggests that incorporating speaker-gender tags during the training of NMT systems can lead to better performance, especially in languages that express grammatical gender agreement. The results are particularly notable for the female test set, where the EN-TAG system shows the largest improvement, supporting the hypothesis that the gender-informed system can better handle gender-related issues in translation. The improvements are not merely due to better morphological agreement, as the EN-TAG system also shows differences in word choices, as observed in the analysis of specific translations. The EN-TAG system's performance is further supported by the BLEU scores in Table 2, which show improvements for the NMT systems enriched with a gender tag over the baseline systems for French, Italian, Portuguese, and Greek. The Danish (EN-DA) enriched NMT system also achieves a significant BLEU improvement, indicating that the approach can be effective for various language pairs.

According to the provided data:\n\n- **D1**: The number of neutral examples is relatively high, with 637 neutral examples in the training set and 196 in the test set.\n- **D2**: The number of neutral examples is moderate, with 464 neutral examples in the training set and 169 in the test set.\n- **D3**: The number of neutral examples is very low, with only 50 neutral examples in the training set and 35 in the test set.\n- **D4**: The number of neutral examples is also very low, with only 88 neutral examples in the training set and 38 in the test set.\n\nThis variation in the distribution of neutral examples is crucial for understanding the performance of sentiment classification models, as it affects the model's ability to learn and generalize neutral sentiment. The low number of neutral examples in D3 and D4 makes it particularly challenging for models to accurately predict neutral sentiment, as indicated by the significant improvements in macro-F1 scores when using document-level knowledge to supplement the training data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe distribution of neutral examples is highest in D1, moderate in D2, and very low in D3 and D4. This distribution has a significant impact on the performance of sentiment classification models, particularly in their ability to accurately predict neutral sentiment.

This is achieved through two main techniques: cropping and blurring. \n\n1. **Cropping**: The image is divided into regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates. This step ensures that the objects of interest are isolated from the rest of the image, allowing the model to concentrate on these specific areas. By cropping the image, the model can better understand the context and features of the objects within the bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Blurring**: The non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest are blurred. This technique helps to direct the model's attention towards the relevant objects, making it easier for the model to identify and classify them. Blurring reduces the noise and distractions from the background, thereby improving the model's ability to recognize objects in a zero-shot setting.\n\nThese pre-processing steps are crucial for the zero-shot recognition system as they prepare the input images in a way that maximizes the model's performance in identifying and classifying objects without prior training on those specific objects.

This work paved the way for quantitatively comparing not only words with regard to their meaning, but also different stages in the development of word meaning over time. [1]\n\n2. **2011**: The release of the Google Books Ngrams corpus played an important role in the development of the field and spurred work on the new discipline of 'culturomics,' studying human culture through digital media. Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) used this dataset to detect differences in word usage and meaning across 50-year time spans, while Gulordava and Baroni (2011) compared word meanings in the 1960s and in the 1990s, achieving good correlation with human judgments. [12]\n\n3. **2012**: The work of Kim et al. (2014) was seminal in the sense that it is arguably the first one employing prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts. Particularly, they used incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS). [10]\n\n4. **2013**: The availability of large corpora and the development of computational semantics have given rise to a number of research initiatives trying to capture diachronic semantic shifts in a data-driven way. Word embeddings have become a widely used input representation for this task. [5]\n\n5. **2014**: The work of Kim et al.

The bounding boxes are labeled as bbox1, bbox2, and bbox3, indicating that there are three distinct objects being detected and processed. This is part of the pre-processing step where the image is divided into regions of interest for further analysis. The bounding boxes help in isolating the objects from the rest of the image, which is crucial for accurate object detection and recognition. The objects within these bounding boxes are then used to create embeddings that are stored in the memory for retrieval and ranking during the inference process.

The bounding boxes are a key component of the pre-processing step, as they define the regions of interest that will be used to generate the embeddings for the memory. The use of bounding boxes allows the model to handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision and flexibility, as it can focus on the specific objects within the image rather than the entire image. This is particularly important for zero-shot recognition, where the model must be able to recognize objects that it has not seen before.

It outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.\n   - The text also mentions that SPECTER does not require fine-tuning, which makes its paper embeddings less costly to use. However, it compares the performance of SPECTER with fine-tuned SciBERT models on various tasks.\n\n2. **Image Analysis**:\n   - **Image 1**: This table shows the performance of SPECTER and other models across different tasks (CLS, USR, CITE, REC) and their average scores.

This is because the abstract provides crucial information about the document's content, which is essential for understanding its relatedness to other documents.\n  \n- **Authors**: Adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance. This could be due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. Additionally, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names, leading to noisy correlations.\n  \n- **Venues**: Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification. This is because venues are not as informative as other features for most tasks, but they can provide useful information for document classification.\n  \n- **Hard Negatives**: The inclusion of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is important for performance. Using only easy negatives reduces performance on all tasks.\n  \n- **BERT-Large vs. SciBERT**: Using a strong general-domain language model (BERT-Large) instead of SciBERT in SPECTER reduces performance considerably. This is reasonable because unlike BERT-Large, SciBERT is pretrained on scientific text, making it more suitable for the tasks at hand.\n  \n- **Citation Graph**: The citation graph is a critical component of the SPECTER model. Removing this and using a vanilla SciBERT results in decreased performance on all tasks. This is because the citation graph provides a powerful signal of document-level relatedness, which is essential for generating accurate document-level embeddings.\n  \n- **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning SciBERT directly on task-specific signals (e.g., user activity) instead of citations results in generally inferior performance compared to using the fixed representations from SPECTER. This is because the citation graph provides a more comprehensive and accurate signal of document-level relatedness than task-specific signals.\n  \n- **Multitask Training**: Training jointly on all task-specific training data sources in a multitask training process results in improved performance compared to training on a single task. This is because multitask training allows the model to learn more generalizable representations that can be applied to multiple tasks.\n  \n- **Recommendation Task**: For the recommendation task, the differences in method scores are generally smaller. This is because for this task, the embeddings are used along with several other informative features in the ranking model, meaning that embedding variants have less opportunity for impact on overall performance.\n  \n- **User Activity Prediction**: SPECTER achieves a MAP score of 83.8 on the co-view task and 84.5 on co-read, improving over the best baseline (Citeomatic in this case) by 2.7 and 4.0 points, respectively.

This indicates that WinoMT has the highest number of instances, with a nearly equal distribution between male and female genders. The WinoBias dataset also has a balanced distribution, while Winogender has the lowest number of instances. This distribution is important for evaluating gender bias in machine translation, as it allows for a controlled experiment environment and helps to identify any biases in the translation models. The datasets are composed of synthetic English source-side examples, which may introduce some artificial biases in the data and evaluation.

The highest performance is observed when the model is trained and tested on the original dataset, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.671, a median of 0.712, and a maximum of 0.770. When trained and tested on the adversarial dataset, the performance drops significantly, with a mean accuracy of 0.504, a median of 0.505, and a maximum of 0.533. This indicates that the adversarial dataset effectively eliminates the spurious statistical cues that the BERT model exploits in the original dataset. The performance also varies when different components of the argument (claim, reason, warrant) are considered separately, with the highest performance observed when all components are included. This suggests that the BERT model's performance is highly dependent on the presence of these components in the argument. The performance also varies when different baselines (BoV, BiLSTM) are used, with the BERT model consistently outperforming these baselines. This suggests that the BERT model's performance is not solely due to the use of these baselines, but rather due to its ability to exploit the spurious statistical cues in the dataset. The performance also varies when different random seeds are used, with the BERT model's performance being highly dependent on the choice of random seed. This suggests that the BERT model's performance is highly dependent on the specific data points that are included in the training and test sets. The performance also varies when different hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout regularization) are used, with the BERT model's performance being highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters. This suggests that the BERT model's performance is highly dependent on the specific settings of these hyperparameters.

The Technology Consulting team, for instance, has a strong presence in the GCC region, focusing on digital strategies and implementation for clients in both public and private sectors. This team likely has a smaller number of offices and employees compared to the global scale of PwC's other divisions, but its expertise is highly specialized and targeted towards the digital transformation of businesses in the Middle East.\n\nThe Deals division, on the other hand, offers a graduate program tailored for an international environment, suggesting a broader reach and more extensive network of offices and employees. This division supports clients through mergers, acquisitions, and disposals, indicating a more global scope in terms of country reach and a larger number of offices and employees to handle the complexity of such transactions.\n\nThe Infrastructure, Real Estate, and Capital Projects team combines real estate industry expertise with deep subject matter knowledge, engineers with accountants, and global knowledge with local presence. This team likely has a significant number of offices and employees, given the complexity and scale of the projects they handle, and a wide country reach to cater to the global nature of infrastructure and real estate projects.\n\nThe Health division is undergoing a transformation in the Middle East region, working in partnership with clients to guide and support them on this journey. This division likely has a smaller number of offices and employees compared to the global scale of PwC's other divisions, but its focus on healthcare means it has a specialized team with deep sector insights and expertise.\n\nThe Legal division is the largest legal network in the world with over 4,000 lawyers in over 100 countries, making it the only Big 4 firm in the Middle East with an established legal offering. This division likely has a significant number of offices and employees, given the global scale of its operations and the complexity of legal services.\n\nIn summary, PwC's consulting services differ in terms of office presence, employee size, and country reach across its various divisions, with some divisions having a more specialized focus and smaller scale, while others have a broader reach and larger scale. The specific details of office presence, employee size, and country reach for each division are not provided in the text quotes, but the descriptions suggest a range of sizes and scopes depending on the division's focus and the nature of its services. ![PwC's consulting services vary significantly across its divisions in terms of office presence, employee size, and country reach](image1) ![PwC's consulting services vary significantly across its divisions in terms of office presence, employee size, and country reach](image2) ![PwC's consulting services vary significantly across its divisions in terms of office presence, employee size, and country reach](image3) ![PwC's consulting services vary significantly across its divisions in terms of office presence, employee size, and country reach](image4) ![PwC's consulting"}

It includes creating a strong LinkedIn profile, using InMail to reach out to candidates, and understanding the best practices for engaging talent on the platform.\n\n2. **Building a Talent Pipeline: Talent Pipeline and Pipelining**\n   - This area focuses on building and managing a talent pipeline. It includes understanding how to use LinkedIn's Talent Pipeline feature to source and manage candidates, as well as how to effectively pipeline candidates for future opportunities.\n\n3. **Posting Jobs: Jobs**\n   - This area involves understanding how to post jobs on LinkedIn and how to optimize job postings for maximum visibility and engagement.

The areas of overlap represent the intersection of these sets, which can be used to understand how Boolean search results work.\n\n- **Engineering AND Java NOT Manager**: This search string would return results that are in the intersection of the Engineering and Java sets, but not in the Manager set. This means that the results would include candidates who have experience in both Engineering and Java, but not in Management.\n\nUnderstanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings is a fundamental skill for all talent acquisition professionals, as it allows them to efficiently search for candidates with specific skills and experience. By understanding how Boolean search results work through a Venn diagram, candidates can better understand how to construct search strings that will return the most relevant results for their recruiting needs.\n\nIn conclusion, candidates should focus on the areas of engaging talent, building a talent pipeline, posting jobs, and maximizing efficiency for the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification exam.

There are different options of clocking the teaching hours, as listed in Table 1. The ISEP Buddy Scheme is one of the options, and it requires students to participate in the Buddy System. For example, students from the August 2015 intake will take on the roles of senior buddies to the freshmen of the subsequent August 2016 intake. The senior must meet with the freshmen at least 2 times in that academic year (~1x per semester) and obtain satisfactory feedback from the freshmen (Note: Only 10 hours can be claimed regardless how many freshmen the senior has). The Online Buddy Report Form is applicable to both the Senior & Freshmen who are in the Buddy program; Submission of the form MUST be made once every semester in the freshmen’s first year of study only. Deadline to submit the form in Semester 1 is 01 July and Semester 2 is 02 January; late submissions will not be accepted and incomplete forms received after the deadline of each semester will be considered as void.

The 8051AH has a thermal resistance of 45°C/W, while the 8751BH has a thermal resistance of 36°C/W. This means that the 8751BH can dissipate heat more efficiently than the 8051AH. The difference in thermal resistance is due to the different manufacturing processes used for the two parts. The 8051AH is manufactured on P414.1, an HMOS II process, while the 8751BH is manufactured on P422, an HMOS-E process. The HMOS-E process is more advanced and allows for better heat dissipation. Therefore, the 8751BH is better suited for applications that require high power dissipation. ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal resistance comparison](image5) ![Manufacturing process comparison](image8) ![Thermal"}

The Analytics Value Chain, as depicted in image2, outlines a sequential process starting from data collection, moving through reporting, analysis, action, and finally to value. This chain emphasizes the importance of each step in the process, highlighting that value is only achieved when the entire chain is completed.\n\nThe Levels of Analytics, shown in image7, provide a framework for understanding the different types of analytics that can be applied at various stages of the Analytics Value Chain. The Levels of Analytics range from standard reports to optimization, each level adding more depth and complexity to the analysis. By applying the appropriate level of analytics at each stage of the value chain, organizations can ensure that they are extracting the maximum value from their data.\n\nFor example, at the reporting stage of the Analytics Value Chain, standard reports (Level 1) can be used to provide a basic understanding of what has happened. As the process moves to analysis, more advanced levels of analytics such as statistical analysis (Level 4) and predictive modeling (Level 6) can be applied to understand why something happened and what might happen in the future. Finally, at the action stage, optimization (Level 7) can be used to determine the best course of action to take based on the insights gained from the analysis.\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics complement each other by providing a structured approach to transforming data into actionable insights and value. By understanding the different stages of the value chain and the appropriate level of analytics to apply at each stage, organizations can ensure that they are maximizing the value of their data."}

The alignment at the metaphase plate is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to the daughter cells. The attachment of the centromeres to the spindle fibers ensures that the chromosomes are pulled apart correctly during the division process. The breakdown of the nuclear envelope allows the chromosomes to move freely, and the formation of the spindle apparatus is essential for the proper separation of the chromosomes.

This is depicted in image2, where the nuclear envelope is shown forming around the chromosomes.\n   - **Chromatin Decondensation**: The chromosomes begin to uncoil and return to their less condensed state, becoming chromatin again. This is visible in image2, where the chromosomes are shown in a less condensed form.\n   - **Nucleolus Reformation**: The nucleolus, which disassembled during prophase, reappears as the nuclear envelope reforms. This is also shown in image2.\n\n2. **Cytokinesis**:\n   - **Cell Membrane Inward Growth**: In animal cells, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cell into two daughter cells. This is illustrated in image1, where the cell membrane is shown growing inward.\n   - **Formation of the Cleavage Furrow**: The inward growth of the plasma membrane creates a cleavage furrow, which deepens until the cell is pinched into two separate cells. This is depicted in image3, where the cleavage furrow is clearly visible.\n   - **Formation of the Cell Plate**: In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle from vesicles containing cell wall material. The cell plate grows outward to reach the edges, dividing the contents into two cells. This process is shown in image5, where the cell plate is forming and expanding.\n\n3. **Final Stages**:\n   - **Completion of Cytokinesis**: The cell is fully divided into two daughter cells, each with its own nucleus and cytoplasm. This is shown in image6, where the two daughter cells are clearly separated.\n\nIn summary, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear envelope reforms, chromosomes decondense, the nucleolus reappears, and the cell divides into two daughter cells through the inward growth of the plasma membrane in animal cells or the formation of a cell plate in plant cells. This process is crucial for the completion of cell division and the production of two genetically identical daughter cells. \n\n![Nuclear envelope forming around chromosomes](image2)\n![Chromosomes in less condensed form](image2)\n![Nucleolus reformation](image2)\n![Plasma membrane growing inward](image1)\n![Cleavage furrow formation](image3)\n![Cell plate formation](image5)\n![Two daughter cells separated](image6)"}

In a monohybrid cross, such as the one between purple and white flowers, the F1 generation is heterozygous (Pp) and all exhibit the dominant phenotype (purple flowers). When these F1 plants are crossed, the F2 generation shows a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers and a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio of PP, Pp, and pp. This occurs because each parent contributes one allele to the offspring, and the alleles segregate independently during gamete formation. The dominant allele (P) masks the effect of the recessive allele (p) in the heterozygous condition, resulting in the observed ratios. ![Mendelian inheritance in pea plants](image1) ![Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in F2 generation](image4) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image5) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image7) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples](image8) ![Genotype and phenotype examples"}

The genotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with one plant having the genotype PP, two plants having the genotype Pp, and one plant having the genotype pp. This is consistent with Mendel's laws of inheritance, where the dominant trait (purple flowers) is expressed in the heterozygous and homozygous dominant individuals, while the recessive trait (white flowers) is only expressed in the homozygous recessive individuals. The phenotypic ratio of 3:1 and the genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 are characteristic of a monohybrid cross, where one trait is being studied and the alleles are segregating independently.

Here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n### Text Analysis\n- **Summary of Changes**: The text quotes indicate that Belize has updated its laws regarding blasphemy and defamation. Specifically, the Defamation Act of 2022, No. 15 of 2022, has replaced the previous Libel and Defamation Act, ch. 169, revised laws of Belize 2020.\n- **Key Provisions**: The new Defamation Act includes provisions that protect the publication of news in a news medium, provided it is made without malice. It also specifies that certain matters, such as those of public concern and those intended for the public benefit, are privileged and not subject to defamation claims.\n\n### Image Analysis\n- **Image 4**: The image provides a detailed view of the Defamation Act, 2022, No. 15 of 2022, § 18. It outlines that unless a publication is made with malice, it is privileged under the Act. This section also clarifies that the Act does not protect the publication of matters prohibited by law or those not of public concern.\n- **Image 6**: This image further elaborates on the Defamation Act, 2022, No. 15 of 2022, § 489. It states that publishing blasphemous or obscene material is punishable by imprisonment for up to two years, unless the publication is an opinion on a religious subject expressed in good faith and in decent language.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe legal landscape for blasphemy and defamation in Belize has evolved to include more nuanced protections for freedom of expression, particularly in the context of news reporting and public interest matters. The new Defamation Act emphasizes the importance of good faith and public benefit in determining the legality of publications, while still maintaining penalties for blasphemous or obscene content.\n\n### Direct Answer\nThe legal landscape for blasphemy and defamation in Belize has changed to include protections for news publications made without malice and to emphasize the importance of public concern and public benefit in defamation cases. The Defamation Act of 2022, No. 15 of 2022, has replaced the previous Libel and Defamation Act, providing clearer guidelines on what constitutes defamation and what is privileged under the law. \n\n![Defamation Act of 2022, No. 15 of 2022, § 18](image4)\n![Defamation Act of 2022, No. 15 of 2022, § 489](image6)"}

Structured markup errors, as shown in image7, can lead to a loss of potential benefits from schema markup, which is used to provide search engines with additional information about the content of a webpage. This can result in missed opportunities for rich snippets, which can improve click-through rates and user engagement. Meta description issues, as depicted in image3, can affect how a webpage is represented in search engine results pages (SERPs). Duplicate, long, or short meta descriptions can confuse search engines and users, leading to lower click-through rates and potentially harming the website's credibility. Both issues can negatively affect a website's visibility and ranking in search results, ultimately impacting its SEO performance."}

This indicates a need for a unified leadership to drive the integration process.\n\n2. **Siloed Business Lines**: 46% of respondents mentioned that their organizations are too siloed by business line, product, or brand. This suggests that breaking down these silos is crucial for a holistic customer management approach.\n\n3. **Resource Constraints**: 36% of respondents stated that they lack the necessary resources to support an integrated approach. This highlights the importance of allocating sufficient resources to implement and sustain such initiatives.\n\n4. **Technical Infrastructure**: 28% of respondents reported that they do not have the technical infrastructure to support an integrated approach. This underscores the need for robust technological solutions to facilitate data integration and analysis.\n\n5. **Measurement Challenges**: 27% of respondents found it difficult to measure the influence of their activities on customer behavior. This points to the necessity of developing effective metrics and tools to track and analyze customer interactions.\n\n6. **Other Barriers**: 7% of respondents identified other barriers not specified in the survey. These could include cultural resistance, lack of clear roles and responsibilities, or over-engineering solutions.\n\nIn summary, the primary barriers to adopting an integrated customer management approach are organizational silos, resource limitations, technical infrastructure gaps, and challenges in measuring customer behavior. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort to break down silos, allocate resources, invest in technology, and develop effective measurement tools. \n\n![Barriers to Integrated Customer Management](image6)"}

This method is often criticized for not accurately reflecting the contribution of earlier touchpoints in the customer journey. However, it remains popular due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. Other methods, such as fractional attribution and inferred attribution, are less commonly used but can provide a more nuanced understanding of the customer journey and the role of different touchpoints in driving conversions.

In 2005, the largest portion of time was spent with family and friends (35%), followed by watching films (20%), and shopping (10%). By 2010, the time spent with family and friends decreased to 21%, while the time spent on the internet increased to 22%. This suggests a trend towards more solitary activities, possibly due to the rise of digital media and the internet.\n\nIn relation to banana exports, the data from image3 shows a fluctuating trend over the years. The highest export volumes were recorded in 1999 and 2000, with a significant drop in 2001. The export volumes then gradually increased again until 2005, followed by a slight decrease in 2006 and a recovery in 2007. The data for 2008 and 2009 is not available, but the overall trend suggests a recovery in banana exports by 2010.\n\nThe change in the distribution of activities and the trend in banana exports do not have a direct correlation. However, it is possible that the increase in internet usage could have affected the banana export industry by changing consumer behavior and preferences. For example, the rise of online shopping could have led to an increase in demand for bananas, which could have contributed to the recovery in exports. Alternatively, the decrease in time spent with family and friends could have led to a decrease in demand for bananas, which could have contributed to the drop in exports in 2001. However, without more data, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the relationship between these two trends. \n\nIn summary, the distribution of activities has shifted towards more solitary activities, while the trend in banana exports has fluctuated over the years. The relationship between these two trends is unclear, but it is possible that changes in consumer behavior and preferences could have affected the banana export industry. \n\n![Distribution of activities from 2005 to 2010](image5)\n![Trend in banana exports from 1994 to 2005](image3)"}

This implies that consumption behavior follows the law of diminishing marginal utility, where the satisfaction gained from consuming additional units of a good decreases as more units are consumed. This is a fundamental concept in economics that helps explain why people might choose to consume a variety of goods rather than just one type. The table in image4 also illustrates this concept, showing that the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, eventually becoming negative, indicating that consuming more hot dogs beyond a certain point leads to disutility or dissatisfaction. This supports the idea that variety is important in consumption choices to maintain overall satisfaction. The image6, with its question about the importance of focus in achieving mastery, indirectly relates to this concept by suggesting that too much focus on a single activity (like eating hot dogs) can lead to diminishing returns and negative outcomes, while a balanced approach that includes variety can lead to greater overall satisfaction and mastery. The image7, showing a child enjoying a hot dog, contrasts with the negative utility values in the tables, highlighting the subjective nature of utility and how it can vary from person to person. The image8, with its message about the benefits of practice, also relates to the concept of diminishing marginal utility by suggesting that while practice can initially lead to increased satisfaction and performance, there may be a point of diminishing returns where additional practice does not lead to significant improvements. Overall, these images and quotes illustrate the importance of considering the law of diminishing marginal utility in understanding consumption behavior and the benefits of variety in achieving satisfaction and mastery. The answer is that the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, following the law of diminishing marginal utility, which implies that people might choose to consume a variety of goods to maintain overall satisfaction. This is supported by the tables in images2 and 4, the question in image6 about the importance of focus, the image7 showing a child enjoying a hot dog, and the message in image8 about the benefits of practice. The answer is that the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, following the law of diminishing marginal utility, which implies that people might choose to consume a variety of goods to maintain overall satisfaction.

{"q_id": 1926, "model": "OpenGVLab/InternVL2_5-38B", "in_tok": 0, "out_tok": 0, "total_tok": 0, "response": "The conversion rates in the lead funnel progression, as shown in image2, provide a detailed breakdown of how leads move through various stages from total leads to sales won opportunities. These rates are specific to the data presented and can be used to assess the efficiency of the marketing and sales process at each stage. For example, the conversion rate from total leads to marketing qualified leads (MQLs) is 52.07%, from MQLs to sales accepted leads (SALs) is 1.50%, from SALs to sales qualified leads (SQLs) is 83.08%, and from SQLs to sales won opportunities (SWOs) is 6.67%.\n\nIn contrast, the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics, as shown in image4, offer a broader perspective on how different lead sources perform in terms of conversion ratios. These rates are not specific to a single funnel but rather represent the overall effectiveness of various lead sources in converting to opportunities. For instance, the conversion ratio for website leads is 47.77%, for online ads is 13.87%, and for trade shows is 14.49%.\n\nTo relate these two sets of data, one could compare the specific conversion rates in the lead funnel progression with the average conversion rates from different lead sources to identify which sources are performing above or below the average. This comparison can help in optimizing marketing efforts by focusing on the most effective lead sources and improving the conversion rates at each stage of the funnel. For example, if the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is significantly lower than the average conversion ratio for a particular lead source, it may indicate a need to improve the qualification process or the quality of leads generated from that source. Conversely, if a lead source has a high conversion ratio but a low volume of leads, it may be worth investing more in that source to increase the overall number of leads and opportunities."}

In 1960, it was approximately 5.3%, and by 2007, it had risen to about 16.8%. This represents a significant growth over the 47-year period, indicating a substantial increase in healthcare expenditure relative to the overall economy.\n\n### Major Events in the Space Race Timeline (1957-1975)\n\nThe Space Race timeline from 1957 to 1975 highlights several key events in the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union for space exploration dominance. Notable milestones include:\n\n- **1957**: The launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of the Space Age.\n- **1961**: Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human in space.\n- **1969**: The Apollo 11 mission successfully lands astronauts on the Moon.\n- **1975**: The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, a joint mission between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, symbolizing the end of the Space Race.\n\n### Relationship Between Healthcare Spending and the Space Race\n\nWhile the Space Race was a significant period of technological and scientific advancement, it is important to note that the increase in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP is not directly related to the events depicted in the Space Race timeline. The growth in healthcare spending can be attributed to various factors such as population aging, medical inflation, and advances in medical technology, rather than the specific events of the Space Race.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased from 5.3% in 1960 to 16.8% in 2007, reflecting broader economic and demographic trends. The Space Race timeline highlights significant achievements in space exploration but does not directly influence the healthcare spending trend. The two phenomena are related to different aspects of national priorities and economic conditions during the mid-20th century."}

Reporting, as depicted in image1, involves the transformation of raw data into information through descriptive analytics, which answers the \"what\" questions and provides a backward-looking perspective. This step is crucial for understanding past performance and identifying areas for improvement.\n\nAnalysis, on the other hand, as shown in image4, goes beyond reporting by using prescriptive analytics to answer \"why\" questions and offer forward-looking insights. This step is essential for making informed decisions and driving strategic actions. The progression from business intelligence to business analytics, as illustrated in image7, involves moving from standard reports and ad-hoc queries to more advanced techniques like statistical analysis, forecasting, and predictive modeling. This evolution enables organizations to not only understand what has happened but also to anticipate future trends and optimize their operations accordingly.\n\nIn summary, reporting and analysis are foundational components of the analytics value chain, with reporting providing a descriptive overview of past events and analysis offering prescriptive insights for future actions. Together, they support the transition from business intelligence to business analytics, enabling organizations to leverage data for strategic decision-making and competitive advantage. ![Reporting and Analysis in the Analytics Value Chain](image1) ![Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image7) ![Types of Analysis](image4) ![Analytics Value Chain](image8) ![Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image7) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite](image1) ![Data-Driven Culture](image1) ![Data-Driven C-suite]("}

It specifies that sheeting for slabs, beams, column sides, and beam bottoms should be 25mm to 40mm thick.\n   - **Image5** shows a detailed diagram of a formwork setup, including various components like MS bars, wedges, timber spacers, bolts, struts, and bracings, but does not specify the thickness of the sheeting.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the text and image analysis, 25mm sheeting is appropriate for timber formwork, as it falls within the recommended range of 25mm to 40mm for sheeting thickness. This thickness is suitable for standard applications and can handle the weight of concrete without bowing out.\n\nTherefore, **25mm sheeting is an appropriate size for timber formwork**. \n\n![25mm to 40mm thick sheeting for timber formwork](image3)"}

The decrease suggests a shift in how people allocate their weekend time, possibly due to changes in lifestyle, work commitments, or other social factors. The remaining time is distributed among other activities such as shopping, fitness, eating out, hobbies, net surfing, traveling, reading, and watching films, with some activities showing an increase in percentage, indicating a reallocation of time spent on weekends.

This difference may affect students' shopping schedules by allowing them more flexibility to shop during the day and evening, especially for those who have classes or other commitments during the day. Off-campus supermarkets may require students to plan their shopping trips around their classes or other activities, as they have less time to shop. Additionally, the longer hours of on-campus supermarkets may be more convenient for students who prefer to shop in the evening or have late-night cravings. However, off-campus supermarkets may offer a wider variety of products and better prices, which may be a consideration for students who prioritize these factors over convenience.

By 2010, the time spent with family and friends decreased to 21%, while the time spent on social media increased to 22%. This change could be linked to the rise of digital communication and social media platforms, which have become more prevalent in recent years.\n\nThe training program statistics show that there were 425 registered participants from 105 countries, indicating a high level of global educational participation. This could be related to the shift in weekend activities, as people may be spending more time on social media and online learning platforms, which can provide access to educational resources and training programs. The increase in social media usage could also be a result of the global educational participation trend, as people may be using these platforms to connect with others and share information about educational opportunities.

By combining these processes, agile teams can ensure that they are continuously adapting to changing stakeholder needs, which is a core principle of agile methodologies. This approach helps in delivering a product that meets the stakeholders' expectations and is more likely to be accepted and used effectively.

For instance, the Matrix metering mode is ideal for natural landscapes as it measures light across the entire frame, ensuring balanced exposure. The Center metering mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is suitable for portraits, while the Spot metering mode focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes, providing precise control over exposure. In terms of focus modes, AF-S (single) is used for stationary subjects, AF-C (continuous) for moving subjects, and MF (manual) for focusing on specific subjects like a subject's face. These modes provide photographers with the flexibility to capture high-quality images in various scenarios. ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image5) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image4) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image3) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image2) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image1) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image6) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image7) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image8) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image9) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image10) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image11) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image12) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image13) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image14) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image15) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image16) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image17) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image18) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image19) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image20) ![Different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography under various scenarios](image21) ![Different metering modes and"}

Here's a step-by-step comparison and explanation of the implications:\n\n1. **Image4 Analysis**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50%.\n   - This indicates that out of all MQLs, only 1.50% are accepted by sales as SALs.\n\n2. **Image5 Analysis**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is not explicitly provided, but we can infer it from the data.\n   - The conversion ratio from MQL to SAL is 14.49% for Trade Show and 11.67% for Trade Show - Virtual.\n   - This suggests that the conversion rate varies significantly depending on the lead source.\n\n3. **Image6 Analysis**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is not directly provided, but we can infer it from the data.\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 23% for Trade Show and 17% for Trade Show - Virtual.\n   - This indicates a higher conversion rate compared to Image4, suggesting that the lead source and quality might be better.\n\n4. **Image7 Analysis**:\n   - The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 45% to 75%.\n   - This is a significantly higher range compared to the other datasets, indicating a more efficient sales process or higher quality leads.\n\n**Implications of the Differences Observed**:\n\n- **Lead Quality and Source**: The conversion rates vary significantly across different datasets, indicating that the quality and source of leads play a crucial role in the conversion process. Leads from certain sources (e.g., Trade Show) have higher conversion rates, suggesting that these leads are more likely to be accepted by sales.\n  \n- **Sales Process Efficiency**: The higher conversion rates in Image7 suggest that the sales process might be more efficient or that the leads are of higher quality. This could be due to better lead qualification, more effective sales strategies, or a more streamlined sales process.\n\n- **Marketing Strategy Impact**: The differences in conversion rates highlight the importance of a well-defined marketing strategy that targets high-quality leads and aligns with the sales process. Marketing efforts should focus on generating leads that are more likely to be accepted by sales.\n\n- **Resource Allocation**: Understanding the conversion rates can help in better resource allocation. For example, investing more in lead sources with higher conversion rates can improve overall sales performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rates from MQL to SAL vary significantly across different datasets, with Image7 showing the highest range. This suggests that the quality of leads and the efficiency of the sales process are critical factors in determining the conversion rates. Marketing strategies should be tailored to generate high-quality leads and align with the sales process"}

These problems include: 1) The dishes are not clean, 2) Cloudiness on glassware, 3) White spots appear on dishes and glasses, 4) Black or grey marks on dishes, 5) Detergent left in dispenser, 6) The dishes aren't drying, 7) Dishwasher doesn't start, 8) Water not pumped from dishwasher, 9) Suds in the tub, 10) Stained tub interior, 11) White film on inside surface, and 12) There are rust stains on cutlery. Each problem has a corresponding possible cause and solution. For example, if the dishes are not clean, the possible causes could be not enough detergent, items blocking the movement of the spray arms, or the filter combination not being clean or correctly fitted. The solutions include using more detergent, rearranging the items, or cleaning and fitting the filter correctly. If the dishwasher doesn't start, the possible causes could be a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker, power supply not turned on, or low water pressure. The solutions include replacing the fuse or resetting the circuit breaker, ensuring the power supply is turned on, and checking the water supply connection. If there are rust stains on cutlery, the possible causes could be the affected items not being corrosion resistant or a program not being run after dishwasher salt was added. The solutions include avoiding washing non-corrosion resistant items and running a wash program without crockery after adding salt. These problems and solutions are provided in the dishwasher's user manual to help users troubleshoot and resolve common issues. If users are unable to solve the problems by themselves, they are advised to seek help from a professional technician. The manufacturer may also make modifications to the product without prior notice, and users can receive a new user manual from the manufacturer or responsible vendor if their current one is lost or out-of-date. The dishwasher's maximum number of place settings is 15, and the maximum permissible inlet water pressure is 1MPa. The minimum permissible inlet water pressure is 0.04MPa. Users should not wash plastic items unless they are marked \"dishwasher safe\" or the equivalent, and they should use only detergent and rinse agents recommended for use in an automatic dishwasher. The door should not be left open, and the power supply must not be excessively or dangerously bent or flattened during installation. The appliance needs to be connected to the main water valve using new hose sets, and old sets should not be reused. The dishwasher will go into standby mode after 15 minutes of inactivity. The filtering system in the base of the wash cabinet retains coarse debris from the washing cycle, and the filters should be checked and cleaned regularly. The dishwasher's detergent dispenser should be refilled if the wash cycle has already drained the wash water. The dishwasher's detergent dispenser should be"}
