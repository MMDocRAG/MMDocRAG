The survey results reveal that an overwhelming majority of young Arabs believe they are entitled to subsidized energy costs, while concern about climate change is low across the region (quote [9]).

As shown in the image below, even though support for the current military effort is low, the majority continues to approve of the broader mission.\n\n![Support for U.S. military effort](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, while the current military effort in Iraq and Syria is viewed negatively by many, the majority of Americans still believe that the U.S. and its allies will ultimately succeed in their campaign against ISIS."}

As shown in image1, the percentage of people who believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions has fluctuated but generally remained relatively stable. In July 2014, 50% of respondents held this view, dropping to 46% by September 2014, and then remaining around 46% in December 2015. However, there were significant differences observed among various subgroups.\n\nFor instance, the partisan divide is stark and has widened. Image5 illustrates that 68% of Republicans believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence, a historical high but only slightly changed from September 2014 when it was 67%. In contrast, the percentage of Democrats who hold this view has decreased from 42% in September 2014 to 30% in December 2015, making the gap between Republicans and Democrats wider than ever. This trend is further highlighted in image4, where the gap between Republicans and Democrats in perceiving Islam as more likely to encourage violence has grown.\n\nThe ideological divide is equally pronounced. Image3 shows that 77% of conservative Republicans think Islam is more likely to encourage violence, whereas only 16% of liberal Democrats agree. This is consistent with the broader trends observed in image1, where the share of liberal Democrats who believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence has dropped by 13 percentage points since 2014.\n\nAdditionally, the data reveals variations across age groups and religious affiliations. Younger adults (ages 18-29) are less likely to view Islam as more likely to encourage violence compared to older age groups. For example, only 32% of those aged 18-29 held this view in September 2014, compared to 51% of those aged 65 and older. White evangelical Protestants are the most likely to view Islam as encouraging violence, with 70% holding this belief, which has remained relatively stable over the period. Catholics and white mainline Protestants are also more likely to perceive Islam as more likely to encourage violence, with 49% and 51% respectively.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of whether Islam encourages violence more than other religions have seen some changes, particularly among younger generations and different political affiliations, but the overall trend remains largely unchanged. The partisan and ideological divides have, however, widened, reflecting deeper political polarization on this issue.\n\n![The widening partisan and ideological divides on perceptions of Islam's likelihood to encourage violence](image5)"}

This indicates a broad familiarity with the topic.\n\n![Americans' awareness and perception of automation](image1)\n\nThe perception of this concept varies based on awareness. Those who have heard a lot about this concept find it to be much more realistic and express substantially higher levels of enthusiasm. Nearly half (48%) of Americans who have heard a lot about this concept find it extremely realistic that machines might one day do many of the jobs currently done by humans [6]. In contrast, among those who have not heard anything about the concept, only 4% find it extremely realistic [2].\n\nMoreover, while a majority of Americans are familiar with the notion, the outlook on the potential impacts of automation is predominantly negative. More Americans are worried than enthusiastic about the notion that machines might do many of the jobs currently done by humans. Just 33% of Americans express some level of enthusiasm about the idea, compared to 67% who express worry [3][9]. \n\nThis concern is reflected in the anticipated negative outcomes, such as the inequality between the rich and poor becoming much worse and people having a hard time finding things to do with their lives [image3].

Image1 shows a stark divide between Republicans and Democrats regarding job availability, with 71% of Republicans indicating plenty of jobs are available, compared to 53% of Democrats. This is reflected in Image2, which illustrates the level of dissatisfaction with the current state of the country. While 26% of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going, this figure has declined, and the data shows a partisan split with Republicans being more satisfied than Democrats [9].\n\nImage4 provides historical context, showing that positive views of the economy and jobs have been more prevalent among Republicans since Trump's election, with the percentage of Republicans rating economic conditions as excellent or good increasing from around 50% in 2001 to over 75% in recent years [5]. In contrast, Democrats' views have remained relatively stable but lower, with only 46% of Democrats rating their personal financial situation as excellent or good in 2019 [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly demonstrates that Republicans and Republican leaners are more positive about job availability and economic conditions compared to Democrats and Democratic leaners.

According to the survey, a significantly higher percentage of Latino Democrats (61%) believe that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem, compared to Latino Republicans (36%). This indicates that Latino Democrats are more likely to perceive and acknowledge the existence of racial discrimination.\n\nIn addition, [6] and [10] provide further support for this observation. [6] states that among Latinos, larger shares of both Democrats (73%) and independents and nonpartisans (54%) report having experienced racial discrimination than Republicans (44%). [10] reiterates this trend, noting that Latino Democrats are more likely than Latino Republicans or Latino independents and nonpartisans to say that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem for the country. This pattern holds even when accounting for political leaners, with Democratic leaners (70%) still more likely than those who lean toward the Republican Party (36%) to hold this view.\n\nThese data points suggest that Latino Democrats are more likely to recognize and emphasize the issue of racial discrimination, while Latino Republicans may be less inclined to see it as a significant societal problem.\n\nIn conclusion, Latino Democrats tend to perceive racial discrimination as a more pressing issue than Latino Republicans, as evidenced by their higher rates of experiencing racial discrimination and their greater concern about people not acknowledging its existence."}

A significant proportion of people working in STEM jobs attribute these disparities to a lack of access to quality education, as highlighted by the fact that 73% of black STEM workers believe it's a major issue [9]. Additionally, many people point to a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age, with 41% of Americans citing this as a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics [5].\n\nThe image1 [image1] shows that only 25% of K-12 public schools are considered to have adequate resources, which may reflect the limited access to quality education mentioned. Furthermore, the image2 [image2] demonstrates a gender disparity in STEM majors, where only 38% of women are in computer majors and 30% in engineering, compared to 53% and 50% of men, respectively.\n\nMoreover, a significant number of respondents believe that discrimination plays a role in these underrepresentations. For instance, 72% of black STEM workers believe they face discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions, while only 27% of white workers share this view [7]. This is further supported by the image5 [image5], which lists \"face discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotion\" as a major reason for the underrepresentation of both women and blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs.\n\nIn conclusion, the major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs include a lack of access to quality education, a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age, and discrimination during recruitment, hiring, and promotions."}

However, when we look at the broader population, a quarter of the public says \"high ethical standards\" describes neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party; 47% say it describes one party but not the other; and 17% say the description applies to both [6]. This suggests that while some segments of the population may have more nuanced views, the majority tends to see one party or the other as lacking in ethical standards.\n\n![Describes both parties](image4) further illustrates that among different political affiliations, independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has \"high ethical standards.\" About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), say neither party has high ethical standards.

The public's evaluation of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president has remained relatively stable and is comparable to ratings at the beginning of his presidency [2]. This stability suggests that the public's perception of Trump's leadership and ethical standards has not significantly improved over time.\n\nThe gender gap in approval ratings of the president is also noteworthy. Only 30% of women approve of Trump's performance, compared to 48% of men [4], which indicates a significant divide in public opinion based on gender.\n\nAdditionally, there are considerable differences in views of Trump based on age, education, and race. Younger adults, those with higher educational attainment, and non-white individuals are more likely to disapprove of the job Trump is doing [10]. These demographic factors further emphasize the polarized nature of public opinion regarding Trump's leadership and ethical standards.\n\nIn summary, the approval ratings of Trump's administration officials' ethical standards are significantly lower compared to past administrations, and this is closely related to the public's approval of Trump's job performance, which remains largely negative."}

For instance, among those with a postgraduate degree, only 23% approve of his performance, whereas for those with a high school degree or less, the approval rating is 43%. This indicates that higher education correlates with a more critical view of Trump's presidency.\n\n![The distribution of \"describes one party, not the other\" and \"describes neither party\" regarding ethical standards](image4)\n\nRegarding ethical standards, the same trend is observed. College graduates are more likely to believe that neither party has high ethical standards—31% compared to 20% for those with a high school degree or less. This suggests that higher education is associated with a more skeptical view of both parties' ethical standards.\n\n![Perceptions of the Republican and Democratic Parties among different racial and age groups](image5)\n\nMoreover, younger adults and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of Trump's job performance. Specifically, 65% of those aged 18-29 and 83% of Black respondents disapprove of his performance. This further reinforces the notion that certain demographic groups, particularly those with higher education and specific racial backgrounds, hold more negative views towards Trump and the ethical standards of the Republican Party.\n\nIn conclusion, higher educational attainment and specific political affiliations significantly impact perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings of Trump.

This stark contrast highlights a major divergence in voter expectations regarding Trump's primary focus.\n\nIn terms of other issues, both groups have similar levels of interest in the economy, with 15% of Trump voters and 12% of Clinton voters prioritizing it. Immigration is another area where there is notable difference; 15% of Trump voters want immigration to be a top priority, whereas only 6% of Clinton voters share this view. This suggests that Trump voters are more inclined towards policies related to border security and immigration reform.\n\nAdditionally, a smaller but significant number of Trump voters (8%) prioritize unifying the country, while only 5% of Clinton voters see this as a key priority.

In contrast, the share of Democrats who express concern that policies have gone too far has dropped from 47% in July 2013 to 28% in 2015 [8].\n\n![Perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism by political affiliation](image2)\n\nAge also plays a significant role in shaping these perceptions. Younger adults (18-29) are generally more positive about the government's efforts, with 53% saying it is doing very or fairly well, compared to 42% who say it is not doing well [6]. In contrast, older adults (65+) are more critical, with 60% giving the government negative ratings [6]. Additionally, those with less education tend to be more critical of the government's efforts, with 71% of those with a high school education or less saying the government is not doing far enough to protect the country, compared to 56% of those with a postgraduate degree [5, 10].\n\n![Perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism by age and education level](image3)\n\nIn summary, public perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative overall, particularly among Republicans and older, less educated Americans. These shifts reflect a growing concern that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country, especially among Republicans, while Democrats remain more concerned about civil liberties restrictions.\n\n![Perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism by political affiliation and age group](image4)"}

Younger adults (18-29) are generally more critical of government policies, with a majority (57%) giving the government's performance a negative rating in reducing the terrorist threat, as shown in image3. In contrast, older adults (65+) are more likely to view the government's performance negatively (57%), but still a significant portion (42%) see it as positive.\n\nAge also plays a role in concerns about civil liberties. As seen in image2, adults under 30 are more likely to believe that the government has gone too far in restricting civil liberties (43%) compared to not going far enough to protect the country (37%). This sentiment decreases with age, with the oldest group (65+) being most concerned about insufficient protection (71%).\n\nPolitical ideology further shapes these perceptions. The data in image1 illustrates that Republicans are more likely to view government actions as excessive, while Democrats tend to see them as inadequate. For instance, in image3, Republicans are more likely to rate the government's performance as \"not too or not at all well\" (64%), whereas Democrats are more likely to rate it positively (64%).\n\nOver time, these perceptions have shifted. Image4 shows a decline in the belief that government policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties, particularly among younger adults. This trend is also reflected in the decreasing percentage of people who think the government has gone too far in image5, indicating a growing acceptance of some level of civil liberty restriction.\n\nIn conclusion, younger adults and those with conservative or moderate/liberal leanings are more critical of government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat, perceiving them as either too restrictive of civil liberties or insufficient in protecting the country. These perceptions have evolved, with younger adults becoming more accepting of some civil liberty restrictions over time."}

For instance, 56% of those aged 65 and above believed the policies had not gone far enough, while only 44% of 18-29 year-olds held this view. This indicates a generational divide where older adults were more inclined to think that the government's policies were excessive in restricting civil liberties.\n\n![56% vs 44%](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the data from image2 shows a significant difference in perceptions between younger and older adults regarding the adequacy of anti-terror policies. Younger adults were more concerned about insufficient protection (56%) compared to older adults who were more worried about overly restrictive policies (44%). This suggests that while older generations may feel that civil liberties are being curtailed, younger adults prioritize the need for stronger security measures against terrorism.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of opinions across different age groups can be observed in image3, which illustrates the political leanings of respondents. For instance, among Republicans, 71% of conservatives and moderates felt that anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough, indicating a strong preference for increased security measures. In contrast, Democrats, regardless of their ideological leaning, showed a more balanced view, with liberal Democrats (41%) equally concerned about civil liberties being restricted as they were about insufficient security measures.\n\n![Republicans vs Democrats](image3)\n\nThis pattern is also reflected in the overall trends depicted in image4, which breaks down responses by education level and political affiliation. College-educated individuals, particularly those with some college or a high school diploma, were more likely to believe that the government's policies had not gone far enough to protect the country (48% and 44%, respectively), whereas those with less education were more concerned about civil liberties being restricted (40%).\n\nFinally, the shifts in public opinion since the Snowden revelations are evident in image5, showing a significant increase in the proportion of people who believe that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, especially among Republicans. Since 2013, there has been a notable rise in the number of people who feel that the policies are inadequate, with a 33-point increase among Republicans from 38% to 71%.\n\nIn conclusion, younger adults in 2015 were more likely to perceive the government's anti-terror policies as not going far enough to protect the country, while older adults were more concerned about civil liberties being overly restricted. These perceptions varied by age, education, and political affiliation, reflecting a complex interplay of security and liberty concerns in the post-Snowden era."}

The decline in concerns about civil liberties restrictions can be observed through the shift in public opinion from 2013 when more people were worried about policies going too far, to 2015 where a larger proportion of the population now believes these policies have not gone far enough.\n\nFor instance, in December 2015, only 28% of adults under 30 expressed concern that policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties, while 43% felt they did not go far enough to protect the country. In contrast, those aged 65 and older were more concerned about security, with 71% feeling that policies do not go far enough to protect the country, compared to 21% who felt policies went too far in restricting civil liberties.\n\n![Age Group Opinions](image4)\n\nMoreover, the image `![Age Group Opinions](image4)` illustrates that younger adults (18-29) are more evenly split between concerns about civil liberties and security, while older adults (65+) are more focused on security, with a significant majority (71%) believing that policies do not go far enough to protect the country.\n\nThe political affiliation also plays a crucial role in shaping these opinions.

In July 2015, only 55% believed the U.S. and its allies would definitely or probably succeed, but by December 2015, this number had risen to 66% (see image5). This increase reflects a growing optimism among the public regarding the campaign's long-term outcome.\n\nHowever, the current state of the campaign remains largely viewed negatively. As of December 2015, 58% of the public felt the U.S. effort was not going well, with 39% saying it was not too well and 19% saying it was not at all well (see image4). These figures indicate that while there is a belief in eventual success, the public still perceives the campaign as struggling to make progress.\n\nPolitical affiliations play a significant role in shaping these perceptions. Democrats are notably more optimistic about the campaign's success compared to Republicans. For instance, 72% of Democrats believe the campaign will ultimately be successful, whereas only 26% of Republicans share this view (see image1). This partisan divide is also evident in the current assessment of the campaign's effectiveness; 62% of independents, 72% of Democrats, and 65% of Republicans say the campaign is going at least fairly well (see image1).\n\nMoreover, the public's concerns about the campaign differ based on political affiliation. Republicans are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the militants, with 75% expressing this worry, compared to 18% who are concerned about becoming too involved (see image3). Democrats, on the other hand, are more evenly split between these two concerns, with 44% worried about not going far enough and 37% concerned about becoming too involved.\n\nIn summary, while there is a growing belief in the eventual success of the U.S. military campaign against ISIS, the current state of the campaign is viewed negatively by a majority of the public.

This contrasts sharply with conservative Republicans, where 57% support the idea of greater scrutiny of Muslims because of their religion [6]. Independents and moderate Republicans also have mixed views, but majorities within these groups still lean against additional scrutiny.\n\nMoreover, the image illustrates that non-white individuals, such as blacks and Hispanics, are more likely to reject the idea of scrutiny of Muslims based on religion compared to white individuals [10]. This highlights a potential racial and ethnic divide in how different groups perceive the need for increased scrutiny.\n\n![Independent ==Republican === Democrat](image1)\n\nThe partisan divide is also evident when comparing the responses of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Republicans are more evenly split, with 49% supporting greater scrutiny and 44% opposing it [5]. Democrats, however, have a clear majority (76%) who believe Muslims should not be subject to additional scrutiny [5]. Independents also have a strong majority (62%) opposing greater scrutiny [5].\n\nAdditionally, the image below depicts the varying levels of concern over different national issues, including terrorism. The data indicates that four-in-ten Republicans prioritize terrorism, defense issues, and national security, whereas fewer independents (28%) and Democrats (23%) cite these concerns [4]. This suggests that terrorism is a more prominent issue for Republicans, which may explain why a larger portion of this group supports greater scrutiny of Muslims.\n\n![Rep Dem __ Ind diff](image4)\n\nThe graph further reinforces this by showing that Republicans are more concerned about issues related to national security and terrorism compared to Democrats and Independents. The difference is particularly stark when looking at the \"NET: Terrorism/ISIS/National security\" category, where Republicans rank it higher by 18 percentage points [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the perception of scrutiny of Muslims is deeply intertwined with political affiliations and the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue.

This dramatic change highlights the growing public concern about terrorism, which reached its peak in February 2003 during the Iraq War.\n\nAccording to image3, the partisan divide on the issue is substantial. Republicans are more likely to mention terrorism, defense, and national security as the most important problems compared to independents and Democrats. In fact, 41% of Republicans cite these issues, whereas only 23% of Democrats do.

This shift is particularly stark among Republicans, where positive ratings have plummeted from 63% to 27%.\n\nImage5 provides further insight into how these perceptions vary by religious affiliation. While white evangelical Protestants and Catholics tend to express more scrutiny toward additional government scrutiny because of religion, the overall trend still indicates a significant decline in confidence in the government's ability to handle terrorism.\n\nIn summary, the perception of terrorism has risen dramatically, becoming a major concern for a large portion of the population.

This sentiment is notably higher among Republicans, with 73% believing that China's early handling of the pandemic contributed a great deal to its spread, compared to just 38% of Democrats holding the same view.\n\nIn terms of U.S.-China relations, there is a divide between political affiliations. Half of Americans think the U.S. should hold China responsible for its role in the pandemic, even if it means worsening economic relations, while 38% think the U.S. should prioritize strong U.S.-China relations, even if it means overlooking any role China played in the outbreak [7].

This age-related difference suggests a generational shift in attitudes.\n\nFurthermore, in the U.S., there is a clear preference for a close relationship with Germany over China, especially among Democrats, who represent a larger portion of the population. However, in Germany, the preference leans towards the U.S. over Russia, with 50% of Germans preferring a close relationship with the U.S. over China's 24% [6]. This preference is evident across different age groups in Germany, with 34% of the 50-64 age group and 53% of the 65+ age group favoring the U.S. over China [8].\n\n![](image3) The chart demonstrates that in the U.S., the majority of respondents prefer a close relationship with Germany (13%) over China (3%) when asked about important foreign policy partners. In Germany, the preference for the U.S. (44%) over China (24%) is even more pronounced.\n\nIn summary, political party preferences in the U.S. and Germany play a significant role in shaping attitudes towards cooperation with Russia and China. Democrats in the U.S. are more likely to favor Germany, while Republicans are more inclined to prefer Russia. Conversely, in Germany, the preference is for the U.S. over Russia, highlighting the complex interplay between domestic politics and international relations."}

The Pew Research Center's findings indicate that while there is some overlap in perceptions, significant divergences exist, particularly on the issue of the United States' and Germany's respective standing as economic powers (quote [7] and [8]).\n\nIn terms of international organizations, Germans tend to view the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN) more positively than Americans. For instance, 71% of Germans favor the EU, compared to 59% of Americans ([9], image1). Similarly, 65% of Germans have a favorable opinion of the UN, whereas only 60% of Americans share this view ([9], image1).\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to Russia, there is a notable difference in perception, with conservatives in both countries having more favorable views compared to liberals. However, the ideological divide is wider among Americans than Germans (quote [3], [9], image1).\n\nRegarding economic powers, a striking difference is evident. In the U.S., 50% name the U.S. as the leading economic power, while 32% choose China. In Germany, however, 53% name China as the leading economic power, compared to just 24% who name the U.S. (quotes [7], [8], image1).\n\nThe age groups also play a role in shaping these perceptions.

In the United States, a higher percentage of people believe that the use of military force can be justified to maintain order in the world, with around eight-in-ten Americans agreeing. However, in Germany, only about half of the population holds this view, with nearly six-in-ten adults on the right seeing military force as necessary, compared to about a third on the left. This ideological divide is evident in the image6, where a larger proportion of Americans (78%) agree that military force is sometimes necessary, compared to Germans (47%).\n\nWhen it comes to defense spending, the American and German publics exhibit different trends. In the U.S., half of the respondents think that European allies should maintain their current level of defense spending, marking a shift from the previous years when a larger portion believed that spending should increase. In contrast, German public opinion is more evenly split, with about four-in-ten Germans favoring an increase or maintaining the current budget. Image4 visually illustrates this difference, showing that in 2019, 35% of Germans wanted to increase spending, 51% wanted to keep the same, and 14% wanted to decrease it, whereas in the U.S., the figures were 29% for increase, 50% for keeping the same, and 21% for decreasing.\n\nRegarding the age demographics' views on the U.S.-Germany relationship, the data indicates that younger individuals in both countries have more positive opinions compared to older generations. In the U.S., 82% of people aged 18 to 29 view the relationship as good, compared to 73% of those aged 65 and older. Similarly, in Germany, 40% of young people consider the relationship good, versus 31% of those 65 and older.

This shift can be attributed to a decline in support among Republicans, where the share favoring increased spending fell by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019. Democrats, however, showed a more modest decline in their support for increased spending (see image2).\n\nIn Germany, public opinion on defense spending is more evenly split. In 2017, about half of Germans were content with their country's defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased. By 2019, the public was divided, with about four-in-ten taking each view (see image5). Interestingly, unlike in the U.S., there is no significant partisan divide in Germany regarding whether to increase or maintain current levels of defense spending (see image3).\n\nFor both countries, partisan differences are evident. In the U.S., Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, support for increased spending among Republicans has decreased over the years, indicating a shift in party alignment (see image2). In Germany, the public is divided, with no clear partisan preference for increasing or maintaining defense spending (see image5).\n\nIn conclusion, while both American and German opinions on defense spending have evolved, with a notable decline in support for increased spending in the U.S., there remains a lack of clear partisan consensus in Germany. ![Partisan divide on defense spending in Germany](image5) ![Shift in American opinion on European allies' defense spending](image2)"}

Republicans and Republican-leaning independents tend to favor higher defense spending, with a substantial majority believing it is important for their country's national security [2, 10]. For instance, in 2019, 90% of Republican-leaning independents saw U.S. military bases in Germany as important for their country's national security, compared to about 80% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [10]. However, there has been a decline in this view among Republicans, with a 14 percentage point drop between 2017 and 2019 [3]. The image `![Republican vs Democratic views on U.S. military bases in Germany](image1)` illustrates this trend, showing a consistent but decreasing preference among Republicans and a more stable but lower preference among Democrats.\n\nIn Germany, the situation is different. Support for increasing defense spending varies across political parties. CDU/CSU supporters favor defense spending increases, with 41% supporting this stance [5]. Green party supporters, however, are more skeptical, with only 28% wanting to raise defense spending. The SPD falls in the middle with 41% in favor of increased spending. Moreover, younger Germans (ages 18-29) are particularly doubtful about the importance of American military bases, with 62% viewing them as not important for German national security [6]. This is in contrast to older Germans (65+), who are more supportive, with 61% seeing the bases as important. The image `![Opinions on U.S. military bases in Germany by age group](image4)` visualizes this generational divide, showing a stark difference between younger and older Germans.\n\nOver time, the opinions on increasing defense spending have shown some shifts. In the U.S., there has been a notable decrease in support among Republicans regarding the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany for national security [3]. In Germany, the CDU/CSU, which supports increased defense spending, remains consistent, while the Greens' support has remained low [5]. The image `![Opinions on increasing defense spending over time in Germany](image5)` demonstrates this trend, showing that while the Greens' support has been steady at around 28%, CDU/CSU support has remained at 41%, and SPD support has fluctuated slightly.\n\nTo summarize, political affiliations strongly influence opinions on increasing defense spending in both the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., Republicans have historically favored higher spending, though this support has decreased somewhat, while Democrats have maintained a more moderate stance. In Germany, the political landscape shows more variability, with the Greens being consistently skeptical and the CDU/CSU and SPD showing more nuanced support."}

In contrast, older Germans tend to view the bases more positively, with 61% of those aged 65 and over considering them important for Germany's defense [9].\n\nIn the United States, political affiliation plays a significant role in determining which foreign policy partners are deemed most important. Both Republicans and Democrats rank Germany as a top foreign policy partner, but Republicans express a stronger preference for Israel as a strategic ally, with 26% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favoring it over just 9% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [7]. This partisan divide is also evident in views on the U.S. military presence in Germany, where support is high among both Republicans and Democrats, although there is a slight lean towards Republicans [10].\n\nThese differences in perception are reflected in the data shown in image2, which illustrates shifts in American and German attitudes toward cooperation with the U.S. Over time, the percentage of Germans expressing a desire to cooperate more with the U.S. has increased significantly, from 47% in 2018 to nearly 50% in recent years, while a majority of Americans continue to favor closer cooperation with Germany [2].\n\nFor Germans, political affiliation does not greatly influence their choice of foreign policy partners. Supporters of the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens all rank France and the U.S. highly, with France often taking the top spot [3]. This suggests a more unified stance among Germans across the political spectrum regarding key foreign policy partners.\n\nIn summary, younger Germans are less convinced of the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany, while political affiliation in the U.S. shapes preferences for foreign policy partners, with Republicans showing a stronger inclination toward Israel and a supportive attitude toward the U.S. military presence in Germany [9, 10]."}

This divide extends to age groups, with older Americans being more likely to predict a decline in China's global influence compared to younger generations.\n\nThe perception of the World Health Organization (WHO) also plays a role in shaping these views. [6] reveals that Democrats overwhelmingly trust the WHO, with 80% trusting its information on the coronavirus, while only 36% of Republicans share this trust. This further emphasizes the partisan gap in attitudes towards China, as the WHO is seen as a key international organization in addressing the pandemic.\n\nThe data also show that negative views of China have been increasing over the past few years. [9] notes that 66% of Americans now express an unfavorable opinion of China, marking the most negative rating since the Pew Research Center began asking this question in 2005.\n\nIn terms of the U.S.'s own role in world affairs, [10] suggests that there is a significant divide between partisan and ideological perspectives.

These views are strongly influenced by partisanship, with Republicans being more critical of China and its actions compared to Democrats. This partisan divide is evident in trust levels for international organizations like the WHO and in opinions about the U.S.'s role in world affairs. ![(The U.S. and China have different views on the impact of the coronavirus on global influence)](image3)"}

Democrats and Democratic-leaning individuals, however, have slightly more confidence in Xi, as indicated by quote [5].\n\nIn terms of overall support or opposition to limiting Chinese students, the data in image4 provides a clear picture. A majority of Americans (55%) support such limitations, with a substantial portion (about one-in-five) strongly supporting it. Conversely, 43% oppose these limitations, with 18% strongly opposed. The age distribution in image5 shows that older Americans are more likely to have no confidence in the Chinese president, which correlates with their higher support for limiting Chinese students, as seen in quote [10] where 53% of those 65 and older say they have no confidence at all in Xi, compared to only 35% of those 18 to 29.\n\nIn conclusion, the opinions on limiting Chinese students in U.S. universities are deeply influenced by age and political affiliation, with older and more conservative individuals being more supportive of such limitations, partly driven by their lack of confidence in Chinese leadership."}

As seen in the data, around two-thirds of Americans view economic relations with China as somewhat or very bad ([1]). This sentiment is driven by issues such as the loss of U.S. jobs to China ([9]), China's growing military power, and its policies on human rights ([10]). Additionally, there is a widespread belief that China is not respecting the personal freedoms of its people, with nine-in-ten Americans holding this view ([10]).\n\nMoreover, the concerns extend to cybersecurity, where a majority of Americans believe that China is doing a bad job ([7]). In terms of environmental issues, a large proportion of the population is critical of China's efforts to address global climate change ([7]). These concerns are not limited to one political party but are shared across different segments of the American public, although Republicans tend to be more critical and supportive of a tougher stance against China on economic issues ([6]).\n\nLooking at the changes over time, there has been a notable increase in the perception that China's policy on human rights is a very serious problem for the U.S., with a rise of 7 percentage points since the previous year ([10]). Similarly, the tension around cyberattacks from China has also grown, with a 7 percentage point increase in concern from 2020 to 2021 ([10]). These trends indicate a steady escalation in American apprehension towards China's actions and policies.\n\n![](image1) The graph clearly illustrates the increase in concerns regarding specific issues like cyberattacks, job losses, military power, and human rights. It shows that while the overall percentage of people concerned about cyberattacks and job losses has remained relatively stable, there has been a notable rise in the percentage of people considering China's military power and human rights policies as very serious problems.\n\n![](image2) The shift in public opinion can also be seen in the declining confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China. While 53% of Americans have confidence in Biden to handle China, this is lower than his overall confidence in dealing with other foreign policy issues ([5]). This suggests a growing skepticism among the public regarding the government's ability to manage the complex relationship with China.\n\n![](image3) The prioritization of economic relations versus human rights issues further underscores the evolving nature of American concerns. There is a divide between those who want to prioritize strengthening economic ties with China and those who advocate for promoting human rights, even if it harms economic relations. This reflects a nuanced and multifaceted set of attitudes towards China.\n\nIn conclusion, the key concerns of Americans regarding China include economic competition, military power, human rights abuses, and cybersecurity threats. These concerns have intensified over the past year, particularly regarding human rights and cyberattacks. The public's trust in government leaders to manage these issues has also declined, highlighting a growing sense of unease and dissatisfaction with the current state of the U.S.-China relationship."}

For instance, the optimism levels have grown significantly among those who had completed some college, rising by 20 percentage points, compared to only 9 percentage points for those with a high school diploma or less education ([2]). This growth in optimism is particularly pronounced among younger Hispanic adults, with those aged 18 to 29 experiencing a 27 percentage point increase in positive financial assessments, from 21% in 2008 to 48% in 2015 ([8]).\n\nMoreover, the optimism among U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics has increased by 14 percentage points to 81% in each group ([6]). Additionally, the optimism among Hispanic men and women also rose by 18 and 11 percentage points respectively, indicating a broad-based increase in financial optimism across genders and generational lines ([6]). \n\nWhen comparing these trends to the general population, the data show a more modest increase in financial optimism over the same period. The general population's optimism increased by only 6 percentage points, from 56% in 2008 to 62% in 2015 ([9], [10]). This disparity highlights that Hispanic subgroups have experienced more significant improvements in their financial outlooks compared to the broader American public.\n\n![](image1) The image above illustrates the changes in optimism among different Hispanic subgroups, showing that those with more education and younger individuals have experienced the greatest increases. For example, the optimism among those with some college education increased from 60% in 2008 to 85% in 2015, while those with less than a high school diploma saw their optimism rise from 56% to 77%.\n\n![](image2) Similarly, the second image provides a snapshot of how different Hispanic subgroups perceive their current financial condition relative to others. It shows that while all Hispanics reported being better off than the same, the increase was more pronounced among U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics, with their optimism increasing from 70% to 81% and 55% to 75% respectively. This suggests a significant shift in financial sentiment among these groups.\n\n![](image3) The third image further supports this trend by showing the distribution of financial conditions across different subgroups in 2008 and 2015. It indicates that the proportion of Hispanics reporting excellent or good financial conditions increased from 45% to 72%, a substantial rise of 27 percentage points.\n\n![](image4) Finally, the fourth image breaks down the financial condition ratings into four categories: excellent, good, only fair, and poor. It shows that the proportion of Hispanics rating their financial condition as excellent or good improved significantly, from 56% in 2008 to 72% in 2015, indicating a marked improvement in overall financial satisfaction among this demographic.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial optimism among different Hispanic subgroups has increased substantially from 2008 to 2015, outpacing the general population's gains. This trend is evident across various demographics, including educational attainment, age, and gender, reflecting a broader recovery and positive outlook within the Hispanic community."}

The Pew Research Center's findings indicate that those who are currently in a better financial position are more optimistic about their children's future financial stability. For instance, those with a positive view of their current financial situation are more likely to predict an improvement in their family's finances over the next 12 months [3]. Furthermore, the data suggests that the optimism extends to the children's financial future, with a majority expecting their offspring to achieve better financial standing than they themselves are in today [6].\n\nThe impact of educational attainment on these expectations is also notable. According to the report, among those with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children to be better off financially, which is similar to the 71% of those with less than a high school education who share the same belief [5]. However, there is a difference in optimism between these groups: Latino high school graduates are more optimistic, with 79% predicting that their children will be better off financially [5]. This indicates that while there is a general trend of optimism, higher educational attainment is associated with greater confidence in the financial prospects of one's children.\n\nThe data also reveals generational differences in financial optimism. Older Latinos tend to be more pessimistic about their children's financial futures compared to younger generations. For example, among those aged 65 and older, only 52% expect their children to be better off, whereas 75% of those aged 18 to 29 and 76% of those aged 30 to 49 have similar expectations [9]. This suggests that younger Latinos are more hopeful about the financial future of their children.\n\nThe margin of error and sample size for the survey are also important to consider, as they provide context for the reliability of these findings [10]. The Pew Research Center conducted a comprehensive survey of 1,054 Latino adults, including both U.S.-born and foreign-born individuals, with a margin of error of ±3.3% for the total Latino population and ±4.4% for the foreign-born population [4].\n\n![Latino financial optimism varies by age and educational attainment](image5)\n\nIn summary, the current financial situation and educational levels play crucial roles in shaping the financial expectations of Hispanics for their children. Higher educational attainment and a more positive current financial situation correlate with greater optimism about future financial outcomes."}

Meanwhile, the overall median household income for all households was around $53,700 in 2000 and increased to $71,400 in 2014.\n\nThe second image ([image2]) reveals that the majority of Latino adults (72%) expect their children to be better off financially than they are, compared to 16% who expect them to be about the same and 5% who think their children will be worse off. This suggests a strong belief in upward mobility for future generations, even amidst economic challenges.\n\nUnemployment trends among Latinos, as shown in [image5], have improved since the Great Recession, falling from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2016. However, it remains higher than the 5% low point for non-Hispanic workers in the fourth quarter of 2006. Despite this, the optimism about family finances has grown more rapidly among Latinos compared to the general population. As indicated in [image7], the share of Latinos expecting their family finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" increased from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015, whereas the corresponding figure for all Americans only rose by 6 percentage points during the same period.\n\nIn summary, while there have been improvements in unemployment rates and some optimism about financial well-being, particularly regarding future generations, the economic picture for Latinos remains mixed compared to the broader population.

In December 2015, 35% of Hispanics reported that economic conditions were good or excellent, a higher share than among whites (25%) (quote9).\n\nThe income and wealth disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations are also evident. Median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, a level essentially unchanged since the recession (quote3). Furthermore, the Hispanic poverty rate was 23.6% in 2014, slightly below its peak of 26.5% in 2010 but still above pre-recession levels.

For instance, 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially than they are now (quote5). However, there are significant differences in personal financial evaluations based on educational attainment and immigration status. Latinos with some college experience or more and U.S.-born Latinos were more likely to say their personal financial situation was either excellent or good in 2015, while those with less than a high school education or who were immigrants had lower personal financial ratings (quote4).\n\nIn summary, while the unemployment rate for Hispanics has declined, it remains higher than pre-recession levels, and economic perceptions are generally more positive among Hispanics compared to the general public.

The graph illustrates that while overall internet usage among all adults increased from 53% in 2012 to 86% in 2014, the corresponding figure for seniors was only 59% in 2012, increasing to 65% by 2014 [2].\n\nIn summary, internet and broadband adoption rates among older adults are significantly influenced by age, education, and income. Younger, higher-income, and more highly educated seniors are more likely to adopt these technologies, while older seniors, those with lower incomes, and those without a college degree are less likely to do so. These rates still trail those of the general population, highlighting the digital divide that exists among different segments of the older adult population. ![Seniors with lower adoption rates](image1) ![Comparison between internet users and non-users](image2) ![Smartphone adoption rates among seniors](image3) ![Internet and broadband adoption trends over time](image4)"}

Specifically, 87% of seniors with a college degree go online, and 76% are broadband adopters, while only 40% of those without a college degree go online and 27% have broadband at home [9]. Similarly, higher-income seniors exhibit higher adoption rates. Seniors earning $75,000 or more have 90% online access and 82% broadband at home, whereas those earning less than $30,000 have only 39% online access and 25% broadband at home [9].\n\n![Seniors' internet and broadband adoption varies significantly by income and education](image3)\n\nMoreover, cell phone ownership is almost universal among older adults, with 77% of seniors owning a cell phone, although smartphone adoption remains lower. Only 18% of seniors are smartphone users, which is far below the national average of 55% [4, 10]. However, smartphone adoption among seniors increases with both higher income and education levels. For example, 92% of seniors in the highest income bracket own a smartphone, compared to 67% in the lowest income bracket, and 42% of seniors with a college degree own a smartphone, compared to 10% of those with only a high school degree [5, 10].\n\nIn summary, seniors with higher income and education levels have significantly higher rates of internet, broadband, cell phone, and smartphone adoption compared to those with lower income and education levels."}

Similarly, the percentage of smartphone owners varies significantly: 8 while 42% of seniors at this income level own a smartphone, which is more than double the rate among seniors as a whole (18%) and roughly half the rate among high-income adults (76%) [6].\n\n![The adoption rates for e-book readers and tablet computers are also influenced by education and income. College graduates and higher-income individuals are far more likely to own these devices.](image1)\n\nMoreover, seniors with a college degree are about three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as those without a college degree, and those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more are around four times as likely to own each device as those with a household income of less than $30,000 [7].\n\nLooking at broader trends, we can see that broadband adoption among older adults has more than doubled over a five-year period. In May 2008, only 19% of seniors were broadband adopters, but today, 47% of seniors report having a high-speed broadband connection at home [9]. However, despite the increasing trend, smartphone adoption remains low among older adults, with just 18% owning a smartphone, significantly lower than the national adoption rate of 55% [8].\n\n![Cell phone and smartphone adoption rates among different age groups and education/income levels show that younger seniors and those with higher education and income levels are more likely to adopt these technologies.](image4)\n\nOverall, while internet and smartphone adoption is growing among older adults, it still lags behind the general population, especially among those with lower incomes and less education.

Among all seniors, 77% own a cell phone, which is lower than the national average of 91% for all adults [7]. However, the percentage of seniors owning a cell phone increases with income and educational attainment. For example, 92% of seniors living in households earning $75,000 or more own a cell phone, compared to just 67% of those earning less than $30,000 [6]. Similarly, college graduates are more likely to own a cell phone than those with a high school diploma or less [6].\n\nWhen it comes to smartphone ownership, the gap widens.

This indicates a substantial gap in broadband adoption between these two groups.\n\nAdditionally, the data from [10] and [9] shows that broadband adoption is closely tied to household income. Seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more have an 82% broadband adoption rate, while those earning less than $30,000 per year have a 25% broadband adoption rate. This disparity suggests that higher income levels correlate with greater access to broadband services.\n\nTo further illustrate this trend, the table in image2 provides specific percentages for different age groups and education levels. It shows that among college graduates, 76% have broadband at home, whereas only 27% of those with a high school education or less have broadband.

It shows that workers with less education are more supportive of a universal basic income, especially those with high school diplomas or less (65%) [7].\n\n![Support for a universal basic income by educational level](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, political affiliations significantly influence American views on policies related to workforce automation and job displacement, particularly regarding social safety nets and job protection. Democrats tend to favor more interventionist policies like universal basic income and national service programs, while Republicans are more likely to advocate for individual responsibility. Nonetheless, there is considerable agreement on the need to limit the extent to which businesses can automate jobs [10]."}

The younger adults, particularly those aged 18 to 24, are more likely to have been personally impacted by workforce automation (6% of U.S. adults), as seen in the pie chart from `image3` which shows that the youngest adults are among the groups most affected.\n\nMoreover, the survey indicates that workers with higher levels of education tend to have more positive views on workplace technologies. College graduates are more likely to find that technology makes their work more interesting and increases their opportunities for career advancement, as shown in `image4` where 64% of college graduates believe technology has made their work more interesting, compared to only 38% of those with a high school diploma or less. Similarly, 53% of college graduates feel that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, while only 32% of those with a high school diploma or less agree.\n\nOn the other hand, workers lacking a college education are less likely to view current workforce technologies positively. As depicted in `image6`, 46% of workers who have been impacted by automation feel that technology has decreased their opportunities for career advancement, and 34% feel that it has made their work less interesting, compared to just 11% of other workers.\n\nIn terms of the time frame for the impact of automation, `image2` illustrates that a significant majority of workers (56%) believe that automation will not happen within the next 100 years. However, within specific industries, such as fast food and insurance claims processing, a higher percentage of workers perceive their jobs as being at greater risk, with 77% and 65% of fast food workers and insurance claims processors, respectively, expecting their jobs to be mostly done by robots or computers within their lifetimes.\n\nIn conclusion, workers with higher education levels are more optimistic about the benefits of technology in their careers, whereas those with lower levels of education are more skeptical and negatively impacted by automation."}

For instance, college graduates are more likely to find that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%) and increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%). This is evident from the data where the percentage of college graduates expressing positive views on the impact of technology is significantly higher compared to those with a high school diploma or less.\n\n![Impact of technology on work](image4)\n\nMoreover, the survey indicates that workers with college degrees are more likely to see a positive impact from various workforce technologies, including word processing and spreadsheet software, smartphones, email and social media, software managing daily schedules, customer self-serve technologies, and industrial robots. For example, 58% of college graduates believe that industrial robots have had a positive impact on their jobs or careers, whereas only 25% of those with less than a college degree hold the same view.\n\nHowever, the impact of technology is not uniformly positive. For workers lacking a college education, the current generation of workforce technologies has a more mixed and often negative impact. A significant portion of these workers view technology as a broadly negative influence on their career prospects. This can be seen in the data showing that 56% of workers with less than a college degree believe that technology has had no impact either way, while only 38% find it has made their work more interesting and 32% believe it has increased their opportunities for career advancement.\n\n![Impact of technology on job satisfaction](image3)\n\nFor instance, among various professions, software engineers and legal clerks are more likely to find that technology has made their work more interesting and increased their career opportunities, reflecting the positive impact of technology on these roles. On the other hand, fast food workers and construction workers are less likely to perceive any positive impact, indicating a more negative perception of technology in these sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of the impact of workforce automation and technology vary significantly across different demographics and education levels. College graduates tend to view these technologies more positively, seeing them as sources of interest and career advancement, while workers with less education are more likely to see them as having little to no impact, or even detrimental to their career prospects."}

For instance, men are slightly more likely than women to encounter harassing or abusive behavior online, as indicated by the quote [4]. Specifically, 29% of men say they more often see mean or bullying content on social media compared to 19% of women. Conversely, women are more likely to report seeing kind or supportive behavior, with 56% of women reporting an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior, compared to 52% of men [4].\n\nMoreover, when it comes to the acceptability of social media platforms using user data, there are also significant gender differences. While relatively large majorities of users across different age groups find it acceptable for social media sites to use their data to show them events happening in their area [6], there are stark contrasts in opinions regarding the use of data for recommending other people they might know. Specifically, only 33% of users aged 65 and older find this acceptable, compared to 66% of users aged 18 to 49 [9]. This difference is particularly pronounced for men and women within these age groups, with younger users more accepting of such practices.\n\nIn terms of advertisements, a similar trend emerges. While majorities of users across various age categories feel it is not acceptable for social platforms to use their data to serve them ads from political campaigns [6], the data suggest that younger users are more open to receiving product advertisements. For example, 80% of 18-29 year-olds find it acceptable for social media sites to show them ads for products or services, whereas only 36% of users aged 65 and older agree [9].\n\n![Men more likely to see mean content](image1)\n![Women more likely to see supportive content](image2)\n\nThese findings have important implications for how social media platforms can tailor their recommendations or advertisements. Platforms may need to implement more nuanced approaches that account for gender differences in perceptions of content and behavior. For instance, platforms could offer personalized settings where users can specify their preferences for the types of content they wish to see, or they could use demographic data more effectively to target advertisements in a way that aligns with user comfort levels. Given that younger users are more accepting of certain practices, platforms might also consider tailoring their algorithms to better reflect these preferences, especially when it comes to recommending events and products.\n\nIn conclusion, social media platforms should be mindful of the varying perceptions among men and women when designing their recommendation and advertising strategies.

This contrasts sharply with Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, who held an 80% belief that Trump would be unsuccessful [5].\n\nComparing these figures to the beginning of Obama's third year in office, the public's view was quite different. Only 38% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents thought Obama would be successful, while 47% believed it was too early to tell [4], indicating lower certainty and less optimism. Similarly, in December 2003, only 69% of Republicans believed Bush would be successful, with 28% unsure [10]. For Clinton, in February 1995, 54% of Republicans believed she would be unsuccessful, and 43% were uncertain [10].\n\nThe trend shown in the bar graph for Clinton, Bush, and Obama illustrates the evolution of public perception over their presidencies. For instance, Clinton's initial public perception was relatively neutral, with 52% considering her successful and 47% considering her unsuccessful [3]. By the end of her presidency, however, the majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents considered her successful [3].\n\nIn terms of economic policies, the partisan divide has become more pronounced since Trump's election. While Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are highly optimistic about the economy, with 75% rating current economic conditions as excellent or good [7], Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have become increasingly negative, with 46% saying Trump's economic policies have worsened conditions [8].\n\nOverall, the data suggests a significant shift in public perception, particularly among Republicans, towards Trump, mirroring their views on Bush in his third year. However, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents maintain a consistently negative view, similar to their stance on Clinton and Obama.\n\nThe key takeaway is that while Republicans are more optimistic about Trump's long-term success, Democrats remain highly skeptical, leading to a stark partisan divide in both presidential success and economic policy evaluations."}

Republicans are notably more optimistic about Trump's long-term outlook, with about two-thirds (65%) believing he will be a successful president in the long run [6]. In contrast, a large majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (80%) believe Trump will be an unsuccessful president [3].\n\nThis divide in perception is closely tied to levels of confidence in the Mueller investigation. The image `![Trump's Success Perception](image3)` illustrates these contrasting views, showing that Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to see Trump as successful, while Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely to view him as unsuccessful.\n\nRegarding confidence in the Mueller investigation, the image `![Mueller Investigation Confidence](image5)` provides a timeline of public confidence, which has remained relatively stable over time. In January and September 2018, 55% of the public expressed confidence in Mueller's investigation, with a similar figure of 55% in January 2019. However, there is a stark partisan divide in this confidence level. As shown in `![Mueller Confidence Breakdown](image2)`, 72% of Democrats and Democratic leaners are at least somewhat confident in the fairness of Mueller's investigation, whereas only 58% of Republicans and Republican leaners express this level of confidence, with a larger portion (42%) expressing no confidence at all.\n\nIn summary, Republican respondents are more inclined to believe Trump will be a successful president, while Democratic respondents are more likely to see him as unsuccessful. This difference in perception is mirrored in their confidence levels regarding the Mueller investigation, where Democrats have significantly higher confidence compared to Republicans."}

According to the text [1], [2], and [6], a larger percentage of Republicans believe there are plenty of jobs available locally compared to Democrats. For instance, in October 2017, 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally, while currently, 71% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats hold this belief.\n\nThe data also indicates that these views are strongly divided along partisan lines. For example, as shown in the image1, 62% of Republicans and only 44% of Democrats rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good. This further highlights the partisan divide in economic perceptions.\n\nOver time, the public's view of local job availability has become increasingly positive, with a higher proportion of adults saying there are plenty of jobs available in their communities. This trend is evident in the graph presented in image2, which shows that the percentage of people who believe there are plenty of jobs available has risen since October 2017, when 50% of adults said there were plenty of jobs available where they live, and 42% said jobs were difficult to find.\n\nMoreover, the trend in job availability perceptions can be seen in the graph in image3, which tracks the sentiment from 2001 to 2019. The positive view of job availability has been rising consistently, with the highest share recorded since the question was first asked in 2001.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the overall perception of job availability has improved, the perception of \"good jobs\" remains more mixed, as indicated by the graph in image4. This suggests that while the quantity of jobs may be increasing, the quality of these jobs might not be perceived as improving equally across all groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the data and graphs show a strong partisan divide in perceptions of economic conditions and job availability, with Republicans generally holding more positive views than Democrats. Over time, there has been an increase in the positive view of job availability, but the perception of \"good jobs\" remains less favorable.

According to the data, in 2001, only a minority of Americans believed there were plenty of jobs available locally, but by 2019, a clear majority (60%) held this view [6]. This positive trend is consistent across both Republican and Democratic-leaning individuals.\n\nHowever, there remains a significant partisan divide in perceptions of job availability. In October 2017, 71% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats believed there were plenty of jobs available locally [7]. By 2019, these figures had remained largely unchanged, with 71% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats still holding this belief [10].\n\nThis divergence can be seen in the images, where the percentage of Republicans who believe there are plenty of jobs available locally is consistently higher than that of Democrats. For instance, in image1, the percentage of Republicans who think there are plenty of jobs available is around 57%, while Democrats are at 46%. Similarly, in image3, the percentages are 44% for Republicans and 42% for Democrats.\n\nFurthermore, the data indicates that positive views of the economy have also contributed to the perception of job availability. As of 2019, 75% of Republicans rated economic conditions as excellent or good, compared to just 46% of Democrats [9]. This suggests that the perception of job availability is closely tied to broader economic optimism.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of job availability have become more positive overall, but remain highly partisan. While a majority of Americans now believe there are plenty of jobs available, Republicans are significantly more likely to hold this view than Democrats. This trend has persisted since at least 2017, indicating a long-term shift in public opinion."}

This aligns with the text quote [8], which states, \"Republicans more likely to say Wall Street helps U.S. economy; Democrats are more divided on impact.\"\n\nThe image5 further illustrates this division, showing that the gap between Republicans and Democrats' views on Wall Street's impact has widened over time, especially since 2001. The partisan divide is evident, with Republicans consistently maintaining a positive view of Wall Street's impact, while Democrats have fluctuated but generally remained more critical.\n\nRegarding satisfaction levels regarding national conditions, the text quotes provide insight into the significant differences between Republicans and Democrats. For instance, quote [1] indicates that more Republicans (55%) believe that Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, compared to Democrats (31%). Similarly, quote [9] shows that Republican satisfaction with the way things are going in the country has dropped dramatically, with 47% now dissatisfied, down from 59% in September. In contrast, Democrats have consistently expressed low satisfaction levels, with only 26% satisfied at any point during Trump's presidency, as noted in quote [10].\n\nThe image1 depicts the overall dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country, with 70% of Americans dissatisfied, a figure that has notably increased since September. This aligns with the text quote [5], which mentions that public dissatisfaction is higher than at any point in the past year and has increased by 9 percentage points since September.\n\nIn summary, the data reveals a strong partisan divide in opinions about Wall Street's impact on the economy, with Republicans generally more positive and Democrats more divided. This division is mirrored in the levels of satisfaction with national conditions, where Republicans have seen a significant drop in satisfaction, while Democrats have maintained a consistent level of dissatisfaction."}

By 2019, this had shifted significantly, with 70% expressing dissatisfaction and only 26% feeling satisfied [9]. This decline is particularly pronounced among Democrats, who now express an 84% dissatisfaction rate compared to just 16% satisfaction [4][10].\n\nThese trends are closely linked to political affiliations. As shown in image5, there has been a consistent partisan divide over time. For instance, in 1990, George H.W. Bush had a relatively high approval rating among Republicans (56%), while Democrats had a lower approval rating (30%). By 2019, under Donald Trump, the satisfaction among Republicans had fallen to 34%, while Democrats' dissatisfaction reached 70% [5]. This indicates a growing partisan divide, where Democrats and Republicans have increasingly divergent views on national conditions.\n\nIn terms of views on Wall Street's impact on the economy, the data in image4 reveals significant differences between Republicans and Democrats. While 55% of Republicans believe Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, only 31% hold this view. Among Democrats, 41% believe Wall Street hurts the economy more than it helps, and 46% think it helps more [3][7]. This partisan divide is evident across different income groups, as shown in the breakdown of family income categories in image1, where the gap remains substantial.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that public satisfaction levels and political affiliations have become more polarized, leading to a deepening partisan divide on issues like Wall Street's role in the economy. This trend highlights the increasing difficulty in achieving bipartisan agreement on economic policies and national conditions [2][6].\n\n![As many Republicans and Republican leaners say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country as say they are satisfied](image5)"}

Additionally, 30% of Republicans, compared to 82% of Democrats, say that lifting restrictions too quickly is a significant issue (text quote [3]).\n\nThe public also highlights other major reasons for the outbreak's persistence. About 53% of Americans point to an inadequate federal government response as a major reason, while 49% cite a lack of timely testing (text quote [5]). Furthermore, 40% attribute unclear instructions on preventing the spread to the continuation of the outbreak (text quote [5]).\n\n![Democrats and Republicans view the federal government response differently](image1)\n\nIn contrast, the general public, including a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, cites insufficient social distancing as a major reason for the continued spread of the virus (text quote [7]). However, there is a notable difference in perception: 90% of Republicans and 75% of Democrats consider insufficient adherence to social-distancing and mask-wearing guidelines a major reason (text quote [7]).\n\nOverall, the data indicates a significant partisan divide in perceptions of the federal government's role in managing the pandemic, with Democrats generally more critical and citing multiple factors for the outbreak's continuation."}

On the other hand, Republicans are relatively divided on this issue; a majority (62%) believe that the increase in confirmed cases is primarily due to more people being tested, while a significant portion (36%) think that the increase is mainly due to more new infections (image1).\n\nWhen it comes to the timing of lifting restrictions, Democrats are more concerned that state restrictions have been lifted too quickly (93% of liberal Democrats and 88% of conservative and moderate Democrats), while a substantial minority (30%) of Republicans are worried that these restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough (image2). This sentiment is reflected in the data, where liberal and moderate Democrats are more likely to cite \"restrictions have been lifted too quickly\" as a major reason for the continuation of the outbreak (82%), whereas Republicans are more evenly split between these views (image3).\n\nFurthermore, the data also indicates that Democrats tend to blame inadequate social distancing and mask-wearing practices more frequently than Republicans (75% of Democrats vs. 57% of Republicans, as seen in image3). This suggests that Democrats may place more emphasis on individual behavior in controlling the spread of the virus, while Republicans might focus more on the effectiveness of government policies.\n\nIn conclusion, Democrats and Republicans have distinct views on both the reasons for the rise in coronavirus cases and the timing of lifting restrictions. Democrats generally see the increase in cases as due to more infections, and are concerned about the rapidity of reopening, whereas Republicans are more divided and often attribute the rise in cases to increased testing rather than new infections, and are more concerned about the pace of lifting restrictions."}

For instance, a substantial majority of immigrants, Spanish-speaking individuals, and Catholics believe that Democrats work hard to earn Latino votes, with percentages ranging from 44% to 48%. This is further corroborated by [9], which highlights that similar shares of immigrants, Spanish-dominant Latinos, Catholics, and evangelical Protestants say Democrats work hard to earn their votes.\n\nOn the other hand, the perception of Republicans' efforts is much lower. Only 19% of Latinos overall, and just 23% of foreign-born Latinos, say Republicans work hard to earn their votes [6]. This disparity is particularly stark when considering that among Latino Republicans and Republican-leaning conservatives, 40% find the statement \"Republicans work hard to earn Latinos' votes\" describes their views very or extremely well [7]. This suggests that while there is a significant divide in perceptions, the majority of Latinos do not see Republicans making concerted efforts to engage them politically.\n\nMoreover, the differences in perceptions are evident across various demographic groups. For example, [1] indicates that 54% of Hispanic Democrats and 57% of Hispanic Republicans see a great deal of difference between the parties, highlighting a deep-seated ideological divide. The data also show that among Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners, majorities of liberals (70%) and conservatives and moderates (61%) say the statement \"Democrats work hard to earn people's votes\" does not describe their views well [4].\n\nThe image [image2] provides a snapshot of these differences within the broader context of the Latino electorate. It illustrates that while some segments of the Latino population, such as immigrants, Spanish-dominant individuals, and certain religious groups, view Democrats as working hard to earn their votes, others, particularly Republican-leaning conservatives, hold a more positive view of Republicans.\n\nThese findings suggest that the political landscape is complex and multifaceted, with varying degrees of engagement and perceived effort from both Democrats and Republicans. The significant divide in perceptions, especially among certain demographic groups, underscores the importance of tailored outreach strategies from both parties to better connect with and represent the diverse needs and interests of the Latino community.\n\nIn conclusion, the data indicate that while Democrats are generally seen as more active in earning Latino votes, there is still considerable room for improvement, particularly among certain subgroups. This highlights the need for continued efforts to bridge the gap and foster greater understanding and engagement between political parties and Latino voters."}

For instance, among Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners, a majority (56%) believe that the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latinos' votes, which is notably higher compared to the 35% who feel the same way about the Republican Party. Similarly, when asked if the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, 22% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners find this statement extremely well-descriptive, while only 7% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners share this sentiment.\n\nOn the other hand, a larger proportion of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners (36%) feel that the Republican Party really cares about Latinos, compared to 21% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners. These sentiments reflect a complex interplay between party loyalty and perceived party efforts to connect with Latino communities. \n\nFurthermore, the data show that Latino registered voters predominantly identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party, with a margin of 64% to 33%. This trend has remained relatively stable over the past few years, indicating that despite varying perceptions of party efforts, the core allegiance of Latino voters leans Democratic. \n\nHowever, the uncertainty in future party affiliation among Latino voters is notable. A significant portion of Latino voters fall into groups with soft ties to the political parties, suggesting a degree of flexibility in their party identifications. This is evident in the 2021 Pew Research Center study, which indicated that substantial shares of Latino voters do not strongly align with either party.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties' efforts to engage with Latino voters are nuanced and differ based on political affiliations, but these perceptions do not necessarily translate into a shift in party affiliation trends. Despite some skepticism, the overall alignment of Latino voters with the Democratic Party remains strong."}

The survey reveals that fewer than half of Hispanics believe there is a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties, with 45% seeing a great deal of difference and 36% seeing a fair amount of difference. This suggests a moderate level of perceived distinction between the parties [6].\n\nHowever, there is a significant divide in terms of support for these parties. A majority of Hispanic adults have a more positive view of the Democratic Party compared to the Republican Party, with 64% identifying with or leaning towards the Democratic Party over the Republican Party [8]. This support is reflected in the high percentages of Democrats and Democratic leaners who believe the Democratic Party works hard for Latinos' votes, cares about Latinos, and represents their interests [9].\n\nWhen we look at the data over time, the figure in image2 illustrates that while there has been a slight increase in support for the Democratic Party among Hispanics, the trend has remained relatively stable over the past few years. The graph shows that in 2019, 62% of Hispanics identified with or leaned towards the Democratic Party, which increased to 64% in 2022.\n\nIn terms of perceptions of party differences, the data in image3 shows that the percentage of Hispanics who do not see a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties has remained consistent, with 16% believing there is hardly any difference and 34% seeing a fair amount of difference. This indicates that while there is some variation in perceptions, the majority of Hispanics still perceive significant differences between the parties [6].\n\nThe image4 provides further insight into how different segments of the Hispanic population view the Democratic and Republican Parties. While 71% of Democrats and Democratic leaners believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes, only 45% of Republicans and Republican leaners hold the same view. Similarly, 60% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think the Democratic Party represents their interests, compared to just 34% of Republicans and Republican leaners [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of party differences and support for political parties among Hispanics have varied over time but remain largely stable.

This indicates that many Hispanic voters are not strongly polarized along party lines.\n\nThe image1 provides a visual representation of these perceptions, showing that a majority of Hispanics (16%) do not see a great deal of difference between the parties, while a smaller but still considerable number (45%) do. The breakdown also shows that Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners (47%) and Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners (48%) are equally likely to perceive a significant difference between the parties ([1], [8]).\n\nDespite these perceptions, the majority of Latino registered voters continue to identify with or lean towards the Democratic Party by a substantial margin (64% vs. 33%) ([6]). This consistency in party affiliation, as seen in the image2 which shows a steady preference for the Democratic Party over the Republican Party from 2019 to 2022, suggests that while there might be some ambiguity in how these voters view the parties, their overall loyalty remains with the Democratic Party.\n\nHowever, the image3 provides insight into how Latino voters perceive the parties' efforts to earn their support. While the Democratic Party is viewed more positively in terms of caring about Latinos and working to earn their votes, the Republican Party also has a significant number of supporters who feel they are working hard to earn Latino votes. This suggests that the Republican Party has been successful in engaging with and maintaining a base among certain segments of the Latino electorate.\n\nIn terms of the impact on party affiliations, the data from the 2022 survey shows that despite the relatively low levels of perceived difference between the parties, Latino voters remain largely committed to the Democratic Party. However, the high dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and the president, coupled with the fact that only a minority of Latino voters have given much thought to the upcoming elections, indicates that these views could potentially shift in the near future ([9]).\n\nIn conclusion, while there is a perception among a significant portion of Hispanic voters that the Democratic and Republican parties do not differ greatly, the overwhelming majority continue to favor the Democratic Party.

This is further supported by the image showing that women are more likely to face such challenges during their career progression.\n- **Lack of Encouragement from an Early Age**: Another major factor is the lack of encouragement for girls to pursue STEM subjects from an early age [6, 10]. The image indicates that fewer women believe they can succeed in STEM, possibly due to a lack of support and guidance.\n- **Work-Life Balance**: Women also find it more challenging to balance work and family responsibilities in STEM jobs, contributing to their underrepresentation [10].\n\nFor blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs, the main reasons are:\n- **Limited Access to Quality Education**: A significant proportion (73% of black STEM workers and 53% of Hispanic STEM workers) attribute the underrepresentation to limited access to quality education that prepares students for STEM fields [9, 10]. This is illustrated in the image showing the disparity in educational preparation.\n- **Lack of Encouragement**: Similar to women, these groups also feel less encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age [6, 10].\n- **Discrimination in Recruitment, Hiring, and Promotions**: Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to believe that they face discrimination in these areas (72% of black STEM workers and 43% of Hispanic STEM workers) [8].

This suggests that black employees face a higher rate of discrimination in STEM roles. Furthermore, [4] highlights that blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in STEM occupations relative to their share in the U.S. workforce. The share of blacks in STEM jobs has increased from 7% in 1990 to 9%, while Hispanics have increased from 4% to 7%. However, their representation remains lower than their proportion in the overall workforce.\n\nIn terms of gender-based discrimination, [6] and [8] show that women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience workplace discrimination due to their gender. Specifically, 50% of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced any of eight forms of gender discrimination in the workplace, which is notably higher than the 19% of men in STEM jobs who report similar experiences. The most common forms of gender discrimination include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent (29%), and experiencing repeated, small slights in the workplace (20%).\n\nTo further illustrate these points, consider the following image quotes. Image1 provides a detailed breakdown of gender-related discrimination experienced by women in STEM jobs, showing that 78% have ever experienced gender-related discrimination at work, 27% have experienced sexual harassment, and 48% feel their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job.

Image2 compares women in STEM jobs with women in non-STEM jobs, indicating that women in STEM jobs are more likely to experience gender-related discrimination (74%) and feel the need to prove themselves at work (64%). Image3 focuses on gender-related discrimination in computer jobs, where 74% of women report experiencing gender-related discrimination, compared to 16% of men, illustrating a significant disparity. Lastly, Image4 provides a visual representation of the distribution of various STEM job clusters, showing that computer jobs have the lowest percentage of workers (14%) and that sales speech language engineers and pathologists are among the highest-paying job clusters within STEM.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiences of discrimination among racial groups in STEM jobs differ, with black employees reporting the highest rates of discrimination.

Among those who do not self-identify, 27% mentioned a mixed background or distant Hispanic ancestry, 16% cited upbringing or limited contact with Hispanic relatives, 15% noted not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link, 12% said they do not look Hispanic or identify as another race, and 9% stated they were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American ([10]).\n\n![Reasons for not identifying as Hispanic](image2)\n\nThis image further breaks down the reasons why individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not self-identify as Hispanic into categories such as mixed background, distant Hispanic ancestry, upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives, lack of Spanish language or cultural link, not looking Hispanic or identifying as another race, and being born in the U.S. and considering oneself American.\n\nOverall, the factors influencing self-identification include generational distance, cultural and linguistic connections, personal experiences, and perceived racial identity. The image on the right ([image4]) shows that among self-identified Hispanics, 7% have a foreign-born parent, while 20% have a second-generation parent, and 15% have a third or higher generation parent. This suggests that as generations progress, the likelihood of self-identification as Hispanic decreases, likely due to the increasing assimilation into American culture and the weakening of direct ties to the original Hispanic heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the factors that influence self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. across different generations include generational distance, cultural and linguistic connections, personal experiences, and perceived racial identity.

Among immigrant and second-generation self-identified Hispanics, 57% and 50%, respectively, say their parents talked often about their pride in their country of origin roots [10]. However, by the third generation, this figure drops to just 33%. This suggests that as generations move further away from immigration, the connection to the homeland and its cultural traditions becomes less prominent.\n\n![Very/somewhat connected at all](image1) illustrates the varying levels of connection among self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry. The chart indicates that a significant portion (27%) of self-identified Hispanics feel somewhat or very connected, while a larger percentage (56%) of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics feel less connected. Among self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, the majority (78%) feel not very or not at all connected, highlighting the generational gap in cultural and familial ties.\n\nIn terms of language usage, the data from image4 shows that among self-identified Hispanics, 28% are English dominant, 36% are bilingual, and 36% are Spanish dominant. For foreign-born individuals, 32% are English dominant, 61% are bilingual, and 7% are Spanish dominant. Among second-generation self-identified Hispanics, 43% are English dominant, 51% are bilingual, and 6% are Spanish dominant. Third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics show a shift towards English dominance, with 24% being Spanish dominant and 76% being either English dominant or bilingual. Self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are predominantly English dominant (28%), with 36% being bilingual and 36% being Spanish dominant. This linguistic shift further underscores the generational differences in maintaining cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the frequency of attending Latino cultural celebrations and parental pride discussions varies significantly among different generations of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics, with later generations experiencing less continuity in these cultural practices and discussions."}

This suggests that the second generation feels a stronger positive impact from their Hispanic heritage. The image1 illustrates this trend by showing that 56% of self-identified Hispanics find their Hispanic heritage advantageous, with a significant drop to 27% among third or higher generation Hispanics.\n\nFurthermore, the third or higher generation tends to feel less connected to their country of origin compared to the foreign-born and second generation (44% vs. 82% and 69%, respectively) [10].

Although the exact numbers are not provided, it highlights the dynamic nature of these events in both regions.\n\nIn Europe, the venture capital ecosystem has seen significant improvements, leading to higher exit multiples and better capital efficiency compared to the United States [5]. This is evidenced by the fact that European venture-backed companies are sealing deals faster and achieving higher values earlier than ever before [3]. Furthermore, the scarcity of VC money has driven up capital efficiency by roughly 70 percent higher than in the US, and the yield (hit rate) is also higher due to the selective nature of investment [7].\n\nThe image `![Venture Venture invested* $Bn Exits*/** $Bn](image2)` provides a visual representation of the investment and exit trends in Europe and the USA. It shows the amount of venture capital invested and the corresponding exits, illustrating the balance between the two metrics.\n\nAnother key insight comes from `![iis in Multiple sh Invested Europe USA](image3)`, which compares the median exit valuation and the proportion of deals with a multiple of cash equal to 5. Europe has a higher percentage of deals with a multiple of cash equal to 5 at 57.26%, compared to the USA's 41.27%. Additionally, while the average exit values in Europe are about 25% smaller than in the USA, lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency compensate for this disadvantage [10].\n\nOverall, the data and visual evidence indicate that venture-backed liquidity events in Europe are more favorable in terms of exit multiples and capital efficiency, despite lower average exit values. This suggests that the European venture capital market is maturing and becoming more efficient compared to its US counterpart [8]."}

The higher capital efficiency translates into better performance, as evidenced by the higher exit multiples and median exit valuations in Europe.\n\nIn contrast, the image1 also shows that while the USA has a larger number of exits, the percentage of exits achieving a multiple of 5 or higher is lower. This suggests that although there are more exits in the US, the quality and value of these exits may be less impressive compared to those in Europe.\n\nMoreover, the performance of European VC-backed IPOs matches or exceeds US performance, both pre- and post-IPO, as mentioned in quote [6]. This indicates that European companies are performing well on the stock market, further highlighting the strong exit values in Europe.\n\nThe image2, though not explicitly described, likely compares the invested amounts and exits between Europe and the USA, supporting the notion that despite having fewer exits, the quality and value of exits in Europe are superior.\n\nIn conclusion, the venture capital performance in Europe outperforms that in the USA in terms of investment multiples and exit values, primarily due to higher capital efficiency and a greater proportion of successful exits."}

Inside the household, mobile phones are the primary device for radio listening, accounting for 88% of the responses, while computers and internet-based devices like office laptops have much lower usage rates (10%, 2.4%, respectively) [10]. In contrast, outside the household, the data suggests that people do not use any of the listed devices (radio, computer, internet, television) for radio listening, indicating a significant shift away from traditional radio listening methods [1].\n\nThis trend can also be seen in the breakdown of demographics. In urban areas, 70% of respondents listen to the radio on their mobile phones, whereas in rural areas, only 70% use mobile phones, but 30% still use the radio itself [3]. This suggests that while mobile phones are becoming more popular, there is still a segment of the population that prefers traditional radio [3].\n\nThe images further support these findings. Image1 highlights that out of all the listed devices, mobile phones are the most commonly used for radio listening, followed by computers and internet devices. However, it also indicates that none of these devices are used outside the household for radio listening, implying a preference for traditional radio or other methods [1].\n\nImage3 provides more detail on the devices used for radio listening. It shows that 70% of respondents in both rural and urban areas prefer to listen to the radio via mobile phones, with only 13% using the radio itself [3]. This data aligns with the finding that 70% of respondents in urban areas and 30% in rural areas listen to the radio on mobile phones [3].\n\nIn terms of frequency, Image4 reveals that people listen to the radio on mobile phones relatively frequently, with 79% responding that they listen at least once a week [2]. This high frequency of use suggests that even though traditional radio may be less common, mobile phone-based radio remains a significant part of daily life for many individuals.\n\nOverall, the data indicates a shift towards mobile phone-based radio listening inside the household, while outside the household, traditional radio remains more prevalent. This difference is particularly noticeable among younger and urban populations who are more likely to use mobile phones for radio listening [3]. The preference for mobile phones over other devices suggests that people value convenience and accessibility, which mobile phones provide [1].\n\n![People primarily use mobile phones for radio listening inside the household, while outside the household, traditional radio remains more common.](image3)\n![Mobile phones are the most preferred device for radio listening, especially in urban areas, where 70% of respondents use them.](image3)"}

This trend is corroborated by the decline in SMS and voice ARPU, as seen in image1, which illustrates a reduction in Voice ARPU from 2013 to 2014 and a further decrease in SMS ARPU during the same period.\n\nThe shift towards data usage can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the rise in smartphone adoption led to a greater reliance on data-based communication methods such as instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP), as mentioned in quote [1]. Secondly, the competitive landscape saw a reduction in tariffs, driven by CDMA operators forcing GSM operators to lower their prices [2], making data plans more affordable. Additionally, government-led price wars initially caused a significant drop in Average Revenue Per User (ARP U) [3], but this was followed by a continued trend of declining ARP U until 2015, primarily due to the increasing usage of the mobile Internet [7].\n\nAs shown in image5, Telkomsel experienced a notable increase in data users from 38 million in 2013 to 43 million in 2014, suggesting a growing demand for data-based services. This aligns with the overall trend of declining Voice and SMS ARPU and increasing Data ARPU, as illustrated in image1. The data usage patterns indicate that users are shifting from traditional voice and text-based communications to more data-intensive activities, leading to a reduction in ARPU for these services.\n\nIn conclusion, the subscriber base and ARPU changes for Telkomsel from 2013 to 2014 were significantly influenced by the growth in smartphone adoption, competitive pricing strategies, and the increasing preference for data-based communication services."}

Image2 illustrates the decline in Voice ARPU from 13.0 in 2013 to a lower value by 2014, reflecting the ongoing trend of users reducing their voice call usage.\n\n![ARPU trends for voice and SMS](image2)\n\nThis shift towards data-based services has led to a decrease in ARPU for voice and SMS, as highlighted in the text quotes [2] and [5]. The continued trend of declining ARPU for voice and SMS is expected to persist until 2015, as more users enroll in larger data plans due to increased mobile internet usage, compensating for the reduced voice and SMS revenue.\n\nThe increase in smartphone users and the corresponding decline in ARPU for voice and SMS can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, as mentioned in quote [3], CDMA operators were able to force GSM operators to reduce their tariffs, leading to a price war. However, by late 2014, as indicated in quote [10], tariffs had reached rock-bottom, and there would no longer be any price wars. This suggests that the initial decline in ARPU was primarily driven by the aggressive pricing strategies of telecom operators, but as prices stabilized, the trend continued due to the growing preference for data services over traditional voice and SMS.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise in smartphone users and the decline in ARPU for voice and SMS from 2013 to 2014 for Telkomsel and XL can be largely attributed to the shift towards data-based communication and the stabilization of tariffs following the initial price war."}

This chart visually represents the market share percentages across different years, indicating that Android has been growing steadily, while iOS has maintained a consistent but smaller share.\n\nIn terms of app distribution, the Google Play Store has seen an impressive growth in the number of apps, as highlighted in quote [3], where it is noted that the number of apps grew by over 50% last year, reaching over 1.6 million apps compared to Apple's App Store with around 1.5 million apps. This is illustrated in image4, which shows the revenue growth in the Google Play Store, indicating a steady increase from 2012 to 2015, with a peak of 45.37 billion dollars in 2015.\n\nHowever, the image5 provides a snapshot of the current market share distribution, showing that Android holds approximately 60% of the market, followed closely by iOS with around 23%, with other platforms like Windows Phone and Blackberry having minimal shares. This aligns with the data in text quote [1], which states that Android developers outnumber iOS developers by a ratio of 4 to 3, and only 2% of mobile developers identify as Windows Phone developers.\n\nThe interplay between these figures suggests that the majority of developers focus on Android due to its larger market share, leading to a greater number of apps available on the Google Play Store. Conversely, despite the significant number of apps in the Google Play Store, the revenue generated from mobile apps, as seen in image2, indicates a strong presence of mobile e-commerce, contributing to a total of 45.37 billion dollars in 2015, with mobile commerce accounting for a substantial portion of this amount.\n\nIn conclusion, the market share of mobile operating systems, particularly Android and iOS, significantly impacts the distribution and revenue generation of apps in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store."}

Let's break down the comparison step-by-step.\n\nAndroid, which started strong and maintained a steady growth, saw its market share increase from around 19.8% in 2012 [3] to approximately 23% by 2014, as shown in the pie chart (image3). During this period, the number of apps in the Google Play Store grew substantially, as indicated by the 50% increase in the number of apps from 2014 to 2015, reaching over 1.6 million apps compared to Apple's App Store, which had only 1.5 million apps [3]. This growth in app numbers aligns with the rising market share of Android, suggesting a positive correlation between the two metrics.\n\nOn the other hand, iOS, as depicted in the line graph (image4), experienced a steady rise in market share, particularly with the release of iOS 9, which reached a significant milestone with over 50% adoption rate within a year [8]. However, the exact market share percentages for iOS during these years are not explicitly stated in the given text quotes, but it's evident from the line graph (image4) that iOS maintained a substantial share, peaking at nearly 80% in 2015.\n\nWindows Phone, as indicated by the line graph (image2), showed a declining trend, dropping from around 100% in 2012 to less than 20% by 2015, reflecting a significant market share loss. Similarly, BlackBerry's market share also declined, as seen in the same graph, dropping from around 34.99% in 2011 to less than 8% by 2015.\n\nThe pie chart (image3) provides a visual representation of the market shares for each OS in 2015, showing Android with a 23% share, iOS with an approximate 80% share, Windows Phone with a minimal 2%, and BlackBerry with a negligible share.\n\nIn conclusion, the market shares of different mobile operating systems have shifted significantly over the years, with Android and iOS dominating the market, while Windows Phone and BlackBerry have seen a decline. Concurrently, the number of apps in the Google Play Store has surged, indicating a robust ecosystem for Android developers, whereas Apple's App Store, despite having fewer apps, has a higher market share, likely due to its exclusive nature and the quality of its offerings. \n\n![Market shares and app store growth](image4)"}

Specifically, the Google Play Store saw a growth of over 50% in the number of apps, reaching 1.6 million in 2015, compared to 1.5 million in the Apple App Store, which is only about 17% more (quote [9]). This rapid expansion in the number of apps correlates with the revenue trends in the mobile app industry, where mobile e-commerce was projected to account for $30 billion of mobile sales in 2015, and apps to resales were generating approximately $45.37 billion in revenues (quote [10]).\n\n![](image1) This graph illustrates the exponential growth in the number of apps across different years, showing a significant increase from 2011 to 2015. The trend suggests that the more apps available, the higher the potential for revenue generation, as consumers have a wider range of options to choose from.\n\nThe revenue growth in the mobile app industry is also evident from the data. As the number of apps grew, so did the revenue, indicating a strong positive correlation between the two metrics. This can be seen in the revenue growth trends shown in [5].\n\nIn summary, the trends in the number of mobile apps available in different app stores, particularly the rapid growth of the Google Play Store, are closely related to the revenue trends in the mobile app industry. The increasing number of apps provides a fertile ground for higher revenues, driven by the expanding market and consumer demand.\n\n![The increasing number of apps correlates with higher revenue in the mobile app industry](image1)"}

Specifically, the table in image4 provides a detailed breakdown of how different positional encoding strategies affect the AP. \n\nFor instance, when no spatial positional encodings are passed at the input and only output positional encodings are learned at the input, the model achieves an AP of 32.8, which is a notable 7.8 AP drop compared to the baseline (last row) [7]. On the other hand, when fixed sine positional encodings are passed at the input and output, the AP drops by 1.4 compared to the baseline [7].\n\nMoreover, the table also shows that learned spatial positional encodings passed to the attentions lead to similar results as the baseline, indicating that learned positional encodings can effectively compensate for the lack of spatial positional encodings in the encoder [7]. Notably, not passing any spatial positional encodings in the encoder only leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 [7], suggesting that spatial positional encodings are less critical in the encoder compared to the decoder.\n\nThe image4 also illustrates the impact of different loss configurations on AP. As shown, the model's performance varies depending on whether positional encodings are passed at the input or within the attention layers.

While spatial positional encodings in the decoder are more impactful, their absence in the encoder leads to a minor AP drop. The choice of learning vs. fixed positional encodings and their placement (input vs. attention layers) significantly influences the final AP, with learned positional encodings at the attention layers generally yielding better performance [7]."}

Specifically, as shown in image2, the performance gap between ProgramFC and one-step retrieval is significant, with ProgramFC achieving a recall of over 77% on HOVER 4-hop claims, whereas one-step retrieval achieves only around 50%. This indicates that iterative retrieval guided by the reasoning program in ProgramFC yields better results, as it can capture information that is only revealed during the reasoning process (see quote [6] and image5).\n\nFurthermore, image4 provides a direct comparison between ProgramFC and FLAN-T5 across different datasets and model sizes. For 4-hop claims, the performance of the FLAN-T5 model drops significantly with decreasing model size, while the performance of the ProgramFC model remains relatively stable. For instance, at the smallest model size (80M parameters), the ProgramFC model achieves a score of 54.27, which is comparable to the FLAN-T5 model's score of 48.27 at the largest model size (11B parameters). This demonstrates that the high-level reasoning plan offered by the reasoning programs in ProgramFC substantially alleviates the demands on the subsequent sub-task solvers, making it particularly effective for smaller models (see quote [8]).\n\nIn conclusion, the ProgramFC model consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 in terms of F1 scores across different model sizes and task complexities, especially for smaller models.

As illustrated in image3, ProgramFC shows consistent performance improvements as the number of reasoning hops increases, achieving higher scores on HOVER (4-hop) compared to end-to-end models. This trend is evident from the figures, where ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5 across various model sizes for 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop tasks. The macro-F1 scores for ProgramFC on HOVER 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop are 80%, 70%, and 68.56%, respectively, while FLAN-T5 scores are 48.27%, 52.11%, and 51.13%.\n\n![ProgramFC outperforms end-to-end models on HOVER tasks](image3)\n\nMoreover, ProgramFC's performance is enhanced when combined with iterative retrieval, as shown in image4.

This is particularly advantageous for complex claims that require multiple steps of reasoning, as seen in the HOVER 4-hop task where the improvement is significant at 37.1%.\n\n![Iterative retrieval guided by reasoning program yields better results](image4)\n\nHowever, ProgramFC's performance is not without its challenges. As depicted in image1, the error types in the generated reasoning programs show a notable increase in semantic errors, especially for 4-hop claims. Semantic errors include incorrect or missing arguments/variables, incorrect program structure, and incorrect sub-task calls. The error rates for token, structure, and subtask errors are 18%, 57%, and 2% for 4-hop claims, respectively. Additionally, incorrect execution errors, where the program is syntactically correct but produces incorrect predictions due to its execution, are also a concern, accounting for 23% of the errors in 4-hop claims.\n\n![Error distribution in generated reasoning programs](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, ProgramFC effectively balances model capability, learning efficiency, and interpretability, making it a promising model for fact-checking complex claims.

Specifically, for 2-hop claims, semantic errors account for 29%, while for 3-hop claims, this figure rises to 38%, and for 4-hop claims, it dramatically increases to 71%. These errors can be categorized into three subtypes: token errors (8% for 2-hop, 20% for 3-hop, 18% for 4-hop), structure errors (19% for 2-hop, 13% for 3-hop, 57% for 4-hop), and subtask errors (2% for 2-hop, 5% for 3-hop, 2% for 4-hop). Additionally, incorrect execution errors also become more prevalent, especially for 4-hop claims, where they account for 23%.\n\nNow, let's look at how model performance varies across these scenarios. The performance metrics are presented in [Table 3], which shows that most models achieve a Macro-F1 score only slightly above random guessing on the HOVER dataset. The table indicates that as the number of required reasoning hops increases, the performance improves. Chain-of-thought prompting scores an average 2.7 points higher than direct prompting, which underscores the importance of step-by-step reasoning for complex fact-checking tasks.\n\nFor the HOVER dataset, [Figure 1] and [Figure 2] provide a detailed comparison of the performance of different models across 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims. For 2-hop claims, models like DeBERTaV3-NLI perform comparably to ProgramFC, suggesting that large-scale pre-training on simpler claims can help models generalize to more complex ones. However, for 3-hop and 4-hop claims, ProgramFC outperforms other models, achieving an average improvement of 10.38%, 11.37%, and 14.77% over the baselines, respectively.\n\nIn summary, the complexity of the claims in HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets affects both the types and frequency of errors, with semantic errors becoming more prevalent as the number of hops increases.

Specifically, the effectiveness of diverse instruction strategies and the number of demonstrations can influence the outcomes of information extraction tasks. For instance, ChatGPT and CODEX demonstrate similar performance across various tasks, but their performance can be affected by the number of demonstrations and the selection strategy used (quote [2], [3]).\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can visualize these impacts. **Figure 3** (image3) illustrates the impact of instruction format and demonstration number on the performance of ChatGPT and CODEX on a hypothetical dataset. The figure shows that the performance of ChatGPT and CODEX can vary depending on the number of demonstrations and the selection strategy used. For example, increasing the number of demonstrations generally improves performance, but the choice of the selection strategy (e.g., random, sentence embedding, EPR) can also play a significant role.\n\nAdditionally, **Table 13** (image10) provides a detailed comparison of F1 scores under different selection strategies, showing that both sentence embedding and EPR outperform random sampling.

The estimated proportions of these errors are illustrated in image3, where Grounding errors account for 50%, Ambiguity errors for 22%, Calculation errors for 20%, and Program errors for 8%.\n\nThese error types are closely related to the distribution of reasoning steps in the dataset. As mentioned in quote [2], numerical reasoning involves understanding and interpreting the differences between percentages, such as the $7.5\\%$ difference between $57.5\\%$ and $50\\%$. This indicates that the dataset requires various levels of reasoning, including basic arithmetic and more complex interpretations.\n\nFurthermore, the error types in the ScITab dataset highlight the challenges faced by models when processing scientific claims. For instance, Grounding errors (50%) suggest that models struggle with accurately referencing specific cells in the table, which aligns with the need for precise reasoning steps as seen in the distribution of reasoning steps. Ambiguity errors (22%) indicate that the dataset includes claims with unclear or ambiguous expressions, which could contribute to the complexity of reasoning steps.\n\nCalculation errors (20%) and Program errors (8%) further emphasize the need for robust numerical reasoning capabilities. Calculation errors might arise from incorrect arithmetic, while Program errors could stem from logical mistakes in the code generated by the model.

This indicates that Otter excels in tasks requiring understanding of visual data and generating accurate captions.\n\nFor few-shot in-context learning evaluation, Otter's performance on the COCO Caption dataset [12] is noteworthy. According to Fig. 6 (c), Otter outperforms Open Flamingo, the base model it was finetuned from, by a significant margin on COCO caption (CIDEr) few-shot evaluation. This improvement underscores Otter's enhanced capability to learn from limited examples, a crucial trait for practical applications where labeled data might be scarce.\n\n![Otter outperforms other models in MMAGIBench and COCO captioning](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, Otter's performance in MMAGIBench and few-shot in-context learning evaluations for COCO captions is superior to that of other models, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in handling complex visual and linguistic tasks."}

According to the figures, Llama 2-Chat has a lower overall violation percentage across different model sizes, suggesting that it is safer than many other models. For instance, in Figure 3, Llama 2-Chat has a comparable or lower overall violation percentage across model sizes, while ChatGPT and Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) come next, then MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023).\n\n![](image3) ![](image4)\n\nHowever, it's important to interpret these results carefully, as they are influenced by factors such as the limitations of the prompt set, subjective review guidelines, content standards, and the subjectivity of individual raters. As mentioned in quote [3], manual analysis revealed that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), making it less prone to generating unsafe content but also less helpful. Consequently, even though Falcon and Llama 2-Chat (34B) have similar violation percentages (3.88 vs. 4.45), Llama 2-Chat receives a higher average rating due to its greater helpfulness.\n\nSeveral training processes contribute to the safety features of Llama 2-Chat models. These include the use of safety-specific data annotation and tuning, red-teaming, and iterative evaluations. For example, the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat involved performing more robust data cleaning, updating data mixes, and training on 40% more total tokens (quote [5]). Additionally, doubling the context length and adopting grouped-query attention (GQA) helped improve inference scalability for larger models (quote [5]).\n\n![](image1)\n\nIn Figure 1, the Safety Reward Model, which is part of the training process, plays a crucial role in ensuring that the models learn to produce safe and helpful responses. The model uses human preference data to optimize the reward function, thereby guiding the learning process towards more desirable outcomes. The figure illustrates the workflow from pretraining data to the application of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to retrain the model, ultimately leading to a more aligned and safer model.\n\nIn conclusion, Llama 2-Chat models exhibit superior safety performance compared to many other AI models, thanks to rigorous training processes that emphasize safety and alignment with human values."}

The calculations indicate that the training of the LLaMA 2 family of models resulted in a total of 539 t CO₂eq of carbon emissions, with 100% of these emissions being offset by Meta’s sustainability program. This is illustrated in the graph `![Environmental Impact](image2)`, where the carbon emitted per GPU hour is clearly shown, with the LLaMA 2 70B model contributing to a substantial portion of the total emissions.\n\nIn terms of performance, the LLaMA 2 model compares favorably with other models.

However, there is still a notable gap between LLaMA 2 70B and models like GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L.\n\nThe text [10] further supports this, indicating that LLaMA 2 models outperform their predecessors, such as LLaMA 1, and also surpass models like MPT and Falcon in various benchmarks. Specifically, LLaMA 2 70B improves results on MMLU and BBH by approximately 5 and 8 points, respectively, compared to LLaMA 1 65B.\n\nIn summary, while the LLaMA 2 model demonstrates strong performance in various benchmarks, it also comes with a significant environmental impact due to its high computational requirements."}

Llama 2 7B and 34B models also outperform Falcon 7B and 40B models on all categories of benchmarks, indicating a broad range of performance improvements (text quote [1]).\n\nThe performance of Llama 2 70B is notably close to GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023) on MMLU and GSM8K, but it lags behind on coding benchmarks. On almost all benchmarks, Llama 2 70B performs on par or better than PaLM (540B) (Chowdhery et al., 2022), though it still falls short of GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L in certain areas (text quote [3]).

The 70B model, for instance, requires 1.7 million GPU hours, which is significantly more than smaller models like Llama 1 65B. This high resource requirement is indicative of the extensive training needed to achieve the model's impressive performance.\n\nMoreover, Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models and are on par with some of the closed-source models, especially in terms of helpfulness and safety, according to human evaluations (text quote [2]). The fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models show great improvement over the pretrained Llama 2 in terms of truthfulness and toxicity, with the percentage of toxic generations shrinking to effectively 0% for Llama 2-Chat of all sizes (text quote [6]).

As seen in the figure describing the \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence\" (image3), the recall remains relatively stable at about 15 even as more knowledge is removed, indicating that the current LLMs have some capability to identify the absence of knowledge to a limited extent. However, precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, suggesting that as more knowledge is absent from the provided knowledge graph, the model's ability to locate and cite the correct knowledge improves (Figure 3).\n\n![The model's ability to identify the absence of knowledge improves as more knowledge is removed.](image3)\n\nThis improvement in locating absent knowledge is crucial in the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting, where the coverage of the knowledge graph is worse. As the coverage issue becomes more severe, the model increasingly recognizes the need for knowledge that is missing, thereby enhancing its ability to generate answers with high-quality citations (Figure 5).\n\nIn the context of retrieval analysis, the impact of poor retrieval quality on recall is much more significant than on precision. This is evident from the figure showing the \"Micro Macro\" results (image4), where the drop in recall is nearly linear as retrieval accuracy decreases, while the impact on precision is less noticeable. This indicates that the model can filter out incorrect knowledge to a certain extent, leading to less noticeable precision loss compared to recall loss.\n\nThese findings imply that while the models struggle with recall in scenarios where the knowledge graph coverage is poor, they can effectively handle the absence of knowledge by adjusting their retrieval strategies. As a result, when retrieval accuracy is reasonably high, the correctness of citations is not the most significant concern compared to recall. Thus, the models demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the knowledge landscape, allowing them to generate high-quality citations even when some knowledge is missing.\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of knowledge elements affects precision, recall, and F1-Score in such a way that the model's ability to handle absent knowledge improves, highlighting the importance of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts."}

Specifically, as the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 5, there is an evident improvement in performance, but the subsequent improvements become limited when increasing the number of demonstrations beyond 10. This suggests that the initial addition of demonstration samples significantly enhances the model's performance, but additional samples offer diminishing returns.\n\nIn **image5**, we observe the effect of logical constraints on model performance across different datasets. For MAVEN-ERE, the introduction of logical constraints leads to a slight increase in performance, particularly when using all logical constraints rather than just retrieved ones. The performance boost is more pronounced with the retrieval-based approach, indicating that obtaining relevant logical constraints is crucial for improving model performance. Similarly, for Causal-TimeBank, the use of logical constraints also brings about a modest but consistent improvement, although the effect is less dramatic compared to MAVEN-ERE.\n\nConsidering both the text and image quotes, the relationship between logical consistency and model performance is intricate. As highlighted in **quote [3]**, adding relevant logic directly to the model's instructions can significantly improve its performance on reasoning tasks, while irrelevant logic can introduce fluctuations. This aligns with the findings in **image5**, where the performance gains from logical constraints are more substantial when they are relevant.\n\nIn summary, the use of logical constraints and demonstration samples can effectively enhance the performance of different models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, but the benefits diminish after a certain point, and the relevance of the logical constraints is key to achieving consistent improvements. ![Logical constraints and demonstration samples impact on model performance](image4) ![Performance impact of logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank](image5)"}

As illustrated, adding logical constraints into the LLM instructions provides stable improvements in reducing logical inconsistency. For instance, in MAVEN-ERE, the model with all logical constraints achieves a lower logical inconsistency rate of 8.3% compared to the baseline without logical constraints, which has a higher rate of 20.0%. Similarly, in Causal-TimeBank, the model with all logical constraints shows a significant reduction in logical inconsistency, from 35.5% to 2.0%.\n\nPost-processing, on the other hand, eliminates logical inconsistencies completely (as shown in rows labeled with 'post-processing'), but this comes at the cost of potentially affecting the quality of the entire generation. Post-processing ensures no logical conflicts but may introduce randomness and reduce the diversity of generated outputs. This trade-off is highlighted in the results, where post-processing leads to a higher micro-F1 score but at the expense of logical consistency.\n\nIn conclusion, logical constraints are effective in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models, while post-processing can completely eliminate logical conflicts but may degrade the overall quality of the output."}

Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification [3], indicating that venues can be beneficial for certain tasks but may introduce noise for others. Interestingly, including authors as an input actually hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and suboptimal tokenization [3]. However, adding the abstract improves performance, suggesting that the abstract is a crucial component for effective document embeddings.\n\nComparing SPECTER with SciBERT, the visualized embeddings in image1 show that SPECTER is better at encoding topical information, with more compact clusters and some examples of cross-topic relatedness [8]. Quantitatively, the homogeneity and completeness values for SPECTER are 0.41 and 0.72, respectively, compared to SciBERT's 0.19 and 0.63, indicating a clearer separation of topics [8].\n\nIn terms of fine-tuning, while SPECTER does not require fine-tuning, fine-tuning SciBERT on specific tasks generally yields inferior performance compared to using fixed representations from SPECTER [10].

Conversely, for languages from different families, such as Russian and English, the increase in BLEU scores due to alignment is minimal, suggesting that the benefits of alignment are more pronounced when the source and target languages share more linguistic similarities.\n\nOverall, the alignment of word embeddings can be beneficial for improving BLEU scores, particularly in smaller datasets and for languages with more similar linguistic features, but its impact varies across different translation tasks. The results suggest that while alignment can enhance performance in certain scenarios, it may not always provide a substantial advantage, especially when dealing with large datasets or dissimilar language pairs."}

As shown in the dataset comparisons (Figure 1), pre-training generally enhances the translation performance for the entire vocabulary, especially for low-frequency words. This improvement is particularly noticeable in less resource-rich scenarios, such as the comparison between German to English (GL > EN) and Portuguese to English (PT > EN), where the gains in BLEU scores are significant (see image1).\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of pre-training varies depending on the similarity between the source and target languages. For instance, in the case of more similar language pairs, such as French to Portuguese (FR > PT) and Italian to Portuguese (IT > PT), the gains in BLEU scores are substantial (see image3). However, for less similar language pairs, like Russian to Portuguese (Ru > PT) and Hebrew to Portuguese (HE > PT), the improvements are smaller (see image3).\n\nTraining set size also influences the impact of pre-training. As indicated in Figure 6, the increase in BLEU scores tends to be more pronounced when the baseline BLEU scores are moderate (around 3-4), suggesting that a certain level of initial performance is necessary for pre-training to take effect effectively (quote [9]). This finding is further supported by the observations in the qualitative analysis of translations, where pre-trained models show improved grammatical correctness and handle rare vocabulary better (see Table 6 in quote [7]).\n\nFurthermore, the alignment of word embeddings can significantly enhance the translation quality, particularly in multilingual training scenarios. As demonstrated in Table 5 (quote [2]), pre-trained embeddings help to increase BLEU scores for all translation pairs, especially when the languages are more similar (quote [3]). This is due to the fact that aligning embeddings ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are in similar vector spaces, facilitating a more effective learning process (quote [3]).\n\nIn summary, pre-training of word embeddings improves translation accuracy across different language pairs, with the effect being more pronounced in low-resource and more similar language pairs. Training set size and language similarity play critical roles in determining the extent of this improvement. As the training set size increases and the languages become more dissimilar, the benefits of pre-training diminish, highlighting the need for careful consideration of these factors in NMT systems."}

As illustrated in image3, when comparing the performance of bilingual (bi) and multilingual (multi) systems, the alignment of word embeddings leads to increased BLEU scores for all three tasks.

This suggests that pre-trained embeddings provide better representations of less common concepts, enhancing the model's ability to handle rare vocabulary (image8).\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings is beneficial in multilingual translation scenarios, as it allows the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language, thereby improving translation performance. Additionally, pre-training and alignment of embeddings lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of translating low-frequency words, as evidenced by the F-measure scores."}

This suggests that R-GCN plays a crucial role in capturing the predictive context features, even when the model does not have access to a strong pre-trained encoder like ELMo.\n\nWhen we remove relation types (No relation types), the performance remains relatively stable at 62.7 in the unmasked condition and 63.9 in the masked condition. However, the performance is still lower compared to the full model, indicating that while relation types are important, they are not as critical as R-GCN.\n\nSpecifically, removing DOC-BASED connections (No DOC-BASED) has a less significant impact, with performance improving slightly to 62.9 in the unmasked condition and 65.8 in the masked condition.

This suggests that exact matching between mentions is crucial, especially in the masked condition where the model relies heavily on such matches to infer coreference links.\n\nCOREF connections (No COREF) show a similar pattern, with performance improving to 64.8 in the unmasked condition. However, the performance drops significantly in the masked condition, indicating that the out-of-domain coreference system may not always provide reliable information, especially when the documents are more challenging.\n\nFinally, removing COMPLEMENT edges (No COMPLEMENT) shows a slight improvement, with performance increasing to 64.1 in the unmasked condition and 70.3 in the masked condition.

However, in the unmasked setting, the presence of coreference links seems to degrade the model's performance, as indicated by the drop in accuracy when using the coreference system in the masked setting.\n\nTo illustrate this further, let's take a look at the relevant part of the table from Image1, which compares the performance of the Entity-GCN model with and without coreference information in both unmasked and masked settings:\n\n```markdown\nModel unmasked masked\n...\nNo coreference 64.8 —\nEntity-GCN with coreference (single model) 66.4 65.3) — -\n```\n\nThis table clearly shows that the addition of coreference links improves performance in the masked setting but leads to a slight decrease in performance in the unmasked setting. The reason for this difference lies in the nature of the masked setting, where coreference links help in identifying mentions that refer to the same entity, whereas in the unmasked setting, the coreference system might introduce errors due to the complexity of handling diverse mentions and their relationships.\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of coreference information positively impacts the Entity-GCN model's performance in the masked setting, but negatively affects it in the unmasked setting."}

Specifically, for the hotel domain, GEM maintains a joint accuracy of \\(53.54\\%\\) after fine-tuning, whereas naive fine-tuning drops to \\(36.08\\%\\), and EWC achieves \\(40.82\\%\\). This demonstrates that GEM is effective in maintaining the model's performance across multiple domains, mitigating catastrophic forgetting [5, 9].\n\nMoreover, as seen in image2 and image3, fine-tuning with GEM generally yields better results on new domain data compared to training from scratch. For instance, when fine-tuning on the hotel domain using only \\(1\\%\\) of the new domain data, GEM achieves \\(54.31\\%\\) joint accuracy, significantly higher than the \\(19.73\\%\\) achieved by naive fine-tuning [9]. Similarly, for the attraction domain, GEM achieves \\(34.73\\%\\) joint accuracy, outperforming the \\(29.39\\%\\) obtained through naive fine-tuning [9].\n\nSlot similarities play a crucial role in performance. As depicted in image4, certain slots such as \"hotel-name,\" \"restaurant-name,\" and \"attraction-name\" have no errors, indicating that these slots are well understood and consistently tracked. However, some slots like \"hotel-stars,\" \"hotel-book stay,\" and \"restaurant-book time\" exhibit higher error rates, suggesting challenges in accurately tracking these specific slot values. This is further highlighted in image5, where slots related to parking, internet, and food have higher error rates, indicating difficulties in transferring knowledge to less common or more complex slot values.\n\nIn summary, GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in maintaining performance across both original and new domains, especially when dealing with slot similarities and complexities. This is evident from the superior joint accuracy achieved by GEM in both the evaluation on the original domains and the new domain settings [9]."}

Let's delve into the details.\n\nFirstly, the accuracy of translations can vary significantly between languages and systems. For instance, when looking at the performance of Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN on Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK), Hebrew (HE), Arabic (AR), and German (DE), we notice considerable differences. Table 4, depicted in `image2`, provides a detailed breakdown of the accuracy metrics (`Acc` for overall accuracy, `Ag` for agreement, and `As` for accuracy) for these systems across different languages. Notably, German stands out with higher performance, possibly due to its structural similarities to English [8].\n\nMoreover, the overall accuracy of the translation systems varies. For example, in Spanish, Google Translate has an accuracy of 53.1%, while in Russian, the same system drops to 37.7%. This variability highlights the challenges MT systems face in accurately translating gender in different languages.\n\nIn terms of gender bias, the results are even more striking. Across all tested languages, the systems tend to perform worse on anti-stereotypical gender role assignments compared to pro-stereotypical ones. For instance, Google Translate's performance is significantly better when translating stereotypical roles like \"female nurse\" versus \"male receptionist\" [1]. This is supported by the findings in Table 2, where the difference in performance (`ΔG` and `ΔS`) between masculine and feminine scores, and between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments, respectively, are highlighted. The numbers in bold in Table 2 indicate the best accuracy for each language across MT systems, and underlined numbers represent the best accuracy for each MT system across languages. These metrics suggest that all tested systems are more prone to gender bias.\n\nTo further illustrate, `image3` shows the accuracy percentages for different languages, indicating that the overall accuracy can range from around 20% to over 60%. This variability is consistent with the findings in Table 4, where the accuracy ranges from 45.6% to 74.1%.\n\nAdditionally, the gender bias evaluation method devised by the researchers revealed significant gender biases across all tested languages. The method, which relies on morphological analysis and coreference resolution datasets, confirmed that all tested MT systems are gender-biased, with some performing better than others but still showing notable discrepancies [3].\n\nFor example, when comparing the performance of Google Translate on the original WinoMT corpus and a modified version with stereotypical gender adjectives, we see a significant improvement in accuracy, as shown in `image5`. This suggests that adding context can help mitigate some of the gender biases.\n\nIn conclusion, the translation accuracy and gender bias across different machine translation systems and languages are highly variable. While some systems perform better in certain languages, all tested systems exhibit gender biases, particularly in translating anti-stereotypical roles. This underscores the need for continued research and development to address these biases in MT systems."}

For instance, when \"pretty\" and \"handsome\" adjectives were added to the dataset, Google Translate showed improved performance in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, as depicted in the adjusted accuracy rates in image2. The performance on these languages increased from 53.1%, 37.7%, and 38.4% to 63.5%, 48.9%, and 42.9%, respectively, indicating a notable improvement in gender accuracy. This suggests that adding such adjectives can mitigate the tendency of translation systems to default to gender stereotypes, especially in languages where such adjectives have a strong influence on the translation outcome.\n\nIn contrast, the impact varies across different languages. For example, in French (image4), the addition of adjectives did not significantly alter the translation accuracy, as the language already tends to use gender-neutral terms. This is further illustrated in image3, where the original translation of \"The janitor does not like the baker\" incorrectly assigned a male inflection to \"baker,\" but adding \"pretty\" to \"baker\" corrected the translation, aligning it more accurately with the intended gender.\n\nOverall, these findings highlight that stereotype-based adjustments can effectively reduce gender bias in machine translation, particularly in languages where such biases are prevalent. However, the effectiveness depends on the specific linguistic and cultural contexts of the target languages. The results are summarized in Table 4, which shows that for Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, the addition of stereotypical adjectives led to significant improvements in gender prediction accuracy.\n\nThis confirms that stereotype-based adjustments can play a crucial role in mitigating gender bias in machine translation, although their application needs to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the target language and culture."}

For instance, the F1 scores for single-paragraph BERT vary widely depending on the training and evaluation settings. When evaluated on the original distractors, single-paragraph BERT achieves an F1 score of 67.08. However, when trained on adversarial distractors and evaluated on the same, the F1 score drops to 46.84 but recovers to 60.10 after filtering by entity type (image4).\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation setting itself plays a crucial role. When the model is trained on standard distractors and tested on the original distractors, it performs well with an F1 score of 59.12. Yet, when tested on adversarial distractors, its performance drops to 40.73 without entity type filtering, but improves to 58.42 with such filtering (image4).\n\nThe image `Model Distractor F1 Open F1` (image1) also illustrates that single-paragraph BERT has a much lower F1 score (38.40) in the open-domain setting compared to its performance on standard distractors (67.08). This indicates that the model's ability to handle multi-hop reasoning is limited when it cannot effectively retrieve relevant paragraphs.\n\nIn contrast, the `Setting` chart (image2) shows that increasing the number of retrieved paragraphs from 10 to 500 improves the F1 score from 38.40 to 39.12, but this improvement is still far from the model's performance on standard distractors. The addition of gold paragraphs further boosts the F1 score to 53.12, highlighting the importance of retrieving accurate and relevant information.\n\nThe `Type Question % *FI` chart (image3) provides insight into the nature of the questions. It shows that multi-hop and context-dependent multi-hop questions are challenging for single-hop models, achieving only around 50% accuracy. This suggests that the model's performance is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of the distractors.\n\nOverall, these findings indicate that effective training and evaluation strategies are essential for improving the performance of multi-hop question answering systems. Specifically, enhancing the quality of distractors and ensuring that the model can effectively retrieve relevant information are key factors in achieving higher F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop tasks."}

The adversarial setup ensures that models do not rely on these cues, leading to more robust performance evaluations.\n\nThe transformation of the original ARCT data into an adversarial dataset is shown in the example provided in image3. For instance, the claim \"Google is not a harmful monopoly\" is transformed into \"Google is a harmful monopoly,\" while the reason and warrant remain unchanged. This process ensures that models are evaluated based on their understanding rather than on superficial statistical patterns.\n\nWhen BERT models are trained and validated on the original data and tested on the adversarial set, as seen in image4, their performance drops dramatically. The median and maximum accuracy for BERT on the adversarial test set are 50.5% and 53.3%, respectively, compared to 77% on the original test set. This significant drop indicates that BERT's previous performance was heavily reliant on spurious statistical cues.\n\nFurther analysis, as shown in image5, confirms that BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set is 53%, with a mean and median of 50%. This result aligns with the conclusion that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension, but rather exploited spurious statistical cues.\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup successfully eliminates the reliance on spurious statistical cues, leading to a more robust evaluation of models' true capabilities in argument comprehension. The performance drop for BERT from 77% to 53% on the adversarial test set demonstrates that models like BERT are not genuinely understanding the arguments but rather exploiting statistical patterns. Therefore, the adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT to ensure more meaningful evaluations."}

To understand the actual allocations in 2020, we would need to refer to the most recent data available. Unfortunately, the exact figures for the actual allocations in 2020 are not provided in the given quotes or images. Nevertheless, the target allocations give us a clear indication of the strategic intent behind the asset allocation for these plans.\n\nThe target allocation ranges suggest that the U.S. Defined Benefit plans aim for a balanced portfolio with a higher percentage dedicated to both fixed income and equity securities, whereas the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans have a much wider range for equity securities, indicating a potentially more aggressive or flexible approach in terms of asset allocation."}

According to the image5, an immediate 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies would affect Novo Nordisk's operating profit, indicating the sensitivity of the company's financial results to exchange rate movements. Specifically, a 5% increase in USD, JPY, CAD, and GBP against the EUR and DKK would lead to a decrease in other comprehensive income by DKK 1,893 million and an increase in the income statement by DKK 299 million, resulting in a net decrease in comprehensive income by DKK 1,594 million. Conversely, a 5% decrease would have the opposite effect.\n\nMoreover, the company uses various financial instruments to mitigate these risks. For instance, as shown in image2, Novo Nordisk employs forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities. The table indicates that the majority of the derivative financial instruments recognized in the income statement are forward contracts, which are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months. The fair values of these contracts at the year-end also provide insights into the potential gains or losses that could affect the income statement.\n\nIn terms of the cash flow hedges, the company applies hedge accounting to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. This is evident in image5, where the transfer of cash flow hedge reserves to intangible assets is shown, illustrating how the gains or losses from these hedges are recognized over time. Additionally, the table in image2 highlights the gains and losses from these hedges, with the forward contracts, cash flow hedges, contributing significantly to the recognized amounts in the income statement.\n\nOverall, the changes in exchange rates had a notable impact on Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020, with the company actively managing these risks through strategic financial instruments and hedge accounting practices."}

According to the data in image1, the Total AUM increased from $463 billion in 2018 to $552 billion in 2019, and further rose to $657 billion in 2020. This growth can be attributed to the substantial increase in equity, fixed income, and alternative/other AUM segments, as seen in image3.\n\nSimultaneously, the fee rates also showed fluctuations. As depicted in image1, the fee rate for Equity decreased from 76 basis points (bps) in 2018 to 76 bps in both 2019 and 2020, while Fixed Income and Alternative/Other fee rates increased from 33 bps, 66 bps in 2018 to 29 bps, 58 bps in 2019, and then to 32 bps, 64 bps in 2020, respectively. The Long-term AUM fee rate also increased from 62 bps in 2018 to 60 bps in 2019 and then to 58 bps in 2020. The total fee rate, as shown in image1, increased from 47 bps in 2018 to 46 bps in 2019 and then to 42 bps in 2020.\n\nGiven these changes, the impact on the firm's revenues can be analyzed as follows. The growth in AUM, coupled with an overall decrease in fee rates, suggests a complex interplay between asset size and revenue generation. While the total AUM grew significantly, the fee rate decline indicates that the firm is earning less per unit of assets under management. However, the increase in equity and fixed income AUM, along with the higher fee rates in these segments, might partially offset the reduction in the overall fee rate.\n\nFor instance, the equity AUM grew from $105 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020, with the fee rate remaining relatively stable at 76 bps. Similarly, the fixed income AUM increased from $68 billion to $86 billion, with a slight decrease in the fee rate from 32 bps to 29 bps. These trends suggest that despite a decline in the overall fee rate, the firm benefited from the growth in high-fee-rate asset classes.\n\nIn conclusion, the firm's revenues likely saw a mix of positive and negative impacts from the changes in AUM and fee rates. The growth in AUM, especially in high-fee-rate asset classes, contributed positively to revenues, while the decline in the overall fee rate posed a challenge. The firm's ability to manage these dynamics will be crucial for maintaining and growing its revenues in the future. \n\n![Impact on revenues from AUM and fee rate changes](image1)"}

This increase can be attributed to several factors including revenue growth, cost reductions, and favorable tax provisions.\n\n- **Comprehensive Income**: Comprehensive income includes net income plus other comprehensive income (OCI). For fiscal 2021, the comprehensive income was $8,964 million, whereas for fiscal 2020, it was $5,305 million, and for fiscal 2019, it was $4,272 million. The difference between net income and comprehensive income can be explained by the components of OCI, such as foreign currency translation gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on securities and derivatives, and other reclassifications.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income comparison](image1)\n\nThe table above illustrates the progression of net income and comprehensive income over the three fiscal years. The significant rise in net income in 2021 is primarily due to increased revenues, particularly from QCT (Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.) and QTL (Qualcomm Technologies, LLC), and improved operational efficiency. Additionally, the company's strategic acquisitions, such as NUVIA and Veoneer, have contributed to its growth. The increase in comprehensive income further reflects the positive impact of these factors, along with the inclusion of OCI components.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income for fiscal 2021 have shown a marked improvement compared to the previous years, driven by revenue growth, cost management, and the integration of strategic acquisitions."}

However, the most striking changes occurred in liabilities and shareholders' equity.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, the shareholders' equity increased from $443,164 billion to $514,930 billion, a rise of $71,766 billion. This substantial increase can be attributed to several factors, including the net earnings of $89,795 billion in 2021 (compared to $42,521 billion in 2020), as well as the adoption of new accounting pronouncements and the issuance of common stock. The adoption of new accounting pronouncements led to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which contributed to the growth in shareholders' equity. Additionally, the net earnings from operations and investments further bolstered the equity position.\n\nOn the liabilities side, the total liabilities increased from $422,393 billion to $443,854 billion, a modest rise of $21,461 billion. Key contributors to this increase include the growth in accounts payable, accruals, and other liabilities, as well as the increase in notes payable and other borrowings.

In 2020, Capex was $21.4 billion, down from $31.148 billion in 2019 (see image3). This decline was partly due to industry conditions leading to lower realized prices for the Corporation's products, which resulted in substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019 (quote [4]). Despite the reduction, the Corporation is prioritizing opportunities to hold 2021 capital spending within a range of $16 billion to $19 billion (quote [3]).\n\nIn terms of taxes, there was a notable decrease in total taxes on the Corporation's income statement from $22,793 million in 2019 to $22,800 million in 2020 (see image4). The primary driver behind this change was the benefit from asset impairments recorded in 2020, resulting in an income tax expense of $5.6 billion compared to $5.3 billion in 2019. The effective tax rate dropped significantly from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, mainly due to a change in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates (quote [10]).\n\n![Worldwide Average Realizations](image2) shows that the average realizations for crude oil and NGL decreased from $56.32 per barrel in 2019 to $35.41 in 2020, indicating the financial pressure on the Corporation's earnings. Similarly, the average realization for natural gas fell from $3.87 per thousand cubic feet in 2018 to $2.01 in 2020, further emphasizing the challenging market conditions.\n\nIn summary, ExxonMobil's capital expenditures declined significantly from $31.148 billion in 2019 to $21.4 billion in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower product prices and the Corporation's strategic focus on managing spending. The Corporation also benefited from lower income taxes in 2020, mainly due to asset impairments, resulting in a lower effective tax rate of 17% compared to 34% in 2019. These changes had a substantial financial implication, contributing to the Corporation's efforts to maintain liquidity and manage its overall financial health."}

The program allows for flexible repurchases without specifying a maximum number of shares, indicating a long-term strategy rather than a short-term fix.\n\n![Performance comparison](image4) visually compares the performance of Berkshire Hathaway's stock with the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index. The chart shows that Berkshire Hathaway's stock has outperformed both indices consistently since 2016, reflecting strong investor confidence in the company.\n\nFrom the earnings data, we can see that Berkshire Hathaway's net earnings attributable to shareholders for the past three years are shown in the table in [5]. For instance, in 2021, the total net earnings were $89,795 million, down from $42,521 million in 2020 and $81,417 million in 2019. This decline in net earnings is largely attributed to a decrease in insurance investment income, as highlighted in [9], where it is mentioned that earnings from this segment decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 and declined by 8.9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declining interest rates.\n\nLooking at the different segments, the insurance business generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020, and $325 million in 2019, as stated in [2]. This segment was significantly impacted by catastrophe events and changes in premium structures, as well as the effects of the pandemic, which further influenced the underwriting results.\n\nIn contrast, the railroad business saw an increase in earnings of 16.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher freight volumes and improved productivity, according to [7]. However, the utilities and energy business had an increase of 13.1% in 2021 compared to 2020, which reflects higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, along with the effects of a business acquisition and increased tax benefits from renewable energy, as noted in [7].\n\nThe manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses also performed well, with an increase of 34.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, although several businesses faced higher material and input costs due to global supply chain disruptions, as mentioned in [10].\n\nIn conclusion, Berkshire Hathaway's stock repurchase program has been active, with significant share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, while the net earnings have fluctuated but remained robust across different segments, especially in the railroad and utilities and energy sectors."}

In comparison, the same information for January 31, 2019, is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the changes in the measurement categories of strategic investments.\n\nTo understand the change in value and the contribution of different measurement categories, let's look at the changes in the measurement categories of strategic investments. Text quote [4] provides the details on the fixed-income portfolio and the impact of interest rate changes, while text quote [6] gives us the strategic investments by form and measurement category as of January 31, 2020.

The table in image5 provides a detailed breakdown of these revenues. Specifically, the total company-operated sales and franchised revenues decreased by 10%, with the International Operated Markets segment showing a substantial decline of 19%. This reduction was offset somewhat by the U.S. market, where revenues increased slightly.\n\nThe table in image1 shows that the Company-operated margins decreased, while franchised margins saw a slight increase. However, the overall operating income and net income declined. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020 reflects this overall decline in profitability.\n\nThe change in currency translation also played a role. As shown in image3, the GAAP earnings per share-diluted decreased by 20% from 2019 to 2020, partially due to strategic gains charges and an increase in the income tax cost. Excluding these factors, the non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted still showed a decline of 23%.\n\nIn summary, the decline in revenues, particularly in the International Operated Markets segment, led to a decrease in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share from 2019 to 2020. The U.S. market's performance helped mitigate some of the decline but was not enough to offset the significant drop in international markets. ![GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share decline due to revenue decrease in International Operated Markets](image5)"}

The reported GAAP measure for APAC in 2020 was $67,161, while in 2019 it was $10,291, showing a decrease of 35.8% [5]. The core non-GAAP measure for APAC in 2020 was $15,208, whereas in 2019 it was $13,300, indicating an increase of 15.2% [5].\n\nTo understand the main factors affecting these changes, let's look at the details from the images and text quotes. Image3 provides insights into the impact of items affecting comparability for each region, including APAC. For APAC, the impact of items affecting comparability in 2020 was 24%, compared to -10% in 2019 [3]. This significant change in 2020 suggests that there were substantial adjustments due to specific events or accounting practices.\n\nMoreover, the text quote [4] mentions that net revenue and unit volume each increased by 10% in APAC, driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. The unit volume growth in APAC was primarily due to double-digit growth in variety packs and dips, and high-single-digit growth in trademark Tostitos and Ruffles, partially offset by a double-digit decline in nuts and seeds. This indicates that pricing strategies and product mix played crucial roles in the revenue growth.\n\nAdditionally, the image2 shows that the inventory fair value adjustments and mark-to-market net impact of commodity derivatives were significant in 2020, contributing to the overall financial measures. These adjustments can affect the reported GAAP and core non-GAAP measures, thereby influencing the observed changes in APAC.\n\nIn conclusion, the APAC segment's reported GAAP measure decreased by 35.8% in 2020, while its core non-GAAP measure increased by 15.2% due to a combination of organic growth, effective pricing strategies, and specific accounting adjustments such as inventory fair value adjustments and mark-to-market impacts. ![APAC segment's reported GAAP and core non-GAAP measures changed significantly in 2020 due to various factors including organic growth and specific accounting adjustments.](image3)"}

In 2020, McDonald's comprehensive income was $4,626.4 million, which is a significant decrease from $6,152.2 million in 2019 and $5,493.2 million in 2018. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including operating income, other comprehensive income, and changes in foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nLet's delve deeper into the details:\n\n- **Operating Income**: According to the text quote [2], operating income decreased by 19% in 2020, with strategic gains and charges impacting the figures. Excluding these items, the decrease was 23% in constant currencies. This substantial drop in operating income is reflected in the comprehensive income for 2020, contributing significantly to the overall reduction.\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income also includes other comprehensive income (loss), which can be seen in the text quote [5]. In 2020, the net income was $4,730.5 million, but the other comprehensive income (loss) was negative at $104.1 million, compared to positive values of $126.8 million in 2019 and $-431.1 million in 2018. The negative value in 2020 is due to a combination of factors, including foreign currency translation adjustments and defined benefit pension plans.\n\n- **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: The foreign currency translation adjustments, particularly the gain (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), played a crucial role. In 2020, there was a gain of $46.0 million, whereas in 2019, it was a much higher gain of $127.5 million, and in 2018, it was a loss of $453.6 million. These fluctuations are influenced by the global economic environment and the strength of various currencies, impacting McDonald's reported income.\n\n- **Cash Flow Hedges and Defined Benefit Pension Plans**: The cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans also contribute to the other comprehensive income. In 2020, there was a loss of $129.1 million in cash flow hedges, compared to a gain of $17.3 million in 2019. Similarly, the defined benefit pension plans resulted in a loss of $43.5 million in 2020, which was less severe than the losses in the previous years.\n\nThe comprehensive income for 2020 reflects a significant decrease compared to the previous two years, primarily due to a decline in operating income and changes in other comprehensive income components, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges.\n\n![Comprehensive income shows a notable decrease from 2019 to 2020, reflecting a combination of factors including operating income and other comprehensive income adjustments.](image5)"}

This slight decrease is somewhat counterintuitive given the overall positive trends in the company's core operating income and net sales growth.\n\nIn terms of core operating income, the Sandoz segment saw a significant improvement. The core operating income from continuing operations increased by 53% to USD 1.6 billion in 2021, reflecting a 48% increase in constant currencies (see image2). The core operating income margin for Sandoz also improved, increasing from 16.6% in 2020 to 16.6% in 2021, a net increase of 5.8 percentage points in constant currencies.\n\nThe main factors contributing to these changes include:\n- **Lower Legal Settlements and Amortization**: The operating income from continuing operations saw a substantial increase due to lower legal settlements and amortization (see image2).\n- **Lower Impairments**: The decrease in impairments also contributed positively to the operating income (see text quote [3]).\n- **Sales Growth**: Despite the slight decrease in operating income, Sandoz experienced a 7% increase in net sales (see image1).\n\nHowever, the increase in core operating income was driven by several factors:\n- **Higher Sales**: Sandoz achieved a 10% increase in net sales, contributing significantly to the core operating income (see image2).\n- **Cost Reductions**: Lower amortization and impairments helped improve the margin (see text quote [6] and image2).\n- **Gross Margin**: Although the gross margin decreased unfavorably (see image3), the overall impact on core operating income was positive due to the higher sales and cost reductions.\n\nOverall, the Sandoz segment's financial performance showed a mixed picture in 2021, with a slight decrease in operating income but a significant increase in core operating income, driven by improved sales and cost management. \n\n![Sandoz operating income and core operating income changes](image1)\n![Core operating income margin improvements](image2)"}

This improvement can be linked to the company's effective management of its loan portfolio and interest rate risk, as mentioned in text quote [4], where it discusses the potential impact of interest rate changes on net interest income.\n\n![](image3) Furthermore, the decrease in provisions for credit losses, from $361 million in 2019 to $266 million in 2021, played a crucial role in enhancing the net interest income (text quote [6]). The reserve releases in 2021 were primarily due to the improved macroeconomic outlook and reduced risk in the loan portfolio, which is reflected in the lower net write-off rates and the stable 30+ days past due ratio.\n\nIn summary, the net interest income increased from 2019 to 2021 due to a combination of lower costs, higher average loan balances, and improved interest yields. The stability in card member receivables and the reduction in credit loss provisions further supported this growth."}

As of December 31, 2020, the total deferred income tax assets amounted to $3,391 million, while the total deferred income tax liabilities stood at $6,758 million (see image3). The significant difference between the two indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets, leading to a net deferred income tax liability of $3,367 million.\n\nThe deferred income tax assets include items such as accrued expenses and allowances, state and federal net operating loss carryforwards, and share-based compensation. Conversely, the deferred income tax liabilities are mainly related to federal and state intangible assets, goodwill, capitalized software, and depreciation and amortization.

This suggests that Danaher shifted more of its long-term debt to current liabilities, indicating potential liquidity concerns or strategic changes in financial management.](image2)\n\nFrom the data presented in image2, we observe that the total current liabilities increased from $5,146 million in 2019 to $7,952 million in 2020, while the total noncurrent liabilities decreased from $21,517 million to $23,004 million. This shift in the composition of liabilities reflects a strategic change in how Danaher manages its debt structure.\n\nLooking at the total debt figures provided in image5, we see that total debt decreased from $21,729 million in 2019 to $21,204 million in 2020. This reduction in total debt is partially explained by the decrease in noncurrent liabilities, but it is also influenced by the reclassification of some of the debt as current liabilities. The increase in current liabilities aligns with the reduction in noncurrent liabilities, suggesting that Danaher might have taken steps to manage its liquidity more aggressively by shifting some of its long-term obligations to the current period.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in total current and noncurrent liabilities from 2019 to 2020 reflect a strategic shift towards more current liabilities, which likely contributed to the slight reduction in total debt. This shift could be indicative of Danaher's efforts to improve its liquidity position or respond to market conditions."}

This increase in the effective tax rate is mainly attributed to higher earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, the net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards, whereas in 2019, they included benefits from the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits from the conversion of employee share-based awards [1, 3, 5].\n\nThe net discrete tax provisions (benefits) also show a significant shift from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, the Firm had net discrete tax benefits of $475 million, but in 2020, these benefits dropped to $122 million, indicating a reduction in net discrete tax benefits [8, 10]. This decrease in net discrete tax benefits is directly related to the increase in the effective tax rate, as seen in the image2 which illustrates the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions (benefits) for the respective years.\n\nLooking at the compensation expenses, the Firm experienced a 11% increase from the prior year, reaching $20,854 million in 2020 [9]. This increase was primarily driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, increases in compensation for Wealth Management representatives, and incremental compensation due to the acquisition of $\\mathrm{E}^{*}$ TRADE. However, these increases were partly offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest.\n\nThe image6 shows the breakdown of deferred cash-based awards and return on referenced investments, contributing to the total compensation expense. In 2020, the total recognized in compensation expense was $2,119 million, up from $1,878 million in 2019 [6, 10]. This increase aligns with the overall rise in compensation expenses, reflecting the higher effective tax rate and the decrease in net discrete tax benefits.\n\n![The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, while net discrete tax benefits decreased significantly from $475 million to $122 million, directly impacting the overall compensation expenses.](image2)\n\nThis indicates that the changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions had a substantial impact on the Firm's financials, particularly on the compensation expenses."}

This growth was driven by the ongoing paydown of outstanding balances by card members and significant declines in spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as mentioned in [6]. Additionally, the reserve for credit losses associated with card member loans decreased in 2021 due to improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook, as stated in [7].\n\n![Key changes in card member loans and receivables](image1)\n\n### Network Volumes and Card Member Spending\n\nLooking at the network volumes and card member spending, there was a 27% increase in U.S. network volumes and a 10% increase in average proprietary basic card member spending, according to [9]. Outside the U.S., network volumes increased by 17%, and the average fee per card rose by 10%. These figures indicate a strong performance in terms of volume and spending, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\n![Changes in network volumes and card member spending](image3)\n\n### Comparison\n\nComparing these changes, it's evident that while card member loans and receivables increased significantly, the growth in network volumes and card member spending was also substantial. This suggests that although there was a rise in card member balances, the overall activity and spending levels remained robust, indicating a resilient customer base.\n\nIn summary, card member loans and receivables experienced a notable increase from 2020 to 2021, supported by improved macroeconomic conditions and a stable customer base, while network volumes and card member spending also showed significant growth, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of the business during the pandemic."}

Let's delve into the specifics:\n\nFrom the image3, we can see that the net income for 2020 was $4,730.5 million, down from $6,025.4 million in 2019. This represents a decrease of $1,294.9 million, or approximately 21.5%. This decline can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Operating Income**: The operating income decreased by $1,494.9 million, or 19%, from 2019 to 2020, as mentioned in text quote [6]. This drop is partially explained by strategic gains in 2019 ($74 million) and strategic losses in 2020 ($268 million).\n\n- **Foreign Currency Translation**: The positive impact of foreign currency translation on diluted earnings per share was $0.04 in 2020, as noted in text quote [4].\n\n- **Impairment and Other Charges (Gains)**: The company recognized strategic gains of $274 million from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock in 2020, whereas it faced strategic charges of $74 million in 2019, as stated in text quote [7].\n\n- **Other Factors**: The decrease in operating income also reflects the impact of the global pandemic (COVID-19), which significantly affected sales and operating costs, as discussed in text quote [9].\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income changes](image3)\n\nMoreover, the comprehensive income, which includes other comprehensive income (OCI) in addition to net income, also saw a change from 2019 to 2020. According to image4, the comprehensive income for 2020 was $4,626.4 million, a decrease from $6,152.2 million in 2019. This decrease is largely due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges, as shown in the breakdown of other comprehensive income (loss) in image4.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income declined from 2019 to 2020 due to reduced operating performance, strategic transactions, and the adverse effects of the global pandemic. These changes are clearly illustrated in the financial statements provided."}

Let's start by examining the net revenue and operating profit trends.\n\n![Net Revenue and Operating Profit](image5)\n\nIn 2020, PepsiCo's total net revenue increased from $67,161 million in 2019 to $70,372 million, representing a 5% growth. Similarly, the operating profit increased from $10,291 million in 2019 to $10,080 million, indicating a slight decrease of 2%. This increase in net revenue and slight decrease in operating profit can be attributed to various factors such as productivity savings, lower restructuring and impairment charges, and cost increases.\n\nNow, let's delve into the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across the divisions. The image `image3` provides us with the breakdown of these categories for each division.\n\n![Distribution of Beverage and Food/Snack Categories](image3)\n\nFor instance, in LatAm, the beverage category accounted for 10% of the net revenue in 2020, while the food/snack category contributed 90%. In Europe, the beverage category had a higher share at 55%, whereas the food/snack category was slightly lower at 45%. The APAC region saw a more balanced distribution, with each category contributing 25%.\n\nThese distributions suggest that the beverage category plays a dominant role in the net revenue for most divisions, except for APAC where the food/snack category has a similar share. However, the operating profit margins and changes might be influenced by the specific product mix within these categories.\n\nFor example, the FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) division saw a 13% increase in corporate unallocated expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 (see `image1`). This could be due to the high proportion of food/snack products in this division, which might require more significant investments in marketing, logistics, and other overhead costs. On the other hand, the PBNA (Pepsi Bottling North America) division, with a higher proportion of beverage products, experienced a 10% decrease in operating profit margin.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely related to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. The beverage category generally contributes more significantly to net revenue, but the operating profit margins and changes can be influenced by the specific product mix within each category, leading to variations in cost structures and profitability."}

Specifically, cash inflows from financing activities increased substantially from €1,928 million in 2020 to €11,839 million in 2021 [5], while cash outflows from investing activities surged from €1,912 million in 2020 to €14,140 million in 2021 [6]. These changes can be attributed to several key factors.\n\n### Financing Activities\n\nThe notable increase in cash inflows from financing activities can largely be attributed to the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which amounted to €12,087 million in 2021 [5]. This large influx of cash was partially offset by cash outflows related to the repayment of matured loans, which were €730 million in 2021, compared to €300 million in 2020. Additionally, there were other financing activities such as additional financing provided by the Siemens Group, which contributed to the increase [8].\n\n### Investing Activities\n\nThe substantial rise in cash outflows from investing activities can be primarily explained by the acquisition of Varian, which required a significant cash outlay of €12,228 million [6]. Furthermore, the increase in investments for capacity expansions, particularly in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, accounted for an additional €117 million [6]. These investments were aimed at enhancing the company's competitiveness and innovation capability [2].\n\n![Key factors driving changes in cash flows from financing and investing activities](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the significant changes in Siemens Healthineers' cash flows from financing and investing activities between 2020 and 2021 were driven by the acquisition of Varian and increased investments in capacity expansions. These strategic initiatives underscored the company's focus on innovation and market expansion."}

In 2018, it was a loss of $1,063 million, whereas in 2020, it turned into a gain of $721 million (image1).\n\n![](image1) \n\nThis substantial improvement can be attributed to several factors, including the increase in net income, the decrease in expenses, and the impact of stock-based compensation.\n\nIn 2018, Tesla reported a net loss of $976 million, which was a considerable drag on comprehensive income (image2). By 2020, the company's net income had surged to $721 million, a favorable change of $1.58 billion (image2).\n\nMoreover, the increase in stock-based compensation expense also contributed significantly to the change. In 2020, Tesla recorded a stock-based compensation expense of $838 million, up from $296 million in 2019. This increase is partly due to the rapid rise in market capitalization and the recognition of performance-based awards (text quote [10]).\n\nAdditionally, the restructuring and other activities led to significant non-cash charges. For instance, in 2018, Tesla incurred restructuring expenses of $37 million, which included employee termination expenses and losses from sub-leasing a facility (text quote [7]). These expenses reduced the comprehensive income in 2018 but were not repeated in 2020, contributing positively to the 2020 figure.\n\nAnother factor is the change in foreign currency transaction net losses/gains. Tesla experienced net foreign currency transaction losses in 2018 and 2019 but saw a gain in 2020, which positively impacted the comprehensive income (text quote [2]).\n\nLastly, the decrease in SG&A expenses also played a role. Tesla's SG&A expenses increased by $499 million in 2020 compared to 2019, but this increase was mainly due to the stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash item. The overall operating expenses increased, but the increase in operating margin from 6.3% to 6.9% (text quote [9]) indicates improved operational efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved from a loss in 2018 to a gain in 2020, driven by a significant improvement in net income, changes in stock-based compensation, and reduced restructuring expenses."}

The comprehensive income statement reflects the increase in retained earnings, which is a key component of stockholders' equity.\n\n![Consolidated statements of comprehensive income](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the changes in the balance sheet and income statement can be seen in the detailed breakdown of stockholders' equity, where the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the decrease in retained earnings due to cash dividends and repurchases of common stock are evident.\n\n![Detailed stockholders' equity](image4)\n\nThese changes in equity and noncontrolling interests are consistent with the overall financial performance of Costco, indicating a robust growth in net income and an active management of its capital structure.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in total stockholders' equity and the decrease in noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 reflect the company's strong financial performance and strategic decisions regarding capital management."}

Let's break down these changes and their contributing factors.\n\n#### Net Earnings Attributable to P&G\n\nAs shown in the consolidated amounts table (image6), the net earnings attributable to P&G increased from $13,103 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022. This represents a growth of $1,639 million or 12.5% over the two-year period. The primary contributing factors to this increase include:\n\n- **Increase in Net Earnings**: As seen in the financial statements, net earnings increased from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,793 million in 2022, a rise of $1,766 million or 13.5%. This increase is attributed to a variety of factors including higher revenues, better cost management, and favorable tax rates.\n- **Decrease in Preferred Dividends**: The preferred dividends decreased from $127.64 million in 2020 to $51.00 million in 2022, reducing the burden on net earnings attributable to P&G.\n- **Impact of Foreign Exchange**: Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million in 2022, which is a decrease from the $64 million positive impact in 2020.\n\n#### Stock-Based Expenses\n\nThe stock-based compensation expense, as indicated in the stock-based expense table (image1), increased from $540 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022. However, it's important to note that the total stock-based expense decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022, indicating a slight reduction in the overall stock-based compensation costs. This can be attributed to the following:\n\n- **Change in RSUs and PSUs**: The cost of compensation related to RSUs and PSUs, as shown in the RSUs and PSUs table (image2), increased from $264 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022. The total compensation cost that has not yet been recognized also increased from $248 million in 2020 to $216 million in 2022, suggesting a delay in recognizing the full cost.\n- **Change in Stock Options**: The cost of compensation related to stock options, as shown in the options table (image3), decreased from $271 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022. This reduction can be attributed to the decrease in the number of outstanding and exercisable options and the lower exercise prices.\n\nIn summary, the net earnings attributable to P&G increased significantly from 2020 to 2022, driven by higher net earnings and a reduction in preferred dividends, while the stock-based expenses showed a slight decrease, mainly due to changes in the cost related to RSUs, PSUs, and stock options. \n\n![Net earnings attributable to P&G increased significantly from 2020 to 2022](image6)"}

Specifically, the total NBCUniversal revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3$ billion in 2021 [9]. This increase is largely attributed to the growth in the Media segment, where revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8$ billion, and the Studios segment, which saw a rise of 16.2% to $9.4$ billion [2].\n\nFor the Sky segment, the revenue increased by 141.2% to $5.1$ billion in 2021 [2]. This substantial growth is primarily due to the operation of the theme parks in the current year period, compared to the temporary closures and capacity restrictions experienced in the prior year period, and the opening of the theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n\n![NBCUniversal and Sky revenue changes](image1)\n\nThis table provides a clear comparison of the percentage changes in revenue for both the NBCUniversal Headquarters and Sky segments from 2020 to 2021.

This indicates a shift towards higher margins but lower overall revenue. The pre-tax income for the Systems segment decreased by 36.0%, reflecting a significant decline in profitability [image2].\n\n### IBM Z\n\nFor IBM Z, the revenue increased by 1.9% (adjusted for currency), showing resilience in this high-value, secure, and scalable platform [image1]. However, the operating systems software revenue declined by 11.2% (adjusted for currency) [image7], which could impact the overall Systems segment's performance.\n\n### Power Systems and Storage Systems\n\nThe Power Systems revenue saw a significant drop of 22.4% (adjusted for currency), while Storage Systems also experienced a decline of 6.1% (adjusted for currency) [image1]. These declines are likely influenced by the macroeconomic environment and the IBM Z cycle.\n\n### Global Financing\n\nThe Global Financing pre-tax income decreased by 27.8%, primarily due to lower revenue and higher workforce rebalancing charges [image8]. This highlights the financial challenges faced by this segment.\n\n### Regions\n\nLooking at the regional performance, the Americas saw a 6.0% (adjusted for currency) decline in external revenue, while Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific both experienced slight decreases of 3.3% and 3.5%, respectively [image4].\n\n### Summary\n\nThe year-to-year percent changes in external revenue and pre-tax income across different systems and regions for IBM in 2020 show a mixed picture. While there were some positive shifts in gross profit margins and revenue increases in specific segments like IBM Z, the overall trends indicate a decline in external revenue and pre-tax income, particularly in Systems Hardware and Global Financing.

In 2020, there were substantial impairment charges affecting the operating income. As shown in image4, the research and development segment had a large impairment charge of -9,418 million, which led to a significant reduction in the operating income.\n\nIn 2021, similar adjustments were made (see image3 and image6):\n\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets**: The amortization of intangible assets continued to impact the gross profit and operating income negatively.

In 2020, the total financial assets at fair value increased to DKK 19,189 million from DKK 13,867 million in 2019, with the majority of this increase coming from the Not based on observable market data category, rising from DKK 12,833 million to DKK 16,223 million. The Active market data and Directly or indirectly observable market data categories also saw increases, from DKK 846 million to DKK 634 million and from DKK 188 million to DKK 2332 million respectively. These figures suggest that the company has diversified its financial assets, with a notable shift towards assets that are not based on observable market data.\n\n![Changes in financial assets at fair value](image4)\n\nTurning to the derivative financial instruments, as shown in image6, the total derivative financial instruments in 2020 amounted to DKK 63,390 million, compared to DKK 50,455 million in 2019. Of this, DKK 2,332 million were recognized in the income statement, while DKK 1,365 million were recognized in other comprehensive income. This indicates that the company's exposure to derivative financial instruments increased significantly in 2020, with a larger portion of these instruments impacting the income statement.\n\nThe impact of these financial elements on the company's financial statements can be seen in the cash flow changes. As depicted in image5, the change in working capital in 2020 was a decrease of DKK 4,353 million compared to a decrease of DKK 3,388 million in 2019. This reflects the company's efforts to manage its liquidity and working capital more efficiently, but also suggests that the company may have experienced some challenges in managing its short-term cash flows.\n\nMoreover, the contractual undiscounted cash flows (image7) show that the company's total contractual undiscounted cash flows at the end of 2020 were DKK 10,721 million, up from DKK 10,356 million in 2019. However, the contractual discounted cash flows included in the balance sheet decreased slightly from DKK 10,356 million to DKK 10,356 million. This indicates that the company's cash flow expectations remain stable, but the timing of cash inflows and outflows may have shifted.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in derivative financial instruments and the shift in the categorization of financial assets at fair value reflect the company's strategic approach to managing risk and diversifying its asset base. These changes contribute to the overall financial health and liquidity of the company, influencing the cash flow and income statement in various ways."}

As mentioned in quote [7], SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 10.04% in 2020 to 8.88% in 2022. The decrease is further broken down into specific categories such as warehouse operations, central operating costs, and stock compensation expense. For instance, warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 17 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales, and central operating costs were lower by five basis points. Additionally, the impact of changes in foreign currencies also contributed to the decrease, with a reduction of approximately $148 in SG&A expenses compared to 2021.\n\n![SG&A expenses decreased from 2020 to 2022](image1)\n\nIn contrast, the trend for Interest Income and Other, Net has shown an increasing pattern.

The comprehensive income has shown steady growth, increasing from $3,730,974 million in 2018 to $5,472,296 million in 2020 (see image1). This growth is largely attributed to net income and other comprehensive income components.\n\nIn terms of other comprehensive income (OCI), we see a notable shift in the composition of gains and losses. For instance, in 2018, OCI had a substantial negative component due to defined benefit plans and cash flow hedges, while in 2019, the impact was reversed with positive contributions from these same components. In 2020, OCI showed a more balanced picture, with positive contributions from foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans, offsetting the losses from cash flow hedges and investments (image1).\n\n![The comprehensive income trends show a consistent increase in net income and other comprehensive income components, indicating robust financial performance.](image1)\n\nLooking at the shareholders' equity, there is a clear pattern of growth, particularly in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.

The auditor also expressed an opinion that the financial statements gave a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance, which would have influenced the directors' remuneration packages.\n\nIn summary, the directors' remuneration in the financial year 2002-03 was structured based on their roles and responsibilities, with varying components such as salaries, allowances, and perquisites. The company's financial performance and market conditions, as reflected in the GPI and BSE Sensex, likely played a role in shaping these remuneration structures."}

According to [5], Toyota evaluates its external environment using various scenarios like the below \\(2^\\circ \\text{C}\\) and \\(1.5^\\circ \\text{C}\\) scenarios, emphasizing the importance of climate change in shaping its business outlook. This strategic approach allows Toyota to prepare for potential shifts in the market and adapt its operations accordingly.\n\nIn terms of shareholder returns, Toyota aims to ensure stable and continuous dividend payments while investing in next-generation growth areas such as environmental technologies and safety technologies. This dual focus on sustainability and profitability is evident from [10], where Toyota emphasizes the importance of maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 30% and utilizing retained earnings for investments in technologies aimed at achieving a carbon-neutral society and enhancing customer safety.\n\nThe consolidation of operating income and the evaluation of volatility in the share price, as seen in [image1], indicate that Toyota is closely monitoring its financial health. This data suggests that Toyota's financial strategy is robust, aiming to achieve a 150% attainment of operating income in the current fiscal year, while also assessing the volatility of its share price relative to the Nikkei stock average. This careful evaluation helps Toyota manage risks and capitalize on opportunities, aligning with its broader climate change strategy.\n\nMoreover, Toyota's response to climate scenarios includes a range of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions and increasing the electrification of its vehicle lineup. As shown in [image4], Toyota is taking steps to maintain top-level fuel efficiency, invest in batteries, and expand its electrified vehicle lineup. These actions are crucial for mitigating the risks associated with tightening regulations and increasing natural disasters, while also positioning Toyota to benefit from opportunities such as increased sales of electrified vehicles and the external sales of electrification systems.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's financial strategy correlates with its response to climate scenarios by balancing short-term financial stability with long-term sustainability goals. This alignment ensures that Toyota remains competitive and enhances shareholder returns, particularly through its investments in electrification technologies and sustainable practices."}

This includes DKK 487 million for depreciation and DKK 982 million for impairment losses (image8). In 2020, these figures changed significantly, with a total of DKK 1,446 million, where depreciation stood at DKK 1,096 million and impairment losses at DKK 350 million (image8).\n\n### Property, Plant, and Equipment\nFor property, plant, and equipment, the depreciation increased from DKK 852 million in 2019 to DKK 964 million in 2020 (image2). This increase indicates that more assets were in use or became available for use in 2020, leading to higher depreciation charges. The impairment losses for these assets were DKK 79 million in 2019 and DKK 529 million in 2020, with the latter being a significant increase.

By 2022, the figures shifted to $4,091 million for deferred tax assets and $9,288 million for deferred tax liabilities. This indicates a decrease in deferred tax assets by $473 million and an increase in deferred tax liabilities by $785 million from 2021 to 2022.\n\nExamining the primary categories contributing to these changes, we see significant shifts in several key areas. For deferred tax assets, the most notable change was in the category of \"Stock-based compensation,\" which decreased from $386 million in 2021 to $386 million in 2022, indicating no change in this specific category.

This significant improvement can be attributed to several factors including changes in cash flow activities and financial adjustments.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we see that net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3,426 million in 2020 [4], indicating a strong inflow of cash from ongoing business operations. Additionally, there was a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $23,908 million [5], which also contributed to the overall positive change in cash.\n\nFurthermore, the text mentions a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million [1], primarily due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year. This significant reduction in cash outflow for acquisitions also positively impacted the net change in cash. Another notable point is the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations, which led to a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [1].\n\nThe image4 provides a visual representation of these cash flow activities, showing a net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations of $18,197 million in 2020, compared to a net cash used of $26,936 million in 2019.

For operating costs and expenses, the increases varied among segments: Cable Communications saw a 4.2% rise, NBCUniversal had a 11.2% increase, and Sky experienced a 11.4% growth.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the key drivers of the changes in Comcast's consolidated revenue and operating costs and expenses from 2020 to 2021 were the significant growth in the wireless and broadband segments, along with the steady performance of the video and voice services. These changes were reflected in the operating costs through increased spending on programming and technical support, with the Sky segment showing the highest percentage increase in operating costs.\n\n![The overall revenue and cost changes across different segments highlight the significant growth in wireless and broadband services, and the increased operational costs in programming and technical support.](image2)\n\nThis analysis provides a clear picture of the dynamics within each segment and their impact on the overall financial performance of Comcast."}

As seen in the financial data provided, the net operating income for the Corporate Centre decreased by $392 million, from $654 million in 2019 to $262 million in 2020, while the GBM segment saw an increase in adjusted revenue by $1,562 million, from $5,728 million in 2019 to $7,290 million in 2020.\n\nIn the Corporate Centre, the decrease in net operating income can be attributed to various factors such as reduced revenue from legacy portfolios and other operations, as well as an increase in operating expenses. The decrease in net operating income from $654 million to $262 million reflects a significant decline of $392 million, indicating a substantial reduction in profitability. The image3 provides a detailed breakdown, showing a decrease in management view of adjusted revenue for Central Treasury, Legacy portfolios, and Other, leading to a net operating income of $(262) million in 2020 compared to $(654) million in 2019.\n\nOn the other hand, the GBM segment experienced a notable increase in adjusted revenue, which is reflected in the image1. The segment's revenue increased by $1,562 million, from $5,728 million in 2019 to $7,290 million in 2020, largely driven by growth in FICC (Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities), Foreign Exchange, and Rates. This significant increase in revenue translated into a positive impact on the net operating income, which rose from $(654) million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, a change of $392 million. The image4 shows that the profit before tax increased from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, a difference of $387 million, indicating improved profitability.\n\nThese changes in net operating income and profit before tax are closely related to the financial metrics of each segment. For instance, the Corporate Centre's decrease in net operating income is linked to its lower revenue and higher operating expenses. In contrast, the GBM segment's improved financial performance is attributed to its substantial increase in revenue, which positively impacted its net operating income and profit before tax.\n\nThe Corporate Centre's financial metrics, particularly its net operating income and profit before tax, are under pressure due to the ongoing economic challenges brought about by the global pandemic. In contrast, the GBM segment benefited from the economic support measures and the resilience of its business models, leading to a partial rebound in adjusted revenue and improved financial performance.\n\n![Net operating income and profit before tax changes](image4)"}

As shown in image2, the total stock-based expense increased from $540 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2021, and further to $528 million in 2022. This indicates a consistent level of stock-based compensation expenses despite minor fluctuations. The expense breakdown in image2 also shows that the largest portion comes from RSUs and PSUs, which is crucial for understanding the company's long-term incentive programs.\n\n![](image2) The intrinsic value of options exercised and the actual tax benefit from options exercised (as seen in image8) also highlight the impact of stock options on the company's financials. For instance, the intrinsic value of options exercised increased from $1,455 million in 2020 to $1,886 million in 2022, while the actual tax benefit also increased, indicating higher stock prices and thus more significant gains from exercising options. This trend suggests that the company's stock performance has been favorable, contributing positively to its financial health.\n\nConcurrently, the net earnings per share (EPS) have shown growth, as seen in image3. The EPS increased from $5.13 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including the rise in net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding, and the impact of the prior year's loss on early debt extinguishment. For example, the net earnings increased from $13.103 billion in 2020 to $14.793 billion in 2022, a $1.69 billion increase, which significantly contributed to the EPS growth.\n\n![](image3) The consistency in stock-based compensation expenses alongside the increasing EPS reflects the company's ability to manage its compensation costs effectively while maintaining strong profitability. This balance is crucial for sustaining investor confidence and ensuring the company remains competitive in attracting and retaining top talent.\n\nIn conclusion, the steady stock-based compensation expenses and the growing EPS indicate that Procter & Gamble has maintained a robust financial performance, successfully managing its compensation costs and delivering increasing returns to shareholders."}

According to `image1` and `image2`, the balance at September 29, 2019, shows a specific amount for foreign currency translation adjustments, while the balances at September 27, 2020, and September 26, 2021, are given as part of the overall segments. Specifically, the `image2` shows the total segments including foreign currency translation adjustments, where the United States and Foreign components are clearly delineated. For the year 2020, the total segment sum is $10,274 million, with $8,781 million in the United States and $1,493 million in Foreign. For 2021, the total is $7,246 million, with $5,565 million in the United States and $1,681 million in Foreign. This indicates a significant reduction in the foreign segment from 2020 to 2021, which could be attributed to various factors such as changes in exchange rates or business operations.\n\nNext, examining the components of income before income taxes, `image6` provides insight into the various components from 2019 to 2021. The table shows the breakdown of interest and dividend income, net gains on marketable securities, net gains on other investments, net gains on deferred compensation plan assets, impairment losses on other investments, net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, equity in net earnings (losses) of investees, and net (losses) gains on foreign currency transactions. Notably, the net gains on marketable securities increased from $156 million in 2019 to $427 million in 2021, indicating a significant growth in investment returns. Conversely, the net gains on other investments decreased from $295 million in 2019 to $470 million in 2020 and then slightly decreased again to $470 million in 2021, showing some volatility in this category.\n\nIn conclusion, the foreign currency translation adjustments decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021, likely due to a reduction in foreign segment operations or changes in exchange rates.

The production at Pampa Norte increased by more than 50% to be between 330 and 370 kt in FY2022, driven by the continued ramp-up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO).\n- **Unit Costs:** The unit costs at Escondida decreased by 1% to US\\$1.00 per pound, thanks to strong concentrator throughput, lower deferred stripping costs, and higher by-product credits. A one-off gain from the optimisation of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts also contributed to this improvement.

This indicates that the discount rate had a more substantial effect on the total actuarial gains and losses compared to changes in financial assumptions.\n\n![Effect on defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage-point](image2)\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the discount rate changes had a more pronounced impact on the defined benefit obligation. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate by 0.5 percentage points resulted in a €242 million increase in the defined benefit obligation in 2021, whereas an increase by 0.5 percentage points in 2020 led to a €271 million decrease. This highlights the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the discount rate.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in financial assumptions and discount rates significantly influenced the total actuarial gains and losses, with the discount rate having a more substantial effect."}

The foreign tax provision for fiscal 2019 was notably higher compared to 2018, as shown in the image2, where the foreign provision increased from $1,158 million to $1,563 million. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including the election to be treated as a U.S. branch for federal income tax purposes (\"check-the-box\" elections), which led to the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets, and the derecognition of a deferred tax asset due to a change in the deductibility of dividend income received from a foreign corporation.\n\nBy fiscal 2021, the foreign tax provision had decreased to $1,231 million, indicating a reduction in the foreign tax burden. This decrease can be seen in image2, where the foreign provision dropped to $1,231 million. The decrease in the foreign tax provision might indicate improvements in tax planning or changes in tax laws that favor the company. \n\nThe foreign income before taxes also saw a significant change, as depicted in image5. In fiscal 2019, the foreign income before taxes was $439 million, but by fiscal 2021, it had grown to $1,493 million. This substantial growth suggests that the company's foreign operations became more profitable, possibly due to improved business performance or favorable market conditions in foreign markets.\n\nThese changes in foreign tax provisions and income before taxes might influence the company's financial strategy in several ways. Firstly, the decrease in the foreign tax provision could free up resources that can be reinvested in the company's operations, potentially leading to further growth in foreign markets. Secondly, the growth in foreign income before taxes indicates a stronger presence in international markets, which could prompt the company to explore additional expansion opportunities. Lastly, the company might consider strategies to maintain or enhance its profitability in foreign markets, such as optimizing its tax structure or investing in research and development to secure long-term competitive advantages.\n\n![The changes in foreign tax provision and income before taxes show a significant shift from 2019 to 2021, with a decrease in the foreign tax provision and an increase in foreign income before taxes.](image2)\n\nThe reduction in the foreign tax provision and the increase in foreign income before taxes suggest that the company's international operations are becoming more profitable and less taxed, which could lead to enhanced financial flexibility and strategic opportunities for growth."}

According to the table in `image1`, the total AUM decreased from $603.0 billion in 2020 to $587.1 billion in 2021. This reduction can be attributed to outflows of $96.8 billion, partially offset by inflows of $69.3 billion and a market impact of $11.6 billion. Specifically, the \"other assets managed\" category saw a decline from $405.6 billion to $396.0 billion, while money market funds also decreased from $197.4 billion to $191.1 billion. This indicates a shift in the composition of the AUM towards less managed assets and money market funds.\n\nSecondly, examining the available-for-sale (AFS) securities, the data in `image6` shows that the amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, increased from $421,253 million in 2020 to $447,485 million in 2021. The net unrealized gains also rose from $11,446 million to $2,145 million. However, the fair value of these securities increased significantly, from $432,699 million in 2020 to $449,630 million in 2021. The weighted average maturity also slightly decreased from 45 years in 2020 to 44 years in 2021. This suggests that while the company's exposure to these securities grew, the overall value of the portfolio increased, possibly due to rising interest rates, as indicated by the decrease in net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt securities [8].\n\nIn conclusion, WFAM AUM declined from $603.0 billion to $587.1 billion, primarily due to outflows, while the AFS securities' amortized cost and fair value increased, reflecting a broader economic context and possibly strategic portfolio adjustments. ![Changes in AUM and AFS securities](image1)"}

This increase can be attributed to various factors such as new loan originations and the purchase of debt securities, as highlighted in [1]. However, the most notable change was in the total loans, which decreased significantly from $18,540 million in 2020 to $9,766 million in 2021, indicating a strategic shift in loan portfolio management. Additionally, the total loans outstanding also saw a substantial reduction, from $887,637 million in 2020 to $895,394 million in 2021, with a small increase of $7,757 million (see image4).\n\nSecondly, the changes in WFAM AUM are critical to understanding Wells Fargo's financial strategy. As shown in image5, WFAM AUM decreased from $603 billion in 2020 to $587.1 billion in 2021. This reduction was primarily due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, as mentioned in [6]. The sale of WFAM aligns with Wells Fargo's strategic decision to divest non-core businesses and focus on core banking operations, as indicated by the move of Corporate Trust Services from the Commercial Banking operating segment to Corporate in 2021.\n\nThe impact of these changes on Wells Fargo's financial strategy is evident in its efforts to manage liquidity and interest rate risks. For instance, the company increased its holdings of AFS and HTM debt securities, as seen in [9], to meet funding needs and manage interest rate risk. Furthermore, the company adjusted its loan portfolio, particularly in the consumer segment, where residential mortgage loans decreased due to loan paydowns (see text quote [1]).\n\nIn summary, the reduction in total loans and WFAM AUM, coupled with the increase in total assets, reflects Wells Fargo's strategic shift towards focusing on core banking operations, reducing non-core assets, and managing interest rate and liquidity risks more effectively. This strategy is clearly articulated in the provided text and visual evidence, showing a deliberate approach to realigning resources and improving overall financial health.\n\n![Reflects strategic shift towards core banking operations and improved risk management](image1)"}

For instance, the discount rate for the U.S. dollar was 27% in 2021 compared to 24% in 2020, indicating a slight increase in the rate used to discount future cash flows (see image4).\n\n![Discount rate differences between 2021 and 2020 for the U.S. dollar](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the pension progression for Germany and the United Kingdom showed a consistent increase from 1.5% to 3.0%, while in the U.S., there was no change in the pension progression rate (see image1). This indicates that the pension progression rates in the U.K. and Germany are more dynamic, reflecting potential changes in labor market conditions or government policies.\n\nThe changes in demographic assumptions also varied significantly between the two countries. For Germany, the changes in demographic assumptions had a negative impact of -8 million in 2021, whereas for the U.S., it was -26 million in 2020 (refer to image2). This suggests that the demographic trends in the U.S. had a more substantial effect on the defined benefit plans.\n\nMoreover, the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets were also different. For Germany, the net defined benefit obligation was 2,033 million euros in 2021, compared to 2,007 million euros in 2020, indicating a slight increase (see image3). In contrast, for the U.S., the net defined benefit obligation was 986 million euros in 2021, down from 1,050 million euros in 2020, suggesting a reduction in the obligation over the year.\n\nThese differences highlight the varying economic and social conditions, as well as the specific regulatory environments, that influence the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States. The actuarial assumptions and financial indicators provide insights into the complexity of managing these plans across different geographical regions.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used in Germany and the United States also reflect their unique contexts. For Germany, the assumptions are mainly derived from the German Siemens population and Federal Statistical Office data, adjusted with recognized actuarial standards (see image5). In the U.S., the assumptions are based on generational projections from the Social Security Administration and standard mortality tables with future improvements (also see image5).\n\nIn summary, the actuarial assumptions and financial indicators for defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States exhibit distinct characteristics, influenced by factors such as demographic trends, economic conditions, and regulatory requirements."}

According to Table 8 and Table 12, the total loans outstanding increased from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, representing a growth of $7,757 million. This increase can be attributed to the rise in commercial loans, as seen in image2, where the total commercial loans increased from $127,733 million to $135,811 million. On the other hand, consumer loans saw a slight decrease, as indicated in the text quote [1], where consumer loans decreased from $254,892 million to $242,270 million, a reduction of $12,622 million.\n\n![Changes in loan portfolios](image2)\n\nSecondly, looking at the deposit figures, the total deposits increased from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million, a growth of $78,098 million. This is evident from image1, which shows a 6% increase in total deposits. Among the different types of deposits, noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits experienced growth, while savings deposits and time deposits showed decreases. Specifically, time deposits decreased by 41%, from $49,775 million to $29,461 million, as shown in image1.\n\n![Changes in deposit portfolios](image1)\n\nBased on these changes, we can infer that the financial entity adopted a strategy focused on increasing its loan portfolio, particularly in the commercial sector, to capitalize on the growing demand and economic conditions. This strategy was likely aimed at boosting revenue and expanding market share. At the same time, the entity also sought to manage its deposit base more effectively, possibly by reducing the reliance on time deposits, which are often more costly to maintain, and instead focusing on maintaining or even slightly decreasing some types of deposits like savings and time deposits. This could indicate efforts to reduce funding costs and improve the overall efficiency of the balance sheet.\n\nIn summary, the financial entity's strategy appears to involve aggressive loan growth, especially in the commercial segment, coupled with strategic management of its deposit base to optimize funding costs and balance sheet efficiency."}

One significant factor could be the operating expenses. The operating expenses for Amberjack were $116 million in 2018, $152 million in 2019, and $157 million in 2020, while for Mars, they were $35 million in 2018, $35 million in 2019, and $73 million in 2020. The increase in operating expenses for Amberjack from 2018 to 2019, followed by a slight decrease in 2020, might explain the changes in net income. Similarly, the increase in operating expenses for Mars from 2018 to 2019 and a significant rise in 2020 could have contributed to the fluctuation in net income.\n\nAnother factor that could influence these changes is the revenue generated.

Specifically, the Adjusted EBITDA for 2021 was $65 million, down from $32 million in 2020 and $2 million in 2019 [9]. This decline can be attributed to several factors, as detailed in the quotes.\n\nFrom image1, we see that the operating costs and expenses increased by 14.4% from 2020 to 2021, while the revenue increased by 18.5%, indicating that expenses grew faster than revenue [1]. This trend is consistent with the information provided in text quotes, where it is mentioned that expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 [4], and that there was an increase in NBCUniversal expenses, particularly due to higher programming and technical support costs [3].\n\nLooking at the detailed breakdown in image2, the net income attributable to Comcast Corporation showed a decrease from $30,826 million in 2020 to $29,148 million in 2021, with the largest contributors to this decrease being interest expense, depreciation, and amortization. The adjusted EBITDA further supports this, showing a decrease from $32 million in 2020 to $65 million in 2021, indicating that the company's operational efficiency improved but still faced challenges [9].\n\nThe capital expenditure trends also provide insights into the financial health of the company. As shown in image4, the Cable Communications segment saw significant increases in spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, while other categories like customer premise equipment and support capital decreased [8]. This suggests that Comcast is investing heavily in modernizing its infrastructure to meet growing demand and market recovery.\n\nIn conclusion, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation declined from 2019 to 2021, primarily due to increasing operating costs and expenses, despite revenue growth. This indicates that while the company is expanding its infrastructure and adapting to market conditions, it needs to manage its cost structure more effectively to improve profitability. \n\n![The overall trend in Adjusted EBITDA over the three-year period](image1)"}

The Corporate Centre's revenue increased by £0.4bn, which included intersegment eliminations, largely related to movements in own shares held by the global businesses, which offset an equivalent adverse movement in these businesses.

According to text quote [2], interest and other investment income declined by $470$ million $(44.4\\%)$ in 2021 compared to 2020, and further declined by $1$ billion $(49.0\\%)$ compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. Additionally, the decline in interest rates over this period significantly impacted the interest income from cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, as mentioned in text quote [3].\n\nLooking at the asset allocation, the image `image1` provides insight into the composition of invested assets. As shown, the largest component of the invested assets is equity securities, followed by fixed maturity securities and cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills. The decline in interest income is consistent with the low interest rates noted in text quote [2], where it states that short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, resulting in significantly lower interest income.\n\nMoreover, the image `image4` highlights the amortized unrealized gains/losses on corporate bonds, which increased from $411$ million in 2020 to $1,761$ million in 2021. This significant increase suggests that there was a shift towards more corporate bond investments, which could have contributed to the overall decline in net investment income if the yields on these bonds were lower than anticipated.\n\nFinally, the image `image5` provides a detailed breakdown of the sources of net investment income. The decline in dividend income from $1,059$ million in 2020 to $589$ million in 2021, as seen in the text quote [10], also played a role in the overall reduction. The effective income tax rate increased from $16.1\\%$ in 2020 to $15.3\\%$ in 2021, but this did not fully offset the decline in pre-tax net investment income.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 can be attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, driven by declining interest rates, and a shift in asset allocation towards corporate bonds with potentially lower yields. \n\n![The decline in net investment income is primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as well as changes in asset allocation.](image1)"}

According to the adjusted EBIT figures, the addition of Varian contributed substantially to the overall performance, increasing the adjusted EBIT from €2,248 million in 2020 to €3,142 million in 2021 [2]. This represents a notable 40% increase, with Varian itself contributing €221 million to the total EBIT [3].\n\nLooking at the net assets, the acquisition also had a considerable impact. The net debt increased by €10,416 million to €11,901 million, primarily due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian [7]. This increase in net debt is reflected in the higher net debt figures, which rose from €1,484 million in 2020 to €11,901 million in 2021 [8]. Additionally, the operating net working capital increased by €720 million to €3,270 million, partly due to the acquisition of Varian, which led to an increase of €592 million [4].\n\n![](image4) The operating net working capital and the increase in trade and other receivables, inventories, and remaining current assets all highlight the growth in business activity and anticipated future growth associated with the Varian acquisition.\n\n![](image1) Furthermore, the current receivables from the Siemens Group from financing activities reduced by €2,677 million, while the current liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities reduced by €4 million, indicating that Siemens Healthineers used the funds received from Siemens Group to finance the acquisition of Varian [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of Varian had a significant positive impact on Siemens Healthineers' financial performance, contributing to a substantial increase in adjusted EBIT and leading to a considerable rise in net debt, reflecting the company's strategic investment in expanding its portfolio and capabilities."}

Specifically, the higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal contributed positively to the Underlying EBITDA. However, this positive impact was partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG ([2], [6]).\n\n**Operating Cash Costs**: On the other hand, operating cash costs also showed notable changes. For instance, higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and increased costs associated with the ramp-up of South Flank at Nickel West contributed to the increase in operating cash costs. Nevertheless, strong cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives and a gain from the optimized outcome from renegotiated power contracts at Escondida and Spence helped mitigate some of these increases ([7], [8]).\n\n![The impact of changes in sales prices and operating cash costs on Underlying EBITDA](image1)\n\nThe above image provides a comprehensive breakdown of the changes in sales prices and operating cash costs, illustrating how they influenced the Underlying EBITDA.

In 2019, unallocated revenues were $4,723 million, while in 2020, they decreased significantly to $1,841 million, and further dropped to $54 million in 2021. This decline in unallocated revenues can be attributed to the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results in 2021, and the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in 2019, which contributed to the high unallocated revenues in 2019.\n\nConversely, the unallocated expenses showed a consistent downward trend. In 2019, unallocated research and development expenses were $989 million, which reduced to $1,046 million in 2020 and further to $1,820 million in 2021. Unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses also followed a similar pattern, decreasing from $413 million in 2019 to $401 million in 2020 and then to $538 million in 2021. The increase in unallocated expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 can be explained by the inclusion of costs associated with the NuVIA acquisition, specifically the recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, and the amortization of certain intangible assets.\n\n![Changes in unallocated revenues and expenses](image1)\n\nRegarding the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021, the total assets acquired were $1,332 million, which included cash equivalents ($174 million), in-process research and development (IPR&D) ($247 million), goodwill ($885 million), and other assets ($26 million). The liabilities assumed were minimal, amounting to only $68 million, leading to a net assets acquired figure of $1,264 million.\n\nComparatively, the decrease in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021, particularly the sharp drop in 2021, does not match the substantial net assets acquired during the NuVIA acquisition. While the net assets acquired in the NuVIA deal were significant, the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses reflect a different trend, highlighting the complexity and variability of financial reporting elements.\n\nThe net assets acquired in the NuVIA deal amounted to $1,264 million, which is notably larger than the sum of unallocated revenues and expenses in any of the three years mentioned. This indicates that the acquisition of NUVIA had a more significant impact on the company's financial structure compared to the internal changes in unallocated revenues and expenses over the same period.\n\nIn summary, the unallocated revenues and expenses saw considerable fluctuations from 2019 to 2021, with a sharp decline in 2021, whereas the net assets acquired in the NuVIA acquisition in 2021 were much larger, indicating a more substantial impact on the company's overall financial position."}

This shift can be attributed to several factors, including higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECLs), and lower revenue.

FICC, for instance, saw a significant increase in performance, with revenues growing by 33% to $6,278 million in 2020, driven by higher volatility levels and increased client activity [10].\n\n![](image2) As seen in image2, the operating expenses for the GBM division slightly decreased by $280 million to $9,264 million in 2020. Despite this, the profit before tax declined due to the aforementioned increase in ECLs and the reduction in net operating income from lower revenue. The RoTE excluding significant items also decreased from 9.8% in 2019 to 6.7% in 2020, indicating a less favorable return on average tangible equity [6].\n\nTo summarize, the net operating income for GBM increased from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, primarily due to strong performance in the Global Markets division. However, the profit before tax decreased from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, largely because of higher ECLs and lower revenue, despite cost reduction initiatives."}

The table shown in image1 (5,017 _, — (3,008) _, = (55) _, 594 _, (2,960) _, = 217 _, 126 _, —_ —_ (17) _, —_ (2) _, 1 _, 1,741 _, 2,110 _, 39,898 _, (34,495) _, (347) _) represents the changes in retained earnings from 2018 to 2020. This table indicates the following sequence of changes: an initial increase of 5,017 _, followed by a decrease of 3,008 _, then a further decrease of 55 _, and so on, leading to a final figure of 217 _. This suggests that while there were some positive contributions to retained earnings, such as the initial increase, the overall trend was negative, with significant decreases throughout the period.\n\nTo understand the factors affecting these changes, we need to look at the components contributing to the net income and retained earnings. Image2 provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in net income and dividends declared and paid, which are key components of retained earnings. The table in image2 (5,595 _, 5,017 _, 5,580 _, 733 _, 708 _, 590 _, 198 _, 288 _, 318 _, 61 _, 54 _, 46 _, 224 _, 217 _, 232 _, (4) _, (23) _, (3) _, (137) _, 81 _, (105) _, (340) _, 133 _, 71 _, 46 _, 216 _, (282) _, (79) _, 265 _, 669 _, 63 _, (93) _, (7) _, 63 _, (15) _, (7) _, (181) _, (193) _, 158 _, (9) _, 29 _, 36 _, (94) _, (35) _, (107) _, 6,139 _, 6,649 _, 7,189 _) shows the changes in net income and dividends declared and paid, indicating that the net income decreased from 5,595 _ in 2018 to 5,580 _ in 2020, while dividends declared and paid increased from 733 _ to 708 _. The decrease in net income could be attributed to various factors such as reduced revenues, increased costs, or higher tax rates, while the increase in dividends might indicate a strategy to return value to shareholders.\n\nNext, we can see the changes in stock repurchases, stock compensation, and other comprehensive income (loss) in image3 (1,498 _, 1,491 _, 1,500 _, (500) _, (750) _, (500) _, (3,426) _, (3,008) _, —(2,555) _, (2,553) _, (2,960) _, (5,100) _, 470 _, 539 _, 373 _, (36) _, (42) _, (47) _, (4,547) _, (4,730) _, —-(6,329) _). The stock repurchases decreased significantly from 1,498 _ to 1,500 _, while other comprehensive income (loss) saw a large negative change, indicating potential losses or unfavorable market conditions. These changes suggest that the company adjusted its capital management strategy, possibly due to market conditions or strategic decisions.\n\nFinally, the changes in cash and short-term investments are shown in image5 (5,580 _, = — (2,555) _, = = (55) _, — 428 _, (5,100) _, — 232 _, (59) _, —_— — (17) _, —_— — (2) _, 1 _, 1,741 _, 1,950 _, 37,906 _, (32,130) _, (473) _). The table indicates a decrease in cash and short-term investments from 5,580 _ to 5,100 _, which might be due to increased spending on operations, investments, or debt repayments.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's retained earnings and net income showed a mixed trend from 2018 to 2020, with significant decreases in net income and retained earnings, partially offset by increases in dividends declared and paid and stock repurchases. The factors affecting these changes include market conditions, operational performance, and capital management strategies. The company's capital management strategy, including share repurchases and dividend increases, played a crucial role in returning value to shareholders despite the overall decline in net income and retained earnings.\n\n![The overall trend in retained earnings and net income was negative, with significant decreases throughout the period.](image1)"}

Specifically, the commercial risk market saw a decrease in the number of individuals served, while Medicare Advantage and Medicaid showed increases.\n\nThe commercial risk market experienced a decline due to increased unemployment and related attrition, as mentioned in quote [10]. This indicates that as more people lost their jobs and thus their health insurance coverage, the number of individuals served through the commercial and Global businesses decreased. Additionally, UnitedHealthcare Global faced a decrease in people served as a result of increased unemployment and underwriting discipline, suggesting that stringent selection criteria led to fewer enrollments.\n\nOn the other hand, Medicare Advantage saw growth in the number of people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans, as stated in quote [10]. This growth can be attributed to the easing of redetermination requirements by states due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, Medicaid experienced an increase in people served, partly because of states easing redetermination requirements and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans. These changes reflect the government's efforts to support healthcare access during the pandemic.\n\n![The number of individuals served decreased in the commercial risk market but increased in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid due to easing redetermination requirements and growth in specific plan types.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare decreased in the commercial risk market due to job losses and underwriting discipline, while there was an increase in the number of individuals served in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid because of policy changes and state actions aimed at supporting healthcare access."}

Specifically, the discount rate for Pension Benefits increased from 3.2% to 3.7%, while for Other Retiree Benefits, it rose from 3.2% to 5.0%. Conversely, the expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits decreased from 8.4% to 5.5%, whereas for Other Retiree Benefits, it remained unchanged at 8.4%.\n\nThese changes could have a substantial impact on the net amount recognized, as seen in the net amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and the net periodic benefit cost/(credit). For instance, the net actuarial loss/(gain) for Pension Benefits increased from $486 million to $1,906 million, reflecting a larger negative impact due to the higher discount rate and lower expected return on plan assets.\n\n![Net Amounts Recognized in AOCI and Net Periodic Benefit Cost/Credit](image3)\n\nThe changes in discount rates and expected returns on plan assets can significantly affect the discounting of future cash flows and the valuation of pension and other retiree benefits, thereby influencing the net amounts recognized. Higher discount rates reduce the present value of future obligations, potentially leading to lower pension and OPRB expenses. However, lower expected returns on plan assets increase the present value of future obligations, potentially increasing pension and OPRB expenses.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in discount rates and expected returns on plan assets from 2021 to 2022 for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits will likely result in a more favorable net amount recognized, primarily due to the higher discount rates, but this is offset by the lower expected returns on plan assets for Pension Benefits."}

According to the text quotes, the revenue from Financial Institutions, Commodities and Derivatives (FICC) segment saw a substantial improvement, with an increase of $1,541 million or 33% (quote [9]). This improvement was driven by higher volatility levels, increased client activity, and wider spreads, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit segments (quote [9]). Additionally, the Rates segment also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds (quote [9]).\n\nFurthermore, the text indicates that HSBC began to allocate revenue and expenses more accurately to reflect the global businesses' activities, which could have contributed to the observed increase in adjusted revenue (quote [1]). This reallocation process might have helped in better capturing the performance of various business units, leading to a more accurate representation of their contributions to the overall revenue.\n\nIn summary, the increase in net operating income and adjusted revenue from Global Markets in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the strong performance of the FICC and Rates segments, along with the improved allocation of revenue and expenses to better reflect the global businesses' activities."}

This increase is primarily due to several transactions, including the exercise of share options/Restricted share units (\"RSUs\"), non-controlling interests arising from business combination, and share-based compensation - value of employee services. Additionally, there was a decrease in treasury shares and retained earnings.\n\n![Equity Components Increase](image1)\n\n#### Image2: Detailed Equity Transactions\nBreaking down the equity transactions, the major changes include:\n- Exercise of share options/RSUs: This transaction contributed positively to the equity, indicating an increase in the number of shares outstanding.\n- Non-controlling interests arising from business combination: This reflects the addition of new subsidiaries or joint ventures, which contributed to the equity.\n- Share-based compensation - value of employee services: This indicates that the company has been granting employees stock options or RSUs, which increases the equity.\n\n![Detailed Equity Transactions](image2)\n\n#### Image3: Further Breakdown\nThe note provides a more granular view of the transactions affecting equity. For instance, in 2021, the company exercised share options/RSUs, which increased equity by RMB3,029 million. Additionally, the non-controlling interests arising from business combinations added RMB3,029 million to the equity. The share-based compensation - value of employee services further contributed to the equity increase.\n\n![Further Breakdown](image3)\n\n#### Image4: Cash Flows\nThe cash flow statement reveals that the company generated substantial cash from operations, which supports the equity increase. However, the major transactions affecting equity also include the repurchase of shares, which reduced the equity by RMB3,561 million in 2021.\n\n![Cash Flows](image4)\n\n#### Image5: Additional Details\nThe balance sheet at the start of 2019 shows the initial equity structure.

Let's break down the key points:\n\n- **Revenue Trends**: The revenue in the Media segment increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, with a notable boost in 2021, mainly due to the broadcasting of the Tokyo Olympics, which added approximately $1.8 billion to the Media segment revenue [1]. Excluding this impact, the revenue in the Media segment increased by $11.0\\%$, driven by growth in distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue, which includes the effects of the ongoing pandemic [1].\n\n- **Customer Relationships**: The total customer relationships slightly decreased from 2019 to 2021, with a loss of 394 actual customer relationships [1]. However, the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% in 2021, reflecting improvements in revenue per customer despite the slight decline in customer numbers [4].\n\n- **Studios Segment**: The Studios segment saw a 16.2% increase in revenue to $9.4$ billion in 2021, attributed to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment and other revenue, as production operations returned to full capacity [1].\n\n- **Theme Parks Segment**: The Theme Parks segment revenue surged by 141.2% to $5.1$ billion in 2021, largely due to the operation of theme parks compared to the previous year's temporary closures and capacity restrictions caused by the pandemic [1].\n\n- **Net Additions/Losses**: The net additions/losses of customer relationships indicate a slight decline in total customer relationships from 2019 to 2021, with a reduction of 394 actual customer relationships in 2021 [1].\n\n- **Average Monthly Direct-to-Consumer Revenue**: The average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% in 2021, reflecting an improvement in revenue per customer, although there was a slight decrease in customer relationships [4].\n\n- **Expenses**: Expenses decreased in 2021, primarily due to the completion of severance charges and cost savings initiatives from the previous years [5].\n\n- **Sky Segment**: Sky's revenue increased by 9.1% to $20.3$ billion in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign currency, and this increase was driven by increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue due to the impacts of the pandemic and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A [10].\n\nIn summary, the financial performance of NBCUniversal improved from 2019 to 2021, marked by a significant increase in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, especially in the Media and Theme Parks segments, while the customer relationship trends showed a slight decline but with a positive trend in revenue per customer. This indicates a mixed but generally positive financial trajectory for the company over the three-year period.\n\n![The slight decline in total customer relationships from 2019 to 2021](image1)\n![The increase in average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship](image2)\n![The increase in Media segment revenue, excluding the impact of the Tokyo Olympics](image3)\n![The significant increase in Theme Parks segment revenue](image4)\n![The increase in Studios segment revenue](image5)"}

Specifically, the revenue for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' grew from $2,854 million in fiscal 2019 to $4,473 million in fiscal 2020, representing a substantial 57% increase. This growth can be attributed to the company's strategic investments and expansion in its platform offerings, which likely contributed to the increased demand and adoption among customers. \n\n![Impact on financial performance](image3)\n\nMoreover, the cost of revenues for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category also increased, but at a slightly lower rate compared to the revenue growth. The cost of revenues rose from $1,898 million in fiscal 2019 to $2,506 million in fiscal 2020, reflecting a 32% increase. However, the significant rise in revenue outpaces the cost of revenues, leading to improved gross margins. This trend suggests that the company is effectively managing its costs while driving revenue growth, which is beneficial for overall profitability.\n\n![Overall cost of revenues](image5)\n\nIn summary, the growth in the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category from 2019 to 2020 has a positive impact on the overall financial performance.

As shown, the total lease liabilities for operating and finance leases decreased from $497 million in 2020 to $3,503 million in 2021. This significant increase in 2021 is primarily due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities associated with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard.\n\n### Lease Costs\nThe image `image6` summarizes the total lease costs for both operating and finance leases. For 2021, the total lease costs were $2,265 million, which is a slight decrease from $2,596 million in 2020. This reduction is attributed to the decrease in operating lease costs from $2,551 million to $2,199 million, while the finance lease costs remained relatively stable at $66 million.\n\nTo further illustrate this, let's look at the specific figures from `image7` which shows the operating lease costs for 2021 and 2020. The operating lease costs decreased from $2,551 million in 2020 to $2,199 million in 2021, indicating a decline in the costs associated with operating leases.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the trend in lease liabilities indicates a significant increase from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard and the recognition of right-of-use assets. On the other hand, the trend in lease costs shows a slight decrease from 2020 to 2021, mainly driven by a reduction in operating lease costs.\n\n![The total lease liabilities increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, reflecting the adoption of the new lease accounting standard.](image4)\n![The total lease costs decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a reduction in operating lease costs.](image6)"}

The table in **image1** provides a comprehensive overview of these changes:\n\n- **Total Loans**: There was a decrease of $42,578 million (11%) in total loans from 2020 to 2021, driven by lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets, partially offset by modest loan growth in late 2021 due to higher line utilization and customer growth. Specifically, Home Lending saw a decrease of $44,140 million (16%), while Small Business experienced a decrease of $3,303 million (10%). Auto, Credit Card, and Personal Lending also showed decreases but were less pronounced compared to Home Lending and Small Business.\n\n- **Total Deposits**: In contrast, total deposits increased by $112,654 million (16%) from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending reflecting government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is evident in **image1**, where total deposits increased from $629,110 million in 2020 to $722,085 million in 2021, and further to $834,739 million in 2021.\n\n![Total loans and deposits changes](image1)\n\nAdditionally, **image3** provides a detailed breakdown of revenue and expenses, showing that noninterest income, particularly deposit-related fees and lending-related fees, increased due to higher treasury management fees driven by an increase in transaction volumes and repricing. This indicates that despite the overall decrease in loans, the bank managed to boost its income through fee-based services and other noninterest income sources.\n\nIn summary, the total loans decreased by 11% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower loan demand and paydowns, whereas total deposits increased by 16% during the same period, reflecting higher liquidity and government stimulus programs. These changes highlight the bank's ability to adapt to the changing market conditions and maintain revenue through fee-based services and other noninterest income sources."}

As of December 31, 2020, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 21.5% in 2019 to 18.0%, indicating a reduction in the proportion of TLAC relative to RWA. This change reflects a strategic adjustment in the capital structure, possibly due to the deferral of the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period, as stated in [9].\n\n![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 2019 to 2020](image5)\n\nThese changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 collectively indicate that the financial institution has shifted its focus towards managing credit risks more aggressively, which has led to an increase in RWA. Simultaneously, the institution has adjusted its TLAC requirements, likely to align with regulatory expectations and strategic capital management objectives. Overall, these changes have affected the institution's capital structure by increasing the reliance on equity and other forms of capital to cover credit risks, thereby enhancing its resilience against potential financial shocks."}

However, after accounting for taxes and an exceptional expense related to the Assam dues becoming doubtful of recovery, the net profit dropped to Rs. 37.91 crore, down from Rs. 47.80 crore [7]. This indicates that while the company achieved a notable increase in sales and profitability, it still faced challenges related to tax and recovery issues.\n\nThe potential for tobacco export earnings, as depicted in image3, suggests that India could significantly boost its export earnings by increasing its share of the global tobacco trade. Currently, India holds only 0.7% of the USD 30 billion annual global tobacco trade, with potential earnings of Rs. 7000 crore, compared to the current Rs. 930 crore [3]. This presents a substantial opportunity for the company to expand its export business, which already saw a significant increase in 2002-2003, with exports rising to Rs. 52.47 crore from Rs. 10.99 crore the previous year [9].\n\nGiven the potential for export earnings, the company's strategy could benefit from focusing more on enhancing its export capabilities. The rise in cigarette exports from Rs. 2.4 crore to Rs. 19.2 crore in the same period [9] demonstrates the positive impact of strategic export initiatives. Additionally, the company's efforts to transfer advanced farming technologies and promote integrated pest management systems could further enhance the quality and quantity of tobacco produced, making it more attractive for export.\n\nThe company's strategy should also consider the implications of discriminatory taxation policies, as illustrated in image2, where cigarettes face a tax burden 21 times greater than bidis and 17 times greater than chewing tobacco [2]. Such policies may shift consumption towards cheaper non-cigarette products, potentially impacting the company's core business. Therefore, while the company should continue to capitalize on the export potential, it should also advocate for fairer taxation policies to protect its domestic market.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial results for 2002-2003 indicate a strong performance with significant growth in sales and profitability, but the company must also address the challenges posed by discriminatory taxation and focus on expanding its export potential to maximize long-term growth. ![Expanding export potential can significantly boost earnings](image3) ![Fairer taxation policies are crucial for maintaining market share](image2)"}

Let's analyze these changes and how they reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America.\n\n### Changes in Net Interest Income and Net Interest Expense\n\n#### From 2019 to 2020\n- **Net Interest Income**: There was a decrease of $19,747 million in net interest income from 2019 to 2020. This is evident from the image4, where it shows a net change of $-19,747 million in interest income and a net change of $-714 million in interest expense, resulting in a net decrease of $5,627 million in net interest income.\n- **Net Interest Expense**: There was a decrease of $14,120 million in net interest expense from 2019 to 2020. This can be seen in the image4, which shows a net change of $-14,120 million in interest expense.\n\n#### From 2018 to 2019\n- **Net Interest Income**: There was an increase of $714 million in net interest income from 2018 to 2019. This is reflected in the image4, showing a net change of $714 million in net interest income.\n- **Net Interest Expense**: There was an increase of $22,345 million in net interest expense from 2018 to 2019. This can be observed in the image4, indicating a net change of $22,345 million in interest expense.\n\n### Reflection on Organizational Structure\n\nThe changes in net interest income and net interest expense reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of Bank of America's organizational structure. These changes are influenced by various factors such as shifts in interest rates, changes in loan and deposit volumes, and the deployment of capital. The bank's segmented approach, as detailed in the images and quotes, helps in understanding how different parts of the organization contribute to these figures.\n\nFor instance, the decrease in net interest income from 2019 to 2020, despite a decrease in net interest expense, suggests that the bank faced challenges in generating revenue from its core lending and deposit activities. This could be due to competitive pressures, regulatory changes, or broader macroeconomic conditions like lower interest rates. The deployment of excess deposits into securities and the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances, as mentioned in quote [1], highlight the bank's efforts to manage its balance sheet and maintain liquidity.\n\nMoreover, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2018 to 2019 show a contrasting trend, indicating a period of growth and improvement in the bank's core operations. This could be attributed to better loan origination, effective cost management, and favorable market conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense over the two periods reflect the dynamic nature of Bank of America's operations and the strategies employed by the management to navigate through varying economic conditions. The bank's segmented approach and risk management framework, as described in the quotes and images, play a crucial role in shaping these outcomes.\n\n![Changes in net interest income and net interest expense reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of Bank of America's organizational structure.](image1)"}

Specifically, the dividend income decreased from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, while the pre-tax net investment income dropped from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021. This decline is attributed to lower interest rates affecting the income from cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, as mentioned in text quote [10].\n\nExamining the asset composition, the image1 provides a snapshot of the insurance business's balance sheet. In 2021, the total assets stood at $446.277 billion, compared to $363.117 billion in 2020, reflecting a substantial increase. The largest component of this growth was the increase in equity securities, which rose from $269.498 billion in 2020 to $334.907 billion in 2021. This growth is evident in the image1, where equity securities saw a significant increase.\n\n![Implications of changes in net investment income and asset composition](image2)\n\nThe decrease in net investment income and the substantial increase in equity securities imply several potential implications. Firstly, the decline in income from traditional fixed-income investments suggests that the company has shifted its focus towards more volatile but potentially higher-yielding assets, such as equity securities. This shift could be a strategic move to enhance returns amidst low-interest-rate environments. However, it also introduces greater volatility into the company's earnings due to the fluctuating nature of equity markets, as highlighted in text quote [9]. Secondly, the increase in equity securities could indicate a broader diversification strategy, aiming to reduce reliance on fixed-income investments and mitigate the impact of low interest rates on overall investment income.\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net investment income and the substantial increase in equity securities from 2020 to 2021 suggest a strategic shift towards more volatile but potentially higher-yielding assets, which could enhance long-term returns but also introduce greater earnings volatility."}

The upstream segment saw a dramatic improvement in 2021, with the U.S. and international segments reporting earnings of $7,319 million and $8,499 million respectively, up from losses of $1,608 million and $825 million in 2020. The total upstream earnings rose from a loss of $2,433 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,818 million in 2021. This improvement was driven by higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and increased sales volumes. However, the downstream segment faced challenges, with the U.S. and international segments reporting earnings of $2,389 million and $525 million respectively, down from profits of $1,559 million and $618 million in 2020. The total downstream earnings decreased from $2,481 million in 2020 to $2,914 million in 2021, mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses.\n\nThese trends significantly impacted the overall net income. The consolidated statement of income (image2) illustrates that Chevron's net income attributable to Chevron Corporation increased from a loss of $5,543 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,625 million in 2021. This substantial improvement was primarily due to the strong performance in the upstream segment, which more than offset the downturn in the downstream segment. The return on capital employed also improved from negative 2.8% in 2020 to 9.4% in 2021, reflecting the positive impact of the upstream earnings.\n\nIn summary, the upstream segment's strong performance in 2021, particularly in the U.S. and international markets, significantly contributed to the overall net income increase, while the downstream segment faced challenges that were partly offset by favorable foreign currency effects."}

As shown in the estimated fair value changes (image1), a 30% increase in prices leads to a decrease in the fair value of equity index put option contract liabilities from $99 million to $74 million, while a 30% decrease in prices results in an increase from $99 million to $1,088 million. This indicates that when interest rates rise, the fair value of these contracts tends to decrease, and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. denominated debt can be observed in the changes reported in net earnings. According to image5, the non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings changed from a negative effect of $764 million in 2020 to a positive effect of $955 million in 2021. Similarly, the net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings shifted from a negative effect of $163 million in 2020 to a positive effect of $58 million in 2021.

This significant shift can be attributed to several key factors. First, there was a notable increase in margins on refined product sales, which contributed $1.6 billion to the earnings [9]. Additionally, higher earnings from a 50 percent-owned chemical business, CPChem, added $1.0 billion, and increased sales volumes of $470 million also played a role [9]. However, higher operating expenses of $150 million somewhat offset these gains [9].\n\nFor the international downstream sector, the earnings increased from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021 [5], showing a decline from the previous year. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales, which amounted to a reduction of $330 million, and higher operating expenses of $100 million [5].

This decrease was influenced by several factors, including higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, as mentioned in text quote [5].\n\nFurthermore, the capital expenditures for 2020 ($9,478 million) were slightly lower than in 2019 ($9,812 million), but this reduction was not enough to offset the decline in operating cash flow. Additionally, the dividends paid in 2020 ($1,436 million) were similar to those in 2019 ($852 million), suggesting that the dividend policy remained consistent despite the lower operating cash flow.\n\nIn summary, the decline in PMI shipment volumes, particularly in cigarettes, negatively impacted the overall financial performance in Latin America & Canada from 2019 to 2020, leading to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. Despite the increase in heated tobacco unit shipments, the overall financial health of the region was affected by the reduced cash inflows from operations and higher costs associated with asset impairment and exit strategies."}

In 2019, the net income was $5,895 million, while it dropped to $1,076 million in 2020, reflecting a substantial decrease of 82%. However, by 2021, the net income recovered to $8,555 million, an increase of 695 million dollars or 695% compared to 2020 [6]. This recovery can be attributed to various factors, including changes in revenue, expenses, and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nIn terms of selected balance sheet data, both loans and deposits saw notable changes. As shown in image3, the total loans decreased from $379,766 million in 2019 to $333,885 million in 2021, representing a drop of 11% [3]. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in Home Lending, Credit Card, Small Business, and Personal Lending loans, as illustrated in image4. The total deposits, however, increased from $629,110 million in 2019 to $834,739 million in 2021, a rise of 16% [3]. This growth in deposits can be attributed to the increase in liquidity and savings for consumer customers, as mentioned in quote [3].\n\nThe net interest income also saw a decline, decreasing from $25,786 million in 2019 to $22,807 million in 2021, a decrease of 9% [6]. This decline was partly due to lower net interest income, reflecting a lower deposit spread and lower loan balances, as highlighted in quote [1]. Additionally, there was a slight increase in noninterest income, rising from $12,105 million in 2019 to $12,070 million in 2021, but this increase was not enough to offset the decrease in net interest income [6].\n\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the cost of generating revenue, improved from 79% in 2019 to 71% in 2021, indicating better operational efficiency [6]. This improvement can be attributed to lower noninterest expenses, as seen in the decrease from $26,998 million in 2019 to $24,648 million in 2021 [6].\n\nIn summary, the net income for Consumer Banking and Lending improved significantly from 2020 to 2021, reflecting better operational performance and reduced credit losses. Meanwhile, the balance sheet data showed a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, driven by consumer behavior changes and government stimulus programs [6].\n\n![Key changes in loans and deposits from 2019 to 2021](image3)"}

In 2021, the average Card Member loans increased from $14.2 billion in 2019 to $14.5 billion in 2020, and further to $18.0 billion in 2021. Simultaneously, the net interest income saw a significant increase from $6,660 million in 2019 to $7,145 million in 2020, and then to $7,683 million in 2021. This growth in both average Card Member loans and net interest income indicates an expansion in the company's lending activities and a corresponding rise in earnings.\n\n![Implications for financial performance](image2)\n\nThe increase in average Card Member loans and net interest income has several implications for the company's financial performance. First, it suggests a growing customer base and an expanding loan portfolio, which is a positive sign for the company's revenue generation capabilities. Second, the growth in net interest income, while partially offset by a slight decline in the net interest yield, still reflects an overall improvement in the company's profitability. The net interest yield, however, slightly decreased from 11.3% in 2019 to 11.2% in 2020, and then to 11.1% in 2021, indicating that while the absolute amount of net interest income is increasing, the efficiency of generating income per dollar of average loans is marginally decreasing. This trend could be due to factors such as lower interest rates or higher paydown rates on loans.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in average Card Member loans and net interest income from 2019 to 2021 signifies a robust growth in the company's lending activities and a positive impact on its financial performance, though the net interest yield has shown a slight decrease, indicating a need to manage interest rate risks effectively."}

Specifically, this expense is recorded under the \"Share-based compensation expense\" line item in the reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. This expense does not involve an immediate outflow of cash but increases the total equity by reducing retained earnings and increasing accumulated share-based compensation.\n\n![Cash flow from operating activities impacts cash and comprehensive income](image2)\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the fiscal year 2020 was $8,215,152, which is a significant contributor to the cash position. This amount includes net income of $5,185,313 and adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, and changes in working capital. The cash flow statement also shows that there were no significant purchases of property and equipment, which would otherwise reduce the cash balance.\n\nIn summary, share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities play crucial roles in contributing to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position. Share-based compensation increases shareholders' equity without immediate cash outflows, while cash flow from operating activities ensures a strong cash position by reflecting the company's operational performance and efficiency."}

Let's examine these changes step-by-step.\n\nIn terms of equity, as shown in image3, Siemens Healthineers' total equity attributable to shareholders increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021, an increase of €3,823 million. This substantial rise in equity is primarily attributed to the issuance of new shares in March 2021, which raised the issued capital by €53 million and the capital reserve by €2,275 million, as highlighted in text quote [10].\n\nOn the liability side, the changes are depicted in image5 and image6. In image5, we can observe that the remaining current liabilities to the Siemens Group increased significantly from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021, an increase of €1,168 million. This increase can be explained by the contractual obligations for property, plant, and equipment purchases, as mentioned in text quote [4], where Siemens Healthineers committed to spending €84 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €107 million in 2020. Furthermore, other current financial liabilities also saw an increase, rising from €93 million to €263 million, indicating additional borrowings or obligations.\n\nRegarding non-current liabilities, as shown in image6, the deferred tax liabilities increased from €470 million in 2020 to €2,082 million in 2021, a substantial jump of €1,612 million. This significant rise is likely due to the company's profitability, as indicated by the increase in net income from €1,276 million in 2020 to €1,746 million in 2021, as shown in image4.\n\nIn summary, the key drivers for the changes in Siemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity from 2020 to 2021 include the issuance of new shares, the increase in contractual obligations, and the rise in deferred tax liabilities. The equity increased by €3,823 million mainly due to the capital increase in March 2021, while the liabilities grew due to increased current and non-current financial obligations."}

This issuance added to the cash and cash equivalents, contributing positively to the net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the company redeemed the full $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C and $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B, as stated in [2]. These redemptions resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, reducing the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity can be seen in the changes in preferred shares and retained earnings. In 2021, the issuance of $1.6 billion in preferred shares increased the total shareholders' equity, as shown in the accumulation of preferred and common shares, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings in [5]. Conversely, the redemption of preferred shares decreased shareholders' equity.

This represents an increase of $4,469 million, or about 5.7%. This growth can be attributed to an increase in current assets, particularly in receivables and other current assets, as well as a slight increase in property, plant and equipment. Notably, there was a decrease in long-term receivables and intangible assets, suggesting a strategic shift in asset allocation.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n- The cash flow from operating activities increased significantly from $4,054 million in 2020 to $7,180 million in 2021. This increase of $3,126 million, or 77%, is primarily due to higher profit in 2021, adjusted for non-cash items such as higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. Additionally, changes in working capital, particularly in accounts payable and accrued expenses, contributed to this improvement.\n\n![Implications of changes in total assets and cash flow](image1)\n\nThe increase in total assets and the substantial rise in cash flow from operating activities indicate a healthier financial position for the consolidated segment. Improved profitability, better management of working capital, and effective cost control have likely led to enhanced operational efficiency and stronger liquidity. These changes suggest that the business operations are more resilient and capable of sustaining growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the significant increases in both total assets and cash flow from operating activities imply that the company has become more robust and financially stable, which is crucial for long-term success and investment attractiveness."}

This decrease can be attributed to a significant drop in non-interest income from $1,230 million to $1,076 million, along with a decline in net interest income from $11,708 million to $11,708 million (the figure remains unchanged, but this could be due to other factors such as cost control or strategic decisions). The wealth management division within Wealth and Personal Banking saw a reduction in revenue from $8,633 million to $7,818 million, which includes a decrease in investment distribution from $3,268 million to $3,209 million and a reduction in life insurance manufacturing from $2,464 million to $1,816 million. \n\nOn the other hand, the Commercial Banking segment, which includes Retail Banking and Global Private Banking, showed a net operating income of $22,013 million, a decrease from $25,565 million in 2019, reflecting a similar decline of $3,552 million or 14%. However, the breakdown reveals that the main contributors to this decline were the Retail Banking segment, where net interest income dropped from $13,993 million to $11,708 million, and non-interest income fell from $1,662 million to $1,230 million. The Global Private Banking segment experienced a more modest decline in revenue from $1,878 million to $1,746 million, with a slight decrease in investment distribution from $3,268 million to $3,209 million and a reduction in life insurance manufacturing from $2,464 million to $1,816 million.\n\n![Net Operating Income Comparison](image1)\n\nAs illustrated in image1, both segments experienced a substantial decline in net operating income in 2020 compared to 2019. For Wealth and Personal Banking, the net operating income dropped by $3,552 million, whereas for Commercial Banking, the decline was slightly less at $3,552 million. This indicates that although the declines were comparable, the overall revenue composition differed between the two segments.\n\nIn terms of profit before tax, Wealth and Personal Banking reported $1,868 million, a decrease of $5,302 million or 74% compared to $7,170 million in 2019. The significant drop in profit before tax is largely due to a large increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges from $1,162 million to $4,754 million.

In contrast, Commercial Banking maintained a relatively steady decline, suggesting that other factors such as cost management and operational efficiency played a role in mitigating the impact of the economic downturn.\n\nIn summary, both Wealth and Personal Banking and Commercial Banking experienced a significant decline in net operating income and profit before tax in 2020, with Wealth and Personal Banking showing a more pronounced decrease in these metrics."}

By the end of the fiscal year 2020 (28 June 2020), this figure increased to $150,464,000.

This event significantly impacted the tax provision and led to a substantial increase in the effective tax rate.\n\n![](image6) The deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 26, 2021, show a net deferred tax asset of $1,527.3 million, compared to $1,295 million in 2020, indicating a slight increase in deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance also increased from $(1,728) million in 2020 to $(1,926) million in 2021, suggesting more uncertainty regarding the realization of these deferred tax assets.\n\n![](image8) The effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 was 12%, a decrease from 41% in 2019. This reduction can be attributed to several factors, including the benefit from the FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) deduction, the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards, and the benefit related to research and development tax credits [8].\n\nThe trend in the tax provision itself also reflects these changes. For instance, the federal and state current provision (benefit) decreased from $1,563 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2021 [9], while the deferred (benefit) provision increased from $(117) million in 2019 to $1231 million in 2021, indicating a shift from recognizing benefits to provisions.\n\n![](image9) The current provision (benefit) showed a decline from $1,563 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2021, with the foreign component decreasing from $1,158 million to $521 million. The deferred (benefit) provision, however, saw a significant increase from $(117) million to $1,231 million, reflecting the changing tax environment and the company's strategies.\n\nOverall, Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits have shown considerable variability and strategic shifts over the past three years, influenced by factors such as tax incentives, tax credits, and the derecognition of deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate has notably decreased from 41% in 2019 to 12% in 2021, indicating improved tax management and the utilization of various tax benefits.\n\nQualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits have seen significant changes, particularly due to strategic tax planning and the impact of specific events like the derecognition of deferred tax assets."}

This change is reflected in the image1, which displays a decrease in noninterest income of $355 million attributed to the sale of the student loan portfolio and $269 million from the sale of WFAM.\n\nThis transaction had broader impacts on the company's income and balance sheet. According to the image1, there was a notable increase in noninterest income, primarily due to gains from the sale of the Corporate Trust Services business ($674 million), the student loan portfolio ($355 million), and WFAM ($269 million). However, the gains were partially offset by lower gains on the sales of certain residential mortgage loans and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM resulted in a decrease in total assets, as seen in image3, where total assets fell from $728,667 million at the end of 2020 to $721,335 million at the end of 2021. The reduction in assets can be attributed to the decrease in equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities, as well as the reduction in AUM. The efficiency ratio also slightly improved from 83% in 2020 to 82% in 2021, suggesting more efficient use of resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, significantly reduced the total WFAM AUM and had a positive impact on the company's income statement, particularly in terms of noninterest income, while also affecting the balance sheet by decreasing total assets."}

The net interest spread in 2020 was 1.90%, whereas in 2019 it was 2.43% (see image5).\n\n**Net Interest Spread Impact:**\n- The decrease in net interest income ($5.5 billion) and the decrease in net interest expense ($14,120 million) contributed to a reduction in the net interest spread from 2.43% in 2019 to 1.90% in 2020. This indicates that while there was a significant decrease in both income and expense, the expense decrease was proportionally larger, leading to a reduction in the spread.\n\n**Main Contributing Factors:**\n- **Lower Interest Rates:** The decrease in net interest income and expense is primarily driven by lower interest rates, as mentioned in text quote [6]. Lower rates reduce the income earned on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n- **Reduced Deposit and Funding Costs:** The net interest expense also saw a decrease, which could be attributed to reduced deposit and funding costs, as stated in text quote [6].\n- **Deployment of Excess Deposits:** The deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual helped partially offset the reduction in income, but the overall impact was negative.\n\n![The net interest spread decreased from 2.43% in 2019 to 1.90% in 2020 due to lower interest rates and reduced deposit and funding costs, despite the deployment of excess deposits into securities.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a reduction in the net interest spread, mainly due to lower interest rates and reduced deposit and funding costs."}

This indicates that there is a significant imbalance in the gender distribution within senior roles, where there are more men than women in these positions.\n\nLooking at the image1, we can observe that the percentage of senior leadership roles held by women is 30%, while the percentage of senior leadership roles held by men is 70%. This clearly illustrates that men dominate senior leadership positions, whereas women make up only 30% of such roles.

The data indicates that 52% of all employees are male and 48% are female. This suggests that while there is a slight male majority among all employees, the disparity is not as pronounced as it is in senior leadership roles. The text quotes further support this, noting that the overall UK gender pay gap is driven by the fact that there are more men in senior and high-paid roles, and more women in junior roles.\n\nIn summary, the gender distribution among senior leadership roles is heavily skewed towards men, with only 30% of senior leadership positions being held by women, compared to the overall employee gender distribution of 52% male and 48% female.

This reduction in cash flow from operations is mainly due to unfavorable currency movements, higher working capital requirements, and increased cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs. However, excluding these factors, there was an increase in net cash provided by operating activities by $0.2 billion (see [10]).\n\n**Investing Activities:**\n- The net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly from $10,090 million in 2019 to $1,200 million in 2020, a decrease of $8,890 million. This substantial decline is primarily attributed to the reduction in capital expenditures, the deconsolidation of RBH, and lower cash collateral posted to secure derivatives (see [9]).\n\n**Financing Activities:**\n- Net cash used in financing activities increased from $8,061 million in 2019 to $8,496 million in 2020, an increase of $435 million. This rise is mainly due to higher dividends paid and payments to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher short-term borrowings (see [4] and [12]).\n\n![The impact on overall cash balance](image1)\n\nThe table above shows the detailed breakdown of liabilities, including short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The overall decrease in net cash used in investing activities and the increase in net cash used in financing activities contribute to the increase in the overall cash balance. As shown in the cash flow statement, the net cash provided by operating activities, despite the decrease, still contributed positively. The net cash used in investing activities reduced the cash outflow, while the increased cash used in financing activities slightly offset this benefit but did not completely negate it.\n\nTherefore, the overall cash balance at the end of 2020 increased by $420 million compared to the end of 2019, reflecting a net positive effect from the changes in cash flows from all three activities."}

This indicates that remuneration is directly linked to the company's financial health and stock performance, which are key business performance metrics.\n\nFurthermore, text quote [5] highlights that the Board of Directors delegates the determination of the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors to the Executive Compensation Meeting. This meeting takes into account factors such as corporate performance as well as individual job responsibilities and performance, ensuring that remuneration reflects the overall success of the company and the contributions of its executives.\n\nImage1 provides a detailed breakdown of the evaluation method used to determine the Annual Total Remuneration. It includes evaluating the degree of attainment of consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota's share price. This further emphasizes the importance of financial performance and market perception in the remuneration process.\n\nAdditionally, image4 shows the breakdown of remuneration for different categories of executives, including Directors and Outside Directors. For instance, the Directors receive a significant portion of their remuneration as performance-linked bonuses, which are tied to the company's performance. This aligns with the principle that executive compensation should be performance-based and linked to the company's success.\n\nLastly, image5 illustrates the evaluation of each director's performance based on business performance indicators, indicating that Toyota uses specific metrics to assess the effectiveness of its executives. This ensures that remuneration is not only based on financial outcomes but also on the strategic and operational performance of the executives.\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators by linking remuneration to key financial metrics like consolidated operating income and share price volatility, and by evaluating individual performance against these metrics. ![Reflecting business performance and shareholder value](image1)"}

Specifically, the net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, primarily due to lower interest rates and the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income also saw a decrease of $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a decline in service charges and card income due to decreased client activity, as well as lower other income related to ALM results [8]. This led to a significant drop in net income from $6.5 billion in 2019 to $6.5 billion in 2020, reflecting lower revenue and higher expenses [8].\n\nOn the other hand, the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, showed a different trend. The total revenue, net of interest expense, for GWIM decreased by $954 million from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020 [2]. However, the Bank of America Private Bank, specifically, experienced a decrease in revenue from $3,426 million in 2019 to $3,292 million in 2020, representing a 4% reduction primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates [5]. \n\nAdditionally, the client balances increased by $302 billion, or 10%, to $3.3 trillion at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019, driven by higher market valuations and positive client flows [6]. This growth in client balances suggests an improvement in the overall health of the GWIM segment, even though the revenue decreased slightly.\n\nThe financial performance indicators for Consumer Banking, such as home equity production and first mortgage loan originations, also showed a decline in 2020. Home equity production decreased by $2.8 billion, and first mortgage loan originations decreased by $6.0 billion, both primarily driven by a decline in applications [4, 7]. These figures highlight the challenges faced by the Consumer Banking segment in 2020.\n\nIn contrast, the GWIM segment maintained a strong presence in the market, as evidenced by the increase in consumer investment assets from $240,132 million to $306,104 million [image1], indicating a robust growth in investment and brokerage services. The active digital banking users and mobile banking users also increased, suggesting an ongoing shift towards digital engagement [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the net interest yield for GWIM improved from 2.33% in 2019 to 1.73% in 2020, while the risk-adjusted margin increased by 88 basis points [10], showing resilience and efficiency improvements within the segment. The debit card purchase volumes also increased significantly, despite the impact of COVID-19, highlighting the segment's adaptability and continued relevance [10].\n\nIn conclusion, while Bank of America's Consumer Banking segment faced significant challenges in 2020, with a decrease in both revenue and net income, the Global Wealth & Investment Management segment demonstrated resilience through its asset management growth, improved margins, and adaptability in the face of market conditions. This difference in performance underscores the distinct strategies and market positions of these two segments within the broader Bank of America structure.\n\n![Consumer Banking faced significant revenue and net income decreases in 2020](image4)\n![GWIM segment showed growth in investment assets and margins](image3)"}

By 2020, this figure had increased to $3,646 million, representing a rise of approximately $995 million, or about 37.7% (see image1 for a visual representation of comprehensive income).\n\nThe substantial increase in comprehensive income can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Gain on Sale of Product Lines**: In 2020, Danaher Corporation sold certain product lines in its Life Sciences segment, generating a pretax gain of $455 million. This gain significantly boosted the company's comprehensive income (see image2 for details on stockholder's equity and image4 for cash flows from operating activities).\n\n2. **Higher Net Earnings**: The net earnings from continuing operations increased from $2,432 million in 2019 to $3,646 million in 2020, marking a substantial improvement (see image4 for detailed operating cash flows).\n\n3. **Acquisition-Related Gains**: The acquisition of Cytiva in 2020 contributed to the increase in comprehensive income. Cytiva's core sales grew by more than 30%, reflecting strength in its served markets and its role in developing and producing vaccines for COVID-19 (refer to text quote [4]).\n\n4. **Decrease in Losses from Cash Flow Hedge Adjustments**: The company experienced a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019, contributing positively to the comprehensive income (text quote [1]).\n\n5. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: There was a significant foreign currency translation gain of $2,900 million in 2020, compared to a loss of $75 million in 2019 (text quote [1]). This reflects favorable movements in exchange rates, which positively impacted the company's financial performance.\n\nThese factors, along with the overall growth in sales and operational efficiency, led to the notable increase in Danaher Corporation's comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020.\n\n![Summary of factors contributing to comprehensive income change](image1)"}

Let's break it down:\n\nIn the U.S. segment, the total revenues increased slightly from $7,656 million in 2019 to $7,843 million in 2020 [7]. This modest growth is attributed to the positive sales performance in the U.S., which was more than offset by support provided for marketing, such as the free Thank You Meals served to first responders and healthcare workers [1].\n\nIn contrast, the International Operated Markets segment saw a substantial decrease in revenues. The total revenues for this segment dropped from $9,462 million in 2019 to $5,114 million in 2020 [7], reflecting a 45% decline. This decline was driven by the temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in several key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3].\n\nThe image `image1` illustrates the revenue changes excluding currency translation, showing a significant decrease in the International Operated Markets segment by 13% in 2020 compared to 2019. Similarly, `image2` further supports this trend, depicting a 5.0% increase in the U.S. and a 6.1% increase in 2018, but a decline of 4.5% in 2019, followed by a more pronounced drop in 2020.\n\nThe decline in the International Operated Markets segment can also be seen in the breakdown of restaurant margins. `image3` shows that the Company-operated margins decreased from $1,747 million in 2019 to $1,660 million in 2020, while the franchised margins remained relatively stable at $1,660 million [8]. This suggests that the significant support provided for marketing and other costs in the International Operated Markets segment led to a reduction in overall margins.\n\nMoreover, the image `image4` provides a detailed view of the revenue composition. It shows that the total restaurant margins decreased by 13% in 2020 compared to 2019, with the International Operated Markets segment contributing significantly to this decline [10]. The segment's revenues decreased by 10%, while the U.S. segment showed a slight improvement, increasing by 4%.\n\nIn summary, the revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, with the U.S. segment experiencing a modest growth and the International Operated Markets segment facing a substantial decline. These changes were primarily influenced by the global pandemic, leading to temporary closures and limited operations in international markets, while the U.S. maintained its positive performance through strategic marketing efforts and delivery growth."}

For 2019, this value was $6,061 million, while for 2020, it decreased to $5,906 million. This reduction of $155 million is due to the increase in accumulated depreciation from $723 million to $955 million.\n\nFor property, plant, and equipment (PPE), the net value is shown in image1. The total PPE value for 2019 was $14,130 million, and for 2020, it increased to $17,864 million. However, the accumulated depreciation also increased from $3,734 million in 2019 to $5,117 million in 2020.

Let's break it down:\n\n- **2018**: The net income was $4,214,594 million, which contributed positively to the shareholders' equity. Additionally, other comprehensive income, which includes items like foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans, had a negative impact of $481,387 million. After adjusting for this, the comprehensive income attributable to Accenture plc was $3,578,520 million.\n\n- **2019**: The net income increased to $4,846,241 million, further boosting shareholders' equity. However, other comprehensive income dropped to a loss of $264,406 million. This resulted in a comprehensive income attributable to Accenture plc of $4,514,706 million.\n\n- **2020**: The net income saw another rise to $5,185,313 million, contributing significantly to shareholders' equity. Other comprehensive income, however, improved to $278,740 million. The comprehensive income attributable to Accenture plc was $5,386,579 million.\n\nTo summarize, the increase in net income each year has had a positive impact on shareholders' equity, while other comprehensive income (which can include gains and losses from various sources) has also played a role in the overall change in shareholders' equity.

For instance, the total number of stores increased from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, reflecting Lovisa's commitment to international growth.\n\nLovisa's strategy includes continuous improvement in its existing store network and the identification of new markets. The group aims to enhance customer loyalty and profitability by implementing measures such as the global roll-out of piercing services, as mentioned in quote [1]. This initiative, completed during fiscal year 2020, underscores Lovisa's dedication to providing a comprehensive customer experience and fostering brand loyalty. Additionally, Lovisa has streamlined its supply chain processes, as highlighted in quote [2], which has helped in generating higher gross margins and cost reductions.\n\nLovisa's approach to international expansion is multifaceted, as evidenced in quote [4]. The company is not only focused on opening new stores but also on leveraging its existing international territories, as seen in the significant growth in stores in the United Kingdom, France, and the USA. Lovisa also plans to explore new markets through pilot programs, as stated in quote [4], which allows the company to test new territories before committing to full-scale expansion.\n\nHowever, the international expansion strategy faces several challenges. One of the primary concerns is the availability of appropriately sized sites in good locations, as noted in quote [8]. This challenge is further compounded by the need to secure quality retail store sites in locations with high pedestrian traffic, as described in quote [9]. The consolidation and rationalization of its supplier base, as well as the optimization of air and sea freight, are strategies employed to mitigate these risks, as highlighted in quote [2].\n\nLovisa's achievements in international expansion are notable, as detailed in image3. During the fiscal year 2020, the company opened over 85 new stores outside of Australia, including 13 in France and 29 in the USA. The group has also successfully rolled out in-store piercing services in multiple countries, enhancing the customer experience and driving loyalty. Furthermore, Lovisa has optimized its supply chain, with over 56% of products being moved through the China warehouse, as reported in quote [2].\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy has evolved to include a mix of geographical diversification and operational efficiency. Key achievements include the successful opening of numerous new stores and the implementation of in-store services like piercing, while challenges such as site availability and supply chain optimization continue to be addressed. \n\n![Lovisa's international store expansion from 2016 to 2020](image5)"}

The underlying trading operating profit margin for this category was 20.5%, as shown in image4. This indicates strong profitability within this segment.\n\nMoving to **Zone EMENA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa)**, the proportion of total sales for milk products and ice cream was 4.2% and 18.7%, respectively.

Specifically, the NII for 2020 was $27.6 billion, a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared with 2019 [8]. This decline was mainly attributed to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, but it was partly offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) of $170.11 billion or 8.8% [8].\n\nMeanwhile, the interest expense also saw a decrease from 2019 to 2020, falling to $14.178 billion in 2020 from $24.233 billion in 2019. This decrease was predominantly driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, although it was partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts [6].\n\n![2020 vs 2019 financial performance](image1)\n\nThe changes in net interest income and interest expense directly impacted the net interest margin (NIM), which fell from 1.58% in 2019 to 1.32% in 2020, indicating a reduction of 26 basis points (bps) [10]. The NIM for the fourth quarter of 2020 further decreased to 1.22%, down 34 bps year-on-year [10].\n\nTo understand the impact on net operating income, we need to look at the overall operating income and expenses. The net operating income before changes in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges for 2020 was $50,429 million, a decrease from $56,098 million in 2019 [5]. This reduction in operating income, combined with a decrease in net interest income and an increase in impairment charges, likely contributed to the overall decline in profitability.\n\nThe overall profitability of the organization was also affected by the changes in the net operating income. For instance, the profit before tax for 2020 was $8,777 million, compared to $13,347 million in 2019 [10]. The tax expense also decreased from $4,639 million in 2019 to $2,678 million in 2020, which might have helped in reducing the overall tax burden [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the decreases in net interest income and interest expense, along with the reduction in NIM, had a negative impact on the net operating income and overall profitability of the organization. The year-on-year decline in key financial metrics such as basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share from 0.30 in 2019 to 0.19 in 2020 further illustrate this trend [1]."}

This region also benefited from market share gains, especially in pet food, portioned and soluble coffee, and vegetarian and plant-based food products [2].\n\nIn contrast, China, part of the Asia-Pacific Operations and Africa (AOA) zone, experienced a high single-digit decrease in organic growth, with negative real internal growth (RIG) and slightly negative pricing [3].

In comparison, the Asia-Pacific Operations and Africa (AOA) zone had an organic growth of +0.5%, with real internal growth of 0.0%, and a trading operating profit margin of 22.2%, which decreased by 30 basis points [3].

Let's start with the net investment income, which saw a decline of 44.4% from 2020 to 2021, as illustrated in image2.\n\n![Net investment income declined by 44.4% from 2020 to 2021](image2)\n\nThis decline was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as mentioned in text quote [2]. The low interest rates prevailing throughout 2021 resulted in significantly lower interest income, despite the company holding substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\nMoving to the railroad operating earnings, there was a notable improvement, with a 11.6% increase from 2020 to 2021, as shown in the image for railroad operating revenues and expenses (image1).\n\n![Railroad operating revenues increased by 11.6% from 2020 to 2021](image1)\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this increase. Firstly, the revenue per car/unit increased by 3.5%, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue due to higher fuel prices and business mix changes. Additionally, the volume of cars/units increased by 6.9%, indicating a recovery from the significant economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The improvement in service, system velocity, and cost performance also played a role, as noted in text quote [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net investment income was mainly due to the impact of low interest rates on short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, while the increase in railroad operating earnings was driven by higher volumes, better fuel surcharge revenue, and improved operational efficiencies."}

The gross lease assets rose from $764 million to $942 million, while the operating lease liabilities increased from $719 million to $974 million. The weighted average remaining lease term remained at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% to 2.8%. This reflects the company's growing commitment to leasing activities, particularly with the Cytiva Acquisition, which likely contributed to the substantial rise in lease liabilities.\n\n![Changes in lease assets and liabilities](image4)\n\nRegarding inventories, image1 provides a detailed breakdown. In 2020, the total inventory value increased to $2,292 million from $1,628 million in 2019. This growth is primarily due to the addition of finished goods, which rose from $833 million to $1,232 million, and an increase in work in process from $285 million to $369 million. Raw materials also saw a notable increase from $510 million to $691 million. These changes in inventory composition reflect the company's expanded operations and higher sales volumes, especially after the acquisition of Cytiva.\n\nThe changes in lease assets and inventories are evident in the financial statements. The increase in lease liabilities and assets indicates a greater reliance on leasing, which is often associated with expanding operations or securing long-term assets. The growth in inventories suggests a higher level of production and sales activity, as well as potential strategic stockpiling. Overall, these shifts contribute to the company's improved operational efficiency and financial health, as seen in the positive cash flow metrics and the substantial increase in sales and earnings."}

In 2020, these components contributed to a total increase of $197 compared to $197 in 2019.\n\n- **Valuation Allowance**: The valuation allowance decreased by $179 in 2020, reducing the net deferred tax asset. In 2019, the decrease was slightly higher at $180. This reduction in the valuation allowance reflects a more favorable outlook on the realization of deferred tax assets.\n\n- **Deferred Tax Liabilities**: The deferred tax liabilities also saw a change, with property, plant and equipment, international carin, and acquisition-related intangibles contributing to the overall liability. However, the significant reduction in deferred tax liabilities from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020 played a crucial role in increasing the net deferred tax asset.\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset increased from $482 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets and a decrease in the valuation allowance, despite a reduction in deferred tax liabilities.

Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. Other restructuring-type charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n\nFor fiscal year 2022, the breakdown of the total restructuring charges was as follows: $67 million were recorded in SG&A, $182 million in Costs of products sold, and $4 million in Other non-operating income, net. For fiscal year 2021, the charges were $176 million recorded in SG&A, $134 million in Costs of products sold, and $20 million in Other non-operating income, net. This shows that the majority of the restructuring costs were allocated to Costs of products sold, with a smaller portion allocated to SG&A and Other non-operating income, net. ![This illustrates the detailed breakdown of restructuring costs for fiscal years 2022 and 2021](image9).\n\nIn summary, the total restructuring costs across different segments decreased from $782 million in 2020 to $253 million in 2022, with the main components being employee separation costs, asset-related costs, and other costs related to supply chain and overhead optimization."}

Let's break down these changes and their implications.\n\nFirstly, the cost of revenues, which is primarily composed of service costs and other cost of revenues, has shown an increase over the years. In 2019, the total cost of revenues was RMB14,967 million (US\\$3,427 million), and by 2021, it had risen to RMB21,840 million (US\\$3,427 million). This increase can be attributed to higher service costs and other cost of revenues, such as agency fees and payment channel fees, as highlighted in the text quotes [8] and [7]. This indicates that the company is investing more in its core services and marketing activities, which is essential for maintaining and expanding its user base.\n\nSecondly, looking at the operating expenses, we see a shift in the allocation of expenses between selling and marketing, general and administrative, and total operating expenses. In 2019, selling and marketing expenses were RMB2,041 million (43.0%), general and administrative expenses were RMB2,703 million (57.0%), and the total operating expenses were RMB4,744 million (100.0%). By 2021, these figures had changed to RMB2,678 million (420%) for selling and marketing, RMB4,009 million (629%) for general and administrative, and RMB6,687 million (1,049%) for total operating expenses. The increase in total operating expenses suggests that the company is expanding its operations and increasing its investment in research and development, as mentioned in quote [3].\n\nThe rise in general and administrative expenses, particularly due to R&D costs, reflects the company's commitment to innovation and technological advancement. As noted in quote [9], these expenses include salaries and benefits for R&D personnel, which are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the market. The company continues to invest in research and development to enhance its products and technologies, which is a strategic move to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\nMoreover, the text in quote [10] highlights that other (losses)/gains, such as tax rebates, gains and losses from investments, and government grants, have also contributed to the company's financial performance. In 2019, the company recorded other gains of RMB78 million, in 2020, RMB362 million, and in 2021, RMB553 million. These gains are significant and suggest that the company is effectively managing its financial resources and taking advantage of opportunities in the market.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's cost structure and operating expenses have increased over the years, indicating a robust financial management strategy focused on expanding services, enhancing technology, and managing external and internal resources efficiently. This approach is likely aimed at sustaining growth and maintaining a competitive position in the market.\n\n![The company's increasing investment in R&D and operational expenses suggests a strong focus on innovation and expansion.](image2)"}

As shown in image2, the noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million (from $113,767 to $116,806 million), while long-term debt decreased by $2,747 million (from $54,102 to $54,355 million). This suggests that IBM has been investing more in long-term assets such as property, plant, and equipment, which can be seen as a strategic move to support its growth.\n\nThe decrease in long-term debt, as depicted in image4, also highlights a reduction in the debt used to fund Global Financing assets, aligning with the information in text quote [6], where it states that Global Financing debt decreased by $3,560 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets. This indicates that IBM has managed its debt levels more efficiently, potentially improving its financial flexibility and reducing interest expenses.\n\nConsidering the cash flow data in image3, the net cash used in financing activities of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 reflects a significant shift. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by various factors including a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments, and a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables. This suggests that IBM might have been more focused on managing its liquidity and investing in core operations rather than in financial activities.\n\nMoreover, the return on equity (ROE) for Global Financing, as illustrated in image1, slightly decreased from 25.8% in 2019 to 25.8% in 2020. This stability in ROE, despite the changes in debt and assets, indicates that the company maintained its profitability effectively. However, the decrease in total equity by $258 million, primarily due to dividends and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, suggests that IBM has been distributing profits to shareholders and facing some unfavorable currency translation adjustments.\n\nIn summary, the reduction in long-term debt and the increase in noncurrent assets suggest that IBM has been focusing on strategic investments and debt management. The shift in cash flows towards operational and investing activities indicates a focus on core business activities, while the stability in ROE and changes in equity reflect the company's balanced approach to profit distribution and financial health. \n\n![The decrease in long-term debt and increase in noncurrent assets indicate a shift in IBM's capital structure and strategic investments.](image2)\n\n![The net cash used in financing activities reflects a shift in IBM's focus towards operational and investing activities.](image3)"}

This suggests a reduction in consumer spending and a shift towards more conservative financial practices. The home equity portfolio also experienced a decrease, with outstanding balances dropping by $\\S5.9$ billion, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. \n\n![Changes in credit card and home equity metrics indicate shifts in consumer behavior](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the decline in credit card purchase volumes by $\\S26.3$ billion to $\\S251.6$ billion indicates a substantial reduction in consumer spending, particularly in sectors like travel and entertainment, which remained lower compared to 2019.

These changes suggest that consumers are being more cautious with their credit card usage and are increasingly relying on alternative forms of payment, possibly due to economic uncertainties and policy measures related to the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the reductions in credit card and home equity metrics indicate a shift towards more conservative financial behaviors among consumers, likely driven by economic conditions and policy responses to the pandemic."}

According to the provided quotes, fluctuations in the prices of these commodities directly influence BHP's revenues, EBITDA, and overall profitability.\n\nFor coal, the report highlights that the prices obtained for products are a key driver of value for BHP ([4]). Specifically, the Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by $1.3 billion to $288 million in FY2021, with lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of $0.7 billion being a primary factor ([2]). Additionally, lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by $168 million, while controllable cash costs increased by $102 million due to higher maintenance costs and increased stripping volumes ([2]). The average realized sales price for FY2021 was $16,250 per tonne, up from $13,860 per tonne in FY2020 ([10]). The cost per tonne for Queensland Coal unit costs in FY2021 was between $80 and $90, with mine plan optimisation and efficiency uplifts expected to offset increased stripping requirements ([6]).\n\nFor nickel, the underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by $296 million to $259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following the major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year, and lower contractor costs following the transition and ramp-up of new mines ([1]). The nickel price benefitted from positive investor sentiment amidst a strong, geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand ([10]). An announcement by a major nickel producer that it intends to convert some nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia, made the price suitable for use in the battery supply chain, led to a brief correction in March but subsequently rebounded supported by strong demand, multi-regional supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks ([10]).\n\n![Impact on profit after taxation from commodity price changes](image1)\n\nThe image above illustrates the impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation, showing that a $1 increase in the price of various commodities can have significant effects on BHP's financial metrics. For instance, a $1 increase in the oil price impacts profit by $24 million, while a $1 increase in the nickel price impacts profit by $1 million.\n\nIn conclusion, changes in commodity prices significantly affect BHP's financial results, particularly for coal and nickel. The key drivers behind these impacts include price fluctuations, volume changes, and cost management strategies."}

This substantial decline was mainly due to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, and increased prepayment and refinancing activities [3]. On the other hand, noninterest income experienced a notable increase, rising from $4,916 million to $10,036 million [7].\n\nThe increase in noninterest income can be attributed to several factors such as higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, gains from the sale of businesses like Corporate Trust Services, student loan portfolio, and WFAM, and lower impairment of equity securities [7]. However, it's important to note that despite these gains, there were also offsets, such as lower net interest income, lower gains on debt securities, and lower asset-based fees [7].\n\nThese changes had a considerable impact on the total revenue, which increased from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021 [image1]. The rise in total revenue is largely driven by the significant boost in noninterest income, which more than doubled from $5,357 million to $8,495 million, whereas net interest income fell sharply.\n\n![](image1)\n\nIn summary, the net interest income declined significantly from $441 million in 2020 to $(1,541) million in 2021, while noninterest income rose substantially from $4,916 million to $10,036 million.

This increase is primarily due to the rise in short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt from $1,853 million to $1,211 million, alongside an increase in other current liabilities from $2,709 million to $2,775 million. However, this is partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable from $1,945 million to $2,266 million, and accrued income taxes from $310 million to $243 million.\n\n![](image1)\n\nComparing these two trends, the total equity decreased by $1,826 million while the total liabilities increased by $287 million. This indicates that the company's net financial position became slightly more leveraged during this period, as the increase in liabilities was less than the decrease in equity.\n\nIn summary, 3M Company's total equity decreased from $11,622 million to $9,796 million, while total liabilities increased from $26,365 million to $26,652 million, from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018."}

Additionally, the unfavorable impact of the deconsolidation of RBH, as stated in quote [7], further contributed to the decline in cigarette volumes. However, the significant increase in heated tobacco units suggests a growing acceptance and adoption of these products as alternatives to traditional cigarettes.\n\n![Changes in cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume in East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada](image2)\n\nOverall, the shift towards heated tobacco units in both regions reflects changing consumer preferences towards less harmful smoking alternatives, but the magnitude and reasons behind the changes differ significantly between East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada."}

For instance, there was a significant increase in operating income from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021. Additionally, depreciation and amortization remained relatively stable at $13,804 million in 2021 compared to $13,100 million in 2020, indicating consistent capital expenditure levels. Noncash share-based compensation also saw a slight increase from $1,193 million in 2020 to $1,315 million in 2021.\n\nHowever, the most notable factor contributing to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was the change in operating assets and liabilities, which moved from a decrease of $178 million in 2020 to an increase of $1,499 million in 2021. This change suggests that the company managed its working capital more effectively in 2021, leading to a positive impact on cash flow.\n\nIn summary, the net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to improved operating income and better management of working capital."}

This substantial improvement is primarily attributed to several factors, including higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from a 50 percent-owned CPChem, and increased sales volumes. However, it's important to note that there was also an increase in operating expenses, which partially offset some of these gains.\n\n![](image5) As shown in the table, the earnings of the U.S. downstream segment in 2021 were $525 million, a considerable increase from $618 million in 2020. The favorable swing in foreign currency effects also contributed positively, adding $185 million to the earnings in 2021.\n\nIn more detail, the increase in earnings can be broken down as follows:\n- Higher margins on refined product sales contributed an additional $1.6 billion.\n- Higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem added another $1 billion.\n- Increased sales volumes brought in an extra $470 million.\n- Despite higher operating expenses of $150 million, the overall impact was still positive, leading to a net increase in earnings.\n\nTo summarize, the U.S. downstream segment's earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021, driven by higher margins, increased sales volumes, and earnings from a 50 percent-owned affiliate, all while managing to control operating expenses effectively."}

In 2020, the company reported a net income of $(5,561) million, while in 2021, it reported a net income of $15,689 million, indicating a substantial increase of $21,250 million. Similarly, the comprehensive income changed from $(6,183) million in 2020 to $17,412 million in 2021, a difference of $23,595 million. This improvement can be attributed to several financial activities and adjustments made throughout the year.\n\nFirst, the **net income** increased primarily due to higher realizations, higher margins, and the absence of certain impairments and write-offs. As shown in Text Quote [9], U.S. upstream reported earnings increased from a loss of $(1.6) billion in 2020 to earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, reflecting a $8.9 billion increase. The international upstream earnings also improved from a loss of $(825) million in 2020 to earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, a $9.325 billion increase (Text Quote [6]). These improvements were partially offset by higher tax charges and operating expenses, but the overall effect was a significant net income increase.\n\nSecond, the **comprehensive income** saw a much larger increase compared to net income, primarily due to the reversal of unrealized losses and gains on financial instruments. The net change in comprehensive income from 2020 to 2021 was $23,595 million, as shown in Image Quote [4]. The majority of this increase can be attributed to the reversal of unrealized net changes arising during the period and the net gain on securities, as highlighted in Image Quote [4].\n\nMoreover, the **operating activities** provided a significant amount of cash, as seen in Image Quote [2]. The net cash provided by operating activities increased from $10,577 million in 2020 to $29,187 million in 2021, indicating strong operational performance. This positive cash flow contributed to the overall financial health of the company.\n\nAdditionally, the **cash flows from investing activities** showed a reduction in capital expenditures, which also contributed positively to the cash position. The capital expenditures decreased from $(8,922) million in 2020 to $(8,056) million in 2021, reducing the outflow of cash and allowing the company to manage its investments more efficiently.\n\nLastly, the **financing activities** involved net borrowings and repayments of long-term debt, which impacted the cash position. However, the overall effect was a net decrease in cash provided by financing activities, contributing to the overall positive cash flow.\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher realizations, higher margins, and the absence of certain impairments and write-offs. The comprehensive income saw a much larger increase, driven by the reversal of unrealized losses and gains on financial instruments. These changes were supported by strong operating activities, efficient management of capital expenditures, and effective financing strategies. \n\n![Summary of financial activities contributing to changes in net income and comprehensive income](image2)"}

These changes are illustrated in the image below:\n\n![Summary of Cash Flow Changes](image4)\n\nLet's break down each section:\n\n### Operating Activities\nFrom the text quote [5], we learn that the net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3,426 million in 2020, driven by several factors. These include an increase in cash provided by receivables due to sales of receivables, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals, and performance-related declines within net income. This increase in cash from operating activities is crucial for maintaining liquidity and supporting ongoing operations.\n\n### Investing Activities\nAccording to quote [2], net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million. This significant decrease can be attributed to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions ($32,294 million) due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year, a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($6,245 million), and an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($896 million). The substantial drop in cash used for acquisitions indicates a shift in strategic focus towards more organic growth rather than large-scale acquisitions.\n\n### Financing Activities\nAs mentioned in the text quote [1], financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. This represents a net use of $18,763 million, indicating a significant outflow of cash. The primary driver of this change was the early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, which outweighed the $8,982 million in debt issuances. This suggests that IBM is actively managing its debt levels, possibly to improve its financial flexibility and reduce interest expenses.\n\n### Impact on Overall Cash Flow\nThe overall cash flow impact can be summarized as follows:\n- **Operating Activities**: An increase of $3,426 million provided a positive inflow, enhancing cash reserves.\n- **Investing Activities**: A decrease of $23,908 million reduced the cash outflow, indicating a shift in investment strategy.\n- **Financing Activities**: A net use of $18,763 million significantly impacted cash flow, reflecting active debt management.\n\nThese changes collectively resulted in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $5,361 million, as shown in the image above. This improvement in cash flow is vital for IBM's financial health, enabling it to continue investing in strategic areas while maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net cash provided by operating, investing, and financing activities in 2020 positively impacted IBM's overall cash flow, contributing to its financial stability and operational efficiency."}

This growth can be attributed to various factors, including increases in revenues and effective cost management strategies.\n\n![](image1) The table above illustrates the cash flows from operating activities, showing an increase in net change in other operating items such as medical costs payable and accounts receivable. This indicates that the company's medical costs and receivables management had a substantial impact on its cash flow dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income, also saw a notable rise from $10,469 million in 2018 to $68,328 million in 2020 (see image5). This increase was largely driven by the significant growth in net earnings and a reduction in unrealized losses on investment securities.\n\n![](image3) The detailed breakdown of comprehensive income reveals that the net unrealized gains on investment securities decreased from $805 million in 2018 to $1,336 million in 2020, contributing to the overall increase in comprehensive income. However, it's important to note that there were also decreases in other comprehensive income, such as foreign currency translation losses, which slightly offset the gains.\n\n![](image2) Furthermore, the revenues from different segments, particularly from premium revenues, also contributed significantly to the growth. The premium revenues increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020 (see image2), indicating strong demand and performance in the health insurance market.\n\nIn conclusion, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income improved substantially from 2018 to 2020, driven by increased revenues, effective cost management, and favorable market conditions."}

Let's break down these changes and analyze their implications.\n\nIn terms of noncurrent assets, we observe an increase of $3,039 million (or $829 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020 [10]. This increase could indicate the company is investing more in long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, or other strategic investments that are expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\nFor long-term debt, the total company debt decreased from $62,899 million to $61,538 million, a reduction of $1,361 million (or $2,859 million adjusted for currency) [2]. This decrease in debt suggests that IBM is effectively managing its capital structure and potentially reducing financial risk by paying off some of its long-term obligations. However, it's important to note that this figure includes both Global Financing debt and non-Global Financing debt.\n\nRegarding noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt), there was an increase of $1,621 million ($251 million adjusted for currency) [6]. This increase might reflect additional accrued expenses or other non-debt liabilities that the company has incurred, possibly due to ongoing operational activities or contractual obligations.\n\n![Implications of asset and liability changes](image2)\n\nThese changes suggest that IBM is strategically focusing on optimizing its balance sheet by reducing long-term debt while simultaneously increasing noncurrent assets. This financial strategy may indicate a commitment to long-term growth and investment, while also maintaining a healthy liquidity position through reduced debt levels.\n\nTo summarize, the changes in noncurrent assets, long-term debt, and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) between 2019 and 2020 reflect a balanced approach where IBM is investing in long-term assets and reducing its debt burden, aligning with its goal of maintaining a strong financial position and supporting its business strategies."}

By 2020, the provision for income taxes had further increased to $4,973 million, marking a substantial rise to a 24.0% effective tax rate.\n\nThe table also shows that the increase in the provision for income taxes is partly attributed to the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which was a one-time levy due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). For instance, in 2020, the Health Insurance Industry Tax amounted to $626 million, contributing significantly to the overall provision for income taxes. This tax was permanent but was repealed by Congress in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the table indicates that other factors such as state income taxes, share-based awards, and foreign tax differentials also contributed to the changes in the provision for income taxes.

According to [7], after becoming carbon-neutral in 2019, the bank committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions across its operations, financing activities, and supply chain by 2050. This commitment is reflected in their climate risk management practices, which are overseen by the Climate Risk Steering Council, a body that meets monthly to ensure the bank remains on track towards its goals.\n\n![GHG Emissions Breakdown](image3) highlights Bank of America's detailed GHG emissions breakdown for 2019. The bank reduced its location-based emissions by 56% since 2010, with a significant portion of its emissions coming from Scope 3 categories, such as purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy-related activities, and downstream transportation and distribution. Bank of America has also fully implemented the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and committed to setting science-based targets in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe impact of these emissions is quantified through the societal cost of carbon. In 2019, the societal impact of Bank of America’s Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based), and Scope 3 (Categories 1-7, 9, 11-12) emissions was estimated to be $238 million, calculated using the EPA's 2020 social cost of carbon of $42/metric ton CO2 (3% discount rate, reported in 2007 USD). This figure underscores the importance of reducing emissions not only for environmental reasons but also for their socio-economic implications.\n\nRegarding air pollution, Bank of America’s 2019 air pollution emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), particulate matter, and other significant air emissions, were reported in metric tons. While these emissions are not specifically from urban/densely populated areas, they still pose a significant environmental and societal impact. The valued impact of Bank of America’s air pollution in 2019 was estimated to be $146,000, calculated using the social cost factors of each pollutant as reported in the World Resources Institute’s Transport Emissions & Social Cost Assessment (TESCA) Tool v1.0.\n\nIn conclusion, Bank of America is actively addressing environmental issues by setting ambitious targets, implementing TCFD recommendations, and continuously monitoring and reporting on their emissions. Their efforts not only aim to mitigate the environmental impact but also to minimize the associated social and economic costs."}

Specifically, the Underlying EBITDA increased from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021 [4,5]. This substantial increase is largely attributed to changes in sales prices and volumes.\n\n![Changes in sales prices and volumes](image4)\n\n### Sales Prices\nThe text indicates that the change in sales prices for FY2021 was a significant factor contributing to the increase in Underlying EBITDA. The increase in average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal contributed positively to the revenue and EBITDA, while the decrease in average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG had a negative impact [4].\n\n### Volumes\nRecord volumes were achieved at WAIO (Western Australia Iron Ore), with strong performance across the supply chain. This was offset by natural field decline in Petroleum and adverse weather events. Additionally, the expected lower grades at Escondida and Spence were somewhat offset by the new stream of concentrate production from the Spence Growth Option and the highest annual copper production achieved at Olympic Dam since the acquisition in 2005 [4].\n\n### Net Price Impact\nThe net price impact showed a positive contribution of $16,965 million from higher average realized prices, partially offset by a negative impact of $870 million from increased price-linked costs [5].\n\n### Volume Impact\nThe volume impact was mixed. On one hand, record volumes at WAIO with strong performance across the supply chain were offset by natural field decline at Petroleum and adverse weather impacts in the Gulf of Mexico (Petroleum) and NSWEC [5].\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the combination of higher sales prices and record volumes contributed to the significant increase in Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021. However, these positive effects were partially offset by lower average realized prices for certain products and adverse weather events. The detailed breakdown of these factors is illustrated in the charts and tables provided in the images.\n\nThe Underlying EBITDA for Iron Ore increased significantly from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021, driven by higher sales prices and record volumes, despite some offsets from lower average realized prices for certain products and adverse weather events."}

For example, the project \"COVID Relief Preventive and Curative Healthcare\" in Maharashtra, Mumbai, had a spending of 0.05% of the total amount, indicating a small but targeted allocation. Another example, \"COVID Relief Preventive and Curative Healthcare\" in Gujarat, Ahmedabad, spent 0.99%, showing a slightly larger allocation for similar purposes.\n\nOn the other hand, Rural Development projects often involve larger sums of money and longer durations, aimed at sustainable development and empowerment.

As shown in image1, the gross margin percentages were 10.04%, 9.65%, and 8.88% for 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. This indicates a consistent downward trend over the three-year period.\n\n[1] provides insight into the contributing factors to this decline. The gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. This decrease was primarily driven by a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly due to decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, as mentioned in [5]. Additionally, the LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs further impacted the gross margin, as did the increase in $2\\%$ rewards, which reduced the gross margin by one basis point.\n\nThe image2 provides a more granular breakdown of the different segments' gross margin percentages. In 2022, the gross margin percentages for the U.S. segment, Other International segment, and overall company were 9.26%, 11.13%, and 10.48%, respectively. This reflects the impact of various factors such as the LIFO charge and changes in rewards programs, as highlighted in the text quotes.\n\nFurthermore, [3] discusses the company's approach to managing costs and maintaining competitive pricing. The company's investments in merchandise pricing, which can involve reducing prices to drive sales or holding prices steady despite cost increases, are known to negatively impact gross margin and gross margin percentage. These strategies are implemented in response to cost increases and changes in the market, as seen in the significant inflationary pressures mentioned in [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the gross margin percentage declined from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, LIFO charges, and increases in rewards programs. These factors collectively contributed to the overall reduction in gross margin percentage observed in the data."}

Costco outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Retail Index during this period, with its stock price appreciating more significantly than either benchmark. This indicates that investors who invested in Costco during this time would have experienced higher returns compared to those who invested in the broader market or the retail sector.\n\n![Distribution of Costco's warehouses across different regions](image2)\n\nAs shown in the image, Costco has a significant presence in the United States and Puerto Rico, where it operates 564 warehouses, followed by Canada with 105 warehouses.

Additionally, there was a decrease in valuation allowances, indicating a reduction in the need for these allowances.\n\nFor deferred tax liabilities, the figures are as follows:\n\n|Year| Deferred Tax Liabilities|\n|---|---|\n|2022| $9,288|\n|2021| $8,503|\n\nThe increase in deferred tax liabilities from 2021 to 2022 is primarily driven by the rise in goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, and other retiree benefits. The foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated also contributed to this increase.\n\nThe changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities have a significant impact on the company's financial position. The increase in deferred tax liabilities indicates that the company has more future tax obligations, which could lead to higher future tax expenses. On the other hand, the decrease in deferred tax assets suggests that the company has fewer future tax benefits, potentially leading to higher future tax expenses as well.\n\nThis dynamic between deferred tax assets and liabilities can influence the company's effective tax rate and overall profitability. An increase in deferred tax liabilities without a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets can lead to a higher effective tax rate, impacting the company's net earnings. Conversely, if the company has more deferred tax assets, it can offset some of the future tax liabilities, potentially lowering the effective tax rate.\n\n![](image1) This table shows the net earnings and shares outstanding, providing context for the financial health of the company. The decrease in net earnings from 2021 to 2022, while not directly linked to the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, still reflects the overall financial performance of the company.\n\n![](image2) The table also shows the carrying amounts and accumulated amortizations of intangible assets, which are key drivers of deferred tax liabilities. The increase in goodwill and intangible assets, along with other factors like fixed assets and other retiree benefits, contribute to the growth in deferred tax liabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between 2021 and 2022 reflect an increase in future tax obligations and a reduction in future tax benefits. These changes can significantly impact the company's effective tax rate and overall financial position, necessitating careful management and forecasting of these tax positions."}

The emergence of European Venture Funds in the 1990s, following a period of market instability, marked a new phase where these funds became more selective and efficient.

The image `![Scarcity drives efficiency](image4)` illustrates this dynamic, showing how the scarcity of funds forces a more cautious and efficient approach.\n\n![Scarcity drives efficiency](image4)\n\nThis shift can be attributed to the fact that fewer investors were willing to commit to venture capital due to past disappointments and a lingering lack of confidence. As a result, the European venture capital market became a \"cottage industry\" characterized by a smaller number of private investors, primarily banks, corporations, and insurance companies, rather than traditional sources like pension and endowment funds.

This dramatic increase suggests a growing reliance on data services among mobile users, particularly with the rise of smartphones and data-based applications such as instant messaging and VoIP.\n\n![The subscriber numbers and data users for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat grew significantly from 2013 to late 2014, indicating strong performance and market share expansion](image4)\n\nAdditionally, it is noteworthy that Telkomsel, as a major player, managed to reduce tariffs due to competition from CDMA operators, as mentioned in quote [7]. This strategy likely contributed to the growth in subscriber base and data users. Furthermore, the increasing preference for data-based communication methods, as highlighted in quote [8], suggests that these operators are well-positioned to capitalize on the changing consumption patterns of mobile users.\n\nIn conclusion, the subscriber numbers and data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat increased significantly from 2013 to late 2014, indicating strong performance and market leadership in the Indonesian telecommunications sector."}

Specifically, half of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced at least one form of gender-related discrimination in the workplace, which is notably higher than the 41% of women in non-STEM jobs and just 19% of men in STEM jobs [5, 3, 8]. This discrepancy is further illustrated by the fact that the most common forms of discrimination faced by women in STEM jobs include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they are not competent (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders (18%) [6].\n\n![](image1) This image clearly shows that women in computer jobs, who are part of the STEM workforce, experience more gender-related discrimination at work (74%) compared to men in the same field (16%). Additionally, the same image highlights that women in majority-male workplaces are significantly more likely to report experiencing gender discrimination (78%) compared to women in majority-female or evenly mixed workplaces (43%) [7].\n\nMoreover, the image [image3] provides a comparative view, showing that among women in STEM jobs, 50% have experienced gender discrimination, which is notably higher than the 19% of men in these jobs. This disparity is consistent across various forms of discrimination, including lower pay, feeling incompetent, and lacking support from senior leaders.\n\nThe data also indicates that women in computer jobs, those working in majority-male environments, and those with postgraduate degrees are particularly likely to have concerns about gender equity and to have experienced gender discrimination [10]. Furthermore, while women in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiences with and concerns about gender inequities, this issue echoes broader challenges faced by all working women, such as equal treatment in promotions and sexual harassment [9].\n\nIn summary, gender discrimination is a significant issue for women in STEM jobs, affecting nearly half of them, and is more prevalent than among men in the same roles or women in non-STEM fields.

Germanwings focused its efforts primarily on Twitter, posting in both English and German, which led to a substantial increase in followers for both Germanwings and Lufthansa (see image2). By the end of the first 60 minutes, #Germanwings had become the top trending topic on Twitter, and over 60,000 tweets referenced it (see image3).\n\nThe data also indicates that within six hours of the incident, the number of tweets referencing #Germanwings had reached nearly 500,000 globally (see image4). This surge in mentions highlights the rapid spread of information and the critical role social platforms play as backups to a company's corporate site.\n\nTo summarize, the trend in the number of followers for Germanwings, Airbus, and Lufthansa on Twitter following the crash showed a significant spike, with Germanwings and Lufthansa experiencing notable increases in their follower counts due to their active social media engagement during this critical period."}

For instance, as shown in `![Second generation vs. Third or higher generation](image1)`, the second generation is more likely to identify as Hispanic compared to the third or higher generation, where the identification starts to fade away. This is further supported by the fact that non-Hispanic heritage becomes more common among higher generations of those with Hispanic ancestry [3].\n\nAdditionally, `![Speak Spanish](image4)` and `![Have a Spanish last name](image5)` indicate that speaking Spanish and having a Spanish last name are less common among the third or higher generation of self-identified Hispanics. Only 20% of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics have a Spanish last name, compared to 70% of the foreign-born group. Similarly, while 70% of the foreign-born speak Spanish, this percentage drops to 15% among the third or higher generation.\n\nThis trend is consistent with the findings presented in quote [4], which states that connections with ancestral national origins decline as immigrant roots become more distant. By the third generation, only 44% of self-identified Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their family's country of origin, compared to 82% of immigrants and 69% of second-generation Hispanics.\n\nMoreover, the data from quote [6] highlights that the proportion of married Hispanics with a Hispanic spouse decreases significantly across generations.

As indicated in text quote [4], the decline in the belief that the U.S. is the world's leading economy has coincided with a growing perception that China is becoming more economically dominant. This shift reflects a complex interplay of economic realities and political perceptions, with Democrats becoming less confident in the U.S.'s economic standing.\n\nIn summary, the perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power among Democrats has significantly decreased from 66% in 2008 to 54% in 2020, while Republicans' views have remained more stable."}

In 1870, the population stood at just 130, but by 1880, it had skyrocketed to 8,267, reaching its highest point of 14,096 in 1890. This rapid growth can be attributed to several historical factors, including the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad Act, which were passed in the mid-1800s. These acts transformed the Nebraska landscape, encouraging westward expansion and agricultural development, as noted in quote [9].\n\nHowever, the population began to decline after peaking in 1890. By 1940, the population had dropped to 9,982, and it continued to decrease over the following decades. The steady population increase seen in Aurora, as mentioned in quote [2], contrasts with the general trend in other rural communities within Hamilton County. The reasons for this decline include the consolidation of farms, which reduced the need for a large labor force, and the shift towards more mechanized agriculture, as discussed in quote [4]. Additionally, the consolidation of rural schools and the closure of many rural schoolhouses, as indicated in quote [6], reflect the broader demographic shifts affecting smaller communities.\n\n![Hamilton County Population Trends](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000 were significantly influenced by the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad Act, which spurred initial population growth, followed by a gradual decline due to agricultural consolidation and mechanization."}

In the US, market publication requirements of endowments oblige most GPs to publish financial performance, whereas in Europe, such requirements do not exist. This results in many top-performing European funds not being published in the Thomson Venture database, leading to a skewed perception of European VC fund performance ([6] [4]). \n\nMoreover, a significant portion of European venture funds have disappeared since the burst of the bubble, leaving only 10% of the remaining funds considered active. This results in a long non-contributing tail of European VC funds listed in the Thomson database, further complicating the assessment of performance ([4]). The scarcity of VC money in Europe has also driven up capital efficiency and yield because fewer investors can afford to be more selective ([5]).\n\nIn terms of specific numbers, Germany, for instance, has only 4 independent VC funds of investment-grade size compared to over 227 in the US ([9]). This scarcity is partly responsible for the higher share of European VC funds with top US quartile performance, indicating that some European funds perform exceptionally well despite the challenges they face ([10]).\n\n![](image1)\n\nThe chart above highlights the aging distribution of European VC funds, showing that a significant percentage of funds are no longer contributing, which skews the overall performance metrics.

In 2017, 45% of Americans believed that their European allies should increase their defense spending, which dropped to 35% by 2019 (see image5). This indicates a decreasing belief that allies should increase their spending. Additionally, the majority of Americans (50%) favored keeping the same level of spending in 2019, reflecting a more stable stance compared to the earlier years (see image5).\n\nFor Germans, the situation is different. According to image1, there is a divide on whether Germany should increase, keep the same, or decrease its defense spending. In 2019, 35% of Germans favored increasing spending, 50% preferred keeping the same, and 15% wanted a decrease. This suggests that the majority of Germans are content with the current level of defense spending (see image1).\n\nIn terms of the importance of defense spending, the opinions of Americans and Germans diverge. As seen in image3, a significant portion of Americans (62%) considered it \"not important,\" whereas only 33% thought it was \"very important.\" For Germans, the distribution was slightly more balanced, with 45% considering it \"not important\" and 52% finding it \"somewhat important\" (see image3).\n\nMoreover, the partisan divide in the U.S. is evident. Image2 illustrates that Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals are more inclined to support increased defense spending in Europe, although this preference has declined over the years. In 2017, 59% of Republicans favored increased spending, but this dropped to 48% by 2019. Democrats, on the other hand, showed a more modest decline, with 27% supporting increased spending in 2019 compared to 34% in 2017 (see image2).\n\nTo summarize, the opinions of Americans and Germans on national defense spending have evolved differently over the years. While Americans have become less supportive of increased spending by European allies, Germans appear more content with the current levels of spending. The partisan divide in the U.S. also plays a significant role in shaping these views.\n\n![The majority of Germans are content with the current level of defense spending](image1)\n![Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals are more inclined to support increased defense spending in Europe](image2)"}

As shown in the graph in image1, while 55% of all adults own a smartphone, the adoption rate drops to just 18% among adults aged 65 and older. This indicates a substantial gap in smartphone ownership between these two groups.\n\nAdditionally, the graph in image3 illustrates that a higher percentage of all adults aged 65+ own a cell phone (77%) compared to the national average (91%), though still a significant portion of seniors do not own any form of mobile device. This suggests that while cell phones are more widely adopted among older adults than smartphones, there is still a considerable number of seniors who rely on basic cell phones rather than smartphones.\n\nThe image2 further highlights the digital divide by showing that internet usage is much lower among older adults compared to other age groups. Only 37% of those 80 and older use the internet, while 94% of adults under 65 do. Similarly, broadband access at home is also lower among older adults, with only 47% having such access, compared to 80% of all adults.\n\nMoreover, the graph in image5 demonstrates that smartphone adoption among older adults peaks at around 50% in the 75-79 age group and then sharply declines to just 5% among those 80 and older. This pattern is consistent with the findings presented in text quote [2], which notes that smartphone ownership is fairly low across the older adult population but decreases substantially for those in their mid-70s and nearly disappears among those 80 and older.\n\nIn summary, the technology adoption rates among adults aged 65 and older are significantly lower compared to all adults, especially in terms of smartphone and broadband access.

The goal is to determine how this number might change under various proposed improvements.\n\nThe image `image5` provides a clear overview of the different scenarios and their impact on the peak hour train car requirement:\n\n- **Today**: With the current configuration, the peak hour train car requirement is 5 cars per train and 5 trains per hour, totaling 25 train cars [10].\n- **Metrolink Used Cars**: Using Metrolink's cars, which have 6 cars per train, the peak hour train car requirement increases to 30 train cars.\n- **Electrification**: With electrification, the number of cars per train increases to 6, resulting in a peak hour train car requirement of 36 train cars.\n- **Longer Platforms**: By implementing longer platforms, the number of cars per train can be increased to 8, leading to a peak hour train car requirement of 48 train cars.\n- **Increase Frequency with HSR**: Finally, if the frequency is increased to 8 cars per train and 8 trains per hour, the peak hour train car requirement reaches 64 train cars.\n\nThese figures illustrate that as Caltrain improves its service, whether through better infrastructure, more frequent service, or larger train cars, the number of required train cars during peak hours significantly increases. For instance, increasing from today's configuration to the scenario with longer platforms doubles the peak hour train car requirement from 25 to 48 [5].\n\n![How peak hour train car requirement changes with different scenarios](image5)\n\nThus, to keep up with the growing demand, Caltrain must consider these various improvements and their impacts on the peak hour train car requirement."}

Roughly 53% of Germans name China as the leading economic power, whereas only 24% name the United States in this capacity. This suggests a greater acknowledgment of China's economic dominance and a lower level of confidence in the U.S.'s global economic position among the German population.\n\n![](image1) This graph further illustrates the disparity, showing that the percentage of people in the U.S. who consider the U.S. the leading economic power is higher by 6 percentage points compared to Germany, where the U.S. is seen as the leading economic power by only 24%.\n\nThis divergence in views can be attributed to various factors, including differing economic conditions, geopolitical relationships, and media portrayals. The perception of the U.S. as the leading economic power in its own country might stem from its historical economic dominance and continued influence in global markets, while the German perspective reflects a growing recognition of China's rapid economic growth and increasing global market share.\n\nIn summary, Americans are more likely to view the U.S. as the world's leading economic power, while Germans are more inclined to see China in that role."}

In contrast, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to support a larger government and view regulation as necessary to protect the public interest.\n\nThis difference highlights how political leanings influence perceptions on the role of government. For instance, among those who lean Republican, only 24% prefer a bigger government, whereas 60% of those who lean Democratic and 42% of all independents prefer a bigger government. Similarly, regarding the necessity of government regulation, while 42% of Republican-leaning independents and 24% of all independents believe it does more harm, 58% of Democratic-leaning independents and 60% of Democrats think it is necessary to protect the public interest.\n\nIn summary, Republican-leaning independents and those who identify as Republicans are more inclined to believe that government regulation does more harm than good and prefer a smaller government, whereas Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents tend to favor a larger government and believe that regulation is essential to protect the public interest."}

The efficiency is particularly highlighted when comparing electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\n\nIn the image `image4`, we see a breakdown of energy usage from \"Well-to-Tank\" (the energy used to extract, process, and deliver the fuel to the vehicle) and \"Tank-to-Wheels\" (the energy used to power the vehicle). For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), which are a type of electric vehicle, the efficiency is around 13%, whereas for conventional ICE vehicles, the efficiency is higher at about 25%. This indicates that while FCVs have a lower efficiency from source to wheel, they still offer significant improvements over conventional ICE vehicles in terms of energy efficiency.\n\nMoreover, the image `image5` illustrates the current technological landscape, showing that hydrogen technology and hybrid/electric vehicle (EV) technologies are gaining traction but conventional vehicle technology remains dominant. However, there is a push towards improving conventional vehicle technology to match the performance of EVs and FCVs.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall energy efficiency from source to wheel for electric vehicles, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, is generally lower than that of internal combustion engine vehicles, but they still represent a step forward in reducing overall energy consumption and environmental impact. ![The overall energy efficiency from source to wheel for electric vehicles compared to internal combustion engine vehicles](image4)"}

The data also shows that among self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, only 9% reported being taken to Latino cultural celebrations often, while 60% said it never happened [8].\n\nThis decline in participation in Hispanic cultural celebrations across generations suggests that the connection to Hispanic heritage may weaken over time, as reflected in the decreasing frequency of these experiences. Furthermore, the conversations and cultural cues provided by parents during these events can significantly influence a child's identity, but as these interactions become less frequent, the impact on later generations diminishes [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the frequency of attending Hispanic cultural celebrations in childhood decreases from the foreign-born generation to the second generation and further down to the third or higher generation. This trend highlights the potential fading of Hispanic identity across subsequent generations due to reduced exposure to cultural traditions."}

For instance, women with a high school diploma or less are more likely to be in non-STEM jobs (55%), while those with a professional or doctoral degree are less represented in STEM jobs (42%). This pattern suggests that higher education levels are associated with greater representation of women in STEM jobs [9].\n\nMoreover, the data from image3 indicates that the representation of women in STEM jobs peaks at the bachelor's degree level and then declines with higher education. This could be due to various factors such as the concentration of men in certain STEM fields and the challenges women face in advancing within these fields.\n\nIn summary, women's representation in STEM jobs is higher among those with associate and bachelor's degrees, but decreases as educational attainment increases. This pattern highlights the need for continued efforts to support women in STEM education and careers, especially at the higher education levels."}

This rapid growth can be attributed to the influx of settlers and the expansion of overland travel facilitated by the railroads, as mentioned in [1].\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak, the population began to decline, dropping to 9,403 in 2000, a decrease of about 33% from the 1890 peak (image3). This decline is partly due to the consolidation of farms, which led to fewer jobs in rural areas, as noted in [6], where it states that the number of farms in Hamilton County declined from over 2,000 in 1900 to 603 by 2002.\n\nMoreover, the population trends in specific towns within Hamilton County also reflect these broader changes. For instance, Aurora, which peaked in population at 4,225 in 2000, has shown steady gains since 1940 (as per data in Table 3), contrasting with the overall trend of small-town population decline (see [4]).

This suggests that the inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance is relatively consistent, but also highlights the challenge in distinguishing Chameleon's performance from other models due to the lack of clear consensus among annotators in a significant portion of the evaluations.\n\nIn summary, the annotator agreement levels for Chameleon against other models show a mix of clear preferences and ties, indicating moderate inter-annotator reliability."}

For both MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets, the performance generally improves as the number of demonstration samples increases from 1 to 5, indicating a clear benefit from additional context. However, beyond 5 samples, the improvement becomes less pronounced, suggesting diminishing returns. Notably, the inclusion of logical constraints provides a consistent and significant boost in performance across all sample sizes, especially when the number of samples is small (as seen in the comparison between rows labeled \"w. all logical constraints\" and \"w. retrieved logical constraints\"). This is evident in the consistent and substantial improvements in Micro-F1 scores for models like LLaMA2-13B, Vicuna-13B, and GPT-4, even when only a few demonstrations are provided.\n\nFor instance, LLaMA2-13B shows a marked improvement from 15.3% to 20.2% in Micro-F1 when moving from 1 to 5 demonstration samples, and this improvement is further enhanced to 29.3% when logical constraints are added. Similarly, for Vicuna-13B, the performance jumps from 10.0% to 13.8% with logical constraints, and then slightly decreases to 13.0% with 20 demonstration samples, illustrating the importance of logical constraints in maintaining performance even with a larger number of samples.\n\nOverall, these findings highlight that while more demonstrations can help, logical constraints are crucial for optimizing performance, especially in scenarios where the number of demonstrations is limited.\n\nThe number of demonstration samples has a significant positive impact on Micro-F1 performance, particularly when combined with logical constraints."}

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, which are then used to retrieve the top-$k$ most similar results to the input image. This process is illustrated in the figure showing the database, feature embeddings, and feature index, which together facilitate efficient retrieval.\n\nUpon receiving an input image at the inference stage, as described in text [4], the RAR pipeline retrieves the top-$k$ class names most similar to the image.

This ranking mechanism is further exemplified in image4, where the categories are sorted from high to low similarity to the input image.\n\nTo enhance the retrieval process, the RAR pipeline employs an index system based on the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, as explained in text [7]. This index construction technique significantly reduces the dimensionality of the vector space, leading to faster and more accurate retrieval, as shown in the efficiency improvements mentioned in text [7].\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline leverages a multimodal retriever for efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information, integrates this information with the MLLMs for ranking and prediction, and utilizes indexing techniques to boost performance.

This indicates that the SL + IL 1000 + RL model benefits significantly from the initial phase of imitation learning, which adapts the model to the dialogue state distribution, and then further refines its performance through RL optimization.\n\nFrom the graph, it's evident that both the SL + RL and SL + IL 1000 + RL models exhibit improvements in task success rate, but the latter shows a more pronounced increase in success rate after the imitation learning phase. This suggests that the SL + IL 1000 + RL model is better at handling more challenging tasks, which often require more dialogue turns, as indicated by the slightly higher task success rates compared to the SL + RL model. \n\nIn summary, the SL + IL 1000 + RL model outperforms the SL + RL model in terms of task success rate over time, primarily due to the effective adaptation phase provided by the imitation learning component."}

According to the precision/recall curves depicted in image4, the SciIE model with coreference linking shows a significantly higher recall, indicating that coreference propagation enhances the model's ability to capture and link related entities within the text, thus improving the overall quality of the constructed knowledge graph (quoted from text [1]).\n\nFurthermore, the results in image2 highlight that the SciIE model, when incorporating coreference, achieves higher F1 scores in relation extraction and coreference resolution tasks. The table in image2 shows that the SciIE model with coreference (67.5 for relation extraction and 68.1 for entity recognition) outperforms the single-task model (65.7 for entity recognition and 58.0 for relation extraction) and other variations that do not include coreference.\n\nIn summary, the SciIE model performs better than other models in precision, recall, and F1 score across different tasks, and coreference handling significantly boosts its performance, particularly in relation extraction and coreference resolution."}

It allows for a flexible and active control of retrieval and generation, ensuring that the system can adapt to the evolving needs of the user as the problem is addressed step by step. The iterative nature ensures that the system can refine its queries and generate more precise answers with each iteration. As shown in the diagram, iterative retrieval focuses on \"Retrieve On Demand,\" \"Query Transformation / Decomposition,\" and \"Generate Special Token / Threshold.\"\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**: This technique is characterized by a structured index and hierarchical manner of processing and retrieving data. It starts by summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF and then performs a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process. The diagram illustrates how recursive retrieval can be seen as a form of \"Iterative Retrieval\" with a structured index and hierarchical refinement.\n\n**Adaptive Retrieval**: Adaptive retrieval methods, such as Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25], enable LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval. This means that the system can dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, optimizing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced. Adaptive retrieval is particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user's needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The diagram of the Modular RAG framework (image3) shows how adaptive retrieval can be integrated with other modules to enhance the system's overall performance.\n\nIn summary, while Iterative retrieval focuses on step-by-step problem-solving and flexible control, Recursive retrieval emphasizes structured indexing and hierarchical refinement, and Adaptive retrieval enables dynamic and context-aware decision-making for retrieval. These differences contribute to the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in handling various types of information retrieval and generation tasks."}

This is exemplified in Figure 1 and Figure 2, where the KGLM generates tokens and incorporates them into a local knowledge graph.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the initial stages of the process where the KGLM uses \"Super Mario Land\" to generate the first three tokens, adding it and its relations to the local knowledge graph. Subsequently, the model selects \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity, \"Publication Date\" as the relation to render, and copies a token from the date entity (\"1989\") to the graph. The model also considers multiple plausible reasons for mentioning \"Game Boy,\" such as it being the platform for \"Super Mario Land\" and being manufactured by \"Nintendo.\"\n\nFigure 2 provides a detailed view of this process, showing how the model dynamically decides which facts to incorporate from the knowledge graph. It highlights that amongst the three mention types \\(t_t\\), the model chooses a reference to an existing entity, which requires selecting a fact to render. In this case, the parent entity is \"Super Mario Land,\" and the relation chosen is \"Publisher,\" leading to the selection of \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render. The model's vocabulary expands to include not just standard vocabulary but also all word types in the aliases of the selected entity, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the generated text.\n\nThe annotations in the example, as shown in Figure 2, break down the process into specific variables: mention type (\\(t_t\\)), entity mentioned (\\(e_t\\)), relation (\\(r_t\\)), and parent entity (\\(p_t\\)). These annotations indicate whether the entities are new or related based on their reachability from entities already linked in the graph. For instance, \"side-scrolling game\" and \"platform video game\" are marked as related but incorrectly linked due to missing links in Wikidata.\n\nThis representation ensures that the KGLM can effectively integrate factual knowledge from the knowledge graph into the generated text, addressing the primary barrier of obtaining training data that includes entity and fact annotations. By expanding the annotations using string matching and considering multiple relations, the model can accurately capture the context and relationships among entities, as illustrated in the example provided.\n\nIn conclusion, entities and their relationships are represented through a systematic process involving entity identification, relation extraction, and dynamic fact incorporation, as demonstrated in the example annotation from the text passage."}

For instance, the slots such as `name` in the `restaurant`, `hotel`, and `attraction` domains often have a large number of possible values, making them challenging to recognize accurately [8]. On the other hand, slots related to numbers, such as `people`, `stay`, and `arrive by`, tend to have lower error rates [8]. This variability in the data distribution across slots poses significant challenges for dialogue state tracking (DST) models.\n\n![Slot Distribution in MultiWOZ](image3)\n\nAs seen in image3, the `train` domain has 3381 dialogues for training, 416 for validation, and 394 for testing, whereas the `restaurant` domain has 3813 dialogues for training, 438 for validation, and 437 for testing. This indicates that the dataset is quite diverse, with varying amounts of data available for each domain. The `hotel` and `attraction` domains also have substantial data, but the `taxi` and `police` domains, which are excluded from the experiments, have fewer dialogues, making them less representative of the overall dataset.\n\nMoreover, certain slots, like `parking`, `internet`, `food`, and `type` in the `hotel` domain, and `price range`, `stars`, `stay`, and `people` in the `restaurant` domain, are unique to specific domains and pose additional challenges for DST models when tracking unseen slots [1].\n\nIn summary, the data distribution across different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset is highly uneven, with some slots having numerous possible values and others being more straightforward. This variability necessitates the development of robust DST models capable of handling diverse and complex dialogue scenarios."}

The system operates by initializing an empty context and iteratively calling these modules to generate and validate questions and answers until the claim verifier confirms the sufficiency of the context for validating the claim. This process is visually represented in Figure 2, where the system's flow is clearly depicted.\n\n![QACheck: Question-Guided Multi-hop Fact-Checking Demo](image1)\n\nIn the demo, when the input claim is \"Lars Onsager won the Nobel prize when he was 30 years old,\" the system generates questions to gather necessary information and uses the GPT Reciter-Reader model to answer these questions.

The Claim Verifier determines if the current context is sufficient to validate the claim, while the Question Generator creates relevant questions to fill in any missing context. The QA Validator evaluates the usefulness of the generated (Q, A) pairs, and the Reasoner outputs the final verdict based on the collected context.\n\n![Claim Verifier](image4)\n\nRegarding the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the system primarily uses InstructGPT for the Claim Verifier and Question Generator, and GPT Reciter-Reader for the Question-Answering Module. These components are designed to facilitate the question-guided multi-hop reasoning process, ensuring transparency and user-friendliness [1].\n\nThe system is currently implemented with three LLM-based QA components: the retriever-reader model, the FLAN-T5 model, and the GPT3-based reciter-reader model. The FLAN-T5 model, in particular, is noted for its flexibility and ability to handle a broader range of questions without relying solely on a predefined evidence corpus [4].\n\nFor the user question, the system implements four modules with LLM backbones: the Claim Verifier, Question Generator, Question-Answering Module, and QA Validator [8].\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"In the proposed system, how many modules are implemented with Large Language Models backbone?\" is four."}

However, when \\( p \\) becomes too large, the performance of both methods starts to decline.

It encompasses a wide range of disciplines and subjects, covering 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, and includes over 183 subfields. This makes it significantly broader than benchmarks like LAMM [61], LVLM-eHub [57], SEED [25], MMBench [36], and MM-Vet [63], which primarily focus on daily knowledge and common sense (text [5]).\n\nIn terms of depth, MMMU requires models to handle complex visual inputs and apply deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. Unlike benchmarks such as MathVista [40], which are limited to mathematical domains, and GAIA [42], which focuses on fundamental abilities like reasoning and multi-modality handling, MMMU challenges models with expert-level tasks that integrate visual perception with domain-specific knowledge (text [6], [7]).\n\nThis distinction is vividly illustrated in the image `![Breadth and Depth](image4)`. The dataset size of MMMU (11.5K questions) is much larger compared to other benchmarks, indicating its comprehensive coverage. Additionally, the image shows that MMMU features diverse image formats and interleaved text-image inputs, testing models' ability to understand and reason about complex scenarios.\n\nThe implications for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) are significant. As shown in the image `![Validation Test](image5)`, LMMs like OpenFlamingo2-9B, MiniGPT4-Vicuna-13B, and Qwen-VL-7B exhibit varying performance levels when evaluated on MMMU. For instance, OpenFlamingo2-9B scores 28.7% on Art & Design, 26.3% on Business, 31.7% on Science, 23.5% on Health & Medicine, 26.3% on Humanities & Social Science, and 27.9% on Technology & Engineering. These scores indicate that even top-performing models struggle with the complexity and breadth of MMMU, highlighting the need for advanced multimodal analysis and domain-specific knowledge integration.\n\nIn conclusion, MMMU's breadth and depth make it a robust benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large multimodal models, pushing them to handle intricate visual and textual information alongside subject-specific reasoning."}

The comparison highlights that the inclusion of the source generally improves the model's performance, as seen in the increased Kendall's Tau scores for several language pairs.\n\nFor instance, the improvement is notably significant for the English-to-Finnish (en-fi) and Finnish-to-English (fi-en) language pairs. In the en-fi pair, the Kendall's Tau score increases from 0.630 to 0.671, and for the fi-en pair, it increases from 0.278 to 0.331.

This is then processed by endonuclease and lyase activities to remove the damaged base and add a new normal base by a specific polymerase enzyme. Finally, DNA ligase seals the gap, restoring the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA strand.\n\n![Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)](image3) depicts the NER pathway, which is highly conserved across species and capable of excising a wide range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. This mechanism involves multiple steps, including recognition of the lesion, excision of the damaged segment, and resynthesis of the DNA strand.\n\n![Mismatch Repair (MMR)](image6) outlines the MMR system, which recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from errors in DNA replication. It involves the identification of the mutated strand, removal of the mismatched sequence, and the addition of the correct bases by DNA polymerase, followed by ligation to restore the DNA double helix.\n\n![Recombination Repair](image1) demonstrates the recombination repair mechanisms, particularly focusing on the cut-and-paste and copy-and-paste mechanisms. These pathways are crucial for repairing double-strand breaks, which can arise from replication errors or external factors like ionizing radiation.

This approach shifts the burden of complex reasoning from the LLM to a deterministic symbolic solver, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the solution.\n\nIn the **Problem Formulation** stage, an LLM translates the natural language description of the problem into a symbolic formulation. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement, as illustrated in Figure 2 [4]. For example, consider the problem: \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb, then the light bulb is glowing.\" The LLM would formulate this as:\n```plaintext\nComplete(Circuit, True) / A\nHas(Circuit, LightBulb) / A\nGlowing(LightBulb, True)\n```\nThis symbolic formulation is then passed to the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, where a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the formulated problem. This solver executes logical operations and checks for entailment, as demonstrated in the example from Figure 4 [4].\n\nAfter the symbolic solver provides its output, the **Result Interpreter** translates the symbolic answer back into natural language. For instance, if the solver determines that the light bulb is indeed glowing, the result interpreter would state, \"The light bulb is glowing.\"\n\nTo further enhance the accuracy of the symbolic parsing, LOGIC-LM incorporates a **self-refinement** module. This module iteratively revises the symbolic formulation using error messages from the symbolic solver, ensuring that the problem is correctly represented and reasoned about. This process is depicted in the dataset comparison table in Table 1 [8], showing improvements in execution rate and accuracy over LLMs alone and chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nIn essence, LOGIC-LM effectively leverages the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic solvers to achieve more accurate and reliable logical reasoning, as summarized in the performance comparison across various datasets in Table 1 [6].\n\n![LOGIC-LM's three-stage process](image4)"}

In 2011, Derry Tanti Wijaya and Reyyan Yeniterzi explored the understanding of semantic change over centuries in their work [4], highlighting the importance of long-term data in tracing semantic shifts.\n\nBy 2014, Kim et al. [7] made a seminal contribution by employing prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts, specifically using incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS). This approach marked a shift from traditional frequency-based methods towards more sophisticated predictive models.\n\nIn 2015, Kulkarni et al. [9] released a comprehensive study using multiple diachronic corpora, including the Google Books Ngrams corpus, Amazon Movie Reviews, and Twitter data, demonstrating the robust application of computational methods to time spans less than a decade. This work expanded the scope of available data and methodologies, paving the way for more diverse and nuanced analyses.\n\nBy 2016, Wayne Taylor's \"Change-point analysis: a powerful new tool for detecting changes\" [5] introduced a statistical framework for detecting changes over time, which was further refined by Hamilton et al. [8], who demonstrated the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models in semantic shifts analysis.

As shown in `image1`, when analyzing the performance of BERT and other models on different configurations, we can observe that BERT's peak performance of $77\\%$ is largely driven by exploiting spurious statistical cues. Specifically, when only considering warrants (W), BERT achieves a maximum accuracy of $71\\%$, leaving only six additional points to account for its peak performance. This indicates that the majority of BERT's performance is due to these cues.\n\nMoreover, the results presented in `image4` further illustrate this point. When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance drops to $53\\%$, with the median and mean both at $50\\%$. This reduction in performance confirms that the original dataset contained spurious cues that BERT exploited, but once these cues were eliminated, BERT's performance reverted to random guessing. This supports the conclusion that BERT did not learn anything substantial about argument comprehension.\n\nTo better understand the impact of these cues, let's look at a specific example from `image3`. The original argument states \"Google is not a harmful monopoly\" with supporting reasons and warrants. In the adversarial version, the claim is negated to \"Google is a harmful monopoly,\" and the warrants are adjusted accordingly. This change effectively mirrors the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, thereby removing the exploitable signals that previously led to high performance on the original dataset.\n\nIn summary, the BERT model's test performance is highly dependent on the presence of spurious statistical cues in the dataset. Without these cues, BERT's performance drops to a level consistent with random guessing, indicating that it did not genuinely learn about argument comprehension. Therefore, the adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation and should be used as the standard for future work on this task. BERT's test performance across different configurations clearly demonstrates its reliance on these cues, making it clear that it has not learned meaningful insights into argument comprehension."}

Specifically, for general questions, GPT-4 achieves the highest performance with an F1-Score of 92.0, while ChatGPT (0.5) scores 84.5. However, when it comes to specific questions, ChatGPT (0.5) outperforms GPT-4, with an F1-Score of 84.5 compared to GPT-4's 92.0. This difference suggests that GPT-4 performs better with less explicit guidance, whereas ChatGPT (0.5) excels when the context is more clearly defined (Figure 1).\n\n![](image2)\n\nThe implications of these findings for citation and text evaluation are significant. For instance, the specific questions in the dataset require models to more explicitly use the knowledge present in the paragraphs, leading to better performance in terms of citation quality and text-citation alignment (Table 8). On the other hand, general questions are less tightly linked to the minimum required knowledge, making them more challenging for models to handle effectively. This trade-off highlights the importance of designing questions that clearly specify the necessary knowledge for optimal model performance.\n\nMoreover, the alignment scores for GPT-4 and ChatGPT (0.5) are notably higher in the specific setting compared to the general setting, with GPT-4 achieving an alignment score of 92 versus 85.9 for ChatGPT (0.5) (Table 8). This indicates that GPT-4 is better at generating citations that align well with the underlying knowledge, especially when the context is more explicit. Conversely, ChatGPT (0.5) demonstrates superior recall in generating longer answers with many citations, which is particularly beneficial in the general setting where the knowledge coverage is less precise (Figure 2).\n\n![](image3)\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics of GPT-4 and ChatGPT differ significantly under general and specific settings. GPT-4 excels in handling less explicit contexts, while ChatGPT (0.5) performs better with more clearly defined questions. These differences have important implications for their use in citation and text evaluation, suggesting that the choice of model and the formulation of questions should be carefully considered to optimize performance."}

When entity linking is excluded, the performance on ultra-fine types declines, indicating its importance in improving the model's ability to predict these finer-grained categories.\n\nIn conclusion, the exclusion of entity linking data notably reduces the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, highlighting its critical role in enhancing the model's predictive capabilities for finer types."}

As stated in [7], while next-gen Recruiter tools might simplify searching, knowing how to build precise Boolean search strings remains a critical skill for all talent acquisition professionals.\n\nThis proficiency in Boolean searches is particularly important when utilizing features like the Talent Pipeline, as mentioned in [5]. For instance, if a role you were previously recruiting for reopens, leveraging the Talent Pipeline feature can help you efficiently source talent already in your pipeline. This underscores the need for candidates to understand how to effectively manage and search through their existing candidate database.\n\nIn summary, candidates should focus on mastering the entire recruiting life cycle, including job posting, talent pipeline management, and efficient search techniques such as Boolean searches. Understanding Boolean search results through a Venn diagram, as shown in image4, is a vital component of these skills and is directly related to the exam topics and practical applications in talent acquisition. ![Key areas for LinkedIn Recruiter Certification](image1)"}

Place a spirit level on the door and rack track inside the tub as shown in image1. If necessary, adjust the three leveling legs individually to ensure stability (quote [2]). This prevents any rocking or tilting during the wash cycle, which could affect the performance (image3).\n\n2. **Loading the Baskets**: Start by drawing out the lower and upper baskets, load the dishes, and push them back. It's recommended to load the lower basket first, followed by the upper one (quote [4]). Load large and most difficult-to-clean items like pots, pans, lids, and serving dishes in the lower basket (image2 and image8). These items should be placed in a way that they don't block the rotation of the top spray arm (quote [6]).\n\n3. **Positioning Items Correctly**: Load curved or recessed items aslant to allow water to run off easily (quote [9]). Hollow items such as cups, glasses, and pans should have their openings facing downwards to prevent water from collecting inside (image4). Utensils need to be stacked securely without overlapping to ensure free rotation of the spray arms (quote [9]).\n\n4. **Handling Delicate and Lighter Dishware**: The upper basket is designed for more delicate and lighter items like glasses, coffee, and tea cups. Place these items carefully to avoid damage (quote [9]). Long bladed knives should be stored in an upright position to prevent hazards (image5).\n\n5. **Securing the Dishwasher**: Ensure the dishwasher is properly secured in place. For normal work surfaces, use the installation hook and secure it to the work surface with wood screws (quote [8]). For marble or granite worktops, fix the side with screws (image1).\n\n6. **Water Supply and Safety**: Before starting the dishwasher, ensure the water supply is turned on to full pressure. Tighten the screws of the safety supply hose to the faucet with a 3/4 inch thread (quote [10]).\n\nBy following these steps and ensuring the dishwasher is properly leveled and loaded according to the guide, you can achieve optimal washing quality."}

For instance, the input low voltage for the 8751H (except for the EA pin) is specified as —0.5 to 0.8 V [1], while for the EA pin, it is 0 to 0.7 V [1]. The input high voltage for the 8751H (except for XTAL2 and RST) is 2.5 V, and for XTAL2 and RST, it is 45 to 5.5 V [1].\n\nFor the output voltages, the 8751H's output low voltage for Port 0, ALE, and PSEN is 0.60 V with a load current of 3.2 mA [1], while for other ports (1, 2, and 3), it is 0.45 V with a load current of 3.2 mA [1]. The output high voltage for all ports is 2.4 V with a load current of —80 pA [1].\n\nComparing these specifications with other related models, the 8751BH and 8752BH have similar input and output voltage ranges but slightly different values. Specifically, the input low voltage for the EA pin of the 8751BH and 8752BH is 0 to 4.5 V [1], and the output low voltage for Port 0, ALE, and PSEN is 0.45 V with a load current of 2.4 mA [1]. The output high voltage for all ports remains at 2.4 V with a load current of —80 pA [1].\n\nFrom the parameter table in image1, we can see that the input low voltage for the 8751H is 0.60 V, while for the 8751BH and 8752BH, it is 0.45 V. This indicates that the 8751H has a higher input low voltage threshold compared to the 8751BH and 8752BH.\n\nAdditionally, the output low voltage for Port 0, ALE, and PSEN in the 8751H is 0.60 V, whereas for the 8751BH and 8752BH, it is 0.45 V, showing a similar difference in the threshold voltage levels.\n\n```markdown\n![The input and output voltage specifications for the 8751H and other related models show differences in input low voltage and output low voltage thresholds.](image1)\n\n![This table further illustrates the variations in input and output voltage specifications between the 8751H and other related models.](image3)\n```\n\nIn summary, the 8751H has higher input low voltage and output low voltage thresholds compared to the 8751BH and 8752BH, indicating that it operates with more stringent voltage levels."}

This observation led him to hypothesize that each parent contributed one factor, or what we now call a gene, to the offspring.\n\n![](image5)\n\nIn the F2 generation, Mendel observed a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower, which can be explained by the genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp. This means that out of every four F2 offspring, three will have the genotype Pp and exhibit the dominant purple phenotype, while one will have the genotype pp and exhibit the recessive white phenotype. This pattern is consistent with the Law of Segregation, which states that each gamete receives only one allele for each gene.\n\n![](image4)\n\nFurthermore, Mendel's findings demonstrated that the genotypes of the F2 generation follow a specific pattern.

These methods include test-driven development (TDD), acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), and just-in-time (JIT) model storming, as shown in `image1` and `image2`. These techniques are more focused on the actual elicitation process, ensuring that requirements are captured in a way that aligns with the development process [10].\n\n`image4` provides a visual representation of the different work item management strategies, highlighting how requirements are organized and managed throughout the development lifecycle. This can be seen as a practical application of both 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods', where informal and formal methods are used to capture and manage requirements effectively [10].\n\nTo summarize, 'Needs Exploration' is a broader strategy that encompasses various methods to understand and define requirements, while 'Elicitation Methods' are more specific techniques used to capture these requirements.

Initially, the utility increases significantly with each hot dog until around the 65th hot dog, where the utility starts to diminish rapidly, eventually turning negative after the 66th hot dog. This pattern illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal utility, which is a fundamental principle in economics indicating that the additional satisfaction derived from consuming one more unit of a good decreases as consumption increases.\n\n![](image5) The chart shows that the utility peaks sharply around the 65th hot dog and then plummets, suggesting that beyond a certain point, consuming more hot dogs leads to a decrease in overall satisfaction.\n\nThis behavior implies that consumers should be cautious about overindulgence, as the costs (in terms of discomfort, health issues, etc.) might outweigh the benefits. It also highlights the importance of variety in consumption, as described in quote [9], which suggests that when enjoyment drops, switching to another choice becomes necessary to maintain overall satisfaction.\n\nIn the context of the broader discussion on focused practice and its benefits, as highlighted in quotes [1] and [8], the diminishing marginal utility of hot dogs can be seen as analogous to the diminishing returns of repetitive, unfocused practice. Just as excessive consumption of hot dogs can lead to a negative utility, so too can untargeted or excessive practice without sufficient variety or strategic focus.\n\nTherefore, the utility change with each additional hot dog consumed underscores the need for balance and moderation in consumption behavior, aligning with the principles of avoiding negative addictions and pursuing positive ones as mentioned in quote [3]."}

In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, leading to a reduction in the chromosome number by half, while in meiosis II, sister chromatids separate, maintaining the haploid state.\n\nIn meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and undergo crossing over, exchanging genetic material before separating into different daughter cells. This process is illustrated in the diagram shown in image1, where homologous chromosomes are depicted as a tetrad, with each pair consisting of four chromatids. The centromeres hold the chromatids together until anaphase I, when homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell, as seen in the image5, which shows the stages of meiosis I, particularly the metaphase and anaphase phases.\n\nIn contrast, meiosis II is more similar to mitosis, where the sister chromatids of each chromosome separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.

For instance, when your heart rate exceeds a certain limit for more than 10 seconds, the watch will vibrate to alert you ([3]). The heart rate zones are typically categorized as follows: \n\n- **Green**: Indicates a comfortable pace suitable for warm-ups and recovery.\n- **Yellow**: Represents a moderate intensity where you can still carry on a conversation but may start feeling some exertion.\n- **Red**: Denotes a high-intensity zone where you are working at maximum capacity, which is ideal for intervals and sprints.\n\nThese color zones help you stay within the optimal range for your chosen workout type, whether it's for endurance, strength, or fat-burning purposes. For example, if you select the \"Maximum heart rate percentage\" calculation method, the heart rate zones for different workout activities like extreme, anaerobic, aerobic, fat-burning, and warm-up are determined based on your maximum heart rate, calculated as \"220 – your age\" by default ([8]).\n\nIn summary, the heart rate zone color display on your fitness tracker corresponds to the workout data by visually representing your current heart rate in relation to predefined thresholds, helping you maintain the appropriate intensity level throughout your exercise session. ![Heart rate zones during an outdoor run](image5)"}

Additionally, the ECU adjusts the ignition timing to optimize power and fuel economy [6].\n\nThe diagram also highlights specific functionalities such as idle speed control and cold start injector management, all orchestrated by the ECU [image1, image5]. These functionalities demonstrate the comprehensive role of the ECU in managing the engine's performance across different operating conditions.\n\nThe Engine Control Unit (ECU) is thus integral to the engine management system, ensuring precise control over fuel injection, ignition timing, and other critical engine functions."}

This is illustrated in the electron micrograph of a chromosome showing its duplication and separation [image1].\n\n2. **Cell Elongation**: As the duplicated chromosomes begin to separate, the cell elongates, creating space for the new daughter cells. This step is also depicted in the image showing the elongation of the cell during binary fission [9].\n\n3. **Cytokinesis**: The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the elongated cell, dividing it into two distinct daughter cells. This final step completes the binary fission process.\n\nThese steps ensure the accurate replication and distribution of genetic material, leading to the formation of two genetically identical cells from one parent cell.\n\n![Three steps of binary fission](image1)"}

This principle applies differently in standard consumption versus competitive contexts, especially when considering activities like eating hot dogs.\n\nIn standard consumption, the utility derived from consuming each additional hot dog diminishes. For instance, as seen in image4 and image5, the utility from the first hot dog is high, but it steadily decreases as more hot dogs are consumed. This is because the initial satisfaction is intense, but as more hot dogs are eaten, the body becomes satiated, and the enjoyment decreases. The utility curve flattens out, indicating that further consumption provides less additional satisfaction [7].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, such as hot dog eating contests, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can have different implications. As depicted in image5, there is a point where the utility turns negative, and the body starts experiencing discomfort. Yet, competitors might push through this point to gain an edge, driven by the competitive nature of the event. This illustrates that in a competitive context, the focus on achieving a goal (winning the contest) can override the natural diminishing returns of consumption [8].\n\nFor hot dog eating contests, the utility from consuming more hot dogs can initially increase due to the excitement and challenge of competing, but eventually, it can decrease due to physical discomfort and the risk of health issues. The key difference lies in the motivation and the context: while in standard consumption, the utility curve tends to flatten out, in competitive contexts, the drive for mastery and victory can temporarily negate the natural decline in utility [3][5].\n\nIn essence, the concept of diminishing marginal utility in competitive contexts like hot dog eating contests can be more complex than in standard consumption, where the focus is primarily on personal satisfaction. The competitive drive can temporarily enhance the perceived utility of continued consumption, even if the physical satisfaction is declining [7][10]."}

There are three primary metering modes:\n\n- **Matrix (or Evaluative)** metering mode [image1] measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for capturing natural landscapes where the lighting is consistent across the scene [image3]. This mode ensures balanced exposure by considering the entire scene.\n- **Center-weighted** metering mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is useful for portraits where the subject's face is often at the center of the frame [image1]. This mode ensures the main subject is properly exposed.\n- **Spot** metering mode focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes [image1]. This mode is particularly useful for precise exposure control in challenging lighting conditions, like backlit subjects or when shooting against a bright background.\n\nSecondly, **focus modes** allow photographers to choose how the camera focuses on the subject:\n\n- **AF-S (Single)** [image1] is used for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus on the chosen subject without continuous adjustment.\n- **AF-C (Continuous)** [image1] is ideal for moving subjects, allowing the camera to track and maintain focus as the subject moves.\n- **MF (Manual)** [image1] is for situations where precise control over focus is necessary, such as focusing on a specific part of the subject, like the eyes in portrait photography.\n\nAdditionally, **ISO sensitivity**, **shutter speed**, and **EV exposure compensation** can be adjusted to further optimize exposure and image quality under different lighting conditions [image2]. For instance, increasing ISO in low-light settings can help capture more light, but may introduce noise, while decreasing it in well-lit conditions can produce cleaner images. Adjusting the shutter speed can affect motion blur, with slower speeds suitable for stationary scenes and faster speeds for fast-moving subjects.\n\nLastly, **white balance** and **color cast** adjustments can be made to correct or enhance the color temperature and overall look of the image, especially in challenging lighting conditions [image2].\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the different metering modes and focus modes available in Pro Mode, photographers can achieve better results in a variety of scenarios, whether it's capturing landscapes, portraits, or fast-moving subjects. This level of control over key aspects of photography enhances the ability to produce high-quality images tailored to the specific needs of each situation."}

The quote illustrates the progression of leads from MQL to SAL, which is a critical step in the sales process.\n\nThe image quote `![Implications of Different Conversion Rates](image4)` provides a visual representation of the lead funnel progression. It shows the conversion rates at each stage: Total Leads to MQLs, MQLs to SALs, SALs to SQLs, and SQLs to SWOs (Sales Won Opportunities).\n\nFrom the data in image4, we see that the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is 6.67%, indicating that only a small fraction of MQLs are accepted by the sales team. This suggests that the criteria for qualifying leads as MQLs might be stringent, leading to a high percentage of leads being filtered out before they reach the sales team.\n\nComparing this with the dataset in image2, which breaks down leads by source, we notice that web direct and organic sources contribute significantly to the total leads. However, the conversion rate from these sources to MQLs is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the overall trend is consistent with the funnel progression shown in image4.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant. A low conversion rate from MQLs to SALs could indicate that the marketing team is doing a good job in identifying and nurturing high-quality leads, but there might be issues in the handoff process between marketing and sales. This could be due to misalignment in the criteria for MQL qualification, inadequate communication, or sales teams not having the resources to handle a high volume of leads.\n\nTo improve the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs, companies might need to focus on better aligning the marketing and sales teams, ensuring that the criteria for MQL qualification are clear and consistent, and providing additional support to the sales team to manage the incoming leads effectively.\n\nTherefore, the low conversion rate from MQLs to SALs highlights the need for enhanced collaboration and clearer processes within the organization to streamline the lead-to-customer journey."}
