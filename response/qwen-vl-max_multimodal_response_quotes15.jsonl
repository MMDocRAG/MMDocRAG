According to [2], a significant majority of Democrats (85%) do not like the way Trump conducts himself as president, with only 10% having mixed feelings and 5% liking his behavior. This sentiment has remained largely unchanged since August. For Republicans, [3] indicates that 38% say they like the way Trump conducts himself, while 45% have mixed feelings and 16% do not like it. These figures suggest a division within the Republican party regarding Trump's conduct.\n\nThe image data further supports these findings. Image 1 shows that among Republicans and Republican leaners, 38% like Trump's conduct, 45% have mixed feelings, and 16% do not like it. In contrast, among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 85% do not like his conduct, 10% have mixed feelings, and only 5% like it. This aligns with the textual evidence provided in [2] and [3].\n\nMoving on to the ethical standards of the Trump administration, [8] reveals that there are modest differences along ideological lines among Democrats, with 93% of liberal Democrats giving low marks for the ethical standards compared to 8% of conservative or moderate Democrats. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, [10] shows that 15% of conservative Republicans express negative views of the ethical standards, whereas about a third (36%) of moderate and liberal Republicans say they are not good or poor.\n\nImage 3 provides a temporal perspective on these views. It shows that among Republicans and Republican leaners, the percentage who believe the ethical standards are \"not good\" or \"poor\" increased from 31% in August 2017 to 38% in May 2018. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, the percentage who believe the ethical standards are \"not good\" or \"poor\" decreased slightly from 93% in August 2017 to 88% in May 2018.\n\nIn summary, the opinions among Republicans and Democrats regarding Trump's conduct and the ethical standards of his administration have shown some changes over time, particularly among Republicans where there appears to be a growing concern about the ethical standards.

However, there are significant differences in views of Trump by race, age, and education [10]. For example, younger adults, those with higher levels of education, and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of the job Trump is doing.\n\nIn summary, the low approval ratings for the ethical standards of Trump's administration officials may be related to the overall public perception of his job performance, which is influenced by various demographic factors.\n![Approval ratings for the ethical standards of Trump's administration officials are lower than those of past administrations](image1)"}

According to [5], evaluations of the government’s job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups. Specifically, 58% say the government is doing very or fairly well, while 40% say it is doing not too or not at all well. By comparison, 48% of those with a bachelor’s degree, and 44% of those with less education, rate the government’s performance positively.\n\nNow, let's consider the data from the images. Image 2 shows a line graph comparing the percentage of people who think the government's anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country versus those who think they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties over time. The graph indicates that since 2013, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of people who believe the policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, reaching 56% in 2015. This aligns with the text quote [7], which states that by two-to-one, Americans now say they are more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%), rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (28%).\n\nFinally, let's look at the data from image 5, which provides a breakdown by age group of the concerns about anti-terror policies. The table shows that for those 65 and older, 71% are concerned that the policies do not go far enough to protect the country, while only 15% are concerned that they go too far in restricting civil liberties. For those 50-64, 60% are concerned about not going far enough, and 21% are concerned about going too far. For those 30-49, 52% are concerned about not going far enough, and 32% are concerned about going too far. For those 18-29, 44% are concerned about not going far enough, and 43% are concerned about going too far. This data supports the earlier findings that older Americans are more likely to be concerned about the government's anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country, while younger Americans are more split in their concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the data from both the text and image quotes indicate that older Americans are more critical of the government's performance in reducing the terrorist threat and are more concerned that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country. Younger Americans, on the other hand, are more likely to give the government a positive rating for its performance and are more split in their concerns about whether the policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties or not far enough to protect the country.\n![The chart shows a significant increase in concern about ISIS from August 2014 to December 2015](image1)\n![The graph shows an increasing trend in the belief that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country](image2)\n![The graph shows that Republicans are more concerned about anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country](image3)\n![The table shows that younger adults are more likely to give the government a positive rating for its performance in reducing the terrorist threat](image4)\n![The table shows that older Americans are more concerned about anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country](image5)"}

According to [4], there has been a shift in opinion since Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, with more people now saying that the government’s anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country. This shift is more pronounced among Republicans, with 71% now expressing this concern, up from 57% in January and 38% in July 2013. For Democrats, the majority (54%) also now say their greater concern is that government policies do not go far enough, which is up somewhat since January and 16 points since 2013.\n\nNext, let's look at the specific age groups. The table in [8] shows that adults under 30 are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%). In contrast, majorities in every other age group are more concerned about security than civil liberties, though this concern is more pronounced among those 65 and older (71% say this) than those 30-49 (52%).\n\nNow, let's compare these opinions across political affiliations. The line graph in image3 shows the percentage of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents who say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country. As of December 2015, 71% of Republicans, 54% of Democrats, and 49% of Independents hold this view.\n\nIn summary, opinions on government anti-terrorism efforts have evolved over time, with more people now concerned that these policies do not go far enough to protect the country. This trend is more pronounced among Republicans and older age groups. However, adults under 30 remain split on this issue, and there are differences in opinion across political affiliations, with Republicans being more concerned about security than Democrats or Independents.\n![The percentage of people who believe anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country increased from 2013 to 2015](image2)"}

However, current ratings of how well the campaign is going remain negative, with about six-in-ten saying the U.S. effort is going either not too well or not at all well [4]. Despite this, a majority continues to approve of the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, with support remaining steady throughout 2015 [6].\n\nThere are wide partisan divides in current assessments of the campaign against ISIS [2]. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the campaign is going at least fairly well, while Republicans are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the militants [5] [10]. This partisan divide is also reflected in the image showing different levels of concern across political affiliations [![The chart shows varying levels of concern about the U.S. military action in Iraq and Syria among different age groups and political affiliations](image3)].\n\nOverall, while there has been an uptick in the view of ultimate success, current state assessments remain negative, and these views differ significantly across political affiliations [7] [9].\n![The chart shows varying levels of concern about the U.S. military action in Iraq and Syria among different age groups and political affiliations](image3)"}

The image below further illustrates these trends over time, showing a growing partisan gap in views on whether Islam encourages violence.\n\n![The trend shows a growing partisan gap in views on whether Islam encourages violence](image1)\n\nThese differing perceptions are closely related to views on government handling of terrorism. For example, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum since early 2015 [6]. However, Democrats remain the only partisan group where a majority (64%) still believes the government is doing at least fairly well, although this is down from 85% in January [6]. This suggests that those who perceive Islam as more likely to encourage violence may also be more critical of government efforts to address terrorism.\n\nIn summary, there is a clear correlation between negative perceptions of Islam's encouragement of violence and dissatisfaction with government handling of terrorism, particularly among Republicans."}

In contrast, Democrats mostly think the tariffs were bad for the U.S. This sentiment is reflected in the image showing the distribution of opinions on the effects of tariffs on the U.S. economy [image5].\n\nSecondly, when it comes to preferences for getting tougher with China versus building stronger relationships, the data shows a clear divide along party lines. The majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want the U.S. to get tougher with China, with 72% of them holding this view [1]. This is particularly true for conservative Republicans, where 81% support getting tougher on China [1]. On the other hand, about six-in-ten Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents would rather focus on building stronger ties with China [1].

Additionally, [7] states that affluent and well-educated seniors adopt the internet and broadband at substantially higher rates than those with lower levels of income and educational attainment.\n\nTo visualize this trend, we can look at the following table which shows the percentage of seniors who go online and have broadband at home based on their education level:\n![Seniors' internet usage and broadband adoption varies by education](image2)\n\nFrom the table, it is evident that college graduates have the highest rates of internet usage (87%) and broadband adoption (76%), while those with a high school degree or less have the lowest rates (40% for internet usage and 27% for broadband adoption).\n\nIn conclusion, seniors with higher educational backgrounds are more likely to use the internet and own smartphones compared to those with lower educational attainment.\n![Seniors with higher education are more likely to use the internet and own smartphones](image2)"}

Specifically, 87% of seniors with a college degree go online, and 76% are broadband adopters, whereas only 40% of seniors who have not attended college go online, and 27% have broadband at home [3].\n- Among seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more, 90% go online and 82% have broadband at home, which is significantly higher than the 39% going online and 25% having broadband at home for those earning less than $30,000 annually [3].\n\nRegarding cell phone and smartphone ownership:\n- The overall cell phone ownership rate among seniors is 77%, trailing the national average of 91% [7]. However, smartphone ownership is much lower, with only 18% of seniors being smartphone adopters [9].\n- Smartphone ownership decreases substantially with age, with only 5% of those 80 and older owning a smartphone [8].\n- Higher-income seniors have higher rates of smartphone ownership. For example, 42% of seniors with a household income of $75,000 or more own a smartphone, compared to 8% for those with an income less than $30,000 [2].\n- Similarly, college graduates are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as are seniors who have not attended college [4].\n\nThe image quotes provide additional insights:\n- Image 2 shows that cell phone ownership is highest among seniors aged 65-69 (84%) and lowest among those 80+ (61%). Smartphone ownership follows a similar trend but at a much lower rate, with 29% for 65-69 and 5% for 80+.\n- Image 3 indicates that internet and broadband adoption also decrease with age, with 74% of 65-69 year olds going online and 65% having broadband at home, compared to 37% and 21% respectively for those 80+.\n- Image 4 reveals that e-book readers and tablets are more common among higher-income and more educated seniors, mirroring the pattern seen with smartphones.\n\nIn summary, both internet and broadband adoption, as well as cell phone and smartphone ownership, are positively correlated with higher education and income levels among seniors. However, the adoption rates for smartphones remain relatively low across all demographic subcategories, especially for older seniors and those with lower incomes or less education.\n\n![Seniors' internet usage has increased over time, but still lags behind the general population](image1)"}

For instance, while 54% of Americans think the personal finance score algorithm would be effective at identifying good customers [1], only 32% believe it is fair to consumers [8]. This 22-percentage-point difference is the largest among the four scenarios studied [8]. In contrast, for the criminal risk score, 49% think it would be effective at identifying people deserving of parole, and 50% believe it would be fair to those up for parole [1]. The smaller gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness for the criminal risk score suggests a higher level of trust in this system compared to the personal finance score.\n\n![Most Americans believe computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias](image1)\n\nThese differences imply that public trust in these systems is influenced by the context in which they are applied.

According to [1], views of these standards remain at record lows compared with previous administrations dating back to the 1980s. This is further supported by [7], which states that views of Trump administration officials are lower than those of officials in the previous five administrations, often measured at times of specific ethical controversies. Additionally, [10] provides a breakdown of partisan views on this issue: 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners say that ethical standards of top administration officials are excellent or good, while 90% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are not good or poor. This stark contrast highlights the significant divide in perceptions based on political affiliation.\n\nNext, let's consider the economic impact of Trump's policies. [4] indicates that overall, 40% think that Trump’s policies have made economic conditions better since taking office, compared with fewer (28%) who say they have made conditions worse; 29% say they have not had much of an effect. However, there is a clear partisan divide here as well. [9] shows that nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that his economic policies had improved conditions in the country, up from 63% in October 2017. In contrast, Democrats and Democratic leaners have grown more negative in their views of Trump’s economic policies, with almost half (46%) now saying his policies have worsened economic conditions.\n\nRegarding long-term success, [5] reveals that about half (47%) think Trump will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, compared with fewer (29%) who think he will be successful; 23% say it’s too early to tell. This is more negative than ratings for Obama and George W. Bush at comparable points in their administrations. [3] adds that about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65%) say Trump will be a successful president in the long run, indicating a strong partisan divide in expectations for his legacy.\n\nNow, let's look at how these perceptions compare to those of previous presidents. Image 3 shows the percentage of people who believe each president will be successful, unsuccessful, or if it's too early to tell over time. For example, in January 2019, 29% of people believed Trump would be successful, 47% believed he would be unsuccessful, and 23% said it was too early to tell. In comparison, in January 2011, 43% of people believed Obama would be successful, 26% believed he would be unsuccessful, and 31% said it was too early to tell. Similarly, in December 2003, 69% of people believed Bush would be successful, 37% believed he would be unsuccessful, and 28% said it was too early to tell. These comparisons suggest that perceptions of Trump's presidency are more negative than those of recent predecessors.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of Trump's presidency differ significantly among political affiliations, with Republicans generally viewing him more favorably than Democrats. Compared to previous presidents, views of Trump's presidency are more negative, particularly in terms of trust and ethical standards. However, there is a notable exception in the area of economic impact, where a majority of Republicans view his policies positively, despite a growing negativity among Democrats.\n\n![The chart shows that the percentage of people who believe Trump will be a successful president is lower than for previous presidents at comparable points in their administrations.]"}

In contrast, an even larger share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (80%) think that Trump will be an unsuccessful president [5]. This polarization is evident when comparing these views to those held about previous presidents. For example, at comparable points in their presidencies, nearly half of the public (47%) said it was too early to tell whether Obama would be successful, while 38% said this about George W. Bush and 43% about Clinton [4].\n\nImage1 provides a visual representation of these views for Trump, Obama, Bush, and Clinton. It shows that the percentage of Republicans who believe Trump will be successful (65%) is higher than the percentage of Republicans who believed Bush would be successful (69%) but lower than the percentage of Democrats who believed Obama would be successful (43%). The percentage of Democrats who believe Trump will be unsuccessful (80%) is much higher than the percentage of Democrats who believed Bush would be unsuccessful (37%).\n\nAdditionally, the trend over time can be observed in image3, which shows the percentage of people who believe each president will be successful, unsuccessful, or say it's too early to tell. For Trump, the percentage who believe he will be successful has remained relatively stable since January 2017, while the percentage who believe he will be unsuccessful has increased. For Obama, the percentage who believed he would be successful decreased over time, while the percentage who believed he would be unsuccessful increased. For Bush, the percentage who believed he would be successful decreased over time, while the percentage who believed he would be unsuccessful increased. For Clinton, the percentage who believed he would be successful increased over time, while the percentage who believed he would be unsuccessful decreased.\n\nIn summary, the data suggests that there is a significant partisan divide in perceptions of Trump's presidency, with Republicans being more positive and Democrats being more negative.

According to [2], rock is driven by catalog at all formats while pop is mainly driven by current. This suggests that for rock, a significant portion of its activity comes from older, established albums, whereas pop is more focused on new releases.\n\nNext, we can examine the specific percentages for each genre. Image 3 shows the breakdown of album sales, song sales, and streams for various genres. For rock, we see that it has the highest percentage of album sales (37%) and the second-highest percentage of streams (24%). This aligns with the statement that rock is driven by catalog, as album sales often represent older, catalog titles.\n\nIn contrast, pop has the highest percentage of song sales (26%) and the third-highest percentage of streams (19%). This supports the idea that pop is mainly driven by current releases, as song sales typically reflect newer, popular tracks.\n\nFor R&B/hip-hop, we see a more balanced distribution between album sales (23%), song sales (26%), and streams (18%). This genre appears to have a mix of both current and catalog activity.\n\nCountry music shows a similar pattern to R&B/hip-hop, with a relatively even distribution across album sales (12%), song sales (11%), and streams (12%).\n\nFinally, image 5 provides additional context by showing the share of total activity for each genre. Rock again stands out with the highest share of total activity (82%), followed by R&B/hip-hop (61%) and country (55%). These high percentages suggest that these genres have a strong presence in both current and catalog activities.\n\nIn summary, the comparison of streaming and album sales across different music genres reveals that rock is heavily influenced by catalog activity, pop is primarily driven by current releases, and R&B/hip-hop and country have a more balanced mix of both current and catalog activity.\n![Streaming dominates most genres](image2)"}

For 2-hop claims, ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5 across all model sizes, with the gap widening as the model size increases. For 3-hop claims, ProgramFC maintains a consistent lead over FLAN-T5, although the difference is less pronounced than in 2-hop claims. For 4-hop claims, ProgramFC again outperforms FLAN-T5, but the performance gap narrows as the model size increases.\n\n![ProgramFC consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 across different model sizes for 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims on the HOVER dataset](image3)\n\nNext, let's examine the error trends in ProgramFC's predictions.

The table in image1 shows the proportion of these error types for 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims. It can be seen that there are no syntax errors, indicating that the programs generated by ProgramFC are syntactically correct. However, the proportion of semantic errors increases as the complexity of the claims increases, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent. This suggests that generating appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for complex claims is challenging.\n\nIn summary, ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5 across different model sizes for various fact-checking tasks, but it faces challenges in generating correct reasoning programs for complex claims, leading to an increase in semantic errors.\n![The proportion of semantic errors increases as the complexity of the claims increases, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent](image1)"}

For example, a question in the Health & Medicine category asks for the etiology of a finding in a breast MRI, which necessitates both expert visual perception and medical knowledge [5]. This is further illustrated in image1, where the question integrates multiple images and requires deep understanding and reasoning.\n\nTo evaluate the depth and breadth comprehensively, the MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges, as detailed in Figure 1, emphasizing the need for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [7].\n![MMMU covers a wide range of subjects and requires expert-level reasoning](image1)\n\nThe statistics in image2 show that the dataset includes 11,550 questions across 30 subjects and 183 subfields, with a diverse set of image types and a mix of easy, medium, and hard difficulties, ensuring both breadth and depth in the evaluation of LMMs' capabilities.\n![Statistics of the MMMU dataset](image2)\n\nThe MMMU benchmark stands out from other datasets by its focus on advanced perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, as shown in image3, where MMMU is positioned higher on both the depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) axes compared to other benchmarks.\n![Positioning of MMMU on depth and breadth axes](image3)\n\nOverall, the MMMU dataset effectively balances breadth and depth, covering a wide range of subjects while requiring expert-level reasoning and knowledge.\n![Detailed subject coverage and statistics](image4)"}

It includes problems sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks spanning six common disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. The benchmark consists of 11.5K carefully selected multimodal questions, which cover 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields, thus meeting the breadth goal. Moreover, many problems within MMMU require expert-level reasoning, such as applying “Fourier Transform” or “Equilibrium Theory” to derive the solution, thus meeting the depth goal.\n\nSecondly, the MMMU benchmark presents two unique challenges absent in current benchmarks (Figure 1). Firstly, it covers diverse image formats, from visual scenes like photographs and paintings to diagrams and tables, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. Secondly, MMMU features interleaved text-image inputs. A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge, and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution.\n\nThirdly, the MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges to multimodal foundation models, as detailed in Figure 1. Among these, we particularly highlight the challenge stemming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge. This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model’s adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, calling for an advanced approach that integrates advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge.\n\nFinally, the MMMU benchmark underscores both the progress and the challenges in multimodal understanding and reasoning. While GPT-4V leads in performance, the overall results indicate substantial room for improvement, especially in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge.\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark stands out due to its comprehensive coverage of subjects and subfields, expert-level reasoning requirements, diverse image formats, and interleaved text-image inputs, making it a rigorous and demanding standard for assessing the capabilities of LMMs.\n![The MMMU benchmark covers a wide range of subjects and subfields, including Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering.](image1)\n[2]"}

This is evident from the text quote [5], which states that \"MMMU features problems sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks spanning six common disciplines\" and requires \"expert-level reasoning, such as applying 'Fourier Transform' or 'Equilibrium Theory' to derive the solution.\" This indicates a higher level of reasoning depth compared to other benchmarks that typically focus on commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning [9].\n\nSecondly, in terms of knowledge breadth, the MMMU benchmark covers 30 different subjects and 183 subfields, as mentioned in the same text quote [5]. This wide coverage is further supported by the table in image2, which shows that MMMU has a larger size (11.5K questions) and more diverse image types (30 types) compared to other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and SEED. The MMMU benchmark also includes interleaved text-image inputs, which adds another layer of complexity and breadth to the tasks [4].\n\nLastly, the variety of image types used in the MMMU benchmark is extensive. As shown in the table in image2, MMMU uses 30 different image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. This diversity is highlighted in the text quote [9], which mentions that \"the covered image format is also limited\" in previous benchmarks, whereas MMMU aims to cover \"college-level knowledge with 30 image formats.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark stands out in terms of reasoning depth, knowledge breadth, and the variety of image types used, making it a more comprehensive and challenging benchmark for large multimodal models.\n![The MMMU benchmark excels in reasoning depth, knowledge breadth, and image type variety.]()"}

Table 3 [3] compares the performance of selected models across three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. GPT-4V demonstrates a significantly higher proficiency compared to open-source models in the \"Easy\" category, with a success rate of 76.1%. However, the gap narrows in the \"Medium\" category, where GPT-4V still leads at 55.6%, and further diminishes in the \"Hard\" category, indicating that as the complexity of tasks increases, the advantage of more advanced models like GPT-4V almost disappears. This might reflect a current limitation in handling expert-level challenging queries even for the most advanced models.\n\nNext, let's look at the performance across different image types. Figure 5 [8] compares the performance of various models across top frequent image types. Across all types, GPT-4V consistently outperforms the other models by a huge margin. Open-source models demonstrate relatively strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings, which are more frequently seen during training. However, for less common image categories like Geometric shapes, Music sheets, and Chemical structures, all models obtain very low scores (some are close to random guesses). This indicates that the existing models are generalizing poorly towards these image types.\n\nRegarding the key errors encountered by GPT-4V, our error analysis on 150 error cases reveals that 35% of errors are perceptual, 29% stem from a lack of knowledge, and 26% are due to flaws in the reasoning process. These findings underscore the challenges of the MMMU benchmark and point towards areas needing further research and model enhancement.\n\nIn summary, GPT-4V performs well in the \"Easy\" and \"Medium\" categories but struggles with \"Hard\" tasks. It also excels in common image types but fails in less common ones.

The bar chart in image1(a) illustrates the percentage of prompts that were judged to have been fulfilled, partially fulfilled, or not fulfilled by each model. For task fulfillment, Chameleon has a higher percentage of fully fulfilled tasks compared to Gemini+ and GPT-4V+, with 55.2% of its responses being considered to have completely fulfilled the tasks, whereas Gemini+ and GPT-4V+ have 37.6% and 44.7%, respectively.\n\nNext, we can examine the inter-annotator agreement on task fulfillment and relevance from image4. The bar chart in image4 shows the count of annotations where all three annotators agreed, two agreed, or there was no agreement for various criteria including task fulfillment and relevance. For task fulfillment, the majority of annotations (around 2000 out of 3000) show full agreement among the annotators, indicating a high level of consistency in their judgments.

The table in [5] shows that the \"+ positive\" technique, which creates a balanced dataset, leads to improved performance compared to the original dataset. Conversely, the \"+ negative\" technique, which increases the imbalance, results in underperformance. This is consistent with the expectation that balancing the dataset improves model performance, while increasing imbalance has the opposite effect.\n\n![The \"+ positive\" data augmentation technique improves BERT performance on QQP by creating a more balanced dataset](image1)\n\nMoving on to sentiment analysis tasks, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of different training objectives. The table in [8] demonstrates that BERT fine-tuned with cross-entropy (BERT+CE) achieves the highest accuracy on SST-2 and SST-5. However, when using dice loss (DL) or dynamic sampling correction (DSC), the performance slightly decreases. This indicates that for accuracy-oriented tasks like text classification, the proposed dice loss is not as effective as cross-entropy.\n\n![BERT+CE outperforms DL and DSC on SST-2 and SST-5](image2)\n\nFor named entity recognition tasks, the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset is used to evaluate the impact of hyperparameters in Tversky index (TI). The table in [4] shows that the highest F1 score is achieved when the hyperparameter α is set to 0.6. This suggests that TI can effectively control the tradeoff between false-negatives and false-positives, leading to improved performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\nIn summary, different data augmentation techniques have varying impacts on BERT models depending on the task and dataset. Balancing the dataset generally improves performance, while increasing imbalance has the opposite effect. For sentiment analysis tasks, cross-entropy remains the most effective training objective, while for named entity recognition tasks, Tversky index with appropriate hyperparameters can lead to significant performance improvements.\n  \nTherefore, the answer is: Different data augmentation techniques impact the performance of BERT models on the QOP dataset by either improving or deteriorating it based on whether they balance or increase the imbalance in the dataset."}

From [1], we learn that coreference propagation is mainly helpful for entities but appears to hurt relation extraction. On the other hand, relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in both domains. This is supported by the data in image1, which shows that removing the coreference propagation layer (−CorefProp) slightly decreases the F1 score for entities but increases it for relations. Conversely, removing the relation propagation layer (−RelProp) decreases the F1 score for both entities and relations.\n\nTo further illustrate these points, let's consider the results presented in image2. The table shows that DyGIE outperforms previous methods on all datasets for both entity and relation extraction tasks. Specifically, on ACE04, DyGIE achieves an entity F1 score of 87.4 and a relation F1 score of 59.7, compared to the previous best scores of 81.6 and 47.5, respectively.

This indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminates the cues, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension [6].\n\n![BERT's performance drops to near-random levels on the adversarial test set](image4)\n\nFrom these results, we can conclude that the adversarial dataset has successfully eliminated the cues as expected, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension [6]. The adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT [10]."}

The table in image1 provides a comprehensive comparison of various decoding methods used by COMET across different relation types. The 'Avg' column summarizes the overall performance for each method. Greedy decoding achieves the highest average score of 77.53%, which is notably close to the human validation score of 86.18%. This suggests that greedy decoding is the most effective method among those tested, as it produces commonsense inferences that are closest to human-level quality [1].\n\n![Greedy decoding achieves the highest average score of 77.53%, closely approaching human validation at 86.18%.](image1)\n\nNext, let's consider how variations in training data percentages affect the model's metrics. The table in image3 illustrates the impact of using different percentages of the training data on perplexity (PPL), BLEU-2, and novelty metrics (N/T o and N/U o). As the percentage of training data increases from 1% to 50%, there is a general improvement in all metrics. Specifically, PPL decreases from 23.81 to 11.82, indicating better model confidence. BLEU-2 scores also improve from 5.08 to 13.97, suggesting better alignment with reference texts. Novelty metrics show mixed results but generally indicate that more training data leads to higher novelty [3].\n\nIn conclusion, greedy decoding is the most effective method for generating commonsense inferences, closely approaching human validation scores. Increasing the percentage of training data improves the model's metrics, including perplexity, BLEU-2, and novelty, although the improvements in novelty are less consistent."}

The table in image2 shows that the pass-through strategy has a WER of 11.3% for all attacks, while the background model has a slightly higher WER of 13.1%. The neutral backoff variant matches the pass-through strategy with a WER of 11.3%.\n\nFor open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece), the same table in image2 reveals that the pass-through strategy performs poorly with a WER of 30.3%, indicating high sensitivity to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the background model shows a significant improvement with a WER of 14.7%, suggesting better handling of unseen words. The neutral backoff variant again aligns closely with the pass-through strategy, having a WER of 11.3%.\n\nThe visual representation in image4 further illustrates this trend.

The reserve release was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [7].\n\n- **Network Volumes and Card Member Spending**: Network volumes increased by 24% from 2020 to 2021, reflecting strong growth across both U.S. and international markets [3]. Billed business, which is a measure of card member spending, grew by 25%, indicating robust consumer activity [3].\n\nThese changes reflect a recovery in consumer spending and confidence, supported by improvements in the macroeconomic environment and the company's strategic initiatives.\n\n![Key financial metrics show significant improvements in 2021 compared to 2020](image2)\n\nIn summary, the key changes include a 21% increase in card member loans, a substantial decrease in net write-offs, and a significant reserve release for both loans and receivables, alongside a 24% increase in network volumes and a 25% increase in billed business from 2020 to 2021."}

This indicates an increase in gross property, plant and equipment but also an increase in accumulated depreciation.\n\nFrom [2], we can see that capital expenditures were $3.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly for Model Y production expansion at the Fremont Factory, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas. This suggests significant investment in property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom [3], we learn that depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $232 million, $227 million and $276 million, respectively. This shows a slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nFrom [4], we understand that additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems under construction. This implies that the cost of solar energy systems is increasing.\n\nFrom [5], we see that energy generation and storage revenue increased by $463 million, or 30%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This indicates growth in the energy generation and storage segment.\n\nFrom [6], we learn about the structure of Solar Asset-backed Notes and how they are used to service the principal and interest payments on the notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses. This provides insight into the financing of solar assets.\n\nFrom [7], we see that gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 12% to 1% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This suggests a decline in profitability in this segment.\n\nFrom [8], we learn that cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $635 million, or 47%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This indicates higher costs in this segment.\n\nFrom [9], we see that the cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.05 billion. The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $137 million and $101 million, respectively. This shows an increase in both the cost and accumulated depreciation of these assets.\n\nFrom [10], we can see the breakdown of solar energy systems, net, which includes solar energy systems in service, initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs, solar energy systems under construction, and solar energy systems pending interconnection. This provides a detailed view of the composition of solar energy systems.\n\nFrom image1, we can see the debt structure of the company, which includes recourse debt and non-recourse debt. This gives us an idea of the company’s financial leverage.\n\nFrom image2, we can see the breakdown of property, plant, and equipment, which includes machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture, tooling, leasehold improvements, land and buildings, computer equipment, hardware and software, and construction in progress. This provides a detailed view of the composition of property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom image3, we can see the other long-term liabilities of the company, which include operating lease liabilities, accrued warranty reserve, sales return reserve, deferred tax liability, resale value guarantees, and other non-current liabilities. This gives us an idea of the company’s long-term obligations.\n\nFrom image4, we can see the breakdown of solar energy systems, net, which includes solar energy systems in service, initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, solar energy systems under construction, and solar energy systems pending interconnection. This provides a detailed view of the composition of solar energy systems.\n\nFrom image5, we can see the current liabilities of the company, which include accrued purchases, taxes payable, payroll and related costs, accrued warranty reserve, current portion, sales return reserve, current portion, operating lease liabilities, current portion, accrued interest, resale value guarantees, current portion, and other current liabilities. This gives us an idea of the company’s short-term obligations.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment increased from 2019 to 2020. This is supported by the increase in gross property, plant and equipment under finance leases, the increase in capital expenditures, and the increase in the cost of solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements. However, it is important to note that there was also an increase in accumulated depreciation, which partially offset the increase in gross property, plant and equipment and the cost of solar energy systems.\n\nTherefore, the total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment increased from 2019 to 2020.\n![The total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment increased from 2019 to 2020](image4)"}

The total fair value of derivative financial instruments increased from DKK 734 million in 2019 to DKK 2,332 million in 2020 [6]. This increase is primarily due to the positive fair value of forward contracts, which rose from DKK 81 million in 2019 to DKK 1,658 million in 2020 for USD contracts, and from DKK 35 million to DKK 191 million for CNH, JPY, GBP, and CAD contracts [6].\n\nNext, we look at the cash flow changes. The change in working capital, including exchange rate adjustments, shows a decrease from DKK (3,564) million in 2019 to DKK (2,624) million in 2020 [5]. This indicates a reduction in the amount of cash tied up in working capital, which can be beneficial for the company's liquidity.\n\nThe net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are recognized in the income statement as financial income or expenses [7]. Therefore, the increase in the fair value of derivative financial instruments would positively affect the income statement by increasing financial income.\n\nIn summary, the increase in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the reduction in working capital changes suggest an improvement in the company's financial health, as it indicates better management of financial risks and improved liquidity.\n![The fair value of derivative financial instruments increased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image6)\n![The change in working capital decreased from 2019 to 2020](image5)"}

According to [2], there was a significant amount of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option grants as of June 30, 2022, which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.5 years. This indicates that the company has ongoing commitments to its employees through stock options, which will impact future financial statements.\n\nNext, we can see from image2 that the total stock-based expense has decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $540 million in 2021 and further to $528 million in 2022. This trend suggests that while the company continues to grant stock options and other equity awards, the associated expenses have been decreasing over the past three years.\n\nNow, let's look at the net earnings per share (EPS). From image3, we can observe that the diluted EPS has increased from $5.13 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021 and further to $5.81 in 2022. This steady increase in EPS indicates that the company has been able to generate more earnings per share over the past three years, which is generally seen as a positive financial trend.\n\nTo understand the relationship between these two metrics, we need to consider how stock-based compensation expenses affect net earnings. Stock-based compensation expenses reduce net earnings because they are a non-cash expense that is recorded on the income statement. However, the decrease in stock-based compensation expenses from 2020 to 2022 has likely contributed to the increase in net earnings, which in turn has led to the increase in EPS.\n\nIn conclusion, the decrease in stock-based compensation expenses and the increase in net earnings per share reflect a positive financial trend for Procter & Gamble from 2020 to 2022. The company has been able to manage its stock-based compensation costs effectively while also increasing its earnings per share, which is a sign of strong financial performance.\n![The table shows the number of outstanding, granted, exercised, and forfeited/expired options along with their weighted average exercise price, contractual life, and aggregate intrinsic value.](image1)"}

This can be seen in `![Operating income decreased from $215 million in 2019 to $169 million in 2020](image3)`. The decrease in operating income is likely due to a combination of factors including lower transportation services revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related price impacts, as well as higher costs associated with planned turnaround activities and storms in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n### Cash from Investing Activities\nFrom [8], we see that cash used in investing activities decreased from $(87) million in 2019 to $64 million in 2020. This can be seen in `![Cash used in investing activities decreased from $(87) million in 2019 to $64 million in 2020](image5)`.

This growth is primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and an increase in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans [10].\n- **Global**: The number of individuals served decreased by 5%, which is a result of increased unemployment and underwriting discipline [10].\n\n![The financial performance of UnitedHealth Group improved from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nIn summary, the changes in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare across different segments from 2019 to 2020 were influenced by factors such as increased unemployment, economic-driven employment attrition, and policy changes related to COVID-19."}

The text quote [1] indicates that the Media segment revenue increased by $20.3% to $22.8 billion in 2021, which includes the impact of broadcasting the Tokyo Olympics. Excluding the $1.8 billion associated with the Olympics, the revenue still saw an increase of $11.0%, primarily due to growth in distribution, advertising, and other revenues. This suggests a strong recovery in the media segment post-COVID-19 disruptions.\n\nThe image data also supports this trend. Image 2 shows that the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, representing an 8.7% increase. This increase is attributed to higher sales of wireless handsets and rate increases in the United Kingdom, partially offset by declines in Italy due to reduced broadcast rights for Serie A.\n\nHowever, the customer relationships have shown a slight decline. According to image 1, the total customer relationships decreased from 23,280 in 2019 to 23,027 in 2021, indicating a net loss of 198 customer relationships over the two years. This decline could be attributed to the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns mentioned in text quote [9].\n\nIn summary, despite a slight decline in customer relationships, NBCUniversal experienced significant revenue growth from 2019 to 2021, driven by strong performance in the media segment and increased average revenue per customer relationship.\n![Revenue increased but customer relationships declined](image1)\n![Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased](image2)"}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual [1].\n\n- **Net Interest Expense**: The net interest expense increased by $14.120 billion from 2019 to 2020, which is a substantial increase compared to the decrease of $3.738 billion from 2018 to 2019 [4]. This increase can be attributed to higher funding costs and the impact of the economic environment on the bank's operations.\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, which includes four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking, and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other [10]. Each segment has its own specific activities, products, and businesses, and the financial performance of these segments is closely monitored and managed [2]. The decline in net interest income and the increase in net interest expense suggest that the bank faced challenges in generating revenue from its lending activities while managing its funding costs, which could be related to the broader economic conditions and the strategic decisions made within each business segment [8].\n\n![Changes in Net Interest Income and Expense](image4)\n\nIn summary, the significant decrease in net interest income and the substantial increase in net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 indicate that Bank of America experienced challenges in its core banking operations, which are reflected in the performance of its various business segments."}

This decline is primarily attributed to a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which dropped by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [2]. The decrease in interest income can be linked to the low short-term interest rates that prevailed through 2021, resulting in lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities [6].\n\nRegarding the asset composition of the insurance business, there was a notable increase in equity securities holdings, rising from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 [1].

The increase was due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes of $760 million, and higher asset sales gains of $640 million. From the text quote [6], International upstream reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $825 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion, along with the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion and severance charges of $290 million. Partially offsetting these increases are higher tax charges of $630 million, the absence of 2020 asset sales gains of $550 million, and higher depreciation expenses of $670 million and lower sales volumes of $540 million. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $587 million between periods.\n\nFrom the text quote [9], U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million. From the text quote [2], International downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared with $618 million in 2020. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million between periods.\n\nThe image quote `![Chevron's upstream and downstream earnings trend](image1)` shows the earnings trend for both upstream and downstream operations from 2019 to 2021.

This is a substantial improvement from the net loss of $5,543 million in 2020 and the net income of $2,924 million in 2019.\n  \nTherefore, the trends in Chevron's upstream and downstream operations' financial performance over the years 2019 to 2021 were positive, contributing to the overall net income improvement."}

According to [7], the liability for uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. This significant reduction is due to a $249 million tax benefit from the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position in 2020.\n\nNext, we examine the changes in fair value assets and liabilities. The text quote [9] mentions that the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $6.80 billion as of December 31, 2020, with an estimated fair value of $7.78 billion. However, this does not provide a direct comparison with 2019. For a more detailed analysis, we refer to image5, which shows the breakdown of assets and liabilities by fair value hierarchy levels.\n\nFrom image5, we can see that:\n- Money market funds decreased from $1,213 million in 2019 to $886 million in 2020.\n- Corporate obligations decreased from $1,390 million in 2019 to $663 million in 2020.\n- U.S. government agency and Treasury securities increased from $2,338 million in 2019 to $4,394 million in 2020.\n- Mutual funds decreased from $272 million in 2019 to $18 million in 2020.\n- Deferred compensation increased from $298 million in 2019 to $350 million in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the balance of uncertain tax positions decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, while the fair value of assets showed mixed changes with some categories increasing and others decreasing.

This can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth**: The revenue for Accenture PLC has also been increasing over the same period. For instance, the revenue in 2018 was $40,992,534, which grew to $43,215,013 in 2019 and further to $44,327,039 in 2020. This growth in revenue is likely a key driver of the increase in net income.\n\n2. **Cost Management**: While the cost of services and other operating expenses have also increased, they have not grown as rapidly as the revenue. For example, the cost of services in 2018 was $28,499,170, which increased to $29,900,325 in 2019 and $30,350,881 in 2020. This indicates that Accenture PLC has managed to control its costs effectively, contributing to the higher net income.\n\nNext, let's look at the comprehensive income:\n- In 2018, the comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC was $3,578,520.\n- In 2019, it increased to $4,514,706.\n- In 2020, it further increased to $5,386,579.\n\nThe comprehensive income has also shown a consistent upward trend. This can be attributed to the following factors:\n\n1. **Net Income**: As mentioned earlier, the net income has been increasing, which is a major component of comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**: The OCI includes items such as foreign currency translation adjustments, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. These items can either increase or decrease the comprehensive income. For example, the foreign currency translation adjustment in 2018 was $(305,225), which improved to $(132,707) in 2019 and further improved to $197,696 in 2020. This improvement in foreign currency translation adjustments has positively impacted the comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC have both increased from 2018 to 2020.

According to [5], there was a significant increase in equity for Siemens Healthineers AG in fiscal year 2021, amounting to €2,641 million. This increase is attributed to various factors including a capital increase in March 2021, which raised subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million. Additionally, the net income for the year contributed to an overall increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million. The dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020 decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million, but this negative effect was more than offset by the net income for the year.\n\n![The total assets increased from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021](image2)\n\nNext, looking at the balance sheet components, image2 shows that the total assets of Siemens Healthineers AG increased from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021. This substantial increase can be attributed to the acquisition of Varian, as mentioned in [3], which contributed revenue of €1,241 million and a net loss of €50 million.

This indicates a significant increase in equity investments.\n\nThe balance sheet in `![image showing the balance sheet for 2021 and 2020](image3)` shows that total assets decreased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, which decreased from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021.\n\n### Changes in Total Liabilities\nThe same balance sheet in `![image showing the balance sheet for 2021 and 2020](image3)` also shows that total liabilities decreased from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021.

The graph in image2 shows the historical performance of Amgen (AMGN), the Amex Biotech Index (BTK), the Amex Pharmaceutical Index (DRG), and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) from 2015 to 2020. We can see that Amgen's stock price has generally increased over this period, outperforming the Amex Biotech Index and the Amex Pharmaceutical Index but underperforming the S&P 500 Index. This is further supported by the data in image4, which provides specific values for each index at the end of each year from 2015 to 2020. For instance, while Amgen's stock value increased from $100.00 to $162.76, the S&P 500 Index increased from $100.00 to $203.12 over the same period.\n\nNext, let's look at the trends in stock repurchase activities. According to text quote [7], Amgen repurchased significant amounts of its common stock through its Directors' program, with amounts varying from $3.0 billion to $17.9 billion across different years. The table in image5 provides more detailed information on the number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share during the last quarter of 2020. It shows that Amgen actively engaged in stock repurchases throughout the year, with a total of 15,190,194 shares purchased at an average price of $230.24 per share.\n\nIn summary, while Amgen's stock return was positive and showed growth from 2015 to 2020, it did not match the performance of the S&P 500 Index. Additionally, Amgen demonstrated a consistent trend of stock repurchases, indicating a strategy to return capital to shareholders and potentially boost stock prices.\n![Amgen's stock price has shown a steady increase from 2015 to 2020, outperforming the Amex Biotech and Pharmaceutical indices but trailing the S&P 500.](image2)"}

This statement shows the cash inflows and outflows from the company's primary operations.\n\nLet's look at the specific figures:\n\n- **Net Income**: From image3, we see that the net income for 2020 is $7,175 million, for 2019 it is $7,353 million, and for 2018 it is $12,559 million.\n- **Comprehensive Income Attributable to PepsiCo**: From image1, we see that the comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo for 2020 is $5,944 million, for 2019 it is $8,133 million, and for 2018 it is $10,453 million.\n- **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities**: From image3, we see that the net cash provided by operating activities for 2020 is $10,613 million, for 2019 it is $9,649 million, and for 2018 it is $9,415 million.\n\nBy comparing these figures, we can see that the net cash provided by operating activities was higher than the net income in all three years.

The total RWA increased from $445,151 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020 [3]. This increase was driven by changes in credit risk RWA, market risk RWA, and operational risk RWA. Specifically, credit risk RWA increased by $7,985 million, market risk RWA remained constant, and operational risk RWA decreased by $7,791 million [3].\n\nNext, let's look at the changes in External TLAC. The External TLAC increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020 [5]. This increase is likely due to an increase in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital, which are components of External TLAC [1].\n\nNow, let's calculate the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA for both years. In 2019, the ratio was 44.2% ($196,888 million / $445,151 million), and in 2020, the ratio was 47.7% ($216,129 million / $453,106 million) [5].\n\nTherefore, the increase in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 can be attributed to both the increase in External TLAC and the relatively smaller increase in RWA.\n![The External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 44.2% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image5)"}

Additionally, the company provided significant support for marketing and recovery efforts, including free meals for first responders and healthcare workers, which affected margins but aimed to drive long-term growth [1][2].\n\n![Revenue changes in U.S. and International Operated Markets](image1)\n\nThe revenue declines were more pronounced in the International Operated Markets segment, driven by countries such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, where performance was mixed due to varying degrees of lockdown measures and consumer behavior changes [3].\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. segment showed resilience with stable revenue despite the pandemic, partly due to positive sales performance and strategic marketing investments [4]. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 on the company's operations and the need for ongoing support measures contributed to the observed changes in revenue composition and growth rates [5].\n\nOverall, the changes in revenue composition and growth rates reflect the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on McDonald's business operations, with the International Operated Markets segment being more severely affected than the U.S. segment.\n\nThe revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

From image2, we can see that the total cost of revenues increased from RMB16,761 million in 2019 to RMB21,840 million in 2021. The service costs, which make up the majority of the cost of revenues, increased from RMB14,967 million in 2019 to RMB18,992 million in 2021.

The 2020 full year dividend was $5.04 per share, with an increase in the fourth quarter to $1.29 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $5.16 per share.

This could indicate a stronger uptake of parental leave among women, possibly due to societal norms or family responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the return rate is slightly lower for female employees (94%) compared to male employees (96%), which might suggest some challenges faced by women in returning to work post-parental leave. These challenges could be related to work-life balance issues or other personal commitments.\n\nIn terms of gender diversity policies, HDFC Bank has implemented several initiatives to support women in the workplace:\n- They have launched a unique endeavor called Careers 2.0, which provides a platform for transitioning back to work for skilled women professionals who had opted for a break due to family/personal reasons [6].\n- They have also introduced policies and processes to enable women employees to manage professional and personal commitments, such as offering flexi work time and part-time work arrangements [10].\n\nThese policies reflect HDFC Bank's commitment to creating an inclusive work environment and supporting women in balancing their career and personal life. The high return rate of female employees after availing parental leave (94%) suggests that these policies are effective in helping women return to work.\n\nOverall, while there are differences in parental leave entitlement and usage between male and female employees, HDFC Bank's gender diversity policies appear to be supportive of women in the workplace, as evidenced by the high return rate of female employees after availing parental leave.\n![image5](image5)"}

Specifically, the notes mention that premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates [7], and that medical costs are a significant component of operating costs [9].\n\nAdditionally, the notes state that the company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology [5]. This suggests that changes in government regulations and reimbursement policies may have impacted the company's financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income both increased significantly from 2018 to 2020. The main factors influencing these changes include premium revenues, medical costs, and operating costs, as well as government regulations and reimbursement policies.\n![image3](image3)"}

From the image, we can see that OCI has fluctuated over the years but has generally contributed positively to comprehensive income. For example, in 2018, OCI was -$1,517 million, in 2019 it was $582 million, and in 2020 it was -$236 million.\n\n3. **Operating Performance**: The operating performance of UnitedHealth Group has been strong, with increasing revenues and earnings from operations.

According to [3], prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and, accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. However, pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax. This charge included taxes for all U.S. income taxes and for the related foreign withholding taxes for the portion of those earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely invested. We have not provided deferred taxes on approximately $22 billion of earnings that are considered indefinitely invested.\n\nNow, let's examine the specific figures from image3. The total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 in 2021 to $4,091 in 2022. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in pension and other retiree benefits from $1,476 to $740, and an increase in valuation allowances from $(569) to $(409).\n\nNext, let's consider the deferred tax liabilities. According to image5, the total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 in 2021 to $9,288 in 2022. This increase is mainly attributed to an increase in goodwill and intangible assets from $5,761 to $5,783, and an increase in other retiree benefits from $645 to $1,031.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the company's financial position can be seen in the consolidated amounts shown in image1. Despite the decrease in deferred tax assets and the increase in deferred tax liabilities, the net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) increased from $14,035 in 2021 to $14,461 in 2022. This suggests that while there were changes in the deferred tax accounts, they did not have a significant negative impact on the company's overall financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the deferred tax assets decreased by $473 million, and the deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 million between 2021 and 2022. These changes reflect adjustments in the company's tax positions and do not appear to have had a material adverse effect on the company's financial position.\n![Deferred tax assets and liabilities changed significantly between 2021 and 2022](image3)"}

I am keen to embrace modern values and beliefs.\"\n\nThis quote suggests a shift towards modern values, which is consistent with the decreasing trend shown in image5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the increase:\n- In 2011, 17% did not believe traditional values were outdated.\n- In 2014, 46% did not believe traditional values were outdated.\n\nThe increase is 46% - 17% = 29 percentage points.\n\nTherefore, the number of respondents who believe traditional values are outdated decreased by 29 percentage points from 2011 to 2014.\n\n![The percentage of respondents who believe traditional values are outdated decreased by 29 percentage points from 2011 to 2014](image5)"}

Instead, they focus on experiences of discrimination and workplace equity among women in STEM jobs.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that computer jobs have a significant gender disparity in terms of discrimination and harassment experiences.

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, focusing on optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [8]. The retriever uses an encoder to process images and text, generating feature embeddings that are stored in a database [3].\n\n2. **Index System**: To enhance the speed of retrieval, especially as the dataset size increases, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented [7]. This system facilitates dimensionality reduction, transforming vectors from a high-dimensional space into a more condensed form, which improves the efficiency of the retrieval process.\n\n3. **Memory Bank**: The memory bank stores the multimodal embeddings created by the retriever. During inference, the top-k class names most similar to the input image are retrieved from this memory bank [1]. The memory bank serves as a repository for the knowledge base that the MLLMs can access to make predictions.\n\n4. **MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models)**: These models rank the retrieved candidate results based on similarity. They combine the internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category [4]. The MLLMs are fine-tuned with ranking format data or in-context learning examples to improve their ranking performance [1].\n\n5. **Prompt**: The prompt merges the input image with the category information retrieved from memory and guides the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories [5]. The prompt format is designed to facilitate the integration of the retrieved information with the MLLMs' internal knowledge.\n\n6. **Pre-processing Steps**: For object detection datasets, additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring are applied to help the MLLMs focus on the objects of interest [3].

The table shows that removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance. More surprisingly, adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance. One possible explanation is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. As another possible reason of this behavior, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names. Many author names are out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT and thus, they might be split into sub-words and shared across names that are not semantically related, leading to noisy correlation. Finally, we find that adding venues slightly decreases performance, except on document classification (which makes sense, as we would expect venues to have high correlation with document topics).\n\n![The inclusion or exclusion of specific features impacts the performance of the SPECTER model](image4)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion or exclusion of specific features such as abstracts, authors, and venues has a significant impact on the performance of the SPECTER model across different tasks."}

Long bladed knives stored in an upright position can be a potential hazard, so they must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket [9].\n\n3. **Item Placement**: Place objects in the dishwasher with their openings facing downwards so that water can run off [5][9]. Curved items or ones with recesses should also be loaded aslant for the same reason [9]. All utensils should be stacked securely and not tip over [9]. Dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other [9].\n\n4. **Cutlery Loading**: Cutlery should be placed in a way that they do not touch each other to avoid damage [9]. Long and/or sharp items of cutlery such as carving knives must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket [9].\n\n5. **Avoid Overloading**: Do not overload your dishwasher as this is important for good results and reasonable consumption of energy [9].\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your dishwasher operates efficiently and provides optimal washing quality.\n\n![Non compliance with the loading can result to poor washing quality.](image3)"}

This means the values given are under controlled conditions and may vary depending on the actual operating conditions and application.\n\nThe image2 provides a table with thermal resistance data for various parts, including the 8051AH and 8751BH. According to this table:\n\n- The 8051AH has a $\\theta_{ja}$ (junction-to-ambient thermal resistance) of $45^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C/W}$ and a $\\theta_{jc}$ (junction-to-case thermal resistance) of $16^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C/W}$.\n- The 8751BH has a $\\theta_{ja}$ of $36^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C/W}$ and a $\\theta_{jc}$ of $12^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C/W}$.\n\nBy comparing these values, we can see that the 8751BH has lower thermal resistance than the 8051AH, indicating better heat dissipation capabilities.\n\nTherefore, the difference in thermal resistance between the 8051AH and 8751BH parts is that the 8751BH has lower thermal resistance, which means it dissipates heat more efficiently than the 8051AH.

The bar chart in image4 shows a comparison of various security concerns for these two years. For instance, the concern over 'Internal Breach of Security' increased from 51% in 2005 to 56% in 2006, indicating a growing awareness or incidence of internal security breaches. Similarly, 'HIPAA Compliance' saw an increase from 18% to 35%, suggesting a heightened focus on regulatory compliance. On the other hand, 'External Breach of Security' decreased slightly from 25% to 12%, which might imply improved external security measures or a shift in perceived threat vectors.\n\n![The top security concerns include internal breach of security, inadequate business continuity/disaster recovery, and HIPAA compliance.](image4)\n\nNext, looking at the implementation of security tools, image3 provides insights into both current and projected future usage. For example, 'Firewalls' are nearly universally implemented today at 98%, with a slight decrease projected for two years later at 53%. This could suggest that while firewalls remain critical, there may be a shift towards more advanced or integrated security solutions. 'User Access Controls' and 'Audit Logs' also show high current implementation rates (88% and 85% respectively) with no change expected in two years, indicating these are considered foundational and continuously necessary security practices.\n\n![Firewalls, user access controls, and audit logs are widely implemented currently and expected to remain so in the future.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the data indicates an evolving landscape of security concerns and implementations in the realm of computerized medical information, with a notable increase in focus on internal breaches and regulatory compliance, alongside a robust foundation of basic security tools that are expected to persist in their importance.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: There has been an increase in concerns over internal breaches and HIPAA compliance, while external breaches have become less of a concern. Firewalls, user access controls, and audit logs remain highly implemented and are expected to continue being crucial in the future."}

The data shows that the top security concern in both years is \"Internal Breach of Security,\" with a slight increase from 51% in 2005 to 56% in 2006 [4]. This indicates a growing awareness of internal threats within healthcare organizations.\n\nNext, we can examine the implementation of security tools from 2005 to 2006. The chart reveals that the use of \"Firewalls\" has increased significantly, from 53% in 2005 to 98% in 2006 [2]. This suggests that healthcare organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of firewalls in protecting their networks.\n\nFor future trends in security tools, the chart predicts that \"Firewalls\" will continue to be widely used, with 98% of organizations expected to implement them in the next two years [2]. Additionally, \"User Access Controls\" and \"Audit Logs\" are also expected to see increased adoption, with 88% and 85% of organizations planning to implement them, respectively [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of security concerns have shifted slightly, with a growing focus on internal breaches.

The law of similarity [4] suggests that objects that are similar in shape and color are perceived as belonging to part of a group. In this case, the pie charts for 2005 and 2010 are visually similar, which helps us perceive the changes over time more easily.\n\nThe law of proximity [6] states that we tend to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group. In image3, the pie charts for 2005 and 2010 are placed close to each other, which helps us compare the data more effectively.\n\nThe law of closure [7] implies that we tend to perceive objects as being whole when they are not complete. In image3, the pie charts are complete circles, which helps us understand the total time spent on various activities.\n\nBased on these principles, we can conclude that the increase in time spent on watching films and the constant time spent on fitness activities suggest a trend towards more sedentary activities during the period from 2005 to 2010.\n\n![The time spent on watching films increased from 20% in 2005 to 22% in 2010, while the time spent on fitness activities remained constant at 5%.](image3)\n\nTherefore, the time spent on watching films increased from 20% in 2005 to 22% in 2010, while the time spent on fitness activities remained constant at 5%, suggesting a trend towards more sedentary activities during that period."}

According to [4], the 875 x BH can be programmed using a lower Vpp (12.75 volts) compared to other devices which use 21 volts. This indicates a difference in power supply requirements between the 875 x BH and other devices.\n\nNext, let's look at the timing parameters. The table in image2 provides timing parameters for different oscillators. For the 8751H, the ALE Low to PSEN Low timing parameter is 58 ns, whereas for all others, it ranges from 3TCLCL - 25 to 4TCLCL - 100 ns. This shows a specific timing requirement for the 8751H that differs from other devices.\n\nAdditionally, the table in image4 gives information on input and output voltages. For the 8751H, the Input High Voltage (Except XTAL2, RST) is 2.0V to VCC + 0.5V, while for the 8751BH/8752BH, it is 2.5V to VCC + 0.5V. This highlights another difference in specifications between the 8751H and other devices.\n\nIn summary, the 8751H microcontroller has distinct power supply current and timing parameters compared to other devices, as evidenced by the data in the provided tables.\n![The 8751H microcontroller has a lower Vpp requirement and specific timing parameters.]"}

Avoid placing heavy objects on or standing on the door when it is open, as this could cause the appliance to tip forward [9].\n\n- **Dishes**: Load hollow items such as cups, glasses, pans, etc., with the opening facing downwards so that water cannot collect in the container or a deep base. Dishes and items of cutlery must not lie inside one another or cover each other. To avoid damage, glasses should not touch one another. The upper basket is designed to hold more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups [10].\n\n- **Potential Consequences of Improper Loading**: Improper loading can lead to poor wash performance, damage to the dishwasher, and potential safety hazards. For example, if sharp items are not properly located, they may damage the door seal. Additionally, if the dishwasher is overloaded, it can result in unreasonable consumption of energy and may not clean the dishes effectively [9].\n\n![The upper basket is designed for holding more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups](image1)\n\nIn summary, proper loading ensures efficient cleaning and prevents damage to both the dishwasher and the dishes."}

Quote [2] provides specific details about the voltage required for programming: \"Vpp must be $12.75 \\pm 0.25$ Volts.\" This indicates that the programming voltage (Vpp) should be within a range centered around 12.75 volts.\n\nNext, we look at the image quotes for visual confirmation. Image3 shows the timing diagram for ALE/PROG pulses during programming. The waveform at the bottom left corner of this figure represents the ALE/PROG signal. According to the diagram, the ALE/PROG signal is pulsed low for 100 microseconds with a minimum pulse width of 10 microseconds. However, the voltage level is not explicitly stated in the image.\n\nTo find the voltage level, we refer back to the text. Quote [8] specifies that \"The voltage on the $\\overline{\\mathrm{EA}} / \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$ pin must be at the valid $\\overline{\\mathrm{EA}} / \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$ high level before a verify is attempted.\" This suggests that the ALE/PROG signal, which is tied to EA/Vpp, must be at a high level for verification. Given that Vpp is set to 12.75 volts during programming, it is reasonable to infer that the high level for ALE/PROG would also be around this value.\n\nTherefore, combining the information from the text and the image, we can conclude that the minimum voltage of the symbol at the bottom left corner in the Figure of EPROM programming and verification waveforms is approximately 12.5 volts.\n\n![The ALE/PROG signal is pulsed low for 100 microseconds with a minimum pulse width of 10 microseconds](image3)\n\nThe minimum voltage of the symbol at the bottom left corner in the Figure of EPROM programming and verification waveforms is 12.5."}

The image shows a bar chart comparing the results from 2005 and 2006 for various factors that could be considered barriers to IT implementation. We can see that \"Internal Breach of Security\" increased from 51% in 2005 to 56% in 2006, indicating a growing concern about internal security breaches. Similarly, \"Inadequate Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery\" also increased from 39% in 2005 to 47% in 2006, suggesting an increased awareness of the importance of having robust disaster recovery plans. Other factors such as \"Limits of Existing Technology,\" \"HIPAA Compliance,\" and \"Connecting IT at Hospital and Remote Facilities\" also showed increases, indicating that these are becoming more significant barriers over time.\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in security concerns. The same image provides data on security concerns from 2005 to 2006. We can see that \"Internal Breach of Security\" remains the top concern, with a slight increase from 51% in 2005 to 56% in 2006. \"Inadequate Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery\" is the second most significant concern, increasing from 39% in 2005 to 47% in 2006. Other concerns such as \"Limits of Existing Technology,\" \"HIPAA Compliance,\" and \"Connecting IT at Hospital and Remote Facilities\" also show increases, reflecting the growing complexity and challenges in healthcare IT security.\n\nFinally, let's consider the expected implementation of security measures in the coming years. The image shows a bar chart comparing the current implementation status with the expected implementation status in two years for various security measures. We can see that \"Firewalls\" are already widely implemented (98%) and are expected to remain so. \"User Access Controls\" and \"Audit Logs\" are also highly implemented (88% and 85%, respectively) and are expected to remain important. Other measures such as \"Multi-Level Passcodes,\" \"Off-Site Storage,\" \"Electronic Signature,\" \"Data Encryption,\" and \"Disaster Recovery\" are also expected to see increased implementation, reflecting the growing emphasis on comprehensive security strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceived barriers to IT implementation and security concerns in healthcare organizations have increased from 2005 to 2006, particularly in areas such as internal security breaches and disaster recovery. Additionally, there is an expectation for increased implementation of various security measures in the coming years to address these concerns.\n![Internal breach of security is the top concern](image2)"}
