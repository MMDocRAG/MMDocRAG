The primary means of listening to the radio is through a radio set (76%), followed by mobile phones (40%) ![Most people listen to the radio via a radio set, followed by mobile phones.](image4).  Interestingly, mobile phone usage for radio listening is higher in urban areas (49%) compared to rural areas (39%) [4], potentially due to better network coverage and smartphone penetration. The frequency of listening to the radio also varies, with 46% of respondents never listening to the radio [5].\n\nOutside the home, 68% of people do not use any listed technologies, while 20% use mobile phones [7]. This suggests that mobile phones are the primary means of accessing technology outside the household, which could include streaming radio or podcasts [7].  Furthermore, computer usage is more prevalent inside the household (10%) compared to outside (4%) [3, 7], implying that computers are less likely to be used for on-the-go radio listening.  The data suggests that while traditional radio sets are common within households, mobile phones play a significant role in radio access outside the home, especially in urban areas.\n\nTechnology usage within the household differs greatly from outside the household, with mobile phones being the dominant technology used outside the home, influencing radio listening habits differently across demographics.\n"}

Using only 1% of the training data diminishes the quality of generations, while increasing the training data to 10% or 50% improves performance [7]. Training with the full dataset yields the best results, particularly when combined with pre-trained weights ![The table shows how different percentages of training data impact model performance metrics like perplexity and BLEU scores.](image8). The model's ability to generate novel tuples, with a substantial percentage not present in the training set, demonstrates its capacity to extend knowledge graphs [2]. The quality of generated knowledge is high, as indicated by low perplexity scores and high classifier scores, further confirmed by human evaluations deeming a large portion of generated tuples as correct [1].\n\nThe effect of different generation policies on knowledge quality reveals that greedy decoding, despite its simplicity, approaches human performance with only a 10% relative performance gap compared to human evaluation [5]. Fine-tuning the model and using techniques like pre-training also lead to significant improvements in performance, highlighting the importance of leveraging pre-existing knowledge for commonsense reasoning [4]. The model's ability to generate novel and high-quality knowledge makes it a promising alternative to extractive methods for automatic commonsense KB completion [9]. COMET excels in generating more novel tuple objects compared to baseline models, showing consistent improvements across various relation types [8]. BLEU-2 results also confirm that COMET exceeds the performance of all baselines, achieving a substantial relative improvement [11]. Ultimately, COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, approaching human performance for these resources [9].\n\nIn summary, the COMET model's performance is influenced by the decoding method, the amount of training data, and the use of pre-trained weights, with greedy decoding offering a strong automated approach and full training datasets yielding the best results, but human validation still outperforming automated methods in generating commonsense inferences.\n"}

Open vocabulary models, such as char-only, word+char, and word-piece models, treat each unique combination of characters differently, making the pass-through version more sensitive than the background variant because it passes words as they are [6]. However, word-only models, which are closed vocabulary, render all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) character combinations identically, making pass-through less sensitive [6].\n\n![The image consists of two scatter plots, each representing the relationship between sensitivity and word error rate (WER) for two types of models: word-only models (left plot) and char-only models (right plot).](image3)\n\nFigure 2 visualizes the trade-off between WER and sensitivity, showing that a lower error rate often increases sensitivity [12]. The neutral backoff variant generally exhibits the lowest sensitivity because it maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, reducing the number of unique outputs [3, 8].  The hybrid model architecture, combining background and foreground models, addresses rare and unseen words, impacting WER and sensitivity [4].\n\n![The image illustrates a diagram representing a hybrid model combining two components: a \"Background Model\" and a \"Foreground Model\".](image1)\n\nThe background model backoff strategy generally achieves a lower WER but does not consistently translate to robustness in all settings [3, 10].  The pass-through strategy can be more sensitive, especially in open vocabulary models, as each unique character combination is considered differently [6]. In summary, closed vocabulary models generally have lower sensitivity, especially with neutral backoff, while open vocabulary models can have higher sensitivity, particularly with pass-through strategies; WER is often reduced by using background models, but this does not guarantee robustness [6, 8, 12].\n\nTherefore, sensitivity and word error rate exhibit different behaviors based on vocabulary type and backoff strategy, with closed vocabularies and neutral backoff generally reducing sensitivity, while open vocabularies and pass-through strategies can increase it.\n"}

The gains from pre-training are more pronounced when the baseline system's performance is poor but not excessively so, typically with a BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [11]. This suggests that a moderately effective system is needed for pre-training to take effect, but once the basic language characteristics are captured, pre-training becomes highly effective [11].\n\nFor instance, the table shows the dataset sizes for various language pairs translating into English ![The table shows the dataset sizes for various language pairs translating into English](image6). When pre-trained embeddings are applied, the gains in each translation pair tend to align with their similarity, with Galician/Portuguese (GL/PT) showing the most significant gains [10]. However, Belarusian/Russian (BE/RU) shows a small decrease [10].\n\nThe BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT generally support this hypothesis ![The table presents data related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family](image2). Languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), which are more distinct, experience larger accuracy gains compared to their more similar counterparts, French (FR) and Italian (IT) [9].  The plots indicate that pre-training is more effective with smaller training sets; the gain decreases as the training set size increases ![The line graphs demonstrate how training set size affects BLEU scores, with pre-training showing more benefit with smaller datasets](image7).\n\nPre-training also aids in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating more grammatically well-formed sentences [1].  The best system translates names and multi-word phrases successfully, showcasing the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in representing less frequent concepts when working with low-resource languages [1]. For example, pre-training allows the model to translate \"chris\", \"big lawyer\", and \"patent legislation\" [1].\n\nIn multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder between multiple languages, pre-training ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are placed into similar vector spaces. This helps the model learn similarly to how it would if training on a single language [10]. The table highlights the effects of pre-training on multilingual translation into English ![The table displays the impact of pre-training on multilingual translation into English, showing results for standard and pre-trained models across different language pairs](image3).

The \"adaptive filter-then-rerank\" approach uses SLMs to make preliminary decisions, forwarding only the hard samples to LLMs for reranking, thereby optimizing both performance and cost [5].\n\n![The image shows a text box with instructions to identify the entity type of \"The New Yorker.\" It includes the sentence:](image5)\n\nThe effectiveness of LLM reranking is confirmed by the performance gains achieved across different datasets. For example, InstructGPT with reranking provides an average F1 gain of 2.4% without SLM ensemble [9]. This improvement is particularly notable on hard samples, where reranking leads to substantial performance boosts [10, 11]. The selective reranking of hard samples by LLMs significantly enhances overall performance, as LLMs can effectively complement SLMs [6, 7].\n\n![The table displays performance metrics for three datasets: FewNERD, TACREV, and ACE05.

These sensors, such as the Engine Temperature Sensor, Intake Air Temperature Sensor, Mass Air Flow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, HEGO Sensor, Crankshaft Sensor, and Camshaft Sensor, provide input to the ECU, which it uses to monitor engine operating conditions [9]. The ECU then controls the opening of the injectors to manage fuel injection [3]. As shown in the fuel injection system block diagram, the \"DETECTING SYSTEM\" sends signals to the \"CONTROL SYSTEM\", which then manages the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM\" [image2].\n\nThe ECU determines the quantity of fuel to inject based on parameters such as throttle pedal position and engine temperature [4]. The ECU also adjusts the ignition timing to optimize power and economy [5]. Furthermore, the ECU manages idle speed by monitoring engine RPM via the crankshaft position sensor and controlling a programmable throttle stop or idle air bypass control step per motor [6].\n\nIn summary, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) monitors engine conditions, controls fuel injection, manages ignition timing, and regulates idle speed to ensure optimal engine performance.\n"}
