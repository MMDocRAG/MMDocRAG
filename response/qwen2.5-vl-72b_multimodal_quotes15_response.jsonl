According to [7], a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning voters consistently favored a more conservative direction for their party over the years. This is visually supported by ![{Republican voters have consistently preferred a more conservative direction}](image5), which shows that around 60% of Republican voters wanted the party to move in a conservative direction each year from 2008 to 2016.

[9] indicates that Democrats are now more divided over whether their party should move in a liberal or moderate direction. This shift is clearly illustrated in ![{Democratic voters increasingly favor a more liberal direction}](image3). In 2008, only about a third of Democratic voters wanted the party to move left, but by 2016, nearly half (49%) preferred a more liberal stance.

As noted in [6] and [8], there is a stark partisan divide. Republicans are significantly more likely to believe that Islam encourages violence more than other religions, with 68% holding this view, which is a historical high but little changed since last fall. In contrast, only 30% of Democrats share this belief, down from 42% in September 2014. This widening gap is also reflected in ![{Partisan differences in perceptions of Islam encouraging violence}](image5), where the lines representing Republicans and Democrats diverge sharply over time.\n\nFurthermore, ideological divides are even starker, as mentioned in [7]. About three-quarters (77%) of conservative Republicans believe that Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, whereas liberal Democratic opinion is nearly the inverse, with 73% saying Islam is no more likely to encourage violence. \n\nAge also factors into these perceptions, as stated in [2].

According to [3], 53% of Americans express at least some confidence in this area. This is a mixed view, as 46% have little or no confidence. The partisan divide is significant here; [4] indicates that three-quarters of Republicans have confidence in Trump's economic decision-making, while only a quarter of Democrats share this sentiment.\n\nNow, let's look at the perception of Trump's ethical standards. [2] states that just 41% of Americans believe the GOP has high ethical standards, and a nearly identical 42% say the same about the Democratic Party. This suggests a general skepticism towards the ethical standards of both parties. Further, [8] reveals that while only 15% of conservative Republicans have negative views of the ethical standards of Trump administration officials, about a third (36%) of moderate and liberal Republicans do not view them favorably.\n\nThe image ![Views on Trump's ethical standards are deeply divided between Republicans and Democrats](image1) shows a stark contrast in views on Trump's ethical standards. While 75% of Republicans give high marks, 86% of Democrats rate it negatively. This deep partisan divide is also reflected in the text quotes.\n\nComparing these two aspects, it appears that while there is a mixed but slightly positive view of Trump's economic policy, the perception of his ethical standards is more polarized. Republicans tend to have a more favorable view of both, whereas Democrats are largely critical of both, but especially of his ethical standards.\n\nIn conclusion, views on Trump's handling of economic policy are mixed but lean positive overall, while perceptions of his ethical standards are highly polarized along party lines, with Republicans being much more favorable than Democrats."}

The higher level of surprise among Clinton voters suggests they had greater confidence in Clinton's chances of winning.\n\nFurthermore, the words used to describe their reactions further illustrate this divide.

According to [2], Americans' ratings of the government's anti-terrorism efforts are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 attacks, with more people saying the government is doing not too well or not at all well (52%) compared to those who say it is doing very or fairly well (46%). This negative trend is evident across the political spectrum, as shown in ![{Assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism have become more negative across the political spectrum}](image4). Republicans, in particular, have seen a sharp drop in positive ratings, from 63% in January to just 27% by the end of the year.\n\nThe shift in public opinion is also reflected in concerns about the extent of anti-terrorism policies. As noted in [4] and illustrated in ![{Concerns that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough have increased among both Republicans and Democrats}](image3), there has been a significant increase in the proportion of Republicans who believe these policies do not go far enough to protect the country, rising from 38% in July 2013 to 71% by the end of 2015. This sentiment is shared by a majority of Americans, with 56% now expressing concern that policies have not gone far enough, according to [10].\n\nPerceptions of government efforts also vary by age group.

This is reflected in image2, which shows that among those aged 18-29, 43% believe policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties while 44% think they haven't gone far enough to protect the US. In contrast, older age groups prioritize security over civil liberties, with 71% of those 65 and older believing policies haven't gone far enough to protect the country [3]. Image2 also supports this, showing that only 15% of those 65+ think policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties compared to 71% who think they haven't gone far enough.\n\nPolitical ideology plays a crucial role as well. Democrats are now the only partisan group where a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 85% in January [7]. This trend is illustrated in image1, which shows a decline in positive ratings for government efforts among Democrats under Obama's presidency. Republicans' positive ratings have dropped significantly, with just 27% now saying the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [7].

Concerns over government restrictions on civil liberties have fallen dramatically since July 2013, following Edward Snowden’s leaked details about NSA surveillance programs [8].

According to [4], among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat, while only 42% say it is. In contrast, younger adults (18-29 years old) are more positive: 53% give the government’s performance a negative rating, while 46% say it is doing very or fairly well.\n\nThis data is further supported by image4, which shows that for the 18-29 age group, 53% believe the government is doing \"Very/Fairly well,\" whereas for the 65+ age group, only 40% share this view. This indicates a clear generational divide in the perception of the government's effectiveness in combating terrorism.\n\nNext, let's consider the views on whether anti-terror policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties or not far enough to protect the country. [10] states that adults under 30 are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%). Majorities in every other age group are more concerned about security than civil liberties, with this concern being most pronounced among those 65 and older (71%).\n\nImage5 corroborates this information, showing that for the 18-29 age group, 43% believe policies restrict civil liberties too much, compared to 44% who think they don't go far enough. However, for the 65+ age group, only 15% worry about civil liberties, while 71% feel policies are insufficient for protection.\n\nIn summary, younger Americans tend to be more critical of the government's performance in reducing the terrorist threat but are also more concerned about civil liberties. Older Americans, on the other hand, are less satisfied with the government's efforts and prioritize security over civil liberties. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nDifferent age groups perceive the government's performance in reducing the terrorist threat differently, with younger Americans being more critical but concerned about civil liberties, while older Americans prioritize security over civil liberties.\n![{The Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, has seen a significant increase in concern from 67% in August 2014 to 83% in December 2015}](image1)"}

This is further supported by ![{Younger adults are more divided in their concerns compared to older age groups}](image4), which shows that those aged 18-29 have a near-equal distribution of concerns. In contrast, majorities in every other age group prioritize security over civil liberties, with this preference being most pronounced among those aged 65 and older (71%).\n\nComparing opinions across political affiliations, [4] indicates that both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to believe that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough since Snowden’s disclosures.

In the U.S., there has been a notable decline in the percentage of people who believe European allies should increase their defense budgets. Specifically, [4] mentions that in 2017, 45% of Americans felt their allies in Europe should dedicate more resources to national defense, but by 2019, this number had dropped significantly. This trend is visually represented in ![{Americans' support for increased European defense spending decreased from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019}](image1). \n\nIn Germany, the public opinion is divided between increasing or maintaining current levels of defense spending. According to [10], about four-in-ten Germans took each view in 2019. The data also shows a change since 2017 when about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending while about a third felt it should be increased. This evolution is illustrated in ![{Germans' support for increased defense spending rose from 32% in 2017 to 40% in 2019}](image1).\n\nPartisan differences are evident within both countries. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe, as stated in [3]. However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019. This partisan gap is further highlighted in ![{Republican support for increased European defense spending fell from 62% in 2017 to 48% in 2019}](image3).\n\nIn Germany, supporters of the CDU/CSU are on balance in favor of defense spending increases, whereas supporters of the Greens express more skepticism, with only 28% saying they want to raise defense spending, as mentioned in [9]. This partisan divide is depicted in ![{CDU/CSU supporters are most in favor of increased defense spending at 51%, compared to 28% of Green party supporters}](image5).\n\nIn conclusion, American and German views on national defense spending have evolved differently from 2017 to 2019, with Americans becoming less supportive of increased European defense spending and Germans remaining divided but slightly more inclined towards an increase. Partisan differences play a significant role in shaping these opinions within both countries."}

These concerns align with the broader context provided by ![{Limiting China's influence is a significant priority}](image1), which shows that limiting the power and influence of China is a major priority for many Americans.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some confidence in Biden's handling of China-related issues, it is lower than for other foreign policy areas and varies widely by demographics. The primary concerns Americans have regarding China revolve around cyber security, job losses, military power, and human rights violations."}

According to [10], older adults have a unique preference for tablets and e-book readers over smartphones. This is further supported by ![{Seniors prefer tablets/e-readers over smartphones}](image1), which shows that 27% of seniors own a tablet or e-reader compared to only 18% owning a smartphone. This trend contrasts with the general adult population, where smartphones are more popular.\n\nNext, let's look at online social networking usage. [4] indicates that 27% of online seniors use social networking sites like Facebook. This aligns with ![{27% of seniors use SNS, while 32% go online but don't use SNS}](image2), which shows that 27% of seniors use social networking sites (SNS). These users tend to have more persistent social connections, suggesting that despite lower overall internet usage, those who do engage in social networking are quite active.\n\nWhen comparing these two aspects, it becomes clear that while seniors may not be as inclined towards smartphones, they still find ways to stay connected through other devices like tablets and e-readers. Their social networking habits reflect a desire to maintain social connections, even if the methods differ from younger demographics.\n\nIn conclusion, device ownership trends among seniors favor tablets and e-book readers over smartphones, while their online social networking usage is relatively high among those who are online, indicating a strong inclination towards maintaining social connections."}

This trend is visually represented in ![{The graph shows a steady increase in internet usage for both all adults and those aged 65+ over time, with the 65+ group consistently trailing behind}](image4). The data indicates that while internet usage has risen from 35% in 2008 to 59% in 2013 for seniors, it still lags behind the 86% usage rate of all U.S. adults.\n\nWhen examining specific subgroups within the senior population, disparities become more apparent. For instance, younger seniors (ages 65-69) have higher adoption rates compared to older seniors (ages 80+). As shown in ![{The table illustrates that younger seniors (65-69) have significantly higher rates of going online (74%) and having broadband at home (65%) compared to older seniors (80+) who have lower rates (37% and 21%, respectively)}](image5), 74% of seniors aged 65-69 go online, whereas only 37% of those aged 80+ do so. Similarly, broadband adoption drops off dramatically around age 75, as mentioned in [3].\n\nEducation also plays a crucial role in internet and broadband adoption. College graduates exhibit much higher adoption rates than those with less education. In ![{The table highlights that college graduates have substantially higher rates of going online (87%) and having broadband at home (76%) compared to those with a high school degree or less (40% and 27%, respectively)}](image5), 87% of college graduates go online, compared to just 40% of those with a high school degree or less. This aligns with [1] and [8], which state that affluent and well-educated seniors adopt the internet and broadband at substantially higher rates.\n\nIncome level further influences adoption rates. Higher-income households tend to have greater access to the internet and broadband. As seen in ![{The table demonstrates that seniors in higher-income households ($75,000+) have significantly higher rates of going online (90%) and having broadband at home (82%) compared to those in lower-income households (<$30,000) who have lower rates (39% and 25%, respectively)}](image5), 90% of seniors in households earning $75,000+ go online, while only 39% of those in households earning less than $30,000 do so. This supports [10], which notes that seniors with low household incomes are much more removed from online life.\n\nIn conclusion, internet and broadband adoption rates among older adults vary significantly based on age, education, and income, with younger, more educated, and higher-income seniors adopting these technologies at rates closer to the general adult population. However, overall adoption rates among seniors still trail behind the general population."}

In contrast, for those earning less than $30,000 annually, only 39% go online and 25% have broadband at home. This trend is also reflected in ![{Seniors' internet and broadband adoption varies by age, education, and income}](image3), which shows a clear correlation between higher income and education levels and greater internet and broadband usage.\n\nSimilarly, the adoption of cell phones and smartphones follows a similar pattern. According to [4], 77% of seniors are now cell phone owners, but smartphone adoption is much lower at 18%. The data in ![{Cell phone and smartphone ownership among seniors varies by age, education, and income}](image5) further illustrates this point. For example, while 92% of seniors with a household income of $75,000+ own a cell phone, only 42% own a smartphone. Conversely, among seniors with a household income of less than $30,000, 67% own a cell phone, but only 8% own a smartphone.\n\nIn summary, internet, broadband, cell phone, and smartphone adoption rates among seniors are positively correlated with higher income and education levels. Seniors with higher incomes and more education are more likely to adopt these technologies compared to their counterparts with lower incomes and less education."}

Similarly, broadband adoption follows this trend, with 76% of college graduates and 82% of high-income seniors having broadband at home, while only 27% of high school graduates or less and 25% of low-income seniors do.\n\nSmartphone ownership also varies significantly. Only 18% of all seniors own a smartphone, but this rate increases to 35% for college graduates and 42% for high-income seniors ![{Higher education and income correlate with greater smartphone ownership}](image4). In contrast, just 10% of high school graduates or less and 8% of low-income seniors own a smartphone. This indicates that while smartphones are becoming more common among some older adults, they remain rare within the broader 65-and-older population [5].\n\nOverall, these trends align with national device ownership patterns. Nationally, tablets and e-book readers are most popular among college graduates and higher-income Americans, and this is true among seniors as well [7]. The image further illustrates that college graduates and high-income seniors are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as are seniors who have not attended college ![{Education and income influence e-book reader and tablet ownership}](image1).\n\nIn summary, internet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults vary considerably by income and education, with affluent and well-educated seniors adopting these technologies at much higher rates than their less advantaged peers.

[7] states that fully 77% of seniors are now cell phone owners, but smartphones remain rare within the 65-and-older population. The image ![{Cell phone and smartphone ownership among seniors varies by age, education, and income}](image2) provides a detailed breakdown. It shows that while cell phone ownership is relatively high across all groups, smartphone ownership is significantly lower, especially among older seniors and those with lower education and income levels. For instance, only 5% of seniors aged 80+ own a smartphone, and this rate increases with higher education and income levels.\n\nComparing these two sets of data, it is clear that while a majority of seniors own cell phones, internet and broadband adoption, as well as smartphone ownership, are more closely tied to education and income levels.

This is supported by ![{Most Americans support limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs}](image1), which shows that 85% of Americans favor this type of policy.\n\nEducation levels also play a role in shaping these opinions. According to [10], those with lower levels of educational attainment are far more supportive of limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines. Among those with high school diplomas or less, fully 70% say there should be limits on the number of human jobs that businesses can automate, while that share falls to 41% among those with four-year college degrees.

For example, 47% strongly favor limiting machines to doing dangerous or unhealthy jobs only, indicating a shared concern across party lines about the safety implications of automation.\n\nFurthermore, attitudes towards the government's obligation to take care of workers displaced by automation vary strongly by partisan affiliation. According to [4], 65% of Democrats feel the government has an obligation to help displaced workers, even if it means higher taxes, while 68% of Republicans believe individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-being.

[7] states that 72% of Democrats are at least somewhat confident in the fairness of Mueller’s investigation, whereas 58% of Republicans are not too or not at all confident. This is further illustrated in ![{Democrats have higher confidence in Mueller's investigation compared to Republicans}](image4). The image breaks down the levels of confidence among Republicans and Democrats, showing a much higher percentage of Democrats expressing confidence in the investigation.\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely to perceive Trump as a potentially successful president and less confident in Mueller's investigation, while Democrats hold opposite views. These contrasting perceptions highlight the deep partisan divide in public opinion regarding both Trump's presidency and the Mueller investigation. \n\nTo directly answer the question: Perceptions of Trump's potential success as a president are more positive among Republicans and more negative among Democrats, mirroring their respective levels of confidence in the Mueller investigation."}

The image ![{White Republicans have lower support for easing voting policies compared to Hispanic Republicans}](image4) further illustrates that within the Republican party, White adults are less supportive of policies aimed at easing voting, including potentially opposing measures like voter ID requirements.\n\nAcross all adults, there is strong support for requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification, with 76% in favor, as mentioned in [9]. However, when breaking down these numbers by race, we see that Black adults tend to show among the lowest levels of support for such restrictive policies, as noted in [8].\n\nIn summary, the requirement for government-issued photo identification to vote is more favored by Republicans and certain racial groups within the Democratic party, particularly Hispanic and Asian Democrats, compared to White Democrats and Black Americans overall. \n\nTo directly answer the question: Differences in voting policy preferences related to requiring government-issued photo identification to vote are significant, with higher support among Republicans and specific racial groups within the Democratic party, notably Hispanic and Asian Democrats, compared to White Democrats and Black Americans."}

Further support for this comes from image3, which shows high percentages of \"very concerned\" responses across all surveyed countries, with no significant difference between GCC and Non-GCC nations.\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to unemployment, there is a more pronounced difference. ![{GCC countries have a lower level of concern at 39%, compared to 55% in Non-GCC countries}](image2) reveals that Non-GCC countries exhibit a substantially higher level of worry about joblessness. This disparity may reflect varying economic conditions and labor market dynamics within these two groups of countries. Image4 corroborates this trend, showing that while unemployment remains a significant concern overall, its impact is more acutely felt in Non-GCC states.\n\nThese variations highlight regional differences in priorities. The relatively similar levels of concern about rising living costs suggest a shared challenge that transcends GCC membership. However, the stark difference in unemployment concerns points to distinct economic pressures faced by Non-GCC countries, possibly due to factors like less diversified economies or greater reliance on external labor markets.\n\nIn conclusion, the data reveals that while rising living costs are a widespread issue across the Middle East, unemployment is a more pressing concern for Non-GCC countries, reflecting their unique economic challenges."}

This implies that some existing strategies may not perform as well in terms of label diversity. \n\n[6] further elaborates on this by stating that most active querying strategies are biased towards certain classes, even with a relatively larger initial query budget. For example, VAAL prefers selecting data from specific classes like femur-right and platelet but largely ignores others like lung, liver, and monocyte. The proposed querying strategy, however, selects more data from minority classes while retaining the class distribution of major classes.\n\nThe images provide visual support for these claims. In `![{VAAL shows significant bias towards certain classes}](image1)`, it is evident that VAAL has a strong bias towards specific classes in both OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST datasets. This bias indicates poor label diversity since the selection is not representative of all classes.\n\nIn `![{Data Map comparison between ground truth and pseudo-labels}](image2)`, the Data Maps based on ground truths and pseudo-labels show that the modified Data Map using pseudo-labels can better represent the cluster distribution, which aligns with the idea of improving label diversity.\n\n`![{AUC scores comparison among different querying strategies}](image3)` compares AUC scores of various querying strategies.

Lower entropy could indicate less diversity.

Not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, while passing them only in the decoder results in a minor AP drop. This indicates the importance of spatial positional encodings in maintaining high AP values.\n\n[7] further elaborates on this by discussing various combinations of fixed and learned encodings. The table referenced here shows that output positional encodings are essential and cannot be removed. Removing spatial positional encodings entirely causes a substantial drop in AP, losing 7.8 AP compared to the baseline. However, passing fixed sine spatial positional encodings at input or adding them to queries at every decoder attention layer only leads to minor AP drops.\n\nThe image `![{Different configurations of spatial and output positional encodings and their impact on AP}](image4)` visually represents these findings. It shows that when no spatial positional encodings are used in either the encoder or decoder, the AP drops significantly to 32.8. In contrast, using sine or learned spatial encodings at the attention layers maintains higher AP values, with the best configuration achieving an AP of 40.6.\n\nMoreover, [2] mentions that attention mechanisms in the transformer decoder play a key role in modeling relations between feature representations of different detections. This is supported by the architecture described in [5], which details how positional encodings are passed at every attention layer in the transformer. The image `![{Architecture of DETR showing the flow from backbone to prediction heads}](image5)` illustrates this process, highlighting the integration of positional encodings within the transformer structure.\n\nFinally, [3] and [8] discuss the specialization of each query slot in predicting certain areas and box sizes.

Ambiguity errors may arise when dealing with open-domain knowledge or vague pronouns, which are common challenges in scientific discourse. Calculation errors are associated with numerical reasoning tasks like comparisons, additions, and subtractions. Program errors could result from implementing these reasoning steps incorrectly in Python programs.\n\nIn conclusion, the ScITab dataset encompasses diverse reasoning types with varying proportions, and the distribution of reasoning steps highlights the complexity of the tasks. Common error types further emphasize the challenges posed by these reasoning requirements, particularly in accurately referencing data, handling ambiguous claims, performing calculations, and writing correct programs."}

The results for these settings are presented in Table 4, as mentioned in [2]. Specifically, [7] highlights that closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 perform better than open-source LLMs, achieving macro-$F_{1}$ scores of 64.80 in the 3-class setting.

This demonstrates the effectiveness of Step-Back and RAG in handling complex reasoning tasks.\n\nFinally, for StrategyQA, which has stronger baselines due to its binary classification nature, the baseline performance of PaLM-2L is 82.8%. Again, Step-Back combined with RAG achieves the highest accuracy of 86.4%, as seen in ![{Step-Back + RAG also excels on StrategyQA}](image5).

According to [2], this dataset is inherently imbalanced with 37% positive and 63% negative examples. The study constructs synthetic training sets with varying degrees of imbalance to observe how different objectives perform under these conditions. \n\nThe table in `![{BERT+DSC achieves the highest F1 score across all datasets}](image5)` shows the performance of BERT models with various loss functions (MLE, FL, DL, DSC) on the QQP dataset when subjected to different data augmentation techniques: +positive, +negative, -negative, and a combination of +positive & negative. It is evident that the +positive technique, which balances the dataset by increasing the number of positive examples, generally leads to better performance compared to the original dataset.

For example, on SQuAD v1.1, BERT+DSC achieves 85.34 EM and 91.97 F1, outperforming other configurations.\n\n#### Sentiment Classification\nFor sentiment classification tasks like SST-2 and SST-5, [3] notes that dice loss is not accuracy-oriented. The table in ![{Accuracy comparison of BERT models on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets}](image4) confirms this. On SST-2, BERT+CE achieves the highest accuracy at 94.90, while BERT+DSC slightly underperforms at 94.84.\n\n#### Tversky Index Hyperparameters\n[7] discusses the role of hyperparameters α and β in the Tversky index.

This is further supported by the numerical evidence presented in `![{COMET-RANK shows higher Kendall’s Tau scores compared to BLEU for various language pairs}](image3)`. For instance, in the de-en pair, COMET-RANK achieves a score of 0.202, significantly higher than BLEU's 0.053. Similar trends are observed in other language pairs such as fi-en, lt-en, and zh-en.\n\nMoreover, `![{The graph illustrates the decline in Kendall Tau scores as the number of top models decreases, with BLEU showing a steeper decline compared to COMET-RANK}](image5)` provides a visual representation of how these metrics perform as the number of top models decreases. The red line representing BLEU shows a steeper decline compared to the green line for COMET-RANK, indicating that BLEU's performance drops more sharply when fewer top models are considered. This suggests that COMET-RANK is more robust and consistent in its evaluation across varying numbers of models.\n\nAdditionally, `![{COMET-RANK demonstrates improved performance over BLEU when including source information, especially for non-English target languages}](image1)` reveals that COMET-RANK benefits from incorporating source information, leading to better performance, particularly for non-English target languages. This is evident from the Δτ values, which show a significant improvement when using both reference and source.\n\nIn summary, COMET-RANK generally outperforms BLEU in evaluating translation quality across different language pairs. It exhibits higher Kendall’s Tau scores, greater robustness with fewer top models, and improved performance when source information is included. Therefore, COMET-RANK is a more reliable and effective metric for assessing translation quality compared to BLEU."}

It mentions that fine-tuning CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks including natural language code search and code-to-documentation generation. The authors also formulated the task of NL-PL probing and created a dataset for this purpose.

In the PL probing section, CodeBERT (MLM) shows significantly higher accuracy compared to RoBERTa and PRE-TRAIN w/ CODE ONLY across all programming languages, achieving an overall score of 85.66%. Even when considering only preceding contexts, CodeBERT (MLM) still outperforms the other models, demonstrating its robustness.

Similarly, for non-categorical slots such as train-leave at and train-arrive by, DS-Picklist also demonstrates better performance.\n\nThe reason behind these differences can be attributed to the model design. As mentioned in [1], DS-Picklist assumes a full ontology is available and treats all domain-slot pairs as categorical slots, which allows it to predict values directly from the candidate-value list. This approach is particularly beneficial for slots with varied expressions that cannot be easily extracted from the dialog context, as explained in [3] and [4].\n\nIn conclusion, DS-Picklist generally outperforms DS-DST in terms of both joint accuracy and slot accuracy for various slot categories, especially when a full ontology is accessible."}

The CNN Large model has an average score of 78.6, which is lower than even the smaller BERT_BASE model's score of 79.6.\n\nFurther insights from `![{Performance comparison of cloze, bilm, and cloze + bilm on GLUE benchmark}](image3)` suggest that the training regime also plays a crucial role. While this image doesn't directly compare BERT and CNN models, it shows that combining different training strategies (like cloze and bilm) can enhance performance, hinting at the importance of training methods in achieving high scores.\n\nLastly, `![{GLUE score improvement with increasing training data tokens}](image4)` illustrates that more training data leads to better performance. Although this graph does not differentiate between models, it supports the idea that scaling up training data could potentially close the gap between CNN and BERT models if applied effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, BERT models generally outperform CNN models on the GLUE benchmark, indicating stronger capabilities in handling complex language understanding tasks. This suggests that BERT's bidirectional architecture and pretraining strategy might be more effective for these tasks."}

This is because most connections are between mentions in the same document, and removing these connections eliminates important information. The text also notes that coreference links and complement edges play a more marginal role, with coreference edges being less reliable due to the out-of-domain coreference system. \n\nThe table in ![image1](image1) provides empirical evidence supporting this analysis. When comparing the \"full\" model with other ablated versions, it's clear that removing the R-GCN component significantly reduces performance.

This confirms the importance of the R-GCN component as mentioned in [2].\n\nFurthermore, the table shows that removing relation types (\"No relation types\") results in only marginal improvements over the baseline without R-GCN, indicating that a naive graph structure isn't very beneficial.

These metrics are higher than those of the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model, which suggests that the 'full (ensemble)' model is more effective in capturing the relevant relations and making accurate predictions.\n\nFurthermore, the differences in performance can be attributed to the use of different components in the models.

However, when the subspace dimension $d$ is large, CNN can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy on Yelp P., as shown in the same figure.\n\n[7] highlights that SWEM models exhibit stronger performances relative to both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures on topic prediction tasks. This is consistent with the findings in ![{SWEM outperforms CNN and LSTM on document classification tasks}](image3), where SWEM-aver, SWEM-max, and SWEM-concat achieve comparable or even superior results on sentiment analysis and ontology classification problems.\n\nHowever, [10] notes that SWEM yields inferior accuracies on sentiment analysis datasets compared to CNN/LSTM compositional functions. This is reflected in ![{CNN and LSTM perform better than SWEM on short sentence classification tasks}](image4), where CNN and LSTM achieve higher accuracies on MR, SST-1, and SST-2 datasets.\n\nIn conclusion, SWEM models generally outperform CNN models on long document classification and natural language sequence matching tasks, especially for low subspace dimensions. However, CNN models tend to perform better on short sentence classification and tagging tasks, where word-order features are more important. The choice between SWEM and CNN models should be based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the task at hand."}

Specifically, it mentions that transferring the LSTM layer and embedding layer are more useful than the output layer. This aligns with the findings presented in `![{Transfer effects on accuracy and macro-F1 scores}](image2)`, which shows improvements across datasets D1, D2, D3, and D4 when only the LSTM or embeddings are transferred. For instance, \"LSTM only\" achieves an accuracy of 78.09% on D1, while \"Embeddings only\" reaches 77.12%. These results confirm that these layers contribute significantly to performance gains.\n\nMoreover, [5] discusses the impact of varying the percentage of document-level training examples. The corresponding visualization in `![{Accuracy and macro-F1 scores vs. percentage of document-level training examples}](image3)` illustrates this trend. As the percentage increases, there is a noticeable improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 scores for all datasets. Notably, D3 and D4 show sharp increases in macro-F1 scores when the percentage changes from 0 to 0.4. This suggests that even a small amount of document-level data can greatly enhance performance on datasets with fewer neutral examples, as mentioned in [2].\n\nIn summary, incorporating LSTM and embedding layers from document-level models significantly boosts performance across various datasets. Additionally, increasing the percentage of document-level training examples generally leads to better accuracy and macro-F1 scores, with particularly pronounced effects on datasets with limited neutral examples. \n\nThe inclusion of different components improves performance, and increasing document-level training examples enhances accuracy and macro-F1 scores, especially for datasets with fewer neutral examples."}

This observation is supported by the numerical data in ![{Accuracy and bias metrics for different MT systems across languages}](image2).

This improvement is also reflected in ![{Training on adversarial distractors improves F1 score}](image4), which shows a significant boost in F1 scores when the model is re-trained on adversarial data.\n\nMoreover, filtering by entity type can further enhance performance. As stated in [6], this approach helps eliminate entity type bias, leading to an increase in F1 score from 40.73 to 58.42. The table in ![{Entity type filtering boosts F1 score}](image4) supports this claim, showing a substantial recovery in accuracy after applying such filters.\n\nWhen it comes to multi-hop questions, the challenge lies in ensuring that the evidence provided necessitates multi-hop reasoning. [3] emphasizes that future datasets should carefully design distractors to enforce multi-hop reasoning. Image ![{Examples of multi-hop and context-dependent questions}](image3) illustrates the F1 scores for different types of questions, with multi-hop and context-dependent questions achieving lower scores compared to single-hop questions.

To address this issue, an adversarial dataset was constructed by negating claims and inverting labels for each data point, as illustrated in ![{Adversarial examples are created by negating claims and inverting labels}](image3). This process mirrors the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, effectively eliminating the reliance on these cues.\n\nWhen evaluated on the adversarial test set after being trained and validated on the adversarial data, BERT's performance drops dramatically.

These results align with Table 4: Results for BERT Large on the adversarial test set with adversarial training and validation sets [1]. The significant drop in performance indicates that BERT has not genuinely learned argument comprehension but instead relied heavily on superficial statistical patterns present in the original dataset.\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup successfully eliminates the spurious statistical cues, leading to a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension. The results suggest that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension when these cues are removed, underscoring the importance of controlling for such spurious statistics in evaluating NLP models [7].

The Avg column provides an overall performance metric across different relation types. Greedy decoding demonstrates the highest performance with an average score of 77.53%, closely approaching the human validation score of 86.18%. This indicates that greedy decoding is highly effective in generating high-quality commonsense knowledge. However, it still falls short of human-level performance.\n\nOther decoding methods like beam search and random sampling show lower performance scores. For instance, Beam search - 2 beams achieves an average score of 63.29%, while Top-5 random sampling scores 53.27%. These results suggest that while these methods can generate diverse outputs, they do not match the quality produced by greedy decoding or human evaluators.\n\n### Impact of Training Data Percentages\n\nThe table in ![{Increasing the percentage of training data improves the model's perplexity and novelty metrics}](image3) illustrates how variations in the percentage of training data affect COMET's performance. As the percentage of training data increases from 1% to 50%, there is a noticeable improvement in several metrics:\n\n- **Perplexity (PPL)**: Lower perplexity scores indicate better model confidence. With 1% training data, the PPL is 23.81, which decreases to 11.82 with 50% training data.\n- **BLEU-2**: This metric measures the similarity between generated and reference texts. It increases from 5.08 with 1% training data to 13.97 with 50% training data.\n- **Novelty Metrics (N/T o and N/U o)**: These metrics assess the novelty of generated tuples.

Additionally, increasing the percentage of training data significantly enhances the model's metrics, including perplexity, BLEU-2, and novelty [3].

It shows that while the percentage of novel tuples decreases as edit distance increases, the classifier accuracy remains relatively stable. This implies that COMET can maintain high accuracy even when generating more novel knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, the table in `![Examples of generated commonsense knowledge tuples and their plausibility](image3)` provides concrete examples of the commonsense knowledge generated by COMET. Most of these tuples are deemed plausible, indicating the model's capability to produce meaningful and accurate knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, COMET demonstrates superior performance in terms of both accuracy and novelty compared to other models on the ConceptNet dataset.

The text highlights the importance of handling these cases gracefully, especially in adversarial settings. This aligns with the findings presented in image2, which shows the WER for different backoff strategies across closed and open vocabulary models.\n\nIn image2, we observe that for **closed vocabulary models (word-only)**, the `Neutral` backoff strategy achieves a lower WER compared to `Pass-Through` and `Background`. Specifically, the `Neutral` backoff has a WER of 11.3% for all attacks, while `Pass-Through` and `Background` have higher WERs of 17.6% and 19.5%, respectively. This suggests that the `Neutral` backoff is more effective at reducing errors for closed vocabulary models.\n\nFor **open vocabulary models (char-only, word+char, word-piece)**, the results are different. Here, the `Neutral` backoff again shows a lower WER of 11.3%, but the difference is less pronounced compared to the closed vocabulary models. The `Pass-Through` and `Background` backoffs have WERs of 39.6% and 20.7%, respectively. This indicates that the `Neutral` backoff is still beneficial but may not be as dominant in open vocabulary models.\n\nThe sensitivity aspect is further illustrated in image4. The graph plots WER against sensitivity for different backoff strategies. For closed vocabulary models, the `Neutral` backoff has a lower sensitivity of around 10, while the `Pass-Through` and `Background` backoffs have higher sensitivities of approximately 12 and 13, respectively. This means that the `Neutral` backoff provides fewer opportunities for attackers, contributing to greater robustness.\n\nFor open vocabulary models, the `Neutral` backoff also exhibits lower sensitivity, around 10, compared to the other backoffs. However, the difference is less stark than in closed vocabulary models. The `Pass-Through` and `Background` backoffs show higher sensitivities of about 20 and 30, respectively.\n\nIn summary, the `Neutral` backoff strategy generally leads to lower WER and sensitivity, making it a preferred choice for both closed and open vocabulary models. However, its relative advantage is more pronounced in closed vocabulary models. ![{The Neutral backoff has lower WER and sensitivity for both closed and open vocabulary models, but its advantage is more significant in closed vocabulary models}](image2)\n\nConclusively, the `Neutral` backoff strategy offers a better balance between low WER and sensitivity, particularly for closed vocabulary models."}

In the masked setup, BiDAF achieves 59.8% on WIKIHOP and 42.9% on MEDHOP, whereas FastQA scores 38.0% on WIKIHOP and 30.6% on MEDHOP.

The table in image9 shows that the accumulated amortization for these assets increased significantly from $113 million in 2019 to $162 million in 2020. This higher amortization expense directly reduces the net carrying amount of the intangible assets.\n\nAdditionally, while the gross carrying amount of some assets like \"Developed technology\" and \"Trade names\" remained relatively stable, there were decreases in the gross carrying amount of \"Favorable contracts and leases, net\" and \"Other\" categories. These reductions in the gross carrying amount also contributed to the overall decrease in the net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets.\n\nIn summary, the increase in accumulated amortization and the reduction in the gross carrying amount of certain intangible assets are the primary factors leading to the decline in the net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets from 2019 to 2020. ![{Net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets decreased from $334 million in 2019 to $298 million in 2020}](image9)\n\nTherefore, the net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to increased amortization and reduced gross carrying amounts."}

This risk can significantly impact various financial statements including the statement of comprehensive income. The image3 shows that foreign exchange risk is categorized as \"High,\" confirming its importance. \n\nThe image8 provides specific details on the exchange rate fluctuations for key currencies like USD, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP. For instance, the USD experienced a year-end change of -9.3% in 2020 compared to 2019. These fluctuations directly influence the company's financial results, especially when considering that Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge against these risks ([9]).\n\nImage5 illustrates the immediate impact of a 5% increase or decrease in certain currencies on Novo Nordisk’s other comprehensive income and income statement. In 2020, an immediate 5% increase would result in a negative impact of DKK 1,893 million on other comprehensive income and a positive impact of DKK 299 million on the income statement. Conversely, a 5% decrease would have opposite effects. This demonstrates the sensitivity of Novo Nordisk's financials to exchange rate movements.\n\nFurthermore, image9 shows the development of the reserve related to exchange rate adjustments, cash flow hedges, and tax and other items over the years. In 2020, the total reserve decreased from DKK -694 million at the beginning of the year to DKK -911 million at the end, indicating a net negative adjustment of DKK 217 million. This suggests that despite hedging efforts, there were unfavorable impacts from exchange rate adjustments and cash flow hedges.\n\nIn summary, the changes in exchange rates had a notable impact on Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020. Despite employing hedging strategies, the company faced adverse effects due to significant currency fluctuations, leading to a decrease in the reserve related to exchange rate adjustments and cash flow hedges.\n\n**Conclusion:** The changes in exchange rates negatively impacted Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020, resulting in a decrease in the related reserve."}

This decrease can be attributed to several factors:\n\nFirstly, there was a significant income/(charge) to the income statement, which amounted to DKK -2,883 million for intangible assets. This indicates that the company recognized more deferred tax liabilities than assets during the year, contributing to the overall decrease in the net deferred tax asset/(liability).\n\nSecondly, the income/(charge) to other comprehensive income also played a role, with a charge of DKK -216 million for inventories and DKK -469 million for other countries. These charges further reduced the net deferred tax asset/(liability).\n\nAdditionally, the effect of exchange rate adjustments had a negative impact of DKK -307 million on the total net deferred tax asset/(liability), as seen in ![{Exchange rate adjustments contributed to a decrease of DKK 307 million}](image3).\n\nLastly, the acquisition of subsidiaries added DKK 276 million to the net deferred tax asset/(liability), partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases.\n\nIn conclusion, the main contributing factors to the decrease in the net deferred tax asset/(liability) were the income/(charge) to the income statement, income/(charge) to other comprehensive income, and the effect of exchange rate adjustments."}

According to [9], the Asset management revenues of $3,013 million in 2020 increased by 15% compared with the prior year due to higher average AUM driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows. This is further supported by ![{Total AUM increased significantly from 2018 to 2020}](image2), which shows a clear upward trend in total AUM over these years. Specifically, the total AUM grew from $463 billion in 2018 to $781 billion in 2020, indicating substantial growth in the firm's managed assets.\n\nNext, let's examine the fee rates. The fee rate data presented in ![{Fee rates remained relatively stable for equity but decreased for fixed income and alternative/other categories}](image1) reveals that while the equity fee rate stayed constant at 76 basis points (bps) across all three years, the fee rates for fixed income and alternative/other categories experienced slight declines. For instance, the fixed income fee rate dropped from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020, and the alternative/other fee rate fell from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020. Despite these minor decreases, the overall impact on revenue might be mitigated by the significant increase in AUM.\n\nThe combination of rising AUM and relatively stable or slightly declining fee rates suggests that the firm's asset management revenues likely benefited from the sheer volume of assets under management. As stated in [4], the average fee rate is based on asset management revenues, net of waivers, excluding performance-based fees and other non-management fees. Therefore, even with slight reductions in some fee rates, the substantial growth in AUM would have positively influenced the firm's revenues.\n\nIn conclusion, the firm's revenues were positively impacted by the significant increase in AUM from 2018 to 2020, despite minor declines in certain fee rates."}

This change can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the increase in operating lease liabilities is likely due to new leases taken on during the year. The weighted average remaining lease term remained constant at 7 years, but the total operating lease payments increased significantly from $803 million in 2019 to $1,080 million in 2020, indicating a higher volume of lease commitments. [1] Additionally, the weighted average discount rate decreased from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020, which would result in a higher present value of future lease payments and thus an increase in the recorded lease liability.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's overall financial activities and investments may also influence these changes. For instance, the Company has been actively acquiring intangible assets, as seen in image2, where significant acquisitions were made in 2020. These acquisitions might necessitate additional facilities or equipment that are leased rather than purchased outright, thereby increasing the operating lease liabilities. \n\nIn conclusion, the company's operating lease liabilities increased by $177 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily influenced by new lease commitments and a lower discount rate."}

Similarly, the comprehensive income grew from $5,305 million in 2020 to $8,964 million in 2021, as shown in ![{Comprehensive income details for fiscal years 2019-2021}](image5).\n\nThis increase can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, there was a notable surge in revenues, particularly in QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments. According to [8], QCT revenues saw a 64% increase due to higher demand for 5G products across handsets and RFFE, along with automotive and IoT revenues. Additionally, QTL revenues rose by 26%, driven by an increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products. These revenue increases are also reflected in the financial statements provided in ![{Revenue and expense details for fiscal years 2019-2021}](image2), where total revenues jumped from $23,531 million in 2020 to $33,566 million in 2021.\n\nMoreover, the acquisition of NUVIA on March 16, 2021, for $1.1 billion, as mentioned in [1] and [8], contributed to Qualcomm's strategic expansion into high-performance processors and SoC technology, which is expected to bolster future product offerings. This acquisition, while costly, positions Qualcomm for long-term growth in compute-intensive devices and applications.\n\nLastly, the company's effective management of expenses and investments played a crucial role. The operating income increased significantly from $6,255 million in 2020 to $9,789 million in 2021, as seen in ![{Operating activities details for fiscal years 2019-2021}](image3). This improvement indicates better cost control and operational efficiency, further enhancing profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, the net income and comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 were significantly higher than in previous years, primarily due to robust revenue growth in key business segments, strategic acquisitions, and efficient cost management."}

This increase was primarily driven by several factors:\n\n- **Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses**: These rose significantly from $79,854 million in 2020 to $86,664 million in 2021. [2] mentions that claim liability estimates were reduced during 2021, but this did not offset the overall rise in unpaid losses.\n- **Unearned premiums**: There was a moderate increase from $21,395 million in 2020 to $23,512 million in 2021, reflecting higher insurance premiums collected in advance.\n- **Notes payable and other borrowings**: While there was a decrease in notes payable from $41,522 million in 2020 to $39,272 million in 2021, as mentioned in [7], Berkshire repaid some maturing senior notes and issued new ones with lower interest rates.\n\n### Shareholders' Equity Changes\n\nThe shareholders' equity also saw an increase from $451,336 million in 2020 to $514,930 million in 2021, as shown in image2. The key factors contributing to this change include:\n\n- **Retained earnings**: Retained earnings grew substantially from $444,626 million in 2020 to $534,421 million in 2021. This growth is attributed to the net earnings of $89,807 million in 2021, as stated in [4]. Image4 shows that net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders were $89,795 million in 2021.\n- **Treasury stock**: Berkshire continued to repurchase its shares, as indicated in [7]. The treasury stock value increased from $(32,853)$ million in 2020 to $(59,795)$ million in 2021, reflecting these repurchases. Image3 further details the transactions related to common stock acquisitions over the years.\n\n### Key Factors Contributing to Changes\n\nThe changes in liabilities and shareholders' equity are closely tied to Berkshire's core operations and financial strategies:\n\n- **Insurance Operations**: The rise in unpaid losses and unearned premiums reflects the ongoing growth in Berkshire's insurance business. [5] highlights the strong capital position of its insurance subsidiaries, which supports these increases.\n- **Net Earnings and Share Repurchases**: The significant increase in retained earnings is a direct result of strong net earnings in 2021. Meanwhile, the increase in treasury stock indicates Berkshire's strategy of share repurchases, which can enhance shareholder value by reducing the number of outstanding shares.\n\nIn conclusion, the liabilities and shareholders' equity of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. increased from 2020 to 2021, driven by growth in insurance-related liabilities and robust net earnings, partially offset by share repurchases. ![{Total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased from 2020 to 2021}](image2)"}

In 2018, the company repurchased $17.9 billion worth of common stock, which included a significant tender offer of $10.0 billion for 52.1 million shares. This was followed by repurchases of $7.6 billion in 2019 and $3.5 billion in 2020. The image ![The table shows the total number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share during specific months in 2020](image2) further breaks down the share repurchase activity in 2020, showing that the company bought back 15.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $3.5 billion throughout the year.

According to [3], Capex in 2020 was $21.4 billion, a significant decrease compared to previous years. This reduction is further illustrated in ![Capital expenditures decreased significantly in 2020](image3), which shows that total capital expenditures fell from $5,245 million in 2019 to $4,476 million in 2020. The Corporation prioritized holding 2021 capital spending within a range of $16 billion to $19 billion, indicating a continued focus on cost management.\n\nThe financial implications of this reduction in capital expenditures are multifaceted. As mentioned in [4], industry conditions in 2020 led to lower realized prices for ExxonMobil’s products, resulting in substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow compared to 2019. To strengthen liquidity, the Corporation issued $23 billion of long-term debt and implemented significant capital and operating cost reductions. By the end of 2020, ExxonMobil had $68 billion in gross debt, with intentions to reduce it over time. This strategy reflects an effort to balance investment needs with financial stability during challenging market conditions.\n\nRegarding taxes, there were notable changes as well. [10] states that total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement decreased by $15.7 billion from 2019 to 2020, reaching $22.8 billion. Income tax expense turned into a benefit of $5.6 billion in 2020, compared to an expense of $5.3 billion in 2019. This shift is also reflected in ![Income taxes decreased significantly in 2020](image4), where income taxes show a negative value of $(5,632) million in 2020, contrasting with positive values in previous years. The effective tax rate dropped to 17% in 2020 from 34% in 2019, primarily due to asset impairments recorded in 2020 and a change in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates.\n\nThe financial implications of these tax changes are significant. A lower effective tax rate and a tax benefit rather than an expense directly contribute to higher net income and improved financial performance. This can provide ExxonMobil with more resources to invest in its operations, pay down debt, or return value to shareholders.\n\nIn conclusion, ExxonMobil's capital expenditures decreased notably from 2019 to 2020, reflecting a strategic response to challenging industry conditions. Simultaneously, the company experienced a substantial reduction in taxes, which positively impacted its financial performance. These changes underscore ExxonMobil's efforts to manage costs and maintain financial resilience in a volatile market environment."}

According to [4], Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock. This significant amount indicates a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders when the company believes its stock is undervalued. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount, as mentioned in [6]. Additionally, it ensures that repurchases do not reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. \n\n![{Details of Class A and B common stock repurchased during October, November, and December}](image2) provides a detailed breakdown of the shares repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2021, showing the average price paid per share for both Class A and Class B common stocks.

This decline was primarily driven by a substantial drop of 19% in International Operated Markets sales due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations caused by COVID-19 [5]. The U.S. market also experienced a 4% decrease in company-operated sales. These revenue declines were reflected in the overall reported revenues, which fell by 10% from $21,365 million in 2019 to $19,208 million in 2020, as seen in ![image2](image2).\n\nOn the other hand, franchised revenues saw a more moderate decline of 8%, with the International Operated Markets segment experiencing a 14% decrease.

The main factors affecting these changes were restructuring and impairment charges (-10%), inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (+2%), and a positive foreign exchange impact (+1%)."}

The decrease in comprehensive income can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, net income for 2020 was significantly lower at $4,730.5 million compared to $6,025.4 million in 2019 and $5,924.3 million in 2018 [4]. This decline in net income is a major contributor to the overall reduction in comprehensive income. \n\nSecondly, other comprehensive income (loss) also played a role. In 2020, McDonald's reported a total other comprehensive loss of $(104.1) million, contrasting with a gain of $126.8 million in 2019 and a loss of $(431.1) million in 2018 [5]. Specifically, foreign currency translation adjustments had a positive impact in 2020 with a net gain of $63.1 million, but this was not enough to offset the negative effects from cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans, which resulted in a net loss of $(123.3) million and $(43.9) million respectively [5].\n\nAdditionally, the operating income decreased by 19% in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on franchisee sales and resulting cash flow streams [2]. This decline in operating income further contributed to the lower comprehensive income in 2020.\n\nThe image showing the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, provides a clear visual representation of these financial figures ![{McDonald's comprehensive income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018}](image5).\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's comprehensive income for 2020 was lower than the previous two years due to a combination of reduced net income and other comprehensive losses."}

This substantial growth is corroborated by [6], which attributes the increase primarily to lower legal settlements, lower impairments, and lower amortization expenses. However, these positive factors were partly offset by unfavorable gross margin and lower sales.\n\nSecondly, concerning **core operating income**, image2 indicates that the Sandoz segment experienced a decline from USD 2,334 million in 2020 to USD 2,064 million in 2021, representing a decrease of 12%. This reduction aligns with [8], which mentions that higher sales benefited core operating income but were offset by increased marketing, selling (M&S), and research & development (R&D) investments.\n\n![Operating income for Sandoz increased significantly due to reduced legal costs and impairments](image4)\n\nIn summary, while the Sandoz segment saw an increase in operating income driven by reduced legal and impairment costs, its core operating income decreased due to higher M&S and R&D investments despite higher sales."}

According to [4], the company's net interest income was influenced by factors such as the cost of funds and average revolving Card Member loan balances. The image ![Net interest income increased from $866 million in 2019 to $1,011 million in 2021](image5) shows that net interest income indeed increased over this period. This increase can be attributed to a lower cost of funds, as mentioned in [7]. However, it is partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances. Additionally, [4] highlights the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on net interest income, which could have played a role in these changes.\n\nNext, regarding card member receivables, [3] indicates that the reserve for credit losses decreased due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, with an improvement in unemployment rate projections. The image ![Card Member receivables increased from $18.0 billion in 2019 to $31.3 billion in 2021](image1) confirms an increase in total card member receivables over the same period. This growth in receivables, despite the decrease in reserves, suggests a positive trend in the company's financial health and customer payment behavior.\n\nIn summary, the net interest income increased from 2019 to 2021 primarily due to a lower cost of funds, while card member receivables grew as a result of improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook."}

This change is primarily due to the company's profitability as shown in [6], where Tencent Music Entertainment Group reported a profit for the year of RMB4,176 million in 2020. Additionally, the statement of comprehensive income (image5) shows that the total comprehensive income for 2020 was RMB8,100 million, which includes both the profit for the year and other comprehensive income items like fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences. These factors contributed to the substantial increase in retained earnings.\n\n### Total Comprehensive Income for the Year:\n- **2019:** Image1 indicates that the total comprehensive income for 2019 was RMB5,268 million.\n- **2020:** Image3 shows that the total comprehensive income for 2020 rose to RMB8,100 million.\n\nThe rise in total comprehensive income from RMB5,268 million in 2019 to RMB8,100 million in 2020 can be attributed to several factors. The primary driver is the increase in profit for the year, which grew from RMB3,977 million in 2019 to RMB4,176 million in 2020, as seen in image2. Furthermore, the fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income significantly increased from RMB1,031 million in 2019 to RMB5,219 million in 2020, as detailed in ![{the total comprehensive income statement for 2020}](image5).

The provided data shows a clear progression over these years.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the total provision for income taxes as shown in ![{The table details the total provision for income taxes across federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions for the years 2018-2020}](image5). The total provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020. This significant rise can be attributed to an increase in the current provision, particularly in the federal component, which grew from $2,897 million in 2018 to $4,098 million in 2020. The state and local provision also saw a steady increase, while the foreign provision fluctuated but remained substantial.\n\nNext, consider the deferred income tax assets and liabilities depicted in ![{This table outlines the deferred income tax assets and liabilities for 2020 and 2019, showing changes in various categories like accrued expenses, net operating loss carryforwards, and lease liabilities}](image3). In 2020, the total deferred income tax assets were $3,391 million, up from $2,868 million in 2019. This growth was driven by increases in several categories, including accrued expenses and allowances, U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards. However, the valuation allowances also increased, indicating some uncertainty about the realization of these assets.\n\nConversely, the total deferred income tax liabilities decreased from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in U.S. federal and state intangible assets, non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets, and capitalized software. The net effect of these changes resulted in a net deferred income tax liability of $(3,367) million in 2020, compared to $(2,993) million in 2019.\n\nThe trend in the deferred income tax assets and liabilities contributed to the overall tax provision by affecting the timing of tax payments. An increase in deferred tax assets suggests that the company expects future tax benefits, which could lower future tax provisions. Conversely, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities indicates that the company may have recognized more taxable income in the current period, leading to higher current tax provisions.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's provision for income taxes increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to a rise in the current provision, especially the federal component. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities played a role in this trend, with growing assets suggesting future tax benefits and decreasing liabilities indicating more immediate tax obligations."}

This indicates a significant shift in the company's liability structure.\n\n![{The table details the breakdown of current and noncurrent liabilities for 2020 and 2019}](image2)\n\nRegarding the changes in total debt during the same period, text quote [3] provides relevant information. It states that total debt was approximately $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. This suggests a slight decrease in total debt over the year.\n\nAdditionally, image4 offers a detailed breakdown of the components of long-term debt. It shows that while some individual debt instruments saw increases, others decreased, leading to an overall slight reduction in long-term debt from $21,517 million in 2019 to $21,193 million in 2020.\n\nThe relationship between the changes in total current and noncurrent liabilities and total debt can be inferred from these observations. The increase in current liabilities and decrease in noncurrent liabilities may indicate that the company is managing its short-term obligations more actively, possibly by utilizing cash reserves or other liquid assets. This could have contributed to the slight decrease in total debt, as the company might have paid down some of its long-term debt obligations using these resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the total current and noncurrent liabilities changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, with an increase in current liabilities and a decrease in noncurrent liabilities. This change is related to the slight decrease in total debt during the same period, suggesting active management of short-term obligations and possible debt repayment."}

This increase is primarily due to a higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 compared to the prior year [1]. In 2020, the net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, significantly lower than the $475 million recorded in 2019 [8][3].\n\nThese changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions are closely related to the overall compensation expenses. The Firm's compensation and benefits expenses increased by 11% in 2020, reaching $20,854 million [9]. This increase was driven by several factors, including higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts linked to higher revenues, and additional compensation from the E*TRADE acquisition. However, these increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest.\n\nThe timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm’s investments and the deferred recognition of related compensation expense over the vesting period can also impact reported ratios like the Expense efficiency ratio [2]. For instance, the deferred cash-based compensation awarded in 2020 was reduced compared to the previous year, and certain changes to the compensation deferral formula resulted in less cash-based compensation being deferred [4]. This is further illustrated in ![Deferred cash-based awards and return on referenced investments for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image6), which shows that while deferred cash-based awards slightly decreased from 2019 to 2020, the return on referenced investments increased significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in the effective tax rate and the decrease in net discrete tax provisions from 2019 to 2020 are directly related to the higher level of earnings and changes in compensation expenses during the same period. \n\nThe effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions changed due to higher earnings and lower tax benefits, impacting overall compensation expenses."}

This reserve release was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook.\n\n![{Card Member loans and receivables saw significant changes with loans increasing by 21% and receivables by 23% from 2020 to 2021}](image5) provides detailed figures on these changes. It shows that Card Member loans grew from $73.4 billion in 2020 to $88.6 billion in 2021, while Card Member receivables increased from $43.7 billion to $53.6 billion over the same period. The credit loss reserves also reflect these improvements, with a decrease in the ending balance for both loans and receivables.\n\nComparing these changes with network volumes and card member spending, ![{Network volumes and billed business showed substantial growth in 2021 compared to 2020}](image3) illustrates that network volumes increased by 24%, and billed business grew by 25% from 2020 to 2021.

However, this was offset by other charges and expenses that reduced overall profitability [7].\n\n- **Foreign Currency Translation:** Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.04 per share on diluted earnings in 2020, but it did not fully compensate for the overall decline in net income [4].

According to [1], the gross property, plant, and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2020, was $2.28 billion with accumulated depreciation of $816 million. For December 31, 2019, these figures were $2.08 billion and $483 million, respectively. The image2 also provides a detailed breakdown of property, plant, and equipment for both years. By subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the gross value, we can calculate the net value for each year:\n\n- **2020 Net Value:** $2.28 billion - $816 million = $1.464 billion\n- **2019 Net Value:** $2.08 billion - $483 million = $1.597 billion\n\nNext, we consider the solar energy systems.

For instance, FLNA's net revenue increased from $16,346 million in 2018 to $18,189 million in 2020, while its operating profit also rose from $5,008 million to $5,340 million. Similarly, PBNA saw a significant increase in both net revenue and operating profit.\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories plays a crucial role in these financial outcomes. The table ![{Percentage of net revenue generated by beverage and food/snack products for different regions}](image3) shows that PepsiCo's consolidated net revenue is split almost evenly between beverages (45%) and food/snacks (55%). However, this ratio varies significantly across different regions. For example, in Europe, beverages account for 55% of net revenue, whereas in LatAm, food/snacks dominate with 90% of the revenue. This suggests that regions with a higher proportion of beverage sales, like Europe, might have benefited more from pricing strategies and product mix adjustments [4], which could explain their revenue growth.\n\nMoreover, the pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [1] had a notable impact on operating profit. These charges, detailed in ![{Pre-tax charges by division due to COVID-19 in 2020}](image2), include employee compensation expenses, inventory write-downs, and upfront payments to customers. Divisions like PBNA and Europe incurred substantial costs, which likely offset some of the gains from net revenue growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely tied to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, with regions having a higher share of beverage sales potentially experiencing greater financial benefits. However, the pandemic-related charges also played a significant role in shaping the overall financial performance. Therefore, the net revenue growth and productivity savings were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses [6]."}

In 2020, there was a positive adjustment of $399 million, compared to negative adjustments in previous years. [2] explains that foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other (expense) income, net, which directly impacts comprehensive income.\n\nAdditionally, the balance sheet adjustments in image5 show changes in equity components. ![{Equity increased from $4,923 million in 2018 to $22,225 million in 2020}](image5) The total stockholders' equity grew substantially, reflecting improvements in retained earnings and other comprehensive income. Contributions from noncontrolling interests and stock-based compensation also contributed positively.\n\nFinally, the cash flow statement in image3 provides insight into operating activities. ![{Operating cash flow increased from $2,098 million in 2018 to $5,943 million in 2020}](image3) The rise in operating cash flow supports the growth in net income and comprehensive income by indicating better operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved from a significant loss in 2018 to a substantial gain in 2020, driven by improvements in net income, favorable foreign currency translation adjustments, and increases in equity and operating cash flow."}

Additionally, [8] and [9] provide specific details about the issuance and repayment of Senior Notes in 2020, which helps contextualize the current debt structure.\n\nThe image `![{Breakdown of long-term debt by type and year}](image3)` provides a detailed breakdown of the long-term debt as of 2021. It shows various types of Senior Notes with their respective amounts and due dates. For instance, the $1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 amount to $1,250, while the $1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 are valued at $1,750. This information aligns with the details mentioned in [9].\n\nFurthermore, the image `![{Maturity schedule of long-term debt over the next five years}](image2)` outlines the maturity schedule of the long-term debt over the next five fiscal years.

The image ![Total stockholders' equity increased by $2,573 million from 2021 to 2022](image4) shows that the total Costco stockholders’ equity was $18,078 million at the end of August 29, 2021, and it increased to $20,647 million by August 28, 2022. This indicates an increase of $2,569 million in total stockholders' equity over the year.\n\nNext, regarding noncontrolling interests, the same image ![Noncontrolling interests decreased by $66 million from 2021 to 2022](image4) reveals a decrease from $514 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022, reflecting a significant reduction of $509 million.

Meanwhile, under the Advanced approach, the total RWA decreased slightly from $382,496 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020. The increase in RWA under the Standardized approach can be attributed to increases in derivatives exposures, investment securities, and lending commitments, as mentioned in [9]. On the other hand, the decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced approach is due to a decline in litigation-related losses, as stated in [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the financial institution experienced an increase in capital ratios and RWA under the Standardized approach from 2019 to 2020, while the capital ratios also increased but the RWA slightly decreased under the Advanced approach during the same period."}

According to [6], net earnings increased by $3%, or $0.4 billion, to $14.8 billion in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to a rise in earnings before income taxes and a decrease in the effective income tax rate. The text also mentions that foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022. Additionally, image6 shows the detailed breakdown of net earnings attributable to P&G: ![Net earnings attributable to P&G increased from $13.027 billion in 2020 to $14.742 billion in 2022](image6).

On the other hand, stock-based expenses decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022, primarily due to a reduction in the expense for RSUs and PSUs."}

According to [7], the Systems revenue decreased by 8.2% year to year as reported. This is corroborated by ![Systems external revenue decreased by 8.2% year to year](image1), which shows a detailed breakdown of the Systems external revenue, including Systems Hardware, IBM Z, Power Systems, and Storage Systems. The image also reveals that while IBM Z revenue increased slightly by 1.9%, other segments like Power Systems and Storage Systems experienced significant declines of 22.4% and 6.1%, respectively.\n\nRegarding pre-tax income for the Systems segment, [5] states that it declined by 36.0%. This aligns with ![Pre-tax income for the Systems segment decreased by 36.0%](image2), which provides a clear view of the pre-tax income change from $701 million in 2019 to $449 million in 2020.\n\nMoving on to the regional performance, [4] mentions a decrease in Systems revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. However, for a full-year comparison, ![Total revenue decreased by 4.6% year to year](image4) shows the total revenue changes across different regions. The Americas region saw a decline of 6.0%, Europe/Middle East/Africa had a smaller drop of 3.3%, and Asia Pacific experienced a 3.5% decrease.\n\nLastly, the Global Financing business, as mentioned in [8], saw a 27.8% decrease in pre-tax income. This is supported by ![Global Financing pre-tax income decreased by 27.8%](image5), which illustrates the decline from $1,055 million in 2019 to $761 million in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the year-to-year percent changes in external revenue and pre-tax income varied across different systems and regions for IBM in 2020, with most segments experiencing declines due to various factors such as product cycle dynamics and macroeconomic challenges."}

The adjustments for amortization of intangible assets were $236 million, and for impairments, they were $18 million. These adjustments contributed positively to the Core gross profit, which amounted to $5,049 million. Similarly, the Operating income under IFRS results was $1,600 million. After adding the adjustments for amortization ($236 million) and impairments ($34 million), the Core operating income reached $2,064 million. This indicates that both amortization and impairment adjustments had a positive impact on the core results for 2021.\n\n![Adjustments affecting core results for 2021](image3)\n\nFor the year 2020, image2 provides similar insights. The Gross profit under IFRS results was $4,636 million. Adjustments for amortization of intangible assets were $366 million, and for impairments, they were $127 million. These adjustments led to a Core gross profit of $5,279 million. In terms of Operating income, the IFRS result was $1,043 million. With the addition of amortization ($366 million) and impairment ($255 million) adjustments, the Core operating income became $2,334 million.

The most recently observed market price at the end of the reporting period is used for valuation if an active market exists. Image6 provides detailed information about these instruments:\n\n- **Contract Amounts:** In 2020, the total contract amount was DKK 63,390 million compared to DKK 50,455 million in 2019. This indicates a significant increase in the volume of derivative contracts.\n- **Fair Values:** The positive fair value increased from DKK 188 million in 2019 to DKK 2,332 million in 2020, while the negative fair value also increased from DKK 734 million to DKK 1,365 million. This suggests that the overall impact of derivatives on the income statement was more pronounced in 2020.\n- **Recognition in Income Statement:** The net effect recognized in the income statement was DKK 483 million in 2020 compared to DKK 72 million in 2019, indicating a larger impact on financial income or expenses in 2020.\n\n### Cash Flow Changes\n\nImage5 shows the change in working capital, which affects cash flows:\n\n- **Trade Receivables:** There was a decrease of DKK 2,822 million in 2020 compared to a decrease of DKK 2,126 million in 2019. This suggests a higher reduction in trade receivables in 2020, impacting cash inflows.\n- **Trade Payables:** A decrease of DKK 641 million in 2020 compared to a decrease of DKK 398 million in 2019. This indicates a higher reduction in trade payables in 2020, affecting cash outflows.\n- **Other Liabilities:** An increase of DKK 1,274 million in 2020 compared to an increase of DKK 1,202 million in 2019. This suggests a higher increase in other liabilities in 2020, impacting cash inflows.\n- **Cash Flow Change in Working Capital:** The total cash flow change in working capital was a decrease of DKK 4,353 million in 2020 compared to a decrease of DKK 3,388 million in 2019. This indicates a larger negative impact on cash flow from operations in 2020.\n\n### Impact on Financial Statements\n\nThe increase in derivative financial instruments and their fair values had a significant impact on the income statement, as shown in Image6. The larger net effect recognized in the income statement in 2020 (DKK 483 million) compared to 2019 (DKK 72 million) indicates a greater influence on financial income or expenses.\n\nThe changes in working capital, as depicted in Image5, show a larger negative impact on cash flow from operations in 2020. The higher decreases in trade receivables and trade payables, along with the increase in other liabilities, contributed to this negative cash flow change.\n\nIn conclusion, the derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes in 2020 had a more pronounced effect on the company's financial statements compared to 2019, leading to a larger impact on financial income/expenses and a greater negative effect on cash flow from operations."}

The percentage of net sales attributed to SG&A expenses also decreased from 10.04% in 2020 to 8.88% in 2022, as mentioned in [7]. This decrease is largely due to leveraging increased sales and various cost-saving measures.\n\n### Interest Income and Other, Net:\nImage5 illustrates the trend for Interest Income and Other, Net. In 2022, it was $205 million, up from $143 million in 2021 and $92 million in 2020.

In 2018, it was a loss of $(481,387). It improved to a gain of $278,740 in 2019 but then decreased to a loss of $(264,406) in 2020.\n- **Comprehensive Income**: Followed a similar trend as net income, increasing from $3,730,974 in 2018 to $4,575,086 in 2019, and further to $5,472,296 in 2020.\n\nThe changes in shareholders' equity can be observed in images 2, 3, and 5.

An increase in net income contributes positively to retained earnings, which is a major component of shareholders' equity. Fluctuations in other comprehensive income affect the accumulated other comprehensive loss, which also impacts shareholders' equity. Additionally, the repurchase of treasury shares reduces the total number of outstanding shares, thereby impacting shareholders' equity.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in Accenture's comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020 show a general upward trend in net income and comprehensive income, with fluctuations in other comprehensive income.

Instead, the Board decides on the remuneration of Managing/Executive/Whole-time Directors, which is then recommended for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting. Non-executive directors receive only sitting fees of Rs.5,000 per meeting attended.\n\nThe specific remuneration amounts are detailed in image3. ![{Director remuneration details}](image3) This table shows that Mr. K.K.

According to the image4, the total liabilities for Berkshire Hathaway increased from $422,393 million in 2020 to $443,854 million in 2021. This represents an increase of approximately $21,461 million. The rise in liabilities can be attributed to various factors such as increases in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, unearned premiums, and other policyholder liabilities.\n\n![Total liabilities increased by approximately $21,461 million from 2020 to 2021](image4)\n\nNext, let's consider the shareholders' equity. From the same image4, we observe that the total shareholders' equity rose from $451,336 million in 2020 to $514,930 million in 2021, marking a significant increase of about $63,594 million. This growth is primarily driven by retained earnings, which surged from $444,626 million in 2020 to $534,421 million in 2021, reflecting the company's profitability and its decision to reinvest profits rather than distribute them as dividends.\n\nThe net earnings and comprehensive income figures provide further insight into these changes. Image3 shows that net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders jumped from $43,521 million in 2020 to $89,795 million in 2021. Additionally, comprehensive income also saw a substantial rise, increasing from $43,521 million in 2020 to $90,011 million in 2021. These impressive gains in both net earnings and comprehensive income directly contributed to the growth in retained earnings and, consequently, shareholders' equity.\n\n![Net earnings and comprehensive income significantly increased from 2020 to 2021](image3)\n\nIn summary, the increase in total liabilities from 2020 to 2021 reflects the normal course of business operations, while the substantial rise in shareholders' equity is closely tied to the strong performance indicated by the net earnings and comprehensive income over the same period."}

According to [3], an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized in 2020, primarily related to patents and licenses. This is a significant decrease from the DKK 982 million impairment loss recognized in 2019. The impairment loss in 2020 was entirely attributed to research and development costs. Image6 shows that the amortization/depreciation and impairment losses for intangible assets were DKK 1,096 million in 2020 compared to DKK 487 million in 2019. This indicates a substantial increase in overall impairment and depreciation charges for intangible assets.\n\nNext, let's consider property, plant, and equipment. [8] explains that these assets are measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. Image5 provides detailed information on the depreciation for land and buildings and other equipment. In 2020, the depreciation for land and buildings was DKK 644 million, while for other equipment, it was DKK 320 million. Comparing this with 2019, where the depreciation for land and buildings was DKK 564 million and for other equipment was DKK 288 million, there is a noticeable increase in depreciation expenses. Image6 also shows that the total amortization/depreciation and impairment losses for property, plant, and equipment increased from DKK 3,995 million in 2019 to DKK 4,683 million in 2020.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the net carrying amounts can be observed in image6. For intangible assets, the carrying amount decreased from DKK 4,627 million in 2019 to DKK 1,388 million in 2020. This significant drop is largely due to the impairment losses recognized in 2020. For property, plant, and equipment, the carrying amount increased slightly from DKK 50,551 million in 2019 to DKK 50,269 million in 2020, despite the higher depreciation and impairment losses, indicating that additions during the year offset the losses.\n\nIn conclusion, the depreciation and impairment losses have evolved differently across asset categories from 2019 to 2020. Intangible assets experienced a significant impairment loss in 2020, leading to a substantial decrease in their net carrying amount. Property, plant, and equipment saw an increase in depreciation expenses but maintained a relatively stable net carrying amount due to new additions. ![{Depreciation and impairment losses for intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment}](image6)"}

This indicates a decline in net investment income over the three years. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest and other investment income, as mentioned in [6]. Interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, and by $1.0 billion (49.0%) in 2020 compared to 2019.

While the text does not explicitly provide this information, we can infer it from the total plan assets reported in image6. For the U.S. defined benefit plan, the total assets were $1,061 million as of December 31, 2020. Comparing this with the previous year's data would give us insight into the actual return. However, the exact figures for 2019 are not provided in the images, so we cannot calculate the precise change in actual returns.\n\nThe relationship between these figures and the total plan assets can be seen in image6. The total assets of the U.S. defined benefit plan increased from the previous year, which could be attributed to factors including the actual return on investments. The expected return, while negative, improved slightly, suggesting that the actual performance may have been better than anticipated.\n\nIn summary, the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan improved from $(41) million in 2019 to $(36) million in 2020, as shown in ![Expected return on plan assets for U.S. Defined Benefit plan](image2). The actual return, while not directly stated, contributed to an increase in total plan assets to $1,061 million as of December 31, 2020, as reflected in ![Total plan assets for U.S. Defined Benefit plan](image6).\n\nThe expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan improved slightly from 2019 to 2020, and this is reflected in the total plan assets which showed an overall increase."}

According to [4], the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2020, was $8,564 million, while it was $6,995 million as of January 31, 2019. This indicates a significant increase in unearned revenue over the period. The table in ![Unearned revenue increased significantly from $6,995 million in 2019 to $10,662 million in 2020](image4) further confirms this trend, showing that unearned revenue grew to $10,662 million by the end of fiscal year 2020.\n\nThe increase in unearned revenue can be attributed to several factors mentioned in [9]. These include seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, timing, dollar size, and new business linearity within the quarter. Additionally, the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, as noted in [10], likely contributed to this growth, with an acquired contract asset balance of $131 million included in the contract assets as of January 31, 2020.\n\nNow, let's consider the total revenue. The table in ![Total revenue increased from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020](image2) shows that total revenue grew from $13,282 million in fiscal year 2019 to $17,098 million in fiscal year 2020. This substantial increase suggests strong performance across different regions, particularly in the Americas, where revenue rose from $9,445 million to $12,051 million. As stated in [7], the majority of this revenue (approximately 96 percent) is attributed to the United States.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The rise in unearned revenue implies that the company has been successful in securing advance payments from customers, indicating customer confidence and commitment to long-term contracts. This also suggests a stable and predictable revenue stream for future periods. However, as mentioned in [8], unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation are subject to future economic risks, which could impact revenue recognition if not managed properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the significant increase in total revenue reflects the company's effective expansion strategies, including acquisitions like Tableau, which have broadened its product offerings and market reach. This growth also highlights the company's ability to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a competitive edge.\n\nIn conclusion, the total revenue increased from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, and unearned revenue grew from $6,995 million to $10,662 million during the same period. These changes indicate robust financial performance and strategic success but also highlight the need for careful management of future economic risks."}

According to [3], the actuarial gain for pension plans in 2022 was primarily related to increases in discount rates. This suggests a significant impact on the pension-related deferred tax assets. The image `![{Deferred tax assets decreased by $473 million from 2021 to 2022}](image3)` shows that the total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022. The primary categories contributing to this decrease include \"Pension and other retiree benefits,\" which saw a substantial drop from $1,476 million in 2021 to $740 million in 2022. Additionally, \"Capitalized research & development\" also decreased from $358 million to $646 million.\n\nNext, examining the deferred tax liabilities, the image `![{Deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 million from 2021 to 2022}](image9)` indicates an increase from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. The main contributors to this rise are \"Goodwill and intangible assets,\" which remained relatively stable at $5,783 million, and \"Other retiree benefits,\" which significantly increased from $645 million in 2021 to $1,031 million in 2022. Furthermore, \"Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions\" also contributed to the increase, rising from $111 million to $439 million.\n\nIn summary, the deferred tax assets decreased by $473 million from 2021 to 2022, mainly due to reductions in pension and other retiree benefits and capitalized research & development. Conversely, deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 million over the same period, driven by increases in other retiree benefits and unrealized gains on financial and foreign exchange transactions."}

According to [4], net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion in 2020. This increase is further detailed in [6] as being driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by receivables ($4.8 billion), which was partially offset by performance-related declines within net income. The image ![Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities](image4) confirms this, showing that net cash provided by operating activities rose from $14.77 billion in 2019 to $18.197 billion in 2020.\n\nNext, consider the investing activities. [5] and [9] indicate a significant decrease in net cash used in investing activities by $23.9 billion, mainly due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions ($32.3 billion) because of the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($6.2 billion). Image ![Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities](image4) corroborates this, showing a substantial reduction in cash used in investing activities from $(26.936) billion in 2019 to $(3.028) billion in 2020.\n\nRegarding financing activities, [8] notes that these were a net use of cash of $9.721 billion in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9.042 billion in 2019. This year-to-year change of $18.763 billion was influenced by various factors such as dividends paid and changes in debt levels. Image ![Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities](image4) reflects this shift, with financing activities turning from a positive contributor to a negative one.\n\nFinally, combining all these elements, the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5.361 billion, up from $3.290 billion in 2019, as shown in image ![Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities](image4).\n\nIn conclusion, the financial adjustments and cash flow activities significantly impacted IBM's net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting in a higher net change of $5.361 billion in 2020."}

This decline was mainly due to significant sales drops in the International Operated Markets segment as a result of COVID-19. The U.S. market showed positive sales performance, but this was more than offset by the support provided for marketing initiatives, including incentives to franchisees and free meals for first responders and health care workers.\n\nImage9 illustrates these revenue changes, showing a decrease in both company-operated sales and franchised revenues across all regions, with the most substantial drop in the International Operated Markets. The total revenues declined by 10%, reflecting the overall negative impact of the pandemic on global operations.\n\nRegarding restaurant margins, [8] indicates that total restaurant margins decreased by 13% in 2020, again largely influenced by sales declines in the International Operated Markets due to COVID-19. Positive sales performance in the U.S. partially mitigated this decline. Image2 provides detailed figures, showing a 41% decrease in company-operated margins for the International Operated Markets and a 23% decrease in total restaurant margins for the same region. In contrast, the U.S. saw a marginal 2% decrease in total restaurant margins.\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes were the temporary closures and limited operations in international markets, as mentioned in [1]. Additionally, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses, as noted in [3] and shown in image3, played a role. These expenses increased by 14% in 2020, partly due to incremental marketing contributions and strategic technology investments aimed at accelerating recovery and driving growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the total revenues and restaurant margins decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the adverse effects of COVID-19 on international markets and increased operational and marketing expenses."}

According to [3], the graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated revenue made by different segments. Image3 shows that Cable Communications had a slight increase of 0.7% in revenue from 2020 to 2021, NBCUniversal saw a more significant rise of 6.9%, and Sky experienced an even larger growth of 11.4%. The Corporate and Other segment also contributed positively with a substantial increase. This indicates that while all segments contributed to the overall revenue growth, NBCUniversal and Sky were the primary drivers.\n\nRegarding operating expenses, [5] mentions a graph illustrating the contributions to the change in consolidated operating costs and expenses. Image5 provides a visual representation of these changes. It shows that the Cable Communications segment had a positive contribution of $1,450 million, NBCUniversal added $1,285 million, and Sky increased by $6,788 million. However, there was a negative adjustment of $(730) million in the Corporate and Other category. These figures suggest that despite the increases in most segments, the overall expense growth was somewhat mitigated by the adjustments in the Corporate and Other segment.\n\nAdditionally, [2] details specific factors contributing to the expense changes. For instance, NBCUniversal expenses rose due to increases in Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. Cable Communications expenses increased because of higher programming expenses, technical and product support costs, franchise fees, and advertising expenses. Sky's expenses went up mainly due to direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs.\n\nIn summary, the main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021 were NBCUniversal and Sky, as shown in ![{Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, and Sky segments' revenue contributions}](image3). For operating expenses, all major segments contributed to the increase, but Sky had the largest impact, as depicted in ![{Operating cost contributions across segments}](image5). Comparing across segments, Sky showed the highest percentage growth in both revenue and expenses, followed by NBCUniversal, while Cable Communications had more modest changes. \n\nThe main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue and operating expenses from 2020 to 2021 were primarily the Sky and NBCUniversal segments, with Sky showing the highest growth rates in both areas."}

According to image4, the number of daily average active content creators increased by 42% from 22Q1 to 23Q1.\n\nNext, we look at the increase rate for the average daily video views. Image5 shows that the total video views contributed by PUGVs and Story Mode grew by 37% from 22Q1 to 23Q1. This can be considered as a proxy for the average daily video views since it represents a significant portion of the video content.\n\nNow, comparing these two rates:\n- The increase rate for the number of daily average active content creators is 42%.\n- The increase rate for the average daily video views (proxied by total video views) is 37%.\n\nThe difference in the increase rates is 42% - 37% = 5%.\n\nTherefore, compared with 22Q1, in 23Q1, the increase rate of the number of daily average active content creators is 5 percentage points higher than the average daily video views.\n\n![{Increase rate comparison}](image4)\n![{Video view contribution}](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the increase rate of the number of daily average active content creators is 5 percentage points higher than the average daily video views."}

According to [image1], the net operating income for this segment increased significantly from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020, marking a rise of $434 million or approximately 3%. This growth can be attributed to various factors such as an increase in revenue from Foreign Exchange and Credit activities, as shown in the image. The adjusted revenue for Global Markets rose by $1,562 million, with FICC contributing $1,541 million alone. This indicates that despite the economic challenges posed by Covid-19, certain financial services experienced substantial demand, leading to higher revenues.\n\nNow, focusing on the **Corporate Centre**, [image3] reveals a different picture. The net operating income here improved dramatically from $(654) million in 2019 to $(262) million in 2020, a positive change of $392 million. This improvement is largely due to a significant reduction in losses from Legacy portfolios and Other categories. While Central Treasury revenue decreased slightly, the overall impact was less detrimental compared to previous years.\n\nThe variations in these metrics are also reflected in the broader financial performance of HSBC Holdings. [image4] shows that the overall profit before tax for the company increased by $387 million from 2019 to 2020, reaching $1,311 million. This aligns with the improvements seen in both the Global Banking and Markets segment and the Corporate Centre. The share of profit in associates and joint ventures, however, saw a decline, which could indicate challenges faced by partners during the pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, the risk appetite and capital adequacy measures depicted in [image2] provide additional context. Despite the challenging environment, HSBC maintained a CET1 ratio of 15.9%, well above the required minimum, indicating strong capital resilience. The return on average tangible equity (RoTE) was lower than the target but still showed improvement from 2019.\n\nIn conclusion, while both the Global Banking and Markets segment and the Corporate Centre experienced improvements in their net operating income, the reasons behind these changes differ. The former benefited from increased demand for specific financial services, whereas the latter saw reductions in legacy losses. These changes collectively contributed to an overall increase in HSBC Holdings' profit before tax. ![{Net operating income and profit before tax improved for both segments, driven by different factors}](image4)"}

The other comprehensive loss for 2021 was $(50) million, compared to $(158) million in 2020 and $(140) million in 2019. This indicates that while there were losses in other comprehensive income, they were relatively smaller in 2021 compared to previous years.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in shareholders' equity, particularly the increase in retained earnings and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), positively impacted the comprehensive income of the company from 2019 to 2021."}

This reduction could have contributed to a decrease in costs associated with operations and maintenance. Additionally, [6] notes an increase in interest income by $19 million due to financing receivables related to the Norco Assets, which positively impacted the financial performance.\n\nThe image3 shows the detailed revenue and expenses for the years 2018-2020. The operating income for 2020 was $169 million, compared to $215 million in 2019. This indicates a decline in operating income. The reasons for this decline can be inferred from the text and the table:\n\n- **Revenue Changes**: [9] states that total revenue decreased by $22 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Specifically, transportation services revenue decreased by $53 million, allowance oil revenue decreased by $12 million, and product revenue decreased by $21 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $63 million in terminaling services revenue and $1 million in lease revenue. ![{Operating income decreased from $215 million in 2019 to $169 million in 2020}](image3)\n\n- **Costs and Expenses**: The same image3 also shows that while some costs like cost of product sold and depreciation decreased, others such as general and administrative expenses remained relatively stable. \n\n### Cash from Investing Activities Change\n\nImage5 provides details on cash flows from investing activities. In 2020, the net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $64 million, compared to $(87) million in 2019. This significant change suggests a shift in the company's investment strategy or completion of major projects. \n\n- **Capital Expenditures**: As noted in [3], capital expenditures decreased from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020. This reduction likely contributed to the positive cash flow from investing activities in 2020. ![{Net cash provided by investing activities increased from $(87) million in 2019 to $64 million in 2020}](image5)\n\n- **Acquisitions and Contributions**: There were no acquisitions from the parent company in 2020, whereas in 2019, there was a contribution of $90 million. Also, contributions to investments were negative in both years but less so in 2020.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nShell Midstream Partners, L.P.'s operating income decreased from $215 million in 2019 to $169 million in 2020 primarily due to declines in transportation services, allowance oil, and product revenues, despite an increase in terminaling services revenue. Meanwhile, cash from investing activities improved significantly from $(87) million in 2019 to $64 million in 2020, largely because of reduced capital expenditures and the absence of major acquisitions."}

For Escondida, the revenue increased from $6,719 million in FY2020 to $9,470 million in FY2021 [7]. The underlying EBITDA also saw a substantial rise, jumping from $3,535 million to $6,483 million during the same period [7]. This improvement was partly due to a decrease in unit costs by 1 per cent to US$1.00 per pound, reflecting strong concentrator throughput and lower deferred stripping costs [8]. Despite challenges such as unfavourable exchange rate movements and reduced operational workforce due to COVID-19 restrictions, Escondida managed to achieve these positive results.\n\nOn the other hand, WAIO's performance was equally impressive. The revenue for WAIO surged from $20,663 million in FY2020 to $34,337 million in FY2021 [2]. The underlying EBITDA for WAIO also witnessed a considerable increase, rising from $14,508 million to $26,270 million over the same timeframe [2]. This growth can be attributed to higher average realised prices and production, with WAIO production increasing by 1 per cent to a record 252 Mt (284 Mt on a 100% basis) [2]. Record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, including first ore from South Flank in May 2021, contributed significantly to this achievement [2].\n\nThe impact of commodity price changes on their financial performance is evident. ![{Escondida's financial metrics improved significantly in FY2021}](image7) shows that despite a 4 per cent decline in copper concentrate feed grade and lower cathode volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions, Escondida's financial metrics still improved significantly. Similarly, ![{WAIO's financial metrics also showed substantial growth in FY2021}](image2) indicates that WAIO's financial metrics showed substantial growth, driven by higher average realised prices and production. These improvements highlight the resilience and operational efficiency of both Escondida and WAIO in the face of various challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, both Escondida and WAIO demonstrated robust financial and production performances in FY2021, with significant increases in revenue and underlying EBITDA. Commodity price changes positively impacted their financial performance, contributing to their overall success."}

The image ![Level 2 assets increased from $408 million in 2021 to $561 million in 2022](image2) shows that the Level 2 assets have increased from $408 million in 2021 to $561 million in 2022. This indicates a significant rise in the value of these assets over the year.\n\nNext, let's look at the long-term debt. As mentioned in [4], the nature and amount of long-term debt may vary due to various factors. The image ![Long-term debt decreased from $6,692 million in 2021 to $6,484 million in 2022](image5) reveals that the long-term debt has decreased from $6,692 million in 2021 to $6,484 million in 2022. This decrease can be attributed to the repayment of certain Senior Notes as noted in [6], where the Company repaid the $2.300% Senior Notes prior to maturity.\n\nThe differences between the two years can be explained by the company's financial strategies and market conditions. The increase in Level 2 assets suggests a possible shift towards more liquid investments or an improvement in the valuation of existing assets. On the other hand, the decrease in long-term debt reflects the company's efforts to manage its debt levels, possibly to reduce interest expenses or improve its financial leverage position.\n\nIn conclusion, the total financial figures for Level 2 assets increased from $408 million in 2021 to $561 million in 2022, while the long-term debt decreased from $6,692 million in 2021 to $6,484 million in 2022."}

This uptick was driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year [9]. These factors contributed significantly to the overall improvement in free cash flow.\n\nIn summary, the main contributing factors to the increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 were higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and reduced payments out of provisions, despite the offsetting effect of the upfront licensing payment.

In contrast, in fiscal year 2020, changes in financial assumptions led to an increase of €72 million, contributing to the overall actuarial gain of €67 million.\n\nThe discount rate is another critical factor influencing the defined benefit obligation. Image2 provides insight into this:\n\n![{Effect on defined benefit obligation due to changes in discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression}](image2)\n\nFor fiscal year 2021, a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the defined benefit obligation by €242 million, while a decrease would increase it by €271 million. This sensitivity highlights the impact of discount rate changes on the pension obligation and, consequently, on the actuarial gains and losses.\n\nCombining the insights from the text and images, we can conclude: Changes in financial assumptions resulted in a €26 million decrease in 2021 and a €72 million increase in 2020, significantly affecting the total actuarial gains and losses. Additionally, the discount rate's sensitivity further influenced these outcomes, with a half-percentage-point change potentially altering the defined benefit obligation by hundreds of millions of euros. \n\nTherefore, the changes in financial assumptions and discount rates had a substantial negative effect on the total actuarial gains and losses in fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020."}

The impact of these filings on the company's financial strategy can be significant, especially considering the ongoing examinations and potential adjustments. \n\nThe image2 provides a detailed breakdown of the current and deferred provisions for federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. In 2019, the foreign current provision was $(407) million, indicating a benefit. However, in 2020 and 2021, the foreign current provision turned positive at $526 million and $518 million respectively. This shift suggests an increase in foreign taxable income or a change in tax laws affecting foreign operations.\n\nImage5 shows the components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Foreign income before taxes increased significantly from $439 million in 2019 to $715 million in 2020 and further to $1,493 million in 2021. This substantial growth indicates expanding international operations or improved profitability in foreign markets.\n\nCombining this information with [1] and [10], the company has been dealing with complex tax situations involving refunds and unrecognized tax benefits related to Korean withholding taxes. These factors could influence the company's financial strategy by necessitating careful management of tax liabilities and receivables.\n\n![{Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 26, 2021}](image1)\n\nImage1 illustrates the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

According to [5], the defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets are key components. For Germany, ![{Discount rates for Euro increased from 1.0% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021}](image4) shows that the discount rate for the Euro increased from 1.0% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021. This change can significantly impact the present value of future benefits. In contrast, for the United States, the discount rate for the U.S. dollar was 2.7% in 2021 compared to 2.4% in 2020, as shown in the same image.\n\nRegarding mortality tables, ![{Germany uses Siemens-specific tables derived from German Siemens population data; the US uses pre-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration}](image5) indicates that Germany uses Siemens-specific tables mainly derived from its own population data, while the United States relies on the pre-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions. These different sources may lead to variations in estimated life expectancies and thus affect the calculation of pension obligations.\n\nFinancial indicators also play a crucial role. From ![{Defined benefit obligation for Germany is higher than the US in both years}](image3), it is evident that the defined benefit obligation for Germany is consistently higher than that for the United States in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.

[7] mentions that the adjusted profit before tax was $1.9 billion, which is a significant decrease compared to 2019. This decline is attributed to higher expected credit losses (ECL) due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower revenue caused by reduced global interest rates. The quote also highlights that despite these challenges, some segments performed well. For instance, [6] states that Global Banking and Markets (GBM) saw an increase in adjusted revenue thanks to strong performance in Global Markets, even though there were adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments.\n\nNow, let's look at the image data. ![{Net operating income decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020}](image5) shows the adjusted results for the entire bank, indicating a slight increase in net operating income but a substantial drop in profit before tax. This aligns with the information provided in [7]. \n\nFurther segment-specific insights can be gleaned from ![{Global Markets showed a significant increase in revenue, while other segments like Global Liquidity and Cash Management experienced declines}](image8). It reveals that Global Markets had a substantial revenue increase of 27%, driven by Foreign Exchange and Credit categories. However, other segments such as Global Liquidity and Cash Management, and Global Trade and Receivables Finance saw declines in revenue. This corroborates the statement in [6] about GBM's strong performance in specific areas.\n\nAdditionally, ![{Adjusted ECL increased significantly in 2020}](image7) illustrates the significant rise in adjusted ECL to $4.8 billion, reflecting the economic uncertainties brought on by the pandemic.

The table indicates that Adjusted EBITDA was $34,708 million in 2021, a significant increase from $30,826 million in 2020 and $34,258 million in 2019. This suggests a recovery in profitability after a dip in 2020.\n\nNext, examining specific segments, ![image5](image5) provides insight into one particular segment's performance. This segment experienced a substantial improvement in Adjusted EBITDA from $(1,785) million in 2020 to $(1,358) million in 2021, indicating reduced losses. The revenue for this segment also increased significantly by 86.1% from 2020 to 2021, while operating costs and expenses decreased by 10.5%.

In 2020, management actions delivered gross RWA reductions of $37bn globally. Performance in Global Markets was achieved with both a decrease in RWAs and no increase in trading value at risk ('VaR').\n[6] In Global Banking, revenue decreased by $0.1bn or 2%, reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions.

According to [2], this income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, largely due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. The text explains that short-term interest rates have been low since the second half of 2019, which continued through 2021, resulting in significantly reduced interest income.\n\nThis trend is further supported by the data in ![Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased significantly from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021](image1). Despite holding substantial balances of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, the low-interest-rate environment has negatively impacted earnings. Additionally, the allocation to fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, as shown in image1. This reduction in higher-yielding assets likely contributed to the overall decline in investment income.\n\nMoreover, the table in ![Interest and other investment income decreased significantly from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021](image5) clearly illustrates the substantial decrease in interest and other investment income, aligning with the explanation provided in [2].

These asset allocations reflect a strategic focus on liquidity and safety over yield, as mentioned in [2].\n\n**Answer:** The decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to lower interest rates impacting short-term investments and a reduction in fixed maturity securities, as reflected in the company's asset allocations prioritizing liquidity and safety."}

This increase was primarily due to a $44 million rise in income from equity method investments, which included acquisitions of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019 and an interest in Mattox in April 2020. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments by $14 million due to accounting changes for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments post-acquisition. Additionally, Other income increased by $4 million related to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020.\n\nThe image ![Net income and comprehensive income data for 2018-2020](image1) provides a clear view of the net income and comprehensive income figures over the three years.

This is corroborated by image3, which shows that the total cigarette shipment volume decreased by 17.2% from 174,934 million units in 2019 to 144,788 million units in 2020. The heated tobacco unit shipment volume also saw an increase but was negligible compared to the overall drop.

Image6 supports this with a 12.3% decrease in cigarette shipment volume and a substantial 61.5% drop in heated tobacco units. This resulted in a 13.3% reduction in the total market size for the Middle East & Africa region.\n\nIn East Asia & Australia, [9] suggests a mixed performance. While there was a decline in cigarette shipments as shown in ![image1](image1), where cigarettes dropped by 9.7%, there was a notable 10.4% increase in heated tobacco units. This led to a slight overall decrease of 2.1% in the total market.\n\nLatin America & Canada's performance is detailed in [6]. Although specific shipment volume data isn't provided, the text mentions unfavorable volume/mix affecting net revenues. Image7 reflects this with a 22.9% decrease in net revenues, excluding currency effects, indicating a challenging year for this region.\n\nLastly, the financial summary for all regions combined can be seen in image2. It shows a modest 1.2% increase in net revenues when including currency effects, but a more pronounced 24.2% rise in operating income, suggesting cost-saving measures or pricing strategies were effective despite volume declines.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in PMI shipment volumes and net revenues varied significantly across different regions from 2019 to 2020, with most regions experiencing declines in shipment volumes but some managing to maintain or even increase net revenues through pricing strategies and cost reductions."}

The table in image1 shows a significant decrease in unallocated revenues over this period: from $4,723 million in 2019 to $54 million in 2021. This substantial decline is explained by [7], which notes that unallocated revenues in fiscal 2019 included major licensing revenues from settlements with Apple and its contract manufacturers, whereas in 2021, they were primarily due to the release of a variable constraint against previously unallocated revenues.\n\nRegarding unallocated expenses, the same table reveals a consistent pattern of high research and development (R&D) expenses, with figures of $(1,820)$ million in 2021, $(1,046)$ million in 2020, and $(989)$ million in 2019. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also remained relatively stable, at $(538)$ million in 2021, $(401)$ million in 2020, and $(413)$ million in 2019. These expenses are not directly tied to specific segments and reflect corporate-level activities.\n\n![Unallocated Revenues and Expenses](image1)\n\nComparing these changes with the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021, we see that the total net assets acquired were $1,264 million, as shown in image4. This amount includes goodwill of $885 million, IPR&D of $247 million, and other assets totaling $26 million. The acquisition's impact on unallocated revenues and expenses was minimal in 2021, as stated in [6]. Therefore, while the acquisition significantly boosted the company's asset base, it did not substantially alter the trend of decreasing unallocated revenues or the level of unallocated expenses.\n\nIn conclusion, the unallocated revenues decreased dramatically from 2019 to 2021, mainly due to the absence of large settlement-related revenues, while unallocated expenses remained fairly consistent. The NUVIA acquisition in 2021 added considerable net assets but had little effect on the trends observed in unallocated revenues and expenses."}

According to [1], the total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $22.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of $15.7 billion from 2019. This information is further supported by ![{Total taxes decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020}](image2), which shows that the total taxes dropped from $38.468 billion in 2019 to $22.793 billion in 2020. Comparing this with the data from [6] and ![{Total taxes decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020}](image2), it is evident that the total taxes were $44.762 billion in 2018. Therefore, there was a significant reduction in total tax expenses from 2018 to 2020.\n\nNext, let's consider the average realizations for crude oil and natural gas. The worldwide average realizations are shown in ![{Crude oil and natural gas prices declined sharply from 2019 to 2020}](image5). In 2020, the average realization for crude oil and NGL was $35.41 per barrel, down from $56.32 per barrel in 2019 and $62.79 per barrel in 2018. Similarly, the average realization for natural gas was $2.01 per thousand cubic feet in 2020, compared to $3.05 per thousand cubic feet in 2019 and $3.87 per thousand cubic feet in 2018.

According to [1], the approach that yields the higher RWA is used for calculating TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2020, and 2019. From ![{Risk-based capital metrics for 2020 and 2019}](image2), we can see that under the Standardized Approach, the RWA decreased from $1,493 billion in 2019 to $1,480 billion in 2020. Under the Advanced Approaches, the RWA also decreased from $1,447 billion in 2019 to $1,371 billion in 2020. This decrease is consistent with the information in [2] that RWA under the Standardized approach decreased by $13.7 billion during 2020 primarily due to lower commercial and consumer lending exposures.\n\nNext, let's consider the TLAC ratios. The TLAC regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent, totaling 22.0 percent as mentioned in [1].

According to [3], [9], and [8], the balance sheets for December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively show the net income figures. However, specific values are not provided in the text. To fill this gap, we refer to the image quotes. ![{Net income figures for 2018, 2019, and 2020}](image2) provides the net income figures: $5,595 million in 2018, $5,017 million in 2019, and $5,580 million in 2020. This indicates a slight decrease in 2019 followed by a recovery in 2020.\n\nNext, we look at the factors affecting these changes. [6] highlights the company's strong cash generation and capital management strategy, including share repurchases and dividend increases. Specifically, it mentions that approximately 109% of free cash flow was returned to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases and dividends. This is further supported by the data in ![{Cash flow details for 2018, 2019, and 2020}](image4), which shows significant cash outflows related to stock repurchases and dividends.\n\nAdditionally, [2] provides information on future compensation related to equity awards, indicating an expected recognition of $237 million over the next few years. This suggests ongoing expenses related to employee compensation, which could impact net income.\n\nRegarding retained earnings, the text quotes do not explicitly mention retained earnings but provide related information. For instance, [3], [9], and [8] list various components affecting the balance sheet, such as dividends declared and paid, common stock issued for stock-based awards, and stock repurchases. These activities directly influence retained earnings. The image quotes also support this, with ![{Retained earnings adjustments for 2018, 2019, and 2020}](image3) showing the adjustments made to retained earnings over the three years.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's net income fluctuated slightly between 2018 and 2020, influenced by factors such as strong cash generation, capital management strategies, and ongoing employee compensation expenses. Retained earnings were affected by dividends, stock-based awards, and stock repurchases. The significant factors affecting these changes include the company's robust cash flow, strategic capital allocation, and consistent shareholder returns.\n\nThe company's retained earnings and net income experienced minor fluctuations from 2018 to 2020, primarily driven by its capital management strategy and ongoing operational expenses."}

Conversely, the Medicare Advantage segment increased by 440 thousand, and Medicaid saw a rise of 720 thousand. The Global segment also experienced a decline of 295 thousand.\n\nThese changes can be attributed to several factors mentioned in the text quotes. [10] indicates that the fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition caused by economic impacts. This aligns with the observed decline in the Commercial segment. On the other hand, the increase in Medicare Advantage is attributed to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans, while the rise in Medicaid is linked to states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, as stated in [10]. The decline in the Global segment is explained by increased unemployment and underwriting discipline.\n\nIn summary, the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare decreased in the Commercial and Global segments but increased in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid segments from 2019 to 2020, driven by economic factors like unemployment and policy changes related to COVID-19."}

These factors directly impacted the company's equity position. \n\nSecondly, ![ExxonMobil Share of Equity](image2) provides a comprehensive view of the changes in various components of equity.

The statement of changes in equity (image1) shows the following key points:\n\n- **Share Capital**: Remained constant at RMB2 million for both years.\n- **Additional Paid-in Capital**: Increased from RMB35,044 million in 2020 to RMB36,238 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to the exercise of share options and restricted share units (RSUs), as shown in image1.\n- **Treasury Shares**: Decreased from RMB(134) million in 2020 to RMB(3,660) million in 2021, indicating a substantial repurchase of shares during 2021.\n- **Other Reserves**: Slightly decreased from RMB6,300 million in 2020 to RMB3,726 million in 2021.\n- **Retained Earnings**: Increased significantly from RMB11,111 million in 2020 to RMB14,194 million in 2021, reflecting the company's profitability and retained profits.\n- **Total Equity Attributable to Equity Holders**: Decreased slightly from RMB52,731 million in 2020 to RMB51,055 million in 2021, mainly due to the large increase in treasury shares.\n\n### Major Transactions Affecting Equity Changes\n\nThe major transactions affecting these changes are detailed in image1 and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Exercise of Share Options/Restricted Share Units (RSUs)**: In 2021, the company issued additional shares through the exercise of RSUs, increasing the Additional Paid-in Capital by RMB659 million and Retained Earnings by RMB48 million.\n- **Repurchase of Shares**: The company repurchased a significant number of shares in 2021, reducing Treasury Shares by RMB3,561 million.\n- **Non-controlling Interests**: There was an increase in non-controlling interests from RMB486 million in 2020 to RMB738 million in 2021, likely due to acquisitions or investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the equity components of Tencent Music Entertainment Group experienced notable changes between 2020 and 2021, driven by the exercise of share options, significant share repurchases, and adjustments in non-controlling interests. These transactions reflect the company's strategic decisions regarding capital structure and shareholder value. ![{Equity components changed with share repurchases and option exercises}](image1)\n\nThe major transactions affecting these changes include the exercise of share options, repurchase of shares, and adjustments in non-controlling interests."}

According to [1], the Media segment revenue increased by $20.3\\%$ in 2021 compared to 2020, reaching $22.8 billion. This growth was significantly influenced by the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which contributed $1.8 billion to the revenue. Excluding this event, the revenue still saw an increase of $11.0\\%$, driven by distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue streams. The Studios segment also experienced a $16.2\\%$ revenue increase to $9.4 billion due to content licensing, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment. Additionally, the Theme Parks segment showed a substantial revenue increase of $141.2\\%$ to $5.1 billion, reflecting the reopening of theme parks after COVID-19 closures.\n\n![{Total customer relationships decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021}](image1) illustrates the total customer relationships for NBCUniversal. Despite a slight decrease in 2021, the overall number remained relatively stable, indicating that NBCUniversal maintained its customer base during this period. This stability is crucial for sustaining revenue streams, especially in direct-to-consumer services.\n\nFurthermore, ![{Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased significantly from 2020 to 2021}](image2) shows a significant increase in average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship, rising from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021. This increase can be attributed to factors such as rate adjustments, higher sales of wireless handsets, and an overall market recovery post-COVID-19, as mentioned in [7] and [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021 was positively impacted by robust revenue growth across various segments and a stable customer base with increasing average revenue per customer relationship. The company successfully navigated through the challenges posed by the pandemic and capitalized on opportunities like the Tokyo Olympics and market recovery."}

This indicates strong demand and adoption of Salesforce's platform services.\n\nNext, let's consider the cost of revenues. According to [5], the total cost of revenues increased by $784 million from 2019 to 2020. However, this figure encompasses all service categories, not just 'Salesforce Platform and Other'. To get a more precise understanding, we should examine the subscription and support costs, which are closely related to cloud service offerings like the Salesforce Platform. Image5 shows that the subscription and support costs rose from $2,604 million in 2019 to $3,198 million in 2020, an increase of $594 million. Given that the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' is part of the subscription and support category, it is reasonable to infer that a portion of this cost increase is attributable to the growth in this specific category.\n\nThe significant revenue growth in the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, coupled with a corresponding rise in subscription and support costs, suggests that while the company is investing heavily in delivering these services, it is also generating substantial returns. This positive trend likely contributes positively to the overall financial performance by increasing the gross margin, as evidenced by the shift in business mix towards higher-margin cloud services mentioned in [2].\n\nIn summary, the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category experienced robust revenue growth of 57% from 2019 to 2020, accompanied by a proportional increase in subscription and support costs. This growth is indicative of strong market demand and successful customer acquisition strategies, ultimately enhancing the company's overall financial performance. ![{Revenue and cost trends for Salesforce Platform and Other}](image3)"}

This indicates a decrease in overall debt, which may be related to lease obligations. Additionally, ![Operating and finance lease costs for 2021, 2020, and 2019](image6) shows that operating lease costs decreased from $2,551 in 2020 to $2,199 in 2021, while finance lease costs remained relatively stable at $66 in both years.

This decline is attributed to lower loan demand, including reduced line utilization and higher paydowns [3]. The Home Lending sector experienced a significant drop of $44,140 million (16%), reflecting actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations [8]. Similarly, Personal Lending saw a decrease of $1,101 million (18%).

According to [4], credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility, an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, and other factors such as lending commitments and equity investments. The image2 shows that the total change in credit risk RWA for the Standardized Approach was $44,382 million, while for the Advanced Approach it was $56,003 million. These increases reflect higher risk exposure and thus necessitate a larger capital buffer to maintain regulatory compliance.\n\nNext, let's look at the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA. Image5 indicates that the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. Despite this decrease, the actual amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020. This suggests that while the proportion of TLAC relative to RWA has slightly reduced, the absolute amount of TLAC has grown, which is beneficial for the institution's loss-absorbing capacity.\n\nThe impact on the overall capital structure can be seen in image3 and image4. Image3 shows an increase in Common Equity Tier 1 capital from $64,751 million in 2019 to $78,650 million in 2020, indicating a strengthening of the core capital base. Image4 reveals that despite the increase in RWA, the capital ratios remained robust. For instance, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was 16.4% in 2019 and 16.9% in 2020, showing resilience in the face of rising risks.\n\nIn conclusion, the increases in Credit Risk RWA and the slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA did not negatively affect the financial institution's overall capital structure. Instead, the institution bolstered its capital base, maintaining strong capital ratios and enhancing its ability to absorb losses, as evidenced by the growth in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and the increase in the absolute amount of External TLAC. ![{External TLAC increased in absolute terms but slightly decreased as a percentage of RWA}](image5)"}

The unused tax losses without a deferred tax asset recognition were $2,693,000 in 2020 compared to $1,063,000 in 2019, indicating an increase in unutilized tax losses. This suggests a potential decrease in expected future taxable profits.\n\nThe image `![Deferred tax assets increased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image1)` shows a significant rise in deferred tax assets from $6,391,000 in 2019 to $9,449,000 in 2020. This increase could be due to higher temporary differences or expectations of utilizing these assets in the future. \n\nFurther, `![The net deferred tax assets also show a substantial increase from 2019 to 2020](image2)` confirms the overall growth in deferred tax assets. However, the deferred tax expense increased from $(1,792) in 2019 to $393 in 2020, as shown in the same image. This indicates a shift in the company's tax position, possibly due to changes in tax laws or reassessment of tax liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, `![The effective tax rate (ETR) for global operations rose sharply from 29.6% in 2019 to 46.2% in 2020](image4)` highlights a significant increase in the ETR, reflecting a higher proportion of profit being taxed. This could be attributed to various factors such as changes in the geographical mix of earnings or alterations in tax rates in different jurisdictions.\n\n### Impairment Charges Analysis\n\n[7] mentions that during the year ended 28 June 2020, impairment charges of $6,117,000 ($5,434,000 after tax) were recorded, primarily due to exiting the Spanish market and write-downs of fixed assets within the store network. In contrast, there were no impairment charges in 2019.\n\nThis is corroborated by `![Impairment charges related to the exit from the Spanish market and other store impairments amounted to $6,117,000 in 2020](image6)`, which breaks down the impairment charges into two categories: those pertaining to the Spanish market exit ($3,360,000) and other store impairment charges ($2,757,000).

Additionally, substantial impairment charges were recorded in 2020, primarily due to the decision to exit the Spanish market and associated write-downs."}

The \"Customer relationships\" category also saw a slight increase from $1,789 to $1,797. \n\n![{The table shows the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization for intangible assets with determinable lives for 2022 and 2021}](image7)\n\nNext, we consider the amortization expenses. Image1 provides the intangible asset amortization figures, showing that the expense decreased slightly from $318 in 2021 to $312 in 2022. This decrease in amortization expense despite an increase in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets suggests that the new additions to the intangible assets may have longer useful lives or lower amortization rates compared to the existing assets.\n\n![{The table shows the intangible asset amortization for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020}](image1)\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that the accumulated amortization also increased from $(6,100) in 2021 to $(6,273) in 2022, as shown in image7. This indicates that while new intangible assets were added, the company continued to amortize its existing assets, leading to a higher accumulated amortization figure.\n\nIn summary, Procter & Gamble's intangible assets with determinable lives increased from 2021 to 2022, particularly in the \"Brands\" category, but the overall amortization expense decreased slightly. This suggests that the new intangible assets added may have different amortization profiles compared to the existing ones."}

According to [4], the Firm sponsors various employee deferred cash-based compensation programs. The image ![Deferred cash-based awards increased from $1,174 million in 2018 to $1,263 million in 2020](image1) shows that the deferred cash-based awards have been increasing steadily, with a slight dip in 2019 before rising again in 2020. This trend aligns with the text stating that for the 2020 performance year, deferred cash-based compensation was awarded to a reduced group of eligible employees compared to the prior year, but still resulted in an overall increase.\n\nNext, examining the total recognized compensation expense, image ![Total recognized compensation expense has grown significantly from $1,126 million in 2018 to $2,119 million in 2020](image4) reveals a substantial increase over the three years. This growth is attributed to several factors mentioned in [6] and [8], including higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts linked to investment performance, and incremental compensation due to the E*TRADE acquisition. These factors collectively contributed to the significant rise in compensation expenses.\n\nRegarding the projected future compensation obligations, [5] indicates that the table presents a rollforward of the estimated obligation for existing deferred cash-based compensation awards. Image ![The projected future compensation obligation is expected to be $1,601 million, with $680 million recognized in 2021, $312 million in 2022, and $609 million thereafter](image5) provides a detailed breakdown of these projections.

This decrease was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. The image4 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes, showing significant decreases in interest income across various categories such as loans and leases, debt securities, and trading account assets. For instance, residential mortgage interest income decreased by $313 million, home equity by $904 million, and credit card by $1,407 million. These figures reflect the impact of lower interest rates on different segments of the bank's operations.\n\nIn contrast, the change from 2018 to 2019 shows a net increase in interest income by $714 million, indicating a more favorable interest rate environment during that period. The image4 also highlights the volume and rate changes contributing to this increase, with positive contributions from U.S. commercial loans, non-U.S. commercial loans, and other earning assets.\n\nRegarding net interest expense, the image4 reveals a substantial decrease of $14,120 million from 2019 to 2020, driven by lower interest-bearing deposit costs and reduced short-term borrowings. This reflects Bank of America's effective management of its funding costs amidst a challenging interest rate environment. Comparatively, the net increase in interest expense from 2018 to 2019 was $3,738 million, indicating higher funding costs during that period.\n\nThese changes are closely tied to the organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in ![image2](image2). The bank operates through four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with remaining operations recorded in All Other. Each segment has distinct activities and products, influencing the overall financial performance. For example, the Consumer Banking segment, which includes deposits and consumer lending, experienced significant changes in net interest income and expense, as shown in ![image1](image1). The decline in net interest income and increase in provision for credit losses in this segment reflect the broader economic challenges faced by the bank.\n\nIn conclusion, the major differences in changes of net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 were primarily driven by lower interest rates and effective cost management, reflecting the diverse and segmented operational structure of Bank of America."}

According to [6], interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. This decline is further illustrated in image2, which shows a significant decrease in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021.\n\nRegarding the asset composition, image1 provides a clear picture of the changes.

Fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021. These shifts are also reflected in image4, where the carrying value of fixed maturity securities dropped slightly, indicating a reduction in this type of investment.\n\nThe implications of these changes could be multifaceted. The increase in cash and cash equivalents suggests a strategy prioritizing liquidity and safety over yield, as mentioned in [6]. This approach might be a response to the low-interest-rate environment that prevailed through 2021. The rise in equity securities could indicate a strategic move to capitalize on potential market gains, although it also introduces higher volatility into the portfolio, as noted in [9]. The decline in fixed maturity securities may reflect a shift away from lower-yielding assets in favor of more liquid or potentially higher-return investments.\n\nIn conclusion, the insurance business experienced a significant drop in net investment income and a reconfiguration of its asset mix from 2020 to 2021, with an emphasis on liquidity and equity investments. ![{Cash and equity securities increased while fixed maturity securities decreased}](image1)"}

According to [5], U.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, a significant improvement from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. This increase was driven by higher realizations, absence of impairments and write-offs, higher sales volumes, and asset sales gains. Similarly, [6] indicates that international upstream reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $825 million in 2020, mainly due to higher realizations and the absence of previous year's impairments and write-offs. These improvements are also reflected in ![Total Upstream earnings increased significantly from a loss in 2020 to substantial profits in 2021](image1), showing a total upstream earnings jump from $(2,433) million in 2020 to $15,818 million in 2021.\n\nMoving on to the downstream segment, [2] notes that international downstream earned $525 million in 2021, down from $618 million in 2020, primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses. However, [9] highlights that U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, a considerable improvement from a loss of $571 million in 2020, attributed to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes. The combined effect is shown in ![Total Downstream earnings saw a significant recovery in 2021 after a major dip in 2020](image1), where total downstream earnings went from just $47 million in 2020 to $2,914 million in 2021.\n\nThese trends in both upstream and downstream segments had a profound impact on Chevron's overall net income.

According to [9], the U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million. This information is corroborated by ![{U.S. downstream earnings increased significantly from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021}](image12), which shows that the earnings shifted from a negative value in 2020 to a positive value in 2021. Comparing this with 2019, where the earnings were $1.559 billion, it can be seen that despite the dip in 2020, the earnings in 2021 surpassed the 2019 levels.\n\nNext, let's look at the international downstream sector. [5] states that international downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared with $618 million in 2020. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million between periods. This is reflected in ![{International downstream earnings decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021}](image6). When comparing with 2019, where the earnings were $922 million, it is evident that the earnings in 2021 were lower than in 2019.\n\nThe significant factors affecting these changes include:\n\n- **Higher margins and sales volumes:** For the U.S. downstream, higher margins on refined product sales and higher sales volumes contributed positively to earnings. This is supported by ![{Total refined product sales increased significantly in 2021}](image11), which shows an increase in gasoline and other refined product sales.\n  \n- **Operating expenses and foreign currency effects:** For the international downstream, higher operating expenses and lower margins negatively impacted earnings, although there was a favorable swing in foreign currency effects. This is shown in ![{Operating expenses increased slightly in 2021}](image4).\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. downstream earnings increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, driven by higher margins and sales volumes, while the international downstream earnings decreased slightly, affected by higher operating expenses and lower margins."}

This substantial increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Net Income**: The net income rose from €1,423 million in 2020 to €1,746 million in 2021, as shown in image5. This growth reflects improved operational performance.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income**: There was a notable shift in other comprehensive income, which includes items like currency translation differences and cash flow hedges. In 2020, this component resulted in a loss of €598 million, whereas in 2021, it contributed positively with €700 million. This change indicates favorable foreign exchange movements and effective hedging strategies in 2021.\n\n### Balance Sheet Component Differences\n\nAnalyzing the balance sheet changes using [5] and image2 reveals significant shifts:\n\n- **Total Assets**: Total assets grew from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021. This substantial increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Varian, as mentioned in [3], which added significant value to the company's asset base.\n- **Current Assets**: Current assets saw a rise from €10,268 million in 2020 to €10,824 million in 2021. This increase is driven by higher trade and other receivables and contract assets, reflecting stronger business operations.\n- **Liabilities**: Total liabilities also increased from €12,584 million in 2020 to €25,823 million in 2021. This rise is mainly due to an increase in long-term financial debt, which was used to finance the Varian acquisition, as detailed in [7].\n- **Equity**: Despite the increase in liabilities, equity rose from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021. This growth is attributed to the capital increase in March 2021, as noted in [5].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key differences lie in the significant improvement in comprehensive income and the substantial expansion of the balance sheet, particularly in total assets and liabilities, driven by strategic acquisitions and financing activities. \n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income of Siemens Healthineers AG increased from €825 million in 2020 to €2,446 million in 2021, while its total assets grew from €25,094 million to €42,162 million over the same period. ![{image5 shows the comprehensive income details}](image5) ![{image2 provides the balance sheet components}](image2)"}

Net cash provided by operating activities saw a decrease of $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [7]. This decline was partially due to higher working capital requirements, particularly inventory build-up related to the COVID-19 pandemic [5].

According to [6], in 2021, the company generated $21.5 billion of net income compared with $3.4 billion in 2020. This increase can be attributed to several factors including higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory fees, as well as lower operating losses and restructuring charges.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet data, ![Total loans decreased while total deposits increased](image4) shows that total loans by line of business decreased from $379,766 million in 2019 to $333,885 million in 2021, a decrease of 11%.

Conversely, total deposits saw a substantial increase from $629,110 million in 2019 to $834,739 million in 2021, an increase of 16%. This growth in deposits is driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings among consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [3].\n\nFurthermore, the key changes in loans and deposits are also reflected in the specific categories. For instance, Home Lending loans decreased significantly from $276,962 million in 2019 to $224,446 million in 2021, a drop of 16%, influenced by actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations [9].

Similarly, net interest income declined by about $1,009 million.\n\nThese trends have significant implications for the company's financial performance. The decline in average Card Member loans suggests a reduction in the volume of outstanding credit extended to customers, which can be attributed to various factors such as higher paydown rates [2]. This is further supported by the text stating that \"Net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances\" [6].\n\nMoreover, the drop in net interest income indicates a lower return on these loans, impacting the company's profitability. However, it is important to note that despite the decline in net interest income, the company managed to maintain its overall financial health through other revenue streams. For instance, non-interest revenues increased significantly, with Discount revenue growing by 21% [5] and total revenues net of interest expense increasing by 17% year-over-year [6]. This growth was driven by an increase in commercial billed business and higher travel-related revenues, reflecting the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic [5].\n\nIn conclusion, while the average Card Member loans and net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021, the company mitigated the impact on its financial performance through robust growth in non-interest revenues and improved portfolio quality, leading to reserve releases and lower provisions for credit losses [2]."}

According to [4], management estimates and assumptions play a crucial role in financial reporting. In this context, share-based compensation is an important factor. The image5 shows that for the year ended August 31, 2020, share-based compensation expense was $1,118,284. This amount is recorded as an expense, reducing net income but increasing additional paid-in capital, which ultimately contributes positively to total shareholders' equity.

Image2 provides detailed information about the company's cash flows. For the year 2020, the net cash provided by operating activities was $8,215,152. This significant positive cash flow indicates strong operational performance and liquidity. The major components contributing to this figure include net income ($5,185,313), adjustments like depreciation and amortization ($1,773,124), and changes in working capital items. This robust cash generation supports the company's ability to fund operations, invest in growth opportunities, and manage its financial obligations, thereby enhancing its overall cash position.\n\nIn summary, share-based compensation increases Accenture plc's shareholders' equity by boosting additional paid-in capital, while strong cash flow from operating activities significantly bolsters the company's cash position. Therefore, both factors are vital contributors to Accenture plc's financial health in 2020.\n\nAccenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position for the year 2020 were positively influenced by share-based compensation and strong cash flow from operating activities."}

According to [3], there was a significant increase in equity by €2,641 million due to various factors. The capital increase in March 2021 contributed €53 million to subscribed capital and €2,284 million to capital reserves. Additionally, the net income for the year added €497 million to unappropriated net income, despite the dividend payout of €856 million. This is further supported by ![{Equity increased significantly with contributions from capital increases and net income}](image3), which shows that total equity rose from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021. The rise in treasury shares, as mentioned in [5] and shown in ![{Treasury shares increased significantly}](image3), also played a role, reflecting the company's share repurchase activities.\n\nRegarding liabilities, the text does not provide detailed information, but the images offer insights. ![{Current liabilities increased significantly}](image5) illustrates a substantial rise in current liabilities from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021. This increase can be attributed to higher other current financial liabilities, current provisions, and current income tax liabilities. Similarly, ![{Non-current liabilities also saw a considerable increase}](image6) reveals an increase in non-current liabilities from €969 million in 2020 to €2,686 million in 2021, driven mainly by deferred tax liabilities.\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers experienced a notable increase in both equity and liabilities from 2020 to 2021. The key components driving these changes were capital increases, net income, and share repurchases for equity, while higher financial obligations and tax liabilities contributed to the growth in liabilities."}

This reduction is primarily attributed to a decline in cash and cash equivalents from $32.965 billion in 2020 to $22.028 billion in 2021 [10]. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is further supported by the cash flow statement depicted in ![Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2021 were $22,028 million, down from $32,965 million in 2020](image2). It shows that the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was $10.937 billion, mainly due to higher cash outflows from financing activities such as share repurchases and dividend payments.\n\nOn the other hand, the **total liabilities** also experienced a slight decrease from $168.383 billion in 2020 to $166.371 billion in 2021, as illustrated in ![Total liabilities decreased by $2.012 billion from $168.4 billion in 2020 to $166.4 billion in 2021](image3). This change is largely influenced by a reduction in long-term debt from $42.952 billion in 2020 to $38.675 billion in 2021 [10], which aligns with the cash flow statement's data on the repayment of long-term debt.\n\nThese changes in assets and liabilities are closely related to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows. The comprehensive income statement, as seen in ![Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) decreased from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021](image4), indicates an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.945 billion in 2021 compared to $2.895 billion in 2020. This suggests that despite the decrease in total assets, the entity faced additional losses not recognized in the net income but impacting shareholders' equity.\n\nIn summary, the entity experienced a decrease in both total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by reductions in cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt. These changes correlate with the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows, reflecting a period of financial adjustments and strategic decisions regarding liquidity and debt management."}

According to [1], W&P was formed by combining Global Private Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management. From ![{Retail Banking and Wealth Management had a combined net operating income of $20,756 million in 2020}](image1), Retail Banking and Wealth Management together contributed a net operating income of $20,756 million in 2020. On the other hand, CMB's net operating income can be derived from ![{Commercial Banking had a net operating income of $13,312 million in 2020}](image2), which shows that CMB had a net operating income of $13,312 million in 2020. Therefore, W&P generated significantly higher net operating income than CMB in 2020.\n\nNext, let's examine the profit before tax. The adjusted profit before tax for the entire bank is shown in ![{The adjusted profit before tax for the entire bank was $1.9 billion in 2020}](image3). While this figure represents the overall performance, it does not break down the profit between W&P and CMB. However, considering the substantial difference in net operating income, it is reasonable to infer that W&P likely contributed more to the overall profit before tax compared to CMB.\n\nIn conclusion, HSBC's Wealth and Personal Banking outperformed Commercial Banking in terms of net operating income in 2020, generating a significantly higher amount. Although specific profit before tax figures for each segment are not provided, the disparity in net operating income suggests that W&P also likely had a greater contribution to the overall profit before tax."}

According to [4], any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2021. This indicates that leasehold improvements might have been impacted by changes in lease terms. Image4 shows the detailed breakdown of costs and accumulated depreciation for leasehold improvements. The balance at 1 July 2019 was $61,252,000, and by 28 June 2020, it increased to $78,810,000. The additions during the year were $23,139,000, while disposals amounted to $4,052,000. ![{The image shows the cost and accumulated depreciation details for leasehold improvements, hardware and software, and fixtures and fittings}](image4) These figures suggest that despite disposals, there were significant additions contributing to the overall increase in carrying amount.\n\nNext, regarding hardware and software, Image4 also provides relevant data. The balance at 1 July 2019 was $6,093,000, which decreased slightly to $6,759,000 by 28 June 2020. Additions were $1,074,000, and disposals were $273,000.

The company continually assesses potential adjustments based on ongoing examinations. This indicates a consistent focus on managing tax liabilities and uncertainties.\n\nImage8 provides a detailed breakdown of the expected income tax provision at the federal statutory tax rate for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. It shows a significant decrease in the effective tax rate from 41% in 2019 to 9% in 2020 and then to 12% in 2021. This trend suggests that Qualcomm has been able to reduce its tax burden over these years, possibly due to various tax benefits and deductions.\n\n### Significant Changes in Tax Benefits\n\n[6] mentions a substantial tax benefit of $570 million recorded in fiscal 2019 due to check-the-box elections made by foreign subsidiaries. However, this was offset by a $2.5 billion charge in fiscal 2019 due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to intellectual property distribution. This highlights a major fluctuation in tax benefits during this period.\n\nImage8 also reveals other notable changes:\n- In 2019, there was a large benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets ($570 million) but was significantly impacted by the derecognition of a deferred tax asset ($2.472 billion).\n- In 2020, the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards decreased substantially compared to 2019.\n- In 2021, the benefit from the FDII deduction and research and development tax credits were lower than in previous years.\n\n### Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nImage6 illustrates the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The total gross deferred tax assets increased from $3,595 million in 2020 to $4,227 million in 2021, while the valuation allowance also increased, leading to a net deferred tax asset of $1,527 million in 2021. This indicates an increase in potential future tax benefits but also a higher level of uncertainty regarding their realization.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nQualcomm experienced significant fluctuations in its tax provisions and benefits between 2019 and 2021. While the effective tax rate decreased notably, reflecting successful tax management strategies, there were also substantial one-time events impacting tax benefits, such as the derecognition of deferred tax assets and changes in deferred tax positions. The overall trend suggests a complex interplay of tax planning, regulatory impacts, and financial performance influencing Qualcomm's tax position.\n\nThe significant change in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 includes a decreasing effective tax rate and substantial one-time tax benefits and charges affecting the company's financial statements."}

The sale resulted in a net gain of $269 million, which positively impacted noninterest income, as noted in [2]. However, the loss of ongoing fee income from WFAM led to lower asset-based fees, as highlighted in [3]. This reduction in recurring revenue is likely to have a long-term effect on the company's income generation capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the sale influenced the balance sheet by reducing the overall size of the company's assets. As seen in ![{Significant changes in balance sheet components post-WFAM sale}](image3), there were notable decreases in certain asset categories like loans and deposits, reflecting the divestiture of WFAM and its associated assets.\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, led to a substantial decline in the total assets under management and had both positive and negative impacts on the company's income and balance sheet."}

According to [6], net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The primary driver of this decrease was lower interest rates, which reduced the net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent for 2020. This is further supported by image5, which shows that the average balance of loans and leases increased slightly from $958.416 billion in 2019 to $982.467 billion in 2020, but the yield on these loans decreased significantly from 4.52% to 3.48%. Additionally, the yield on debt securities also decreased from 3.56% to 2.83%.\n\nNext, let's examine the net interest expense. Image2 provides detailed information on the changes in interest expense. The total interest expense decreased by $14,120 million from 2019 to 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on various types of deposits and borrowings. For example, the interest expense on U.S. interest-bearing deposits decreased by $4,643 million, and the interest expense on long-term debt decreased by $2,998 million.\n\nThe net interest spread is calculated as the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Image5 shows that the net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020. This decrease can be attributed to the larger decline in the yield on earning assets compared to the decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nIn summary, the main contributing factors to the decrease in the net interest spread were the significant reduction in the yield on loans and leases and debt securities, driven by lower interest rates, and the smaller decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. \n\nTherefore, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 resulted in a decrease in the net interest spread, primarily due to the larger decline in the yield on earning assets compared to the decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. ![Net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020](image5)"}

The key adjustments include:\n  - Amortization of intangible assets: USD 67 million.\n  - Acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items: USD 42 million.\n  - Other items: USD -134 million.\n  - These adjustments led to a core operating loss of USD -691 million.\n\n- ![{Image showing Sandoz's financial adjustments for 2020}](image5) shows the adjustments for 2020.

This indicates a significant change in how intangible assets were treated between the two years.\n\n2. **Acquisition or Divestment of Businesses and Related Items**: In 2021, this adjustment was positive at USD 42 million, whereas in 2020, it was also positive but lower at USD 16 million.

This increase suggests the company faces growing uncertainty related to its tax positions, potentially leading to higher tax expenses if these positions are not upheld.\n\nSecondly, concerning **common share repurchases**, [2] states that during the fourth quarter of 2020, the company repurchased 5.1 million shares at an average price of $334.54 per share. The image `![{The company repurchased fewer shares in 2020 compared to 2019 but at a higher average price}](image1)` provides more detailed information: the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million, compared to 22 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million. Although the number of shares repurchased decreased, the higher average price per share indicates the company invested more capital per share, reflecting a strategic decision possibly influenced by market conditions or internal capital allocation priorities.\n\n**Implications for Financial Position**: The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits implies greater financial risk associated with potential tax liabilities, which could negatively impact profitability if not resolved favorably. On the other hand, the shift in share repurchase strategy, with fewer but more expensive shares being bought back, may signal a focus on maintaining shareholder value despite higher costs, potentially affecting liquidity and cash flow. Overall, these changes suggest the company is navigating complex financial landscapes, balancing tax uncertainties with shareholder returns.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased, and it repurchased fewer shares at a higher price in 2020 compared to 2019, indicating evolving strategies in managing tax risks and optimizing shareholder value."}

This is further supported by [4], which notes that North America sales specifically saw a 29% increase due to these factors. Additionally, [2] highlights that EAME sales also rose by 24%, influenced by similar reasons. The favorable price realization mentioned in [8] and [10] contributed positively to the overall sales growth.\n\nRegarding operating profit, [7] states that it increased by $231 million, or 17%, to $1.611 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Higher manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income. The Financial Products segment's profit also increased by 27%, as noted in [3], mainly due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower provision for credit losses.\n\nVisually, ![{Sales volume was the primary driver of revenue growth}](image1) illustrates that sales volume was the main contributor to the increase in consolidated sales and revenues, with a significant positive impact of $2,049 million. Price realization added another $507 million, while currency effects had a minor negative impact of $29 million. Financial products revenues contributed an additional $36 million.\n\nSimilarly, ![{Operating profit was positively impacted by sales volume and financial products but negatively affected by manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D}](image4) shows the components affecting the change in consolidated operating profit. Sales volume provided a substantial boost of $687 million, while price realization added $507 million. However, manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses reduced the profit by $816 million and $272 million, respectively. Financial products contributed $63 million, and other factors added $110 million.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in sales volume and operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 was largely driven by higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and contributions from the financial products segment, despite higher manufacturing and administrative costs."}

According to [3], risk-based capital regulatory minimums are calculated under Basel 3 standards. The image `![{Total capital ratio increased from 16.1% to 16.6%}](image2)` shows that the total capital ratio under the Standardized Approach increased from 16.1% on December 31, 2019, to 16.6% on December 31, 2020.

This restructuring aimed at enhancing service delivery and customer support during challenging times like the pandemic. The text also mentions a decline in performance due to lower interest rates, reduced customer activity, and increased expected credit loss charges.\n\nThe financial data from ![{Adjusted results for 2020 show a significant decrease in net operating income and profit before tax}](image2) further supports this narrative.

This change led to the initial recognition of a lease liability amounting to $143,621,000 as shown in ![{Recognition of lease liability on initial application of AASB 16}](image2). The lease liabilities were measured at the present value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate [8].

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for ClickSoftware was approximately $1.4 billion. \n\nThe image data also provides a detailed view of the fair value allocation for ClickSoftware:\n- ![Net assets acquired amounting to $1,386 million](image5) outlines the fair value of various assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, goodwill, intangible assets, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, unearned revenue, and deferred tax liability.\n\n### Similarities\n\nBoth acquisitions involved the transfer of significant net assets, as evidenced by the substantial amounts recorded for goodwill and intangible assets. In both cases, the fair values assigned to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions and may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized ([3] and [4]).\n\n### Differences\n\nThe most notable difference lies in the scale of the acquisitions. The ClickSoftware acquisition had a significantly higher fair value of consideration transferred ($1.4 billion) compared to the Salesforce.org acquisition. This is reflected in the larger net assets acquired for ClickSoftware ($1,386 million) versus Salesforce.org ($134 million).\n\nAdditionally, the composition of the net assets differs. For instance, ClickSoftware has a much higher allocation to goodwill ($1,132 million) compared to Salesforce.org ($164 million). Similarly, the intangible assets for ClickSoftware are valued at $276 million, which is considerably higher than the developed technology and customer relationships recorded for MapAnything in [5].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while both acquisitions share similarities in terms of the methodology used for fair value allocation and the presence of significant goodwill and intangible assets, the ClickSoftware acquisition was substantially larger in scale and had a different composition of net assets acquired compared to the Salesforce.org acquisition."}

The difference between these two percentages can be attributed to the items affecting comparability, such as restructuring and impairment charges and inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges.\n\nIn summary, the reported GAAP measure for PBNA decreased from $2,179 million in 2019 to $1,937 million in 2020, influenced by restructuring and impairment charges and inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges. The core non-GAAP measure decreased from $2,230 million in 2019 to $2,050 million in 2020, with a smaller decrease due to the exclusion of these items affecting comparability. ![The table shows the reported GAAP measure and core non-GAAP measure for PBNA in 2020 and 2019, along with the items affecting comparability](image4)\n\nTherefore, the reported GAAP measure and the core non-GAAP measure for PBNA both decreased from 2019 to 2020, with the reported GAAP measure being more significantly impacted by items affecting comparability."}

According to [3], PMI’s operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of trade receivables sold and derecognized. The cumulative trade receivables sold for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, were $11.5 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. This is further supported by ![image2](), which shows that net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to higher working capital requirements and asset impairment costs.\n\nNext, we look at the net cash used in investing activities. As stated in [9], the net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and reduced cash outflows resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019. ![image2]() confirms this with a detailed breakdown showing a significant reduction in deconsolidation-related cash outflows in 2020.\n\nFinally, regarding financing activities, [4] indicates that the net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends paid. This is corroborated by ![image3](), which details the specific amounts related to dividends paid and payments to noncontrolling interests.\n\nCombining these insights, the overall cash balance at the end of 2020 was $7,285 million, as shown in ![image3](). Despite a slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and an increase in net cash used in financing activities, the reduction in net cash used in investing activities helped mitigate the negative impact on the overall cash balance.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities from 2019 to 2020 resulted in a final cash balance of $7,285 million at the end of 2020."}

According to [2], GWIM consists of Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank. The image ![Revenue and client balances data for MLGWM and Bank of America Private Bank](image2) shows that the total revenue for GWIM decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020, a decline of about 5%. This decrease can be attributed to lower interest rates impacting the Bank of America Private Bank's revenue as mentioned in [5]. Despite this, client balances increased significantly by 10% to $3.3 trillion at the end of 2020, primarily due to higher market valuations and positive client flows as stated in [6].\n\nNow, turning our attention to the Consumer Banking segment, the image ![Financial performance details for Consumer Banking](image3) reveals that the net income for Consumer Banking decreased from $4,251 million in 2019 to $3,075 million in 2020, a substantial drop of 28%. This decline is explained in [8] as being primarily due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and higher expenses. Specifically, net interest income fell by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion because of lower interest rates, while noninterest income also decreased by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion due to various factors including lower service charges and card income.\n\nIn summary, both segments experienced declines in revenue and net income between 2020 and 2019, but the Consumer Banking segment saw a more significant drop in net income compared to the GWIM segment."}

In 2020, the company recognized $25 million of restructuring charges primarily for severance and benefit costs associated with its Embedded Processing business [5]. This is a significant increase from the restructuring charge of $24 million in the second quarter of 2020, as shown in image4 ![{Restructuring charges were $24 million in Q2 2020}](image4). The balance sheet also reflects these charges, showing a restructuring charge of $25 million in 2020, which led to an end-of-year balance of $18 million after payments of $8 million [5] ![{The restructuring charges resulted in a year-end balance of $18 million after payments}](image3).\n\nIn contrast, in 2019, there was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [1], which is a stark difference from the charges incurred in 2020.

Similar to COVID Relief projects, Rural Development Projects are also executed both directly and via implementing agencies such as Sahbhagi Shikshan Kendra and Argh Foundation.\n\nThe key differences in project implementation modes can be observed in the Mode of Implementation column in the tables. For example, in image3, the COVID Relief project in Odisha was implemented through Friends Union for Energizing Lives (indirect mode), whereas in image5, the Rural Development Project in Gujarat was implemented directly. This indicates that while some projects are managed directly by the organization, others rely on partnerships with external agencies for execution.\n\nIn conclusion, both COVID Relief and Rural Development Projects have been implemented across various states with varying amounts spent.

These assumptions can significantly influence the defined benefit obligation (DBO). The sensitivity of these assumptions is further illustrated by image1, which shows the effect on the DBO due to a change of half a percentage point in various factors. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point increased the DBO by €242 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €227 million in 2020. Similarly, an increase in pension progression had a substantial positive impact on the DBO, with a half-percentage-point rise leading to an increase of €158 million in both years.\n\nImage3 provides specific figures related to actuarial gains and losses. In fiscal year 2021, there was a total actuarial loss of €22 million, contrasting with a gain of €67 million in 2020. This shift indicates that changes in demographic and financial assumptions, along with experience gains and losses, negatively impacted the DBO in 2021. Specifically, changes in financial assumptions alone led to a €26 million loss in 2021, compared to a €72 million gain in 2020.\n\nRegarding plan assets, image2 illustrates the composition of assets over the two years. Total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. This growth was primarily driven by increases in fixed income securities, equity securities, and alternative investments. However, despite this asset growth, the funded status could still be affected by adverse developments in actuarial assumptions, as mentioned in [4] and [8].\n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly financial assumptions, had a negative impact on the defined benefit obligation in 2021, resulting in a total actuarial loss of €22 million. Meanwhile, plan assets grew overall, but their funded status remained vulnerable to fluctuations in assumptions and market conditions. \n\nThe direct answer to the question is: Changes in actuarial assumptions, especially financial ones, negatively impacted the defined benefit obligation in 2021, while plan assets saw an overall increase but remained susceptible to assumption and market risks. ![{Discount rate changes significantly affect the defined benefit obligation}](image1)"}

Despite this increase, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA actually decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, as seen in ![{External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% to 47.7%}](image5).\n\nThe decrease in the External TLAC ratio can be attributed to the fact that while TLAC itself increased (from $196,888 million to $216,129 million as per ![{External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million}](image5)), the growth in RWA was proportionally larger. Therefore, even though the absolute amount of TLAC grew, its relative size compared to the expanding RWA diminished, leading to a lower percentage.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in various components of RWA, particularly the significant increases in credit and market risk RWAs, resulted in a larger denominator when calculating the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, causing the ratio to decrease despite an increase in the absolute value of TLAC."}

Despite this decline, franchised revenues only saw a slight decrease of 2%, indicating relative stability in the U.S. market. The U.S. segment's total revenue experienced a modest 2% reduction [image7]. This performance can be attributed to positive sales performance in the U.S., which was somewhat offset by support provided for marketing initiatives like the free Thank You Meals served across the country to first responders and health care workers [1].\n\nOn the other hand, the International Operated Markets segment faced more significant challenges. Company-operated sales plummeted by 19% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image7], reflecting the severe impact of temporary restaurant closures and limited operations due to COVID-19 [3]. Franchised revenues also declined by 14% [image7], contributing to an overall 17% decrease in total revenue for this segment [image7]. The comparable sales in the International Operated segment decreased by 15.0%, primarily driven by negative comparable sales in markets such as France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [4]. ![International Operated Markets segment experienced a 15.0% decrease in comparable sales in 2020](image2)\n\nThe pie charts in image6 illustrate the shift in revenue composition between the U.S. and International segments. In 2020, the U.S. segment accounted for 50% of total revenue, while the International segment represented 41%. This contrasts with 2019, where the U.S. segment held a slightly larger share at 54%, and the International segment had 37%. This suggests that the U.S. market became relatively more important to McDonald's revenue in 2020, likely due to the greater resilience of the U.S. segment during the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, with the U.S. segment showing relative stability and the International segment experiencing substantial declines, largely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated operational disruptions."}

This is corroborated by the data in ![Prolia® experienced a 3% increase in total sales from 2019 to 2020](image2). The U.S. market saw a 3% increase in sales, while the Rest of World (ROW) market had a 4% increase. From 2018 to 2019, the growth was even more significant, with a 17% increase in total sales, driven by an 18% increase in the U.S. and a 14% increase in ROW.\n\n### Neulasta® Sales Trends\n[5] explains that the decreases in global Neulasta® sales for 2020 and 2019 were due to biosimilar competition affecting both net selling price and unit demand. This trend is clearly reflected in ![Neulasta® experienced a 29% decrease in total sales from 2019 to 2020](image5), where both the U.S. and ROW markets saw substantial declines—29% and 28%, respectively. The decline continued from 2018 to 2019, with a 28% drop in total sales, reflecting ongoing competitive pressures.\n\n### Otezla® Sales Trends\nOtezla® was acquired in November 2019, as mentioned in [8], and its sales data starts from 2019. According to ![Otezla® experienced a significant increase in total sales from 2019 to 2020](image4), there was a substantial rise in sales in 2020 compared to 2019.

The ROW market also contributed to the overall growth.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, Prolia® experienced consistent growth from 2018 to 2020, with increasing sales in both the U.S. and ROW markets. Neulasta® faced declining sales due to biosimilar competition, with significant drops observed in both regions over the two years. Otezla®, after its acquisition, showed robust growth in 2020, especially in the U.S. market. \n\nThus, the sales trends for these products varied significantly, influenced by factors such as competition and market dynamics."}

According to [2] and ![{Solar energy systems in service and under construction values for 2020 and 2019}](image2), the solar energy systems in service had a gross value of $6,758 million in 2020 and $6,682 million in 2019. The accumulated depreciation and amortization for these systems were $955 million in 2020 and $723 million in 2019. This means that the net value of solar energy systems decreased slightly from $6,061 million in 2019 to $5,906 million in 2020 due to an increase in accumulated depreciation by $232 million over the year.\n\nNext, let's look at the effect on **property, plant, and equipment**. From ![{Property, plant, and equipment values for 2020 and 2019}](image1), the total gross value of property, plant, and equipment was $17,864 million in 2020 compared to $14,130 million in 2019. However, the accumulated depreciation increased significantly from $3,734 million in 2019 to $5,117 million in 2020. Consequently, the net value of property, plant, and equipment rose from $10,396 million in 2019 to $12,747 million in 2020 despite the higher accumulated depreciation. This indicates that the increase in gross value outpaced the rise in accumulated depreciation.\n\nIn summary, while the accumulated depreciation increased for both solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment from 2019 to 2020, it led to a slight decrease in the net value of solar energy systems but did not prevent an overall increase in the net value of property, plant, and equipment due to a larger increase in their gross value. \n\nThe accumulated depreciation affected the net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment by reducing the former slightly and increasing the latter overall."}

According to [1], other income (expense) increased significantly in fiscal 2020 due to gains from investments. This is reflected in the net income values shown in ![{Net income and other comprehensive income for 2018-2020}](image2). The net income for 2020 was $5,185,313, compared to $4,846,241 in 2019 and $4,214,594 in 2018. These increases in net income directly contribute to retained earnings, which is a component of shareholders' equity.\n\nNext, consider the comprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes not only net income but also other comprehensive income items such as foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in pension plans. As seen in ![{Net income and other comprehensive income for 2018-2020}](image2), the comprehensive income for 2020 was $5,472,296, up from $4,575,086 in 2019 and $3,730,974 in 2018. This increase indicates that factors beyond just net income, like foreign currency translations and defined benefit plans, positively affected shareholders' equity.\n\nNow, let's examine the impact on total shareholders' equity. The consolidated shareholders' equity statements in ![{Shareholders' equity statement for 2018}](image3), ![{Shareholders' equity statement for 2019}](image4), and ![{Shareholders' equity statement for 2020}](image5) show the progression over the years.

The consistent growth in net income and comprehensive income contributed significantly to this upward trend in shareholders' equity.\n\nIn conclusion, Accenture's increasing net income and comprehensive income over the years 2018 to 2020 had a positive impact on its total shareholders' equity, leading to a steady rise in the company's equity position."}

By 2020, Lovisa had successfully entered new markets such as the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, with notable achievements including the opening of 48 stores in the USA and 21 in France [4]. This expansion is further supported by the data in image5, showing a significant jump in store numbers for these countries.\n\nThe key achievements of this period include not only the physical expansion into new territories but also the enhancement of operational efficiency. Image4 highlights the company's strategy to streamline its global supply chain, optimize logistics, and consolidate its supplier base [2]. These efforts have contributed to higher gross margins, as depicted in image3, where the gross margin percentage increased from 74% in FY16 to 80% in FY19 before slightly declining to 77% in FY20 due to external factors like COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the company has also faced several challenges during this period. The fast fashion jewellery sector is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and ever-changing customer preferences [7]. To mitigate these risks, Lovisa has employed a dedicated product team and focused on securing quality retail sites in high pedestrian traffic locations [8][9]. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on the global retail leasing market has been closely monitored, leading to a more cautious approach in entering new markets when appropriate opportunities are not presented [3].\n\nIn conclusion, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy has evolved through a combination of aggressive market entry, operational optimization, and risk mitigation strategies, resulting in significant growth despite facing various challenges. ![{Net working capital increased significantly from 2019 to 2020}](image1)"}

According to [8], NII for 2020 was $27.6bn, a decrease of $2.9bn or 9.5% compared with 2019. This decline is attributed to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by 84bps as mentioned in [1]. However, this reduction was partly offset by an increase in AIEA of $170.1bn or 8.8%. The image data also supports this trend; ![Net interest income decreased significantly from $30,462m in 2019 to $27,578m in 2020](image2) shows that NII dropped from $30,462m in 2019 to $27,578m in 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, interest expense saw a substantial decrease. As stated in [6], interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was down $2.9bn year-on-year, mainly due to lower market interest rates, despite growth in interest-bearing customer accounts. Image data further illustrates this point; ![Interest expense decreased from $(24,233)m in 2019 to $(14,178)m in 2020](image3) indicates a significant drop in interest expense from $(24,233)m in 2019 to $(14,178)m in 2020.\n\nThese changes in NII and interest expense directly influenced the net operating income. Despite the decrease in NII, the substantial reduction in interest expense helped mitigate the negative impact on net operating income. However, as shown in ![Net operating income decreased from $71,024m in 2019 to $63,074m in 2020](image5), the net operating income still declined from $71,024m in 2019 to $63,074m in 2020, reflecting the overall pressure on profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, while the decrease in net interest income negatively impacted profitability, the significant reduction in interest expense partially offset this effect, resulting in a moderate decline in net operating income and overall profitability."}

This decrease is primarily attributed to a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell by $470 million (44.4%) during the same period [2]. The reduction in interest income was mainly due to lower returns from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, influenced by persistently low short-term interest rates throughout 2021. Despite this, dividend income saw a modest increase of $169 million (3.5%), partially offsetting the overall decline in net investment income.\n\n### Railroad Operating Earnings\nIn contrast, railroad operating earnings showed a substantial improvement, increasing by $859 million (13.7%) from 2020 to 2021, as illustrated in ![Railroad operating earnings increased by $859 million (13.7%) from 2020 to 2021](image1). This growth was driven by a combination of factors: higher volumes and average revenue per car/unit, reflecting a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic's adverse effects on transportation demand in 2020 [7]. Specifically, coal revenues surged by 21.5% due to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices, and improved export demand [5]. Additionally, agricultural product revenues rose by 5.8%, supported by greater domestic grain shipments and ethanol-related commodities [10]. These positive trends were further bolstered by productivity improvements that helped mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs and operational expenses [4].\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while net investment income declined due to reduced interest income amid low interest rates, railroad operating earnings rebounded significantly in 2021, driven by increased volumes, higher revenues per unit, and favorable business conditions across key sectors like coal and agriculture."}

This significant reduction is also reflected in Image5, which shows a substantial decrease in the balance of uncertain tax positions from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. The image further details that this reduction was due to settlements with tax authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing taxes.\n\nAdditionally, Image1 provides a detailed breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities. It shows an increase in total deferred tax assets from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, before valuation allowance.

Similar trends can be observed in other regions such as Canada/Other Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania.\n\nThe table also shows that the average production prices for both crude oil and NGL generally declined across all regions from 2018 to 2020.

The increase in noncurrent assets by $3,039 million [4] was driven by strategic investments and asset acquisitions, as shown in ![{Noncurrent assets increased to $116,806 million in 2020}](image2). This growth in assets indicates that IBM is expanding its asset base, which can potentially lead to higher future revenues.\n\nHowever, the long-term debt also saw an increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, as depicted in ![{Long-term debt slightly increased to $54,355 million in 2020}](image2). This suggests that IBM is leveraging more debt to fund these asset acquisitions, which could increase its financial risk if not managed properly.\n\nIn terms of cash flows, the net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020, as illustrated in ![{Operating activities provided $18,197 million in net cash in 2020}](image3). This positive cash flow from operations indicates that IBM's core business is generating sufficient cash to support its operations and investments.\n\nOn the equity side, total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income [7]. However, this decrease was partially offset by increases from net income and common stock. The Global Financing return on equity remained stable at 25.8% in both 2020 and 2019, as shown in ![{Global Financing return on equity was 25.8% in both 2020 and 2019}](image1), indicating that the company is effectively utilizing its equity to generate returns.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the financial changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt between 2019 and 2020 positively affected IBM's overall financial standing by expanding its asset base and generating strong cash flows from operations, despite the slight increase in debt and decrease in equity.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt between 2019 and 2020 positively impacted IBM's overall financial standing."}

According to [4], outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased by $18.9 billion in 2020 to $78.7 billion due to lower retail spending and higher payments. This is corroborated by ![{Credit card purchase volumes declined from $277.852 billion in 2019 to $251.599 billion in 2020}](image2), which shows a decline in credit card purchase volumes. The decrease in credit card usage could indicate that consumers were more cautious with their spending during the pandemic, possibly due to economic uncertainty and government stimulus benefits.\n\nRegarding home equity, [5] states that home equity production for the total Corporation decreased by $3.0 billion in 2020 primarily driven by a decline in applications. This trend is further supported by ![{Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased from $9.755 billion in 2019 to $6.930 billion in 2020}](image4). The reduction in home equity activity might suggest that fewer homeowners were seeking additional financing, potentially reflecting a shift in priorities or concerns about taking on more debt during an uncertain economic period.\n\nIn summary, the decline in both credit card outstandings and home equity production indicates a more conservative approach to borrowing and spending by consumers in 2020, likely influenced by the economic impacts of COVID-19."}

For nickel, the underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021 [1]. This growth was driven by higher nickel prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns in the previous year. The positive investor sentiment and strong demand across various regions further supported nickel prices, despite a brief correction due to an announcement from a major producer [10]. However, unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these gains.\n\nFor coal, the underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, largely due to lower prices and volumes [2]. Specifically, the price impacts net of price-linked costs amounted to US$0.7 billion, while lower volumes reduced EBITDA by US$168 million. Increased controllable cash costs, such as maintenance at Queensland Coal and higher stripping volumes, also contributed to the decline, although cost reduction initiatives partially mitigated these effects [2].\n\nThe image data further illustrates the sensitivity of BHP's financial metrics to commodity price fluctuations ![{Metallurgical coal price has a significant impact on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA}](image1). A $1 increase in the metallurgical coal price leads to a $24 million increase in profit after taxation and a $35 million increase in underlying EBITDA. Similarly, nickel price changes have a notable effect, with a $0.01/lb increase resulting in a $1 million change in both metrics. \n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices directly influence BHP's financial performance, with nickel benefiting from higher prices and volumes, and coal facing challenges from lower prices and increased costs. The key drivers include market demand, production volumes, operational costs, and exchange rates."}

This decline was due to several factors including lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of the student loan portfolio, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities premium amortization [3]. \n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income saw a substantial increase from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, an increase of $5,120 million. This growth was driven by higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities, realized gains on sales of equity securities, and improved market conditions [7].\n\nThese changes had a significant impact on the total revenue. Despite the decrease in net interest income, the substantial increase in noninterest income led to an overall increase in total revenue from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021, a rise of $3,138 million. The positive contribution from noninterest income more than offset the negative impact of the decline in net interest income, resulting in a 59% increase in total revenue as depicted in the image ![Total revenue changes](image1).\n\nIn conclusion, the total revenue increased significantly from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the substantial growth in noninterest income, which more than compensated for the decline in net interest income."}

The issuance of preferred stock contributed positively to the equity, while the reduced cash flow from financing activities did not hinder the overall growth in equity due to other positive financial activities.

According to [3], the actual compound annual growth rate in EPS over the performance period ended 28 June 2020 was $\\{{\\upharpoonright3\\dot{\\%}}$. This indicates that the performance did not meet the required threshold for vesting, leading to the lapsed unvested options.\n\nTo understand how EBIT growth affects the exercisable percentage, we can refer to the specific hurdles set for EBIT growth as shown in `![{Performance Options vest based on EBIT growth thresholds}](image4)`. The table outlines the following:\n\n- If the EBIT growth is less than the threshold, no options are awarded.\n- At a 17.5% compound growth, 40% of the options become exercisable.\n- A 20% compound growth results in 60% of the options being exercisable.\n- For a 22.5% compound growth, 80% of the options are exercisable.\n- Finally, achieving a 25% compound growth allows for 100% of the options to be exercisable.\n\nThis demonstrates a clear correlation between higher EBIT growth and a greater percentage of options becoming exercisable. Therefore, the better the company performs in terms of EBIT growth, the more incentives become available to the executives.\n\nIn conclusion, EBIT growth directly impacts the exercisable percentage of incentives; higher EBIT growth leads to a higher percentage of options becoming exercisable."}

[3] mentions that the operating margin decreased from 42.5% in 2019 to 38.1% in 2020. This overall decrease can be attributed to various factors such as a decline in sales, higher other operating expenses, and higher G&A costs. Additionally, [4] and [5] provide insights into the specific segments: International Operated Markets and U.S. markets. The International Operated Markets experienced a significant decrease in operating income due to COVID-19-related sales declines, marketing support, and other expenses. In contrast, the U.S. market had positive sales performance but was offset by marketing support and other costs.\n\nNow, let's examine the visual evidence. ![Operating margins for different segments from 2018 to 2020](image3) shows the operating income figures for the U.S., International Operated Markets, and International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate. It is evident that the U.S. segment saw a relatively smaller decrease in operating income compared to the International Operated Markets, which faced a substantial drop.

The International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate showed growth, albeit modest. Therefore, the answer to the question is: The distribution of operating income by segment changed from 2019 to 2020, with a more pronounced decrease in the International Operated Markets and a smaller decline in the U.S. segment."}

Specifically, as stated in [5], IBM generated $^{\\S18,197}$ million in cash from operating activities in 2020, marking an increase of $^{\\S3,426}$ million compared to 2019. This growth is attributed to factors such as the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables and tax payment deferrals and exemptions related to COVID-19. The image ![Net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations](image4) corroborates this data, showing a rise from $14,770 million in 2019 to $18,197 million in 2020.\n\nSecondly, concerning investing activities, there was a substantial decrease in net cash used. According to [2], the net cash used in investing activities decreased by $^{\\S23,908}$ million. This decline can be largely attributed to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, specifically the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year, as detailed in [3]. The image ![Net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations](image4) also reflects this change, with the net cash used in investing activities dropping significantly from $(26,936)$ million in 2019 to $(3,028)$ million in 2020.\n\nLastly, in terms of financing activities, there was a stark contrast between 2019 and 2020. As mentioned in [1], financing activities were a net use of cash of $^{\\S9,721}$ million in 2020, contrasting with a net source of cash of $\\S9{,}042$ million in 2019. This shift was driven by various factors including early retirements and debt maturities, partially offset by issuances.

In 2016, the face value of long-term debt was $7.782 billion, while in 2017, it increased significantly to $24.842 billion.

According to [1] and [3], these ratios are computed using two methods: the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approach. The key differences between these approaches lie in how they calculate credit risk RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets). The Standardized Approach uses prescribed risk weights, while the Advanced Approach utilizes models for calculating exposure amounts and risk weights.\n\nThe table in ![{Risk-based capital ratios for 2020}](image1) shows the actual values of various capital ratios as of December 31, 2020, under both approaches. For instance, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.2% under the Standardized Approach and 17.7% under the Advanced Approach. Comparing this with the data from ![{Risk-based capital ratios for 2019}](image4), we can see that the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.4% under the Standardized Approach and 16.9% under the Advanced Approach in 2019. This indicates a decrease in the ratio under the Standardized Approach but an increase under the Advanced Approach.\n\nNext, let's consider the **leverage-based capital ratios**. As per [5], these include the Tier 1 leverage ratio and the SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio). The tables in ![{Leverage-based capital ratios for 2020}](image5) and ![{Leverage-based capital ratios for 2019}](image6) provide the necessary data. In 2020, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.4%, and the SLR was 7.4%. In 2019, the corresponding figures were 8.3% and 6.4%, respectively. This suggests a slight increase in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and a more significant increase in the SLR.\n\nIn summary, the risk-based capital ratios changed differently under the two approaches, with a decrease under the Standardized Approach and an increase under the Advanced Approach. Meanwhile, the leverage-based capital ratios showed minor increases across the board. Therefore, the direct and concise answer is:\n\nThe risk-based capital ratios decreased under the Standardized Approach but increased under the Advanced Approach from 2019 to 2020, while the leverage-based capital ratios saw minor increases overall."}

According to [10], noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million in 2020. This increase is also reflected in ![{Noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020}](image2). The rise in noncurrent assets suggests that the company may be investing more in long-term resources or experiencing growth in its long-term receivables, which could indicate a strategic shift towards longer-term investments or operations.\n\nNext, regarding long-term debt, [2] indicates that total debt decreased by $1,361 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to early retirements and debt maturities. This decrease is corroborated by ![{Long-term debt remained relatively stable at $54,355 million in 2020 compared to $54,102 million in 2019}](image2), showing a slight increase of $253 million. However, this minor change in long-term debt amidst an overall reduction in total debt implies that the company might be managing its debt structure, possibly shifting towards shorter-term debt or optimizing its capital structure for better liquidity and financial flexibility as mentioned in [1].\n\nLastly, concerning noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt), [6] states that these increased by $1,621 million in 2020. This increase is confirmed by ![{Noncurrent liabilities excluding debt increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020}](image2). The rise in noncurrent liabilities could be attributed to various factors such as deferred tax liabilities, pension obligations, or other long-term commitments, indicating that the company might be facing growing long-term obligations that need careful management.\n\nIn conclusion, the increases in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, coupled with the slight adjustment in long-term debt, suggest that the company is strategically positioning itself for long-term growth while managing its debt levels and financial obligations. This approach aims to ensure financial stability and flexibility, supporting the company's operational and investment strategies. Therefore, the company appears to be adopting a balanced financial strategy focusing on long-term investments and prudent debt management."}

One major factor is the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which was reinstated after a moratorium in 2019. According to [2] and [5], the company's portion of this tax for 2020 was approximately $3.0 billion. This is also reflected in image1 where the \"Health insurance tax\" line item shows a value of $626 million for 2020, compared to zero in 2019.\n\nAdditionally, the effective tax rate increased from 20.8% in 2019 to 24.0% in 2020, as shown in image1. This increase in the effective tax rate contributed to the higher provision for income taxes in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020, with a significant portion of this increase due to the reinstatement of the Health Insurance Industry Tax and an increase in the effective tax rate.\n\n**The provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020.**"}

In contrast, BSE Sensex remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 90 and 100, and ended at 93 in March 2003.\n\n### Comparison:\nFrom the analysis of both the monthly high-low prices and the normalized index performance, it is clear that GPI's stock price experienced a downward trend compared to BSE Sensex. While GPI initially outperformed BSE Sensex, its performance deteriorated over time, leading to a significant decline by March 2003. On the other hand, BSE Sensex maintained a relatively stable performance throughout the period.\n\nIn conclusion, GPI stock prices showed a declining trend compared to BSE Sensex from April 2002 to March 2003."}

Some projects were executed directly by the organization, while others were carried out through various implementing agencies such as BAIF Development Research Foundation and Aga Khan Rural Support Programme India.\n\n### Key Differences\n\nThe key differences lie in the scale of financial commitment and the approach to implementation. Rural Development Projects received substantially more funding and utilized both direct and indirect methods, indicating a broader and more complex scope. In contrast, COVID Relief projects, though crucial, had a more targeted and immediate focus, leading to lower overall expenditures and primarily indirect implementation through specialized agencies.\n\nIn conclusion, the Rural Development projects had a larger financial allocation and diverse implementation strategies compared to the more focused and agency-driven COVID Relief projects."}

This decline can be attributed to several factors discussed in the text quotes.\n\nFirstly, [5] indicates that the total gross margin percentage decreased by 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. The primary reasons for this decrease were a 33 basis-point reduction in core merchandise categories, mainly due to declines in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and a 19 basis-point decrease due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Additionally, increased $2\\%$ rewards negatively impacted the gross margin by one basis point.\n\nSecondly, [6] highlights that the gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased by 27 basis points. This decrease was observed across all categories, with fresh foods being the most significantly affected. This measure excludes the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nMoreover, [1] mentions that the gross margin on a segment basis decreased across all segments due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO charge, while the Other International segment faced increased $2\\%$ rewards.\n\nLastly, [3] explains that merchandise costs in 2022 were influenced by higher-than-usual inflation. The company's strategies to manage these cost increases, such as working with suppliers, earlier purchasing, and offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, may have contributed to the overall decrease in gross margin percentage.\n\nIn conclusion, the gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022 due to declines in core merchandise categories, higher merchandise costs, increased rewards, and the impact of inflation on merchandise costs."}

According to image5, the total non-current assets increased from DKK 63,156 million in 2019 to DKK 79,113 million in 2020. This significant increase can be attributed primarily to the rise in intangible assets, which grew from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020.

This increase is mainly due to the net profit of DKK 42,071 million for 2020, which was added to retained earnings.

This trend is also reflected in ![image1](image1), which shows a significant decrease in net interest income from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, a drop of 19%. \n\nSimilarly, ![image3](image3) illustrates a slight decline in net interest income for another sector, moving from $7,509 million in 2020 to $7,410 million in 2021, a marginal decrease of 1%. This suggests that while the overall trend is downward, the extent of the decrease varies by sector.\n\n### Total Loans Changes\n\nRegarding total loans, [5] indicates a decrease driven by lower demand and higher paydowns. This is corroborated by ![image2](image2), where total loans fell from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021, a reduction of 14%.

Total loans showed mixed trends, with some sectors experiencing decreases while others saw increases. The changes were influenced by factors such as interest rates, loan demand, and economic conditions specific to each sector."}

This indicates a significant increase in the amount of cash used for investing activities between 2019 and 2020. The text also mentions that this increase is primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions, particularly the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nLooking at image4, we can see the detailed breakdown of investing activities for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. In 2018, the net cash used in investing activities was $(2,949) million. In 2019, it increased to $(1,238) million, and then significantly jumped to $(21,239) million in 2020. This confirms the substantial rise in cash used for investments, especially in 2020.\n\nNow, let's compare these figures with the total operating cash flows. According to [4] and image4, operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $6.2 billion for 2020, an increase of approximately $2.6 billion or about 70% as compared to 2019. For 2019, the operating cash flow was $3.657 billion, which was slightly higher than the $3.644 billion in 2018.\n\nThe comparison reveals that while operating cash flows showed a positive trend, increasing from 2018 to 2020, the net cash used in investing activities saw a dramatic spike in 2020, far exceeding the growth in operating cash flows. This suggests that the company heavily invested in acquisitions and other investment activities in 2020, which required more cash than what was generated from operations.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend in net cash used in investing activities shows a significant escalation from 2018 to 2020, particularly in 2020 due to major acquisitions like Cytiva. This contrasts with the relatively steady growth in total operating cash flows over the same period. ![{Net cash used in investing activities significantly increased from 2018 to 2020, especially in 2020 due to major acquisitions, contrasting with the steady growth in operating cash flows}](image4)\n\nThe trend in net cash used in investing activities from 2018 to 2020 shows a significant increase, especially in 2020, which contrasts with the steady growth in total operating cash flows over the same period."}

According to [5], the consolidated statement of cash flows is an integral part of the financial statements. The image quote ![Cash flow details for 2020 and 2019](image5) provides detailed information on the cash flows. In 2020, the net cash from operating activities was $80,000k, a significant increase from $46,228k in 2019. This positive cash flow indicates that the company generated substantial cash from its core business operations, which can be used to pay dividends, invest in new assets, or strengthen its equity position.\n\nNext, let's look at the **changes in retained earnings**. Retained earnings are a component of shareholders' equity and represent accumulated profits not distributed as dividends. The image quote ![Equity changes over time](image3) shows the retained earnings balance and changes over the period. At the beginning of the period (July 2018), the retained earnings were $43,352k. By the end of June 2020, the retained earnings had decreased to $41,819k. This decrease is due to the profit earned during the year being less than the dividends paid out. Specifically, in 2020, the company reported a profit after tax of $11,221k but paid dividends of $15,866k, leading to a reduction in retained earnings.\n\nThe combination of these factors—positive cash flow from operations and changes in retained earnings—impacted the total equity. The image quote ![Equity changes over time](image3) also shows the total equity at the end of each period. From July 2018 to June 2020, the total equity increased from $45,242k to $58,368k. This increase in total equity is primarily driven by the positive cash flow from operations, which supports the company's ability to retain more earnings despite paying dividends.\n\nIn conclusion, the cash flow from operating activities and changes in retained earnings positively contributed to the growth in total equity from July 2018 to June 2020."}

According to [3], deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of various components. The image3 shows a detailed breakdown of these components for both years. In 2022, the total deferred tax assets amount to $4,091 million, down from $4,564 million in 2021. This decrease is primarily due to a significant reduction in pension and other retiree benefits from $1,476 million to $740 million. Other notable changes include an increase in capitalized research & development from $358 million to $646 million and a slight decrease in stock-based compensation from $386 million to $386 million.\n\nOn the other hand, the deferred tax liabilities have increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022 as shown in ![Deferred tax liabilities increased significantly in 2022](image5). The most significant contributor to this increase is goodwill and intangible assets, which rose from $5,761 million to $5,783 million. Additionally, there was a substantial rise in other retiree benefits from $645 million to $1,031 million.\n\nThe net effect of these changes is an overall increase in the company's deferred tax liability position relative to its assets. This shift can indicate that the company may face higher future tax obligations, potentially impacting its financial flexibility and cash flow. It also suggests that the company has been investing in areas that generate deferred tax liabilities, such as goodwill and intangible assets, which could be strategic for long-term growth but may pose short-term tax challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the deferred tax assets decreased by $473 million while the deferred tax liabilities increased by $785 million between 2021 and 2022, leading to a net increase in the company's tax liability position, which may affect its future financial performance."}

It also mentions that certain performance-based RSUs include a range of shares that can vary based on actual performance relative to the grant date performance measure.\n\nThe PERFORMANCE-VESTING RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT VESTING SCHEDULE, shown in ![{Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Unit Vesting Schedule}](image2), provides a framework for the number of shares vesting at each vesting date.

Specifically, transactions between HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC Ltd) exceed this threshold. This indicates a substantial relationship and volume of transactions between these entities. Further detail on the nature of these transactions is provided in image5: ![Details of related party transaction with HDFC Ltd](image5). It shows that HDFC Bank has an arrangement to purchase up to 70% of home loans sourced by it from HDFC Ltd, with HDFC Ltd continuing to service the assigned portfolio for which the bank pays servicing fees. The amount of home loans purchased under this arrangement was ₹18,979.78 crore.\n\nIn terms of the financial performance of HDFC Bank and its subsidiaries, text [2], [6], and [9] provide insights into the roles and contributions of HDB Financial Services Limited (HDBFSL) and HDFC Securities Limited (HSL), which are subsidiaries of HDFC Bank. HDBFSL is described as a non-deposit taking NBFC catering primarily to segments not covered by the bank, while HSL is noted for broking services. Their financial performance is summarized in image2: ![Financial performance summary of HDFC Bank and its subsidiaries](image2). As of March 31, 2021, HDFC Bank Limited's net assets constituted 97.10% of the consolidated net assets, with a profit of ₹31,116.53 crore, representing 97.75% of the consolidated profit.

According to [5], there are six GSM/WCDMA & CDMA operators in Indonesia, with Telkomsel, XL Axiata, and Indosat being the top three. The image ![Subscriber and Data User Numbers for Major Operators](image2) shows the subscriber numbers for these operators in millions. In 2013, Telkomsel had approximately 132.7 million subscribers, XL had around 68.5 million, and Indosat had about 59.7 million. By late 2014, as shown in ![Subscriber and Data User Numbers for Major Operators](image4), Telkomsel's subscriber count increased to 139.3 million, XL's rose to 63.5 million, and Indosat's slightly decreased to 58.3 million. This indicates that while Telkomsel and XL saw growth in their subscriber base, Indosat experienced a slight decline.\n\nNext, let's consider the data user numbers. The same images also provide information on data users. In 2013, Telkomsel had around 60.5 million data users, XL had approximately 37.5 million, and Indosat had about 29 million. By late 2014, Telkomsel's data user count grew to 63.5 million, XL's increased to 58.3 million, and Indosat's rose to 54.2 million. This suggests that all three operators saw an increase in their data user numbers over this period.\n\nThe trend of increasing data users aligns with the shift towards data-based communication methods like instant messaging (IM) and voice over IP (VoIP) mentioned in [8]. With $90\\%$ of mobile phone users using IM daily and an average of 4.2 IM applications installed per device, it is clear that data usage has become a significant part of mobile communication in Indonesia.\n\nFurthermore, the decline in SMS and voice usage noted in [5] could be contributing to the growth in data users. As people move away from traditional communication methods, they are likely turning to data-intensive services, which benefits operators with strong data networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the subscriber and data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat indicate that while Telkomsel and XL have been successful in growing both their subscriber and data user bases, Indosat has seen a slight decline in subscribers but still managed to increase its data users. This suggests that Telkomsel and XL may be performing better overall, possibly due to stronger network infrastructure or more appealing data plans. However, Indosat's ability to grow its data user numbers despite a decline in subscribers shows that it is still competitive in the data market."}

This trend is further supported by the image of the rural church complex ![Church surrounded by cemetery](image1), which symbolizes the central role of community institutions like churches in the lives of early settlers but also hints at the dwindling rural population over time.\n\nAdditionally, the creation and subsequent consolidation of rural school districts reflect changes in the demographics and needs of the population [6]. The image of an old gravestone ![Gravestone in a rural setting](image2) serves as a poignant reminder of the passage of time and the changing face of the communities that once thrived in Hamilton County.\n\nDespite these challenges, some towns within Hamilton County, such as Aurora, have managed to maintain or even increase their populations since 1940 [2]. This resilience can be attributed to various local factors, including economic opportunities and community development initiatives.\n\nIn summary, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, were influenced by historical factors such as the Homestead Act, railroad expansion, agricultural mechanization, and rural consolidation, resulting in a peak in the late 19th century followed by a gradual decline into the 20th century."}

For higher-resource languages, pre-training provides a consistent gain of approximately 3 BLEU points [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains can be either minimal or substantial; for instance, G L achieves an impressive gain of up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This suggests that pre-trained word embeddings are particularly beneficial for languages that are on the cusp of producing reasonable translations.\n\n![{GL→EN translation quality improves with pre-trained embeddings}](image4) illustrates this point by showing significant improvements in BLEU scores for G L → EN when using pre-trained embeddings compared to standard methods. The qualitative analysis further supports this, indicating that pre-training not only enhances the capture of rarer vocabulary but also produces more grammatically well-formed sentences [2].\n\nThe effect of pre-training is also influenced by the baseline system's performance. As highlighted in [4], the highest gains occur when the baseline system is moderately effective, typically with a BLEU score between 3-4. This implies that a basic understanding of the language is necessary before pre-training becomes highly effective.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between language similarity and BLEU score gains is evident. In multilingual translation systems, where an encoder or decoder is shared between multiple languages, the gains from pre-training are more pronounced for language pairs with higher similarity [5]. For example, the G L /P T pair shows the largest gains due to their high similarity, while B E /R U exhibits a smaller increase [10]. \n\n![{BLEU scores improve with pre-training, especially for lower training set sizes}](image2) demonstrates how pre-training boosts BLEU scores across various training set sizes, with the most significant improvements observed at smaller training set sizes.

The text provides specific percentages of wins, ties, and losses but does not directly discuss the inter-annotator reliability. However, this information can be supplemented by examining `![{Agreement levels among annotators}](image2)` which shows detailed agreement statistics between Chameleon and other models.\n\nIn `![{Agreement levels among annotators}](image2)`, we observe the percentage of cases where all three annotators agree, two out of three agree, and no agreement is reached when comparing Chameleon with Gemini+, GPT-4V+, Gemini, and GPT-4V. For instance, when comparing Chameleon with Gemini+, 31.5% of the time all three annotators agreed, 58.1% of the time two annotators agreed, and 10.3% of the time there was no agreement. Similar trends are observed across other comparisons.\n\nThis data suggests that while there is a significant level of agreement (around 28% to 35% unanimous judgments), there is also a notable portion of cases (about 55% to 60%) where one annotator differs from the other two. This indicates that evaluating Chameleon's performance relative to other models can be challenging due to subjective differences among annotators. \n\nFurther supporting this, [9] states that for each model pair, slightly more than 10% of cases had no agreement among the three annotators, considered as a tie in the evaluation. This reinforces the idea that Chameleon performs similarly to other baselines in many cases, contributing to the complexity of the relative evaluation process.\n\nTherefore, the inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance appears to be moderately strong, with a considerable number of unanimous judgments, but also highlights the subjective nature of such evaluations, leading to some variability in assessments.\n\nIn conclusion, annotator agreement levels suggest that while there is substantial consensus on Chameleon's performance, the presence of differing opinions underscores the nuanced and subjective aspects of evaluating mixed-modal responses."}

This figure breaks down the errors made by Step-Back Prompting predictions. It is evident that Reasoning Errors account for a significant portion of the total errors, with a value of 0.55. In contrast, RAG Errors and Scoring Errors are much lower, with values of 0.45 and 0.02, respectively. \n\nThis indicates that while Reasoning Errors are the primary source of mistakes, RAG Errors also play a considerable role.

Each of these strategies is further detailed in subsequent quotes.\n\n### Training-Time Correction\n[4] describes training-time correction methods, highlighting three typical strategies shown in Figure 2: human feedback, reward model, and automated feedback. Image4 illustrates these strategies with direct optimizing human feedback (a), reward modeling and RLHF (b), and self-training (c). However, the table in image1 does not list many papers under this category.\n\n### Generation-Time Correction\n[6] explains generation-time correction, which uses automated feedback during the generation process. Image3 shows two typical strategies for generation-time correction: Generate-then-Rank (a) and Feedback-Guided Decoding (b). While there are some papers listed in image1 that fall under generation-time correction, they are fewer compared to post-hoc correction.\n\n### Post-hoc Correction\n[8] details post-hoc correction, which refines outputs after generation without updating model parameters. This method allows for more diverse natural language feedback. Image2 categorizes key post-hoc correction strategies into Self-Correction (a), Correction with External Feedback (b), and Multi-Agent Debate (c). Image1 lists numerous papers under the \"Post-hoc Correction\" category, indicating a significant number of studies focusing on this approach.\n\nBy analyzing the table in image1, it becomes clear that the majority of the papers surveyed focus on **post-hoc correction** methods.

This component creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm [7]. The retriever efficiently encodes and stores a vast volume of images/text embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval, as illustrated in ![{The Multimodal Retriever processes images through an encoder, storing feature embeddings in a database and indexing them for efficient retrieval}](image3).\n\nSecondly, the **Retrieval Process** involves retrieving the top-k similar results from the memory bank upon receiving an input image at the inference stage [1]. This step ensures that the most relevant category labels are selected for further processing.\n\nThirdly, the **Ranking Prompt** integrates the retrieved category labels alongside the image embedding and sends them to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [5]. The MLLMs then combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category [4]. An example of this process is shown in ![{The Ranking Prompt sorts categories based on similarity, guiding the MLLM to rank the retrieved candidate object categories}](image4).\n\nLastly, the **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets** includes additional steps such as cropping and blurring to handle object detection datasets effectively [3].

The tree traversal method, as described in [7], selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on cosine similarity to the query embedding and progressively narrows down to finer details by repeating this process until reaching the leaf nodes. This is illustrated in ![Tree Traversal involves layer-by-layer selection of nodes](image2). In contrast, the collapsed tree method, mentioned in [3], evaluates all nodes collectively across all layers simultaneously, flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer for comparison. This method offers greater flexibility by searching through all nodes at once, as depicted in ![Collapsed Tree considers all nodes simultaneously](image2).\n\nThe performance difference between these two methods can be observed in ![Performance comparison shows collapsed tree outperforms tree traversal](image5), where the collapsed tree consistently achieves higher F1 scores across various context lengths. This aligns with the findings in [1] that the collapsed tree approach performs better due to its ability to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question.\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in that the former traverses the tree layer-by-layer while the latter evaluates all nodes simultaneously, leading to different levels of flexibility and performance."}

In contrast, the model with relation propagation (DYGIE) maintains higher and more stable relation extraction performance across sentences with varying numbers of entities.\n\nThis trend implies that utilizing relation propagation is particularly beneficial in scenarios where sentences contain multiple entities. [4] supports this observation by stating that \"relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities,\" which aligns with the visual evidence from image2. The ability to leverage broader context through relation propagation helps the model better capture complex relationships between entities, leading to improved performance on relation extraction tasks.\n\nFurthermore, the table in [3] and the data in ![Performance comparison showing the impact of relation propagation](image3) provide additional insights.

This combination allows the model to better handle unseen words and improve overall performance.\n\nFor instance, ![{The figure illustrates how bilingual word embeddings are projected into a shared space and then used to find nearest neighbors for translation}](image2) shows that even with bilingual word embeddings, there can be differences between word pairs in different languages due to distinct linguistic traits. Character-level features can mitigate this issue by providing additional context that is not available at the surface form level [7].\n\nFurthermore, the architecture depicted in ![{This diagram illustrates the flow of information from word and character embeddings through various layers including Bi-LSTM and masked self-attention, culminating in CRF layer for final output}](image5) demonstrates how these embeddings are integrated within the model. The character-level neural network captures subword details, which are then combined with word embeddings before being processed by the word-level neural network.

This strategy ensures that the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can concentrate on the relevant objects, thereby improving their identification capabilities in object detection tasks.

Specifically, it notes a four-point gain from reasons and warrants over warrants alone, and a two-point gain from claims and warrants, summing up to the six points needed to reach the peak performance.\n\nHowever, when an adversarial dataset is introduced to eliminate these cues, as described in [3], BERT's performance drops significantly.

This indicates that GPT-4 is better at aligning its generated text with citations in a broader context. In terms of citation correctness, both models perform similarly, with GPT-4 achieving 97.6% and ChatGPT reaching 94.5%.

For text evaluation, GPT-4 also outperforms ChatGPT across coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance metrics.\n\nIn contrast, under the **specific setting**, the performance gap between GPT-4 and ChatGPT narrows. GPT-4 maintains a slightly higher alignment score (92.0) compared to ChatGPT (84.5), but the difference in citation correctness is minimal (97.6% vs. 94.8%).

Text evaluation metrics show a similar trend, with GPT-4 performing marginally better.\n\nThe implications of these differences suggest that GPT-4 is more adept at handling both general and specific questions, providing more accurate and relevant citations. Its higher precision and recall under specific settings indicate that it can effectively target the required knowledge explicitly mentioned in the question context. On the other hand, ChatGPT tends to generate longer answers with many citations under general settings, which may lead to lower precision but higher recall. This trade-off highlights the importance of question specificity in determining the effectiveness of LLMs in citation and text evaluation tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, GPT-4 generally outperforms ChatGPT in both general and specific settings, particularly in terms of precision, recall, and overall F1 score, making it a more reliable choice for tasks requiring high-quality citations and coherent text generation."}

These methods differ in how they navigate the multi-layered tree structure to retrieve relevant information. The tree traversal method ([8]) selects nodes layer-by-layer based on cosine similarity, while the collapsed tree method ([5]) evaluates all nodes simultaneously by flattening the tree into a single layer.\n\nThe performance comparison of these two methods is illustrated in ![Performance comparison of collapsed tree and tree traversal methods](image3). This graph shows the F1 scores for both methods at various context lengths (Top 1, Top 3, Top 5, etc.). It is evident that the collapsed tree method consistently achieves higher F1 scores compared to the tree traversal method across all context lengths. For instance, at Top 9, the collapsed tree method reaches an F1 score of approximately 57, whereas the tree traversal method only attains around 55.\n\nThis superior performance of the collapsed tree method can be attributed to its greater flexibility in retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, as mentioned in [6]. In contrast, the tree traversal method maintains a constant ratio of thematic information to granular details regardless of the question's requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, the collapsed tree querying method outperforms the tree traversal method in terms of F1 score across different context lengths."}

The provided figures illustrate these impacts in detail.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the structured markup errors. Image4 shows a table detailing various types of structured markup along with their respective sources, items, items with errors, and pages. For instance, [image4] reveals that there are 72,441 errors out of 135,747 blog items using schema.org markup. This high error rate suggests potential issues in how search engines interpret and display content, which could negatively affect SEO performance by reducing the visibility and click-through rates of web pages.\n\nSecondly, regarding meta descriptions, image1 provides insights into the number of pages with duplicate, long, short, missing, and duplicate title tags. Specifically, ![There are significant issues with meta descriptions and title tags](image1) indicates that there are 2,215 pages with duplicate meta descriptions and 621 pages with duplicate title tags. These issues can confuse search engines and users, leading to lower engagement and potentially harming SEO rankings.\n\nThe combination of these factors—structured markup errors and problematic meta descriptions—can create a challenging environment for optimal SEO performance. Search engines rely on accurate and consistent metadata and structured data to understand and rank web pages effectively. When these elements are flawed, it can result in decreased visibility, lower click-through rates, and ultimately, poorer SEO outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, structured markup errors and meta description issues, as depicted in the provided figures, can substantially hinder SEO performance by affecting how search engines interpret and present web content."}

Additionally, 46% of respondents feel their organizations are too segmented by business line, product, or brand, further complicating integration efforts.\n\nSecondly, resource constraints pose another challenge. According to the same image, 36% of respondents report insufficient resources to support an integrated approach. This aligns with [2], which emphasizes the importance of investing in people, skills, roles, and responsibilities over technology alone. Without adequate human capital, even the most advanced tools cannot effectively drive customer management initiatives.\n\nThirdly, measurement difficulties hinder progress. The inability to accurately gauge the impact of activities on customer behavior is cited by 27% of respondents in the image. This ties into [8], which underscores the limitations of traditional metrics in capturing the full spectrum of customer engagement, sentiment, and loyalty. Marketers need a more holistic measurement framework that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative data points.\n\nLastly, performance attribution models can be overly simplistic. Image5 reveals that 52% of marketers attribute activity solely to the most recent touchpoint, while only 34% use fractional attribution models. This narrow focus on last-click attribution, as mentioned in [4], fails to account for the complex journey customers undertake before making a decision.

The chart shows that key functions like posting policies and procedures, staff communication, training, and resource tools are already widely adopted, with percentages ranging from 70% to 87%. However, access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are less utilized, at 45% and 44%, respectively. This indicates a gap in integrating clinical data within intranets.\n\nLooking ahead, the same image projects significant growth in these areas over the next two years. For instance, access to patient clinical information is expected to rise from 45% to 53%, and physician access for clinical orders from 44% to 57%. This suggests a trend towards greater integration of clinical data into intranet systems, aligning with the broader goal of consolidating fragmented patient information [6] and reducing inefficiencies.\n\nThis trend is further supported by the observed increase in website functions shown in ![{Website function adoption rates between 2005 and 2006}](image1). Functions such as consumer health information, remote employee access, and physician portal links have seen substantial growth. Consumer health information, for example, increased from 70% to 74%, indicating a growing emphasis on providing comprehensive health-related content online. Similarly, remote employee access grew from 53% to an unspecified higher percentage, reflecting a move towards more flexible and accessible healthcare services.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies also plays a crucial role in shaping these trends. ![{Technology adoption rates between 2005 and 2006}](image5) illustrates the increasing use of various technologies like bar code technology, speech recognition, and handheld PDAs. Bar code technology saw a jump from 59% to 69%, while speech recognition and handheld PDAs both increased by 6%.

According to [4], there are several key areas where intranets will play a crucial role. Image 4 illustrates that significant improvements are expected in various aspects such as staff communication (82% today vs. 70% in two years), training (76% today vs. 75% in two years), and access to patient clinical information (45% today vs. 53% in two years). These enhancements suggest a growing reliance on intranets for streamlined operations and better data accessibility.\n\nNow, considering the current staffing needs in Health IT, image 3 provides valuable insights. It shows that network support is the most critical area, with 27% of the focus, followed by clinical informaticists and process/workflow design at 24%. This indicates that organizations are heavily investing in roles that can manage and optimize their networks and processes effectively.\n\nThe relationship between these two elements becomes clear when we consider the specific skills required for the anticipated intranet functions. For instance, improving staff communication and training necessitates robust network infrastructure and skilled network support personnel. Similarly, enhancing access to patient clinical information requires competent clinical informaticists who can design efficient systems for data management and retrieval.\n\n![{Network applications and data repository are central to health information exchange}](image1) further emphasizes the importance of a centralized data repository and network applications in facilitating seamless information flow among various healthcare entities. This underscores the need for strong network support and clinical informaticists to ensure the effective functioning of such systems.\n\nIn conclusion, the expected changes in intranet functions over the next two years closely align with the current staffing needs in Health IT, particularly in network support and clinical informatics. The demand for these roles is driven by the need to enhance intranet capabilities and improve overall operational efficiency in healthcare settings."}

This could be indicative of one of the sectors mentioned. Similarly, ![The image depicts two individuals collaborating in an environment with 9 offices, 500 employees, and operations in 7 countries](image2) and ![The image illustrates a meeting scenario with 9 offices, 500 employees, and operations in 7 countries](image4) both show a setup with 9 offices, 500 employees, and operations in 7 countries, suggesting these might represent another sector.\n\nNow, considering the textual evidence, [2] and [3] highlight the Deals sector's involvement in mergers, acquisitions, and disposals, indicating a broad geographical reach and significant workforce, which aligns well with the data in image1. The Deals sector likely has the highest number of offices (17), employees (870), and country presence (11).\n\nOn the other hand, [5] emphasizes PwC Legal's extensive global network, making it plausible that the Tax & Legal Services sector is represented by the data in image2 and image4. These images suggest a slightly smaller but still substantial presence with 9 offices, 500 employees, and operations in 7 countries.\n\nLastly, the Consulting sector, while not explicitly detailed in the quotes, can be inferred to have a similar scale to Tax & Legal Services based on the common business practices and service offerings described in [6] and [7]. Therefore, it is reasonable to associate the Consulting sector with the same data as Tax & Legal Services.\n\nIn conclusion, the Deals sector has the largest distribution with 17 offices, 870 employees, and presence in 11 countries, while both the Consulting and Tax & Legal Services sectors share a smaller but significant footprint with 9 offices, 500 employees, and operations in 7 countries."}

According to [2], you need to cut off electrical power and water supply, disconnect and reconnect the water inlet pipe, drain any remaining water, and remove the filter at the bottom of the tub. This step is visually supported by ![{Illustration of connecting hoses}](image3), which shows the connection of the water supply and drain hoses.\n\nNext, as per [5], leveling the dishwasher is essential for its performance. You should use a spirit level on the door and rack track inside the tub to check if the appliance is level. Adjust the three leveling legs individually if necessary. Although there isn't a direct image for this step, it is an important preparatory measure.\n\nOnce installation and leveling are complete, you can proceed with loading the dishes. [6] instructs you to draw out the lower and upper baskets, load the dishes (starting with the lower basket), and push them back. ![{Diagram showing the direction of dish placement}](image2) illustrates the correct orientation for placing items inside the dishwasher, ensuring they face outward for optimal cleaning.\n\nAfter loading the dishes, you need to pour in the detergent. [6] specifies this step, and ![{Illustration of adding detergent}](image5) visually demonstrates how to add detergent into the designated compartment.\n\nThe final steps involve inserting the plug into the socket, turning on the water supply, closing the door, pressing the Power button, choosing a program, and pressing the Start/Pause button to begin the cycle, as detailed in [6]. ![{Illustration of starting the dishwasher}](image4) shows the process of initiating the dishwasher cycle.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct sequence of steps to operate the dishwasher includes: preparing the appliance by cutting off power and water supply, reconnecting the water inlet pipe, draining water, removing the filter, leveling the dishwasher, loading the dishes correctly, adding detergent, plugging in the power cord, turning on the water supply, closing the door, selecting a program, and starting the cycle."}

The table illustrates that the utility gained from consuming hot dogs decreases with each additional one. Initially, the first hot dog provides a significant utility of +10, but this diminishes rapidly; by the third hot dog, the utility is zero, and it becomes negative thereafter.\n\nThis pattern reflects the economic principle of diminishing marginal utility, which suggests that as a person consumes more of a good, the satisfaction gained from each additional unit decreases. This concept is further supported by [9], which explains that variety is important because enjoyment drops off, prompting a switch to another choice. \n\n`![{The image highlights the diminishing marginal utility of eating hot dogs and the point where Joey Chestnut ties for the championship}](image5)` reinforces this idea by showing a real-world example where even a competitive eater experiences diminishing returns after consuming a certain number of hot dogs. The differential outcome column indicates a significant positive utility at the 64th hot dog due to the achievement of tying for the championship, illustrating an exception where external factors can alter the typical diminishing utility trend.\n\nIn contrast, standard consumption economics often views focusing on a single item negatively, as mentioned in [4]. However, the context of focused practice and mastery, as seen in [5] and `![{Practice enhances skill and increases the likelihood of winning}](image1)`, shows that intentional focus can lead to improved outcomes and increased utility over time.\n\nTherefore, the utility change with each additional hot dog consumed implies that consumers should be mindful of diminishing returns and consider switching choices or engaging in activities that provide sustained positive utility, aligning with the principles of behavioral economics discussed in [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, suggesting that consumers should diversify their choices to maintain overall satisfaction."}

Then $\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P\\dot{P}}}$ is raised to Vpp, ALE/PROG is pulsed low, and then EA/Vpp is returned to a valid high voltage.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the images:\n\n- ![Illustrates the setup for programming the 875XBH using the Quick Pulse Programming Algorithm](image1) shows the circuit setup for programming the 875XBH.\n- ![Shows the pin configuration for the 8751H microcontroller during programming](image2) illustrates the pin configuration for the 8751H microcontroller during programming.\n- ![Depicts the timing diagram for the ALE/PROG signal during programming](image3) depicts the timing diagram for the ALE/PROG signal during programming.\n- ![Provides a table showing different modes and their corresponding pin states](image4) provides a table showing different modes and their corresponding pin states.\n- ![Illustrates the waveforms for both programming and verification processes](image5) illustrates the waveforms for both programming and verification processes.\n\nIn the waveform figure (image5), the symbol at the bottom left corner corresponds to the $\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P P}}$ signal. According to the waveform, this signal transitions from TTL HIGH to a lower voltage level during the programming phase. The minimum voltage level during this transition is specified as 21V ± 0.5V.\n\nTherefore, the minimum voltage of the symbol at the bottom left corner in the Figure of EPROM programming and verification waveforms is **20.5**."}

This means that while there are general guidelines, specific conversion rates can differ based on unique factors. \n\nThe text in [8] provides a detailed breakdown of the lead funnel progression: it shows the conversion rates from Leads to Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs), then to Sales-Accepted Leads (SALs), Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs), and finally to Sales Won Opportunities (SWOs). These stages are crucial for understanding where potential customers are dropping off or progressing through the sales process.\n\nNow, let's look at the images:\n\n![{Shows trends in cost per member and membership over time}](image1) illustrates trends in costs and memberships, which indirectly relates to conversion rates by showing the financial impact of different programs. However, this image does not directly provide conversion rate data.\n\n![{Displays leads by source with total leads, prospects, leads, opportunities, and won amounts}](image2) breaks down leads by their source, showing the number of leads, prospects, and won opportunities. While this gives insight into where leads come from, it doesn't explicitly show conversion rates.\n\n![{Illustrates typical conversion rates at various stages of the lead funnel}](image3) is particularly relevant. It visually represents the typical conversion rates at each stage of the lead funnel, from inquiries to opportunities-to-sale. For example, it shows that 4% to 8% of inquiries become MQLs, and 20% to 30% of SQLs become actual sales. This aligns well with the textual information in [8].\n\n![{Presents actual conversion rates at each stage of the lead funnel}](image4) further supports this by presenting actual conversion rates at each stage of the lead funnel. The image shows a Lead-to-MQL conversion rate of 52.07%, an MQL-to-SAL conversion rate of 1.50%, an SAL-to-SQL conversion rate of 83.08%, and an SQL-to-SWO conversion rate of 6.67%. These figures can be compared against the typical rates shown in ![{Illustrates typical conversion rates at various stages of the lead funnel}](image3).\n\nFinally, ![{Compares different attribution models used in marketing analytics}](image5) compares different attribution models used in marketing analytics. This is important because it highlights the complexity of attributing conversions accurately across different touchpoints, as mentioned in [6]. Understanding these models helps in interpreting the conversion rates more accurately.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression, as depicted in the images and described in the text, directly relate to the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics. They offer a step-by-step view of how leads move through the sales process and highlight areas where improvements can be made to increase overall conversion rates."}

For instance, [3] mentions that variety is important because enjoyment drops with repeated consumption, and [4] notes that focusing on one activity can be detrimental. This idea is visually represented in image4, which shows a table where the utility from each hot dog consumed diminishes progressively: ![Utility decreases as more hot dogs are eaten](image4).\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the situation changes significantly. Image5 illustrates this difference by showing two tables side by side. The left table represents diminishing marginal utility in a standard context, where the utility from eating each additional hot dog decreases until it becomes negative. The right table, however, reflects a competitive scenario where the utility dramatically increases at a certain point due to the achievement of a goal—in this case, winning a championship: ![Competitive context reverses diminishing returns](image5). \n\nThis reversal occurs because the focus shifts from mere consumption to achieving a specific outcome, as highlighted in [5]. In competitions, the cumulative effect of focus can lead to significant improvements and positive outcomes, even if the initial units of consumption have diminishing returns.\n\nIn conclusion, while standard consumption economics emphasizes the diminishing returns from repetitive activities, competitive contexts can transform these diminishing returns into substantial gains when the focus is on achieving a specific goal."}

According to [1], proximity plays a role in grouping objects that are visually close together. In the pie charts, the segments representing time spent with family and friends are adjacent to other activities, which might influence our perception of their relative importance.\n\nAdditionally, [6] mentions closure, where we tend to perceive incomplete shapes as whole. Even though the pie chart segments are not complete circles, we still interpret them as full representations of the data. This principle helps us grasp the overall picture despite the missing parts.\n\nFurthermore, [5] discusses similarity, indicating that objects similar in shape and color are perceived as part of a group.

The Lotus and BHG Supermarkets are both open from 9:00am to 9:00pm, whereas Carrefour has extended hours, operating from 8:30am to 10:00pm.\n\nComparing these details, we see that some on-campus supermarkets have longer operating hours than their off-campus counterparts. For example, the Tmall campus - Zijing store stays open until 11:30pm, which is later than any off-campus supermarket listed. This could be particularly beneficial for students who have late-night schedules or those who prefer shopping after their evening classes.\n\nOn the other hand, off-campus supermarkets like Carrefour offer earlier morning hours, starting at 8:30am, which might suit students who need to shop early in the day.

Interphase is a preparatory stage for cell division, consisting of three sub-phases: G1, S, and G2. During G1, the cell grows and increases its cytoplasm [7]. The S phase is when chromosomes duplicate [3], as shown in ![{DNA synthesis occurs during the S phase}](image1). In G2, the cell continues to grow and prepares for division [7].\n\nThe mitotic phase involves the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells. It includes mitosis, which is the division of the nucleus [10], and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm [10]. Mitosis itself can be further divided into several stages, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Prophase is characterized by the condensation of chromatin into visible chromosomes, as depicted in ![{Chromosomes condense during prophase}](image4). Metaphase aligns these chromosomes at the cell's equator, as seen in ![{Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate}](image5). Anaphase separates sister chromatids, moving them to opposite poles of the cell, illustrated in ![{Sister chromatids separate during anaphase}](image3). Finally, telophase re-forms the nuclear envelope around the separated genetic material, as shown in ![{Nuclear envelope reforms during telophase}](image2).\n\nIn summary, the main stages of the cell cycle are interphase (G1, S, G2) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), each with specific sub-phases that prepare and execute cell division."}

This means that depending on whether your subject is still or in motion, you can choose the appropriate focus mode to ensure sharpness and clarity.\n\nNext, let's explore the **metering modes**, which are crucial for controlling exposure. [3] indicates that you can select a metering mode by touching 'M'. Image ![Different metering modes for landscapes, portraits, and specific regions](image5) explains the three main types: Matrix measures light across the entire frame, ideal for natural landscapes; Center focuses on light near the center, perfect for portraits; and Spot targets a specific region like a subject's eyes.
