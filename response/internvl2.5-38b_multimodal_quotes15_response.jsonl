This is evidenced by the fact that 66% of people thought the U.S. and its allies would definitely or probably succeed, while only 27% thought they would definitely or probably fail. This positive outlook on the ultimate success of the campaign persisted throughout the year, with views shifting from a more negative stance in early 2014 to a more positive one by the end of 2015. The recent attacks in Paris and San Bernardino did not lead to a fundamental shift in public opinion regarding the U.S. military campaign against ISIS. Overall, the public remained divided on the question of sending U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS, with 47% in favor and an identical percentage opposed. However, the balance of opinion on this issue has shifted since early 2014, when more people believed that relying too much on force created hatred rather than overwhelming military force being the best way to defeat terrorism. Despite these shifts in opinion, the public's overall concerns about the rise of Islamic extremism at home and abroad remained high, but no higher than they were in September 2014. In summary, while the current military effort in Iraq and Syria was not viewed positively, a majority of people still believed that the U.S. and its allies would ultimately succeed in their campaign against ISIS in 2015. ![66% of people believe the U.S. and its allies will succeed in their campaign against ISIS](image1) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS](image5) ![47% of people favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS]("}

According to the data, 71% of Republicans believe there are plenty of jobs available, compared to 53% of Democrats. This partisan gap has been consistent over time, with Republicans generally having more positive views of job availability than Democrats. The image shows that in October 2017, 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally. This trend continues, with Republicans maintaining a more optimistic outlook on job availability. The image also highlights that the public's perceptions of job availability have become more positive overall, with a clear majority of Americans (60%) now saying there are plenty of jobs in their communities. However, this positive trend is more pronounced among Republicans, who have seen a significant increase in their positive views of job availability since Trump's election. In contrast, Democrats have grown more negative in their views of Trump's economic policies, which may contribute to their less optimistic outlook on job availability. The image further illustrates that the partisan gap in views of job availability is not limited to the general public but also extends to perceptions of the economy and personal financial situations. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to rate their personal financial situation as excellent or good, and they have more positive views of economic conditions. This suggests that the partisan divide in perceptions of job availability is part of a broader pattern of partisan differences in economic outlooks.

According to the data, 68% of Republicans believe that Islam is more likely to encourage violence among its believers, which is a historical high and has not changed significantly since last year. In contrast, only 30% of Democrats hold this view, a 12 percentage point decline from the previous year. Independents are divided, with 45% believing that Islam is more likely to encourage violence and 46% believing it is not more likely.\n\nThese perceptions are closely related to views on government handling of terrorism. The partisan divide over whether Islam encourages violence is now as wide as it has ever been. Democrats are the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well in combating terrorism, down from 85% in January. Independents' positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%. Just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year. This indicates that perceptions of Islam's encouragement of violence are closely tied to views on government handling of terrorism, with Republicans being more critical of the government's efforts. \n\nIn summary, perceptions of Islam's encouragement of violence have varied significantly among different political affiliations, with Republicans being more likely to believe that Islam encourages violence and being more critical of the government's handling of terrorism.

According to the data, conservative Republicans are the only major group where a majority (57%) supports greater scrutiny of Muslims due to their religion, while liberal Democrats overwhelmingly oppose it (87%). This stark contrast is mirrored in the views of other groups, with moderate and liberal Republicans, independents, and conservative and moderate Democrats all predominantly opposing additional scrutiny (ranging from 59% to 67%).\n\nDemographically, younger adults (18-29) are the most opposed to increased scrutiny, with 80% saying Muslims should not face more scrutiny solely because of their religion. In contrast, those aged 50 and older are more divided, with 50% supporting and 41% opposing additional scrutiny. Racial and ethnic differences also emerge, with non-whites (blacks and Hispanics) more likely to reject the idea of scrutiny based on religion compared to whites.\n\nThe perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue is closely tied to these views. Republicans are more likely to cite terrorism as a top concern, with 41% mentioning it, compared to 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats. This aligns with the higher support for scrutinizing Muslims among Republicans, particularly conservatives. The data suggests that political ideology and demographic factors significantly influence both the perception of terrorism as a national issue and the support for scrutinizing Muslims based on their religion. \n\nIn summary, the data indicates that conservative Republicans are more likely to support increased scrutiny of Muslims, which correlates with their higher concern about terrorism. Conversely, younger adults, non-whites, and liberal Democrats are less likely to support such scrutiny and are also less likely to prioritize terrorism as a national issue. \n\n![Perceptions of scrutiny of Muslims differ across political and demographic groups](image2)\n![Perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue](image4)"}

Initially, the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism were rated positively by a majority of Americans, but these ratings have since declined. As of the latest data, more Americans now believe the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat compared to those who think it is doing well. This shift is particularly pronounced among older adults and those with less education, who are more likely to give the government low marks for its anti-terrorism efforts.\n\nThe partisan divide on the most important problem facing the nation is evident, with a higher percentage of Republicans citing terrorism, defense issues, and national security compared to independents and Democrats. This divide is also reflected in the ratings of the government's performance, where Democrats are the only group in which a majority still believes the government is doing at least fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, although this percentage has dropped significantly since early 2015.\n\nYounger adults are more positive about the government's performance in combating terrorism than older adults, and those with a postgraduate degree are more likely to rate the government's efforts positively compared to those with less education. The concern over the government's anti-terror policies not going far enough to protect the country has risen, with a majority of Americans now expressing this concern.\n\nIn terms of demographic differences, the data shows that perceptions of terrorism and government efforts vary by age, education level, and political affiliation. For instance, younger adults and those with higher education levels tend to have more positive views of the government's performance, while older adults and those with less education are more critical. Additionally, there are significant differences in perceptions based on political affiliation, with Republicans being more likely to view the government's efforts negatively and Democrats more likely to view them positively.\n\nOverall, the changing perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to combat it highlight the complex interplay of demographic and political factors that influence public opinion on these issues. The data suggests that while there is a general decline in confidence in the government's ability to reduce the terrorist threat, there are significant variations in these perceptions across different demographic and political groups. This underscores the importance of understanding these differences in order to address the concerns and priorities of various segments of the population. \n\n![Perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to combat terrorism have changed over time, with notable differences among various demographic and political groups.](image1)\n![Younger adults and those with higher education levels tend to have more positive views"}

In 2017, 45% of Americans believed their allies should increase spending, but by 2019, this number had dropped to 35%. Conversely, the percentage of Americans who think spending should remain the same has increased from 37% in 2017 to 50% in 2019. This change reflects a notable shift in public opinion regarding defense spending in Europe.\n\nIn Germany, the public is divided on the issue of increasing or maintaining current levels of defense spending. In 2017, about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased. By 2019, 40% of Germans favored increasing defense spending, while 41% wanted to maintain current levels. This division indicates a stable but split opinion within Germany on defense spending.\n\nPartisan differences are evident in both countries. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to favor increased defense spending in Europe compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. However, the share of Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019. Among Democrats, there has been a more modest decline in this view.\n\nIn Germany, supporters of the CDU/CSU are on balance in favor of defense spending increases, with 51% supporting this view. In contrast, supporters of the Greens express more skepticism, with only 28% saying they want to raise defense spending. Members of the SPD fall in the middle, with 41% saying Germany should increase defense spending.\n\nThe importance of U.S. military bases in Germany is also viewed differently by Americans and Germans. While 85% of Americans believe these bases are important to the U.S.’s security interests, with nearly six-in-ten seeing them as very important, Germans are more divided. Younger Germans especially doubt the importance of American military bases in their country, with roughly six-in-ten of Germans ages 18 to 29 thinking the bases do not contribute to German national security.

Additionally, 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially than they themselves are now, indicating a strong belief in upward mobility for the next generation.\n\nIn terms of unemployment trends, the data shows that the U.S. Latino unemployment rate has improved since the Great Recession, falling from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 6.4% in the first quarter of 2016.

According to the data, the Hispanic unemployment rate has been declining but remains above its 2006 low, as indicated by the graph in image5. This suggests that while there has been some improvement, the Hispanic community still faces higher unemployment challenges compared to the non-Hispanic population. The graph in image1 shows that the general public's perception of economic conditions has been more positive than that of Hispanics, with the general public rating economic conditions as good or excellent more frequently than Hispanics. This disparity in economic perceptions can impact income and wealth disparities, as seen in image2, where the median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, which is unchanged since the recession. In contrast, the median household income for all households has increased to $53,700. Additionally, the Hispanic poverty rate is 23.6%, higher than the general population, and their net worth has continued to fall after the recession, unlike white households. These economic perceptions and trends contribute to the ongoing income and wealth disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. \n\nIn summary, the Hispanic population faces higher unemployment rates and less optimistic economic perceptions, which contribute to their lower median household income and higher poverty rates compared to the non-Hispanic population.

This trend is consistent with the general population, where higher education levels correlate with higher technology adoption. Over time, the adoption of technology among different age groups has shown a steady increase, particularly among older adults, with a notable rise in the use of social networking sites and smartphones. However, the adoption rate among seniors is still lower than the national average, indicating a gap that may be influenced by factors such as education and income. The data suggests that while technology adoption is increasing across all age groups, the rate of adoption is slower among older adults, especially those with lower education and income levels. This highlights the importance of targeted efforts to bridge the digital divide and ensure that all segments of the population, including seniors, have access to and can benefit from technological advancements. ![Education level significantly affects the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors](image3) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image2) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image4) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image5) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image1) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image2) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image4) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image5) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image1) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image2) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image4) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image5) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image1) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image2) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image4) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image5) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image1) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image2) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image4) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image5) ![Adoption of technology among different age groups over time](image1) ![Adoption of technology"}

Men are more likely to encounter harassing or abusive behavior online, with 29% of men reporting they more often see people being mean or bullying on social media compared to 19% of women. Conversely, women are slightly more likely than men to see people being kind or supportive, with 24% of women reporting this compared to 17% of men. However, the largest shares of both men (52%) and women (56%) say they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media.\n\nIn terms of deceptive behavior, men are around twice as likely as women to say they more often see people being deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%). However, similar shares of both men (58%) and women (67%) see an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation.\n\nThese differences in perceptions have implications for how social media platforms can tailor their recommendations or advertisements. For instance, platforms may need to be more cautious in recommending events or people to older users, as they are less accepting of these uses of their data. Additionally, platforms may need to consider the different levels of comfort with targeted content and advertisements among men and women, as well as among different age groups. For example, while three-quarters of social media users find it acceptable for platforms to use data about them to recommend events in their area, a smaller majority (57%) thinks it is acceptable if their data are used to recommend other people they might want to be friends with. Similarly, while majorities of users across a range of age groups think it is acceptable for social media sites to use their data to show them events happening in their area, majorities of users across a range of age categories feel it is not acceptable for social platforms to use their data to serve them ads from political campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, social media platforms can tailor their recommendations or advertisements based on the differences in perceptions of social media content and behavior between men and women, as well as among different age groups. By understanding these differences, platforms can better meet the needs and preferences of their users and provide a more positive and supportive online experience. ![Perceptions of social media content and behavior differ between men and women](image2) ![Perceptions of social media content and behavior differ between men and women](image3) ![Perceptions of social media content and behavior differ between"}

For instance, the public is relatively split on the effectiveness of these programs, with 54% thinking the personal finance score program would be effective at identifying good customers, while around half think the parole rating (49%) and resume screening (47%) algorithms would be effective. However, the public is largely skeptical about the fairness of these programs, with none viewed as fair by a clear majority. Especially small shares think the \"personal finance score\" and \"video job interview analysis\" concepts would be fair to consumers or job applicants (32% and 33%, respectively). The automated criminal risk score concept is viewed as fair by 50% of the public, which is higher than the personal finance score but still not a majority. This suggests that while the public may see some utility in these systems, there is a significant lack of trust in their fairness, which could impact their acceptance and use. The differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various systems imply that public trust in these systems is context-dependent and influenced by factors such as the type of decision being made and the potential impact on individuals. For example, the public is more likely to view the criminal risk score as fair because it is seen as a tool for making decisions about parole, which is a high-stakes decision with significant consequences for individuals. In contrast, the personal finance score is viewed as less fair because it is seen as a tool for making decisions about creditworthiness, which is a more personal and sensitive issue. Overall, these differences suggest that the public is cautious about the use of automated systems for decision-making and that there is a need for greater transparency and accountability in the design and implementation of these systems to build public trust. ![Perceptions of fairness and effectiveness vary across different automated systems](image3) ![Public skepticism about the fairness of these programs](image2) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image1) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image4) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image5) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image6) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image7) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image8) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are often highly contextual](image9) ![Public perceptions of algorithmic decision-making are"}

Overall, the public is critical of Trump and his administration in multiple areas, but they see Trump's impact on the economy in a positive light. Ratings for Trump are more negative, on balance, than for Obama and George W. Bush at comparable points in their administrations.

This contrasts sharply with the 41% who are not at all confident and the 16% who are not too confident. When broken down by political affiliation, the differences become more pronounced: 55% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are very confident, while 23% are somewhat confident.

This is a slight increase from the previous year. However, there is a significant partisan divide on this issue as well: 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns, while only 32% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree.

The data shows that 72% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say public health officials have done an excellent or good job in responding to the coronavirus, which is little changed since March. In contrast, only about half of Republicans (53%) give CDC officials and other public health officials positive ratings for their response to the outbreak, a significant drop from 84% in late March.\n\nThe partisan divide is also evident in views of the primary reason for the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases.

According to the data:\n\n- **Democrats**: A majority of Latino Democrats (70%) and Democratic leaners (61%) believe that Democrats do not work hard to earn their votes. This perception is particularly strong among Latino Democrats who are liberal (70%) and conservative/moderate (61%). In contrast, about half of Latino Republicans and Republican leaners who are conservative (47%) believe that Democrats do not work hard to earn their votes. This suggests a significant divide in how Democrats are perceived by different segments of the Latino population.\n\n- **Republicans**: Only about one-in-five Latinos (19%) believe that Republicans work hard to earn their votes. This perception is more prevalent among Latino Republicans (40%) and Republican leaners who are conservative (40%). However, among Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners, majorities of liberals (70%) and conservatives/moderates (61%) believe that Republicans do not work hard to earn their votes. This indicates a strong negative perception of Republicans among the broader Latino community.\n\n- **Demographic Differences**: The data also shows that perceptions vary by demographic factors such as education, age, and language dominance. For instance, among Latinos with a bachelor's degree or higher, 27% believe that Democrats work hard to earn their votes, while only 14% believe the same about Republicans. Similarly, among Latinos aged 65 or older, 46% believe that Democrats work hard to earn their votes, compared to 23% who believe the same about Republicans.

According to the provided data, the share of U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents and immigrant grandparents who self-identify as Hispanic falls to 77% by the third generation, and just half of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry say they are Hispanic by the fourth or higher generation [1]. This trend is further supported by the image data, which shows that 56% of third or higher generation Hispanics do not self-identify as Hispanic, compared to 36% of second generation and 25% of foreign-born Hispanics [image1].\n\nThe reasons for not self-identifying as Hispanic vary across generations. For adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic, 81% say they have never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino. The reasons for this are many and are often linked to mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and few Hispanic cultural links [9]. The image data supports this, showing that 27% of non-self-identified Hispanics have a mixed background or Hispanic ancestry too far back, 16% have an upbringing with no contact with Hispanic relatives, 15% do not speak Spanish or have no cultural link, 12% identify as another race or do not look Hispanic, and 9% were born in the U.S. and identify as American [image2].\n\nLanguage proficiency is another significant factor. While 58% of immigrant Latinos and 84% of second-generation Latinos say that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, this percentage rises to 92% among third or higher generation Latinos [6].

The rapid growth in these areas, particularly in Mountain View and Palo Alto, has led to a significant rise in the number of daily trips, as indicated by the data in [3]. This growth has put a strain on the existing train capacity, resulting in overcrowded trains, as evidenced by the images of crowded trains and platforms (image1, image5). The data in [4] further supports this, showing that the number of daily trips has increased by 38% in Palo Alto and 16% in Mountain View between 2012 and 2014. This increase in ridership has outpaced the current capacity of the trains, leading to the need for more frequent service and additional trains to accommodate the growing demand. The image of the train schedule (image4) also highlights the high capacity utilization during peak hours, with some trains operating at over 100% capacity, further emphasizing the need for increased capacity to meet the growing demand.

This is despite the fact that average exit values in Europe are approximately 25% smaller than in the USA. The scarcity of venture capital (VC) money in Europe has led to lower entry valuations and driven up capital efficiency, which is roughly 70% higher than in the USA. This higher capital efficiency and yield (hit rate) are due to the scarcity of money, allowing very few investors to be more selective.

Initially, the user's input is encoded into a continuous vector using a bidirectional LSTM utterance encoder. This encoding, along with the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state. The dialogue state is then used to generate a probability distribution over candidate values for each tracked goal slot. A query command is formulated from these outputs and sent to a knowledge base to retrieve the requested information. The system action, which is conditioned on the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the query results, is then used to produce the final natural language system response via a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG template is delexicalized and filled with values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action. This process ensures that the system's response is contextually appropriate and informative, addressing the user's request effectively. ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image2) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image3) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image4) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image5) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image1) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image2) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image3) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image4) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image5) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image1) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image2) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image3) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image4) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a response](image5) ![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM neural network to encode a dialogue and generate a"}

The findings indicate that diverse instruction strategies yield comparable results in IE tasks, increasing the number of samples in demonstrations does not unequivocally enhance performance, and the selection strategy of demonstration matters, with retrieval based on sentence embedding being effective [1]. Additionally, the text highlights that LLMs struggle with fine-grained datasets and that their performance plateaus with only modest increases in sample size, whereas SLMs demonstrate marked performance enhancement as sample sizes grow [8].\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence to support these findings. Image1 shows the F1 score performance of various models on the FewNERD dataset across different shot settings. It illustrates that ChatGPT and Codex have relatively stable performance across different shot settings, with ChatGPT generally outperforming Codex.

In terms of difficulty levels, GPT-4V demonstrates a significantly higher proficiency, with a success rate of 76.1% in the \"Easy\" category, compared to LLaVA-1.5-13B's 41.3%. The performance gap narrows in the \"Medium\" category, where GPT-4V leads at 55.6%, and further diminishes in the \"Hard\" category, indicating that as the complexity of tasks increases, the advantage of more advanced models like GPT-4V almost disappears. This suggests a current limitation in handling expert-level challenging queries even for the most advanced models.\n\nIn terms of subject categories, GPT-4V consistently outperforms the other models across all types, with particularly strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings, which are more frequently seen during training. However, for less common image categories like Geometric shapes, Music sheets, and Chemical structures, all models, including GPT-4V, obtain very low scores, indicating that the existing models are generalizing poorly towards these image types. LLaVA-1.5-13B, on the other hand, shows relatively strong performance in categories like Art & Design and Humanities & Social Sciences, where the images tend to be more 'natural' and questions involve relatively less reasoning. In contrast, in fields like Science, Health & Medicine, and Technology & Engineering, which present more complex visual data and require intricate reasoning, LLaVA-1.5-13B exhibits lower performance.\n\nIn summary, GPT-4V generally outperforms LLaVA-1.5-13B across different difficulty levels and subject categories, with a significant performance gap in the \"Easy\" category and a diminishing gap as the complexity of tasks increases.

Initially, the system uses a visual encoder to process the input image and obtain the corresponding image embedding, which is then navigated through a memory index to identify the top-k related images. This step is crucial for narrowing down the vast possibilities to those most likely relevant based on historical data and the semantic closeness of stored labels to the image content [10].\n\nFollowing the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside the image embedding are integrated and sent to the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category. This process ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction, enhancing the system's ability to handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision and flexibility [5].\n\nTo address the limitations of MLLMs in visual recognition, the system employs a multimodal retriever that creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions. Upon receiving an input image at the inference stage, the approach retrieves the top-k class names most similar to the image. Subsequently, the MLLMs rank these retrieved candidate results as the final prediction results. Fine-tuning is also explored to improve the MLLMs' ranking ability, ensuring that the system can effectively bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization [9].\n\nIn object detection datasets, the methodology for extracting image embeddings is slightly different. The system applies two additional pre-processing steps: cropping and blurring. Cropping involves extracting image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. Blurring is used on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks [8].\n\nThe system also employs a ranking prompt example, as shown in image1, to demonstrate how the retrieved categories are sorted and ranked based on their similarity to the input image. This process helps in identifying the most relevant categories and improving the accuracy of the final predictions.\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by combining image retrieval, ranking, and fine-tuning techniques.

As shown in Table 5, the model with ED outperforms the model without ED in all metrics assessed. Specifically, the ROUGE score improves from 28.02 to 35.28, the BLEU score increases from 3.73 to 7.81, the METEOR score rises from 26.26 to 29.27, and the BELURT score jumps from 0.45 to 0.55. This substantial improvement underscores the critical role of entity detection in the model's ability to generate responses enriched with entity-centric information. The enhanced performance across these metrics highlights the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation in producing more accurate and coherent answers, particularly in the context of entity-centric VQA tasks. This finding is consistent with the broader goal of SnapNTell, which is to evaluate models' capabilities in accurately identifying entities and providing detailed, entity-specific knowledge in their responses. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of ED is a key factor in achieving this goal, as it enables the model to better recognize and utilize the specific entities depicted in the images, thereby improving the overall quality of the generated responses. In summary, the inclusion of entity detection in SnapNTell leads to a significant boost in performance across multiple evaluation metrics, underscoring its importance in the model's ability to handle entity-centric VQA tasks effectively. ![The table shows the performance of the model with and without entity detection (ED) across various evaluation metrics, with the model with ED outperforming the model without ED in all metrics.](image1) ![The table shows the performance of the model with and without entity detection (ED) across various evaluation metrics, with the model with ED outperforming the model without ED in all metrics.](image1) ![The table shows the performance of the model with and without entity detection (ED) across various evaluation metrics, with the model with ED outperforming the model without ED in all metrics.](image1) ![The table shows the performance of the model with and without entity detection (ED) across various evaluation metrics, with the model with ED outperforming the model without ED in all metrics.](image1) ![The table shows the performance of the model with and without entity detection (ED) across various evaluation metrics, with the model with ED outperforming the model without ED in all metrics.](image1)"}

The effect is more pronounced in multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder between multiple languages. The BLEU scores increase as the training set size grows, but the gains are most effective when there is a moderate amount of training data. Language similarity also plays a crucial role, with more similar translation pairs showing larger gains from pre-training. For instance, the translation pair GL/PT shows the largest gains, while BE/RU shows a small decrease. Pre-training and alignment of word embeddings help to increase BLEU scores for all three tasks, as a single encoder is used for both source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space. Pre-training and alignment ensure that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language. The results indicate that pre-trained embeddings are most effective in low-resource scenarios, where there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all. Additionally, pre-trained embeddings seem to be more effective for more similar translation pairs. A priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios, but is helpful in multilingual training scenarios. The qualitative analysis of the translations from GL to EN showed that pre-training not only helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed. The best system successfully translates a person's name (\"chris\") and two multi-word phrases (\"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\"), indicating the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing a better representation of less frequent concepts when used with low-resource languages. The BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT generally follow the hypothesis that the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective. The main intuitive hypothesis as to why pre-training works is that the embedding space becomes more consistent, with semantically similar words closer together. If the two languages in the translation pair are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods will be more similar between the two languages, and"}

When CorefProp is removed, the entity F1 score slightly decreases to 85.7, while the relation F1 score increases to 60.2 [image1]. Removing RelProp results in a slight decrease in both entity and relation F1 scores [image1].\n\nThe role of CorefProp and RelProp is further illustrated in the graphs showing relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence for DyGIE and DyGIE without relation propagation on ACE05 [3]. The graphs indicate that relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities, where broader context is expected to be beneficial [3].\n\nIn summary, the DyGIE model's performance on entity and relation extraction varies across different datasets and configurations, with CorefProp and RelProp components playing distinct roles in these variations. CorefProp is mainly beneficial for entities but can hurt relation extraction, while RelProp significantly benefits both tasks, especially in sentences with multiple relation instances.

In terms of performance, SWEM models, particularly SWEM-max, demonstrate competitive or superior results in many cases, as shown in Table 5 and Table 8. For instance, on the SNLI dataset, SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of 83.8%, which is very competitive among state-of-the-art sentence encoding-based models [1]. This is consistent with findings from Nie and Bansal (2017) and Conneau et al. (2017), indicating that max-pooling over BiLSTM hidden units outperforms average pooling on SNLI [1].\n\nIn document classification tasks, SWEM models exhibit stronger performances relative to both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures, especially when leveraging both average and max-pooling features from word embeddings [7]. For example, on the topic prediction tasks, SWEM models outperform a 29-layer deep CNN model [7]. On the ontology classification problem (DBpedia dataset), SWEM models also show comparable or even superior results relative to CNN or LSTM models [7].\n\nHowever, in sentiment analysis tasks, SWEM models yield inferior accuracies compared to CNN/LSTM compositional functions, as observed in Table 8. This may be due to the fact that for shorter text sequences, word-order features tend to be more important, and the semantic information provided by word embeddings alone is relatively limited [10].\n\nThe performance of SWEM and CNN models also varies with subspace dimensions. In Figure 2 (c) and (d), SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efficient to get a decent solution [3]. However, when the subspace dimension is large, CNN can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy [3].\n\nIn summary, SWEM models, especially SWEM-max, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in many cases, particularly in document classification tasks. However, in sentiment analysis tasks, CNN models tend to perform better. The performance of both models also varies with subspace dimensions, with SWEM being more parameter-efficient for low subspace dimensions and CNN leveraging more trainable parameters for higher dimensions.

Overall, the COMET model's performance on the ConceptNet dataset highlights its potential as a powerful tool for automatic commonsense knowledge base construction."}

They are adapted to a multi-document setting by sequentially concatenating all documents in random order into a superdocument.\n- In the masked setup, all baseline models reliant on lexical cues fail in the face of the randomized answer expressions, since the same answer option has different placeholders in different samples. Especially on MEDHOP, where dataset sub-sampling is not a viable option, masking proves to be a valuable alternative, effectively circumventing spurious statistical correlations that RC models can learn to exploit.\n- Both neural RC models are able to largely retain or even improve their strong performance when answers are masked: they are able to leverage the textual context of the candidate expressions.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can see the following:\n- In image1, the test accuracy comparison when only using documents leading to the correct answer (gold chain) is shown.

The statistics on the ConvAI2 dataset bear this out, where the Seq2Seq model responses have lower word and character counts and use fewer rare words than the human responses.\n   - **RetNRef**: Makes some improvements in this regard, e.g. doubling the use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) and smaller gains for words with frequency less than 1000, but are still not close to human statistics.\n   - **RetNRef++**: Boosts the use of the retrieval and makes the statistics much closer to human ones.\n\n2. **Performance Metrics**:\n   - **Engagingness**: RetNRef++ has superior engagingness scores compared to Seq2Seq for all RetNRef variants, and slightly outperforms the retriever which it conditions on.\n   - **Fluency**: RetNRef++ also performs well in fluency, although like the Memory Network model, it is weaker at using the persona than Seq2Seq.\n   - **Consistency**: RetNRef++ maintains consistency while generating text which a retrieval model cannot.\n   - **Persona**: RetNRef++ is weaker at using the persona than Seq2Seq.\n\n3. **Human-like Conversational Abilities**:\n   - **RetNRef++**: The improved model RetNRef++ does use the retriever, but can also generate novel content when it wants to, which a standard retriever cannot. It has similar statistics to human utterances and provides more engaging conversations according to human judgments.\n   - **Seq2Seq**: Inferior to the other methods in terms of engagingness, fluency, and consistency.\n   - **RetNRef**: Improves upon Seq2Seq but still not as close to human statistics as RetNRef++.\n\nIn conclusion, RetNRef++ has superior word statistics and performance metrics compared to Seq2Seq and RetNRef, and it provides more engaging and human-like conversations.

According to the data provided in the images and text quotes, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. **Fee Rate Changes**:\n   - The fee rate for equity investments remained constant at 76 basis points (bps) from 2018 to 2020, as shown in image1.\n   - The fee rate for fixed income investments decreased from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020, indicating a reduction in the fee charged for managing fixed income assets.\n   - The fee rate for alternative/other investments also decreased from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020, reflecting a lower fee structure for these types of assets.\n\n2. **AUM Changes**:\n   - The total AUM increased from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020, as seen in image4. This growth is primarily driven by increases in equity, fixed income, and alternative/other investments.\n   - Equity AUM grew from $111 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020.\n   - Fixed income AUM increased from $71 billion in 2018 to $86 billion in 2020.\n   - Alternative/other AUM rose from $131 billion in 2018 to $145 billion in 2020.\n\n3. **Impact on Revenues**:\n   - Despite the decrease in fee rates for fixed income and alternative/other investments, the overall increase in AUM suggests that the firm's revenues could still benefit from the higher asset base. The text quote [9] supports this by stating that asset management revenues increased by 15% in 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows.\n   - The timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period, as mentioned in text quote [7], may also impact the firm's reported ratios, such as the Expense efficiency ratio, in certain periods"}

In 2018, the cost efficiency ratio was 64.4%, which increased to 75.5% in 2019, and then decreased to 68.3% in 2020. This indicates that the company's efficiency in managing costs relative to its revenue generation has improved in 2020 compared to 2019, but is still higher than the level in 2018. The cost efficiency ratio is a key performance indicator for banks, as it reflects the ability of the bank to control its operating expenses while generating revenue. A lower cost efficiency ratio is generally considered better, as it indicates that the bank is able to generate more revenue with less cost. The improvement in the cost efficiency ratio in 2020 suggests that the bank has been successful in reducing its operating expenses and improving its revenue generation capabilities. However, the ratio is still higher than the level in 2018, which may indicate that there is still room for improvement in the bank's cost management practices.

In 2020, the Corporation's capital expenditures (Capex) were $21.4 billion, a decrease from the $31.1 billion in 2019. This reduction was part of a broader strategy to strengthen liquidity and manage costs in response to lower realized prices for the Corporation's products, which led to substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019. The Corporation took steps to issue $23 billion of long-term debt and implement significant capital and operating cost reductions, ending the year with $68 billion in gross debt and intending to reduce debt over time.\n\nIn terms of taxes, ExxonMobil's total taxes on the income statement decreased from $38.5 billion in 2019 to $22.8 billion in 2020. This decrease was driven by a relative tax benefit due to asset impairments recorded in 2020. The effective tax rate also decreased from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, primarily due to a change in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates.\n\nThe financial implications of these changes include a focus on cost management and liquidity, as well as a strategic adjustment in response to market conditions.

The net earnings for 2019, 2020, and 2021 were $81,417 million, $42,521 million, and $89,795 million, respectively. This indicates a significant increase in net earnings from 2020 to 2021, with a decrease from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThe performance of different segments is as follows:\n\n- Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020, and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates, and higher losses in the life reinsurance business.

This net liability decreased from the previous year, which could have contributed to the increase in the provision for income taxes.

The text does not provide specific figures for these metrics, but it does mention that the company evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its assets may not be recoverable. This suggests that the company is aware of the potential risks to its financial performance and takes steps to mitigate them.\n\nLooking at the images, we can see that the financial performance of Amberjack has changed over the three-year period. In 2018, the company had total revenues of $204 million, operating income of $157 million, and net income of $157 million. In 2019, the company's total revenues increased to $280 million, operating income increased to $202 million, and net income increased to $201 million. In 2020, the company's total revenues decreased to $220 million, operating income decreased to $97 million, and net income decreased to $88 million.\n\nOverall, the financial performance of Amberjack has been volatile over the three-year period, with fluctuations in total revenues, operating income, and net income.

This increase is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 compared to the prior year. In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards, as mentioned in [1] and [8]. In contrast, in 2019, the net discrete tax benefits were $475 million, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to conversion of employee share-based awards, as stated in [3] and [5].\n\nThe overall compensation expenses for the Firm increased by 11% from the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher revenues, higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, and incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, as noted in [9]. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest.\n\nIn summary, the increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits, while the overall compensation expenses increased by 11% during the same period, driven by various factors including higher revenues and the E*TRADE acquisition. The changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions are related to the overall compensation expenses as they both reflect the Firm's financial performance and compensation practices. ![The effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020](image4) ![The net discrete tax benefits decreased from $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020](image4) ![The overall compensation expenses increased by 11% from the prior year](image1) ![The increase in compensation expenses was driven by various factors including higher revenues and the E*TRADE acquisition](image1) ![The increase in compensation expenses was partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest](image1) ![The"}

The factors contributing to these changes include a decrease in operating income, an increase in interest expense, and a decrease in other comprehensive income. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower sales and revenues, while the increase in interest expense was due to higher debt levels. The decrease in other comprehensive income was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges.

This means that any changes in noncontrolling interests will be reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, we can see the following changes in total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022:\n\n- Total stockholders' equity increased from $59,268 million in 2021 to $64,166 million in 2022.\n- Noncontrolling interests decreased from $514 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022.\n\nThese changes can be seen in the comprehensive income statements, which show the following:\n\n- Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $1,137 million in 2021 to $1,829 million in 2022.\n- Comprehensive income attributable to Costco increased from $17,564 million in 2021 to $20,642 million in 2022.\n\nThe decrease in noncontrolling interests and the increase in comprehensive income attributable to Costco suggest that Costco's ownership of its consolidated entities has increased, resulting in a higher proportion of comprehensive income being attributable to Costco. This is reflected in the increase in total stockholders' equity and the decrease in noncontrolling interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 reflect an increase in Costco's ownership of its consolidated entities, resulting in a higher proportion of comprehensive income being attributable to Costco. This is reflected in the increase in total stockholders' equity and the decrease in noncontrolling interests. The comprehensive income statements show that comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased while comprehensive income attributable to Costco increased. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the changes in Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests from 2021 to 2022 reflect an increase in Costco's ownership of its consolidated entities, resulting in a"}

The other comprehensive income (loss) also saw a significant increase, from a loss of $481,387 in 2018 to a gain of $278,740 in 2020. This improvement in other comprehensive income is primarily due to gains in foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges, as well as a reduction in losses from defined benefit plans and investments. These trends in comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components have positively impacted shareholders' equity, which increased from $10,724,588 in 2018 to $17,491,173 in 2020.

In 2020, the net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion, driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables and payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions due to COVID-19 relief programs. However, this was partially offset by performance-related declines within net income and an increase in workforce rebalancing payments. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables. Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9.7 billion in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9.0 billion in 2019, driven by an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments. Overall, the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5.36 billion in 2020, compared to a decrease of $3.29 billion in 2019. The financial adjustments, such as the acquisition-related adjustments and the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform, also had an impact on the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The acquisition-related adjustments increased the gross profit and gross profit margin, while the U.S. Tax Reform had a negative impact on the effective tax rate and the income from continuing operations. The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was also impacted by the debt used to fund Global Financing assets, which remained at 9 to 1 at December 31, 2020.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses and customer service expenses. Additionally, there was an increase in Sky segment expenses primarily due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation. The decrease in Corporate and Other expenses was primarily due to severance charges related to the businesses in the prior year period.

This suggests a strategic focus on expanding commercial lending activities, possibly to capitalize on business growth opportunities or to diversify the loan portfolio.\n- **Consumer Loans:** Consumer loans decreased, mainly due to paydowns in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio and the transfer of a substantial amount of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale. This indicates a strategic shift towards reducing exposure to residential mortgages and possibly reallocating resources to other areas.\n\n**Deposits:**\n- **Total Deposits:** Total deposits increased, reflecting a strategic effort to attract more funds, which could be used to support loan growth or to maintain liquidity.\n- **Time Deposits:** There was a significant decline in time deposits, particularly in brokered certificates of deposit (CDs) and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices. This suggests a strategic decision to manage under the asset cap and reduce reliance on time deposits, possibly to lower funding costs or to adjust the deposit mix.\n\n**Inferences about Strategy:**\n- The increase in commercial loans and the decrease in consumer loans indicate a strategic pivot towards commercial lending, which may be driven by better credit quality and economic conditions in the commercial sector.\n- The increase in total deposits, despite a decline in time deposits, suggests a focus on attracting more stable and lower-cost funding sources, which could improve the financial entity's funding structure and reduce interest rate risk.\n- The strategic adjustments in loan and deposit figures reflect a proactive approach to managing the financial entity's balance sheet, optimizing the mix of assets and liabilities, and positioning the entity to take advantage of market opportunities while mitigating risks.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial entity's strategy appears to be focused on expanding commercial lending, reducing exposure to residential mortgages, and optimizing the deposit mix to improve funding stability and reduce costs. This strategic approach is likely aimed at enhancing profitability and resilience in a changing economic environment. \n\n![Loan and Deposit Figures from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021](image5)  \n![Loan Maturities and Interest Rates as of December 31, 20"}

The decrease in 2020 was mainly due to lower costs associated with Serie A and entertainment programming, partially offset by an increase in the number of sporting events due to COVID-19. Additionally, the decrease in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 was related to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics.

The GBM segment saw an increase in adjusted revenue, driven by strong performance in Global Markets, which offset the impact of lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments. This resulted in a gross RWA reduction of $37 billion globally. However, the Global Banking segment faced a decrease in revenue by $0.1 billion or 2%, mainly due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions. Despite this, capital markets revenue grew, and net interest income increased from corporate lending. The Corporate Centre's adjusted revenue increased by $0.4 billion, largely related to movements in own shares held by the global businesses, which offset an equivalent adverse movement in these businesses.

By 2020, the net income had decreased to $1,491 million, and the retained earnings had increased to $37,906 million. The significant factors affecting these changes include the following:\n\n1. **Net Income Decrease**: The net income decreased from $1,741 million in 2018 to $1,491 million in 2020. This decrease can be attributed to various factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and the global economy. Additionally, the company's restructuring efforts and other corporate-level expenses may have contributed to the decline in net income.\n\n2. **Retained Earnings Increase**: Despite the decrease in net income, the retained earnings increased from $39,898 million in 2018 to $37,906 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to the company's strong cash flow generation and its capital management strategy, which includes share repurchases and dividend increases. The company returned approximately 109% of its free cash flow to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases and dividends, which helped to increase the retained earnings.\n\n3. **Dividend Payments**: The company paid dividends of $2.63 per share in 2018, $3.21 per share in 2019, and $3.72 per share in 2020. The increase in dividend payments over the years contributed to the decrease in retained earnings, as a portion of the net income was distributed to shareholders.\n\n4. **Share Repurchases**: The company repurchased shares worth $2.6 billion in 2020, which reduced the outstanding shares by 1.4%. This share repurchase activity helped to increase the retained earnings, as the company used its cash reserves to buy back shares from the market.\n\n5. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: The company reported other comprehensive income (loss) of $133 million in 2018, $81 million in 2019, and $71 million in 2020"}

The net operating income increased by $340 million, or 284%, from $56 million in 2019 to $340 million in 2020. This substantial increase was primarily driven by higher volatility levels and increased client activity, which supported an improved Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) performance, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit. Rates also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds. Additionally, the company reallocated revenue and expenses relating to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses, which improved the reflection of revenue and expense related to the global businesses generating or utilizing these activities. The adjusted revenue from Global Markets also saw a significant increase, with the FICC segment experiencing a 33% growth in revenue from $4,737 million in 2019 to $6,278 million in 2020.

This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, as mentioned in [10]. The asset composition of the insurance business also changed, with cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increasing from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, while fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and the decrease in fixed maturity securities suggest a shift towards more liquid assets, which could be a response to the uncertain economic environment and the need for liquidity. The implications of these changes could be a lower return on investment due to the lower interest rates on cash and cash equivalents, but also a more stable and less risky asset composition. The company's focus on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments, as mentioned in [6], supports this interpretation. The decrease in net investment income and the shift in asset composition could also impact the company's overall profitability and financial stability. \n\n![Net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021](image2)\n![Asset composition of the insurance business changed from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

These impacts can arise from major events such as raw material sourcing issues, internal or external manufacturing facility disruptions, commodity shortages, strikes, sanctions, natural disasters, and pandemics. To mitigate these risks, Nestlé has implemented policies and procedures to ensure the health and safety of its people, products, and sites. The company also has business continuity and disaster recovery plans for key sites and actively manages price risk on key commodities.\n\nIn relation to Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions, the report provides a detailed breakdown of the number of factories in various countries within the Americas (AMS), Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA), and Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa (AOA). This distribution is crucial for understanding the company's exposure to supply chain disruptions in different regions. For instance, the Americas region has a significant number of factories, with the United States having 72 factories, indicating a high level of production and potential vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. Similarly, the EMEA region has a substantial number of factories, with Germany having 12 factories, which could also be at risk of supply chain disruptions. The AOA region, with countries like India and Indonesia having multiple factories, also faces potential supply chain risks. By understanding the distribution of its factories, Nestlé can better assess and mitigate the risks associated with supply chain disruptions in different regions. ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image1) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image3) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image5) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image4) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image2) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image1) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image3) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image5) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image4) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image2) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image1) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image3) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image5) ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image4) ![Nestlé's factory"}

This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in long-term debt and other liabilities, as well as a decrease in customer deposits.\n\n**Comprehensive Income:**\n- The comprehensive income for the entity decreased from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net income, as well as a decrease in other comprehensive income, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits.\n\n**Cash Flows:**\n- The cash flows from operating activities increased from $13,632 million in 2020 to $14,645 million in 2021. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net income, as well as an increase in other non-cash items.\n- The cash flows from investing activities decreased from $(16,707) million in 2020 to $(10,529) million in 2021. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the net increase in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as a decrease in the purchase of premises and equipment.\n- The cash flows from financing activities decreased from $(15,953) million in 2020 to $(14,933"}

In 2019, the company experienced a high effective tax rate of 41%, primarily due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property and the benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets. This resulted in a substantial tax provision of $3,095 million. In 2020, the effective tax rate decreased to 9%, with a tax provision of $521 million. This reduction was mainly attributed to the benefit from the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction and the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards. In 2021, the effective tax rate further decreased to 12%, with a tax provision of $1,231 million. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from the FDII deduction and the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards. Additionally, the company recognized a benefit from research and development tax credits. The trends in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 indicate a significant reduction in the effective tax rate and a decrease in the tax provision, primarily due to the benefit from the FDII deduction and the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards. However, the company also recognized a benefit from research and development tax credits in 2021. The significant changes in the tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 are primarily due to the changes in the tax laws and regulations, as well as the company's tax planning strategies. The company's tax planning strategies include the use of tax credits, the benefit from the FDII deduction, and the excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards. The company's tax planning strategies have been successful in reducing the effective tax rate and the tax provision over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.

The investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased from $8,085 million in 2020 to $9,574 million in 2021, a reduction of $1,489 million or 18%.

In 2019, the total dividends declared were 33,781,000, while in 2020, the total dividends declared were 15,866,000. This represents a decrease of approximately 53%. The decrease in dividends can be attributed to the impact of COVID-19 on the business, which resulted in a significant reduction in sales and a temporary closure of part of the store network during the final quarter of FY20. As a result, the company deferred the payment date of the interim dividend and reduced the franking percentage. Additionally, the company recognized rent concessions as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which further impacted the financial position of the company. The decrease in dividends is also reflected in the decrease in the dividend franking account, which decreased from 4,620,000 in 2019 to 641,000 in 2020. The decrease in dividends is a direct result of the company's efforts to manage its financial position during the challenging economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, mainly due to lower rates, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income decreased by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a decline in service charges primarily due to higher deposit balances and lower card income due to decreased client activity, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results. Additionally, home equity production and first mortgage loan originations decreased by $2.8 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, primarily driven by a decline in applications and nonconforming applications. ![Consumer Banking financial performance decreased in 2020](image4)\n\nFor the **Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)** segment, which consists of Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, the revenue and net income also showed a decline.

This increase is reflected in the financial statements as an increase in the company's operating lease liabilities, which also rose from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020.

As per the text, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Reductions for Tax Positions of Prior Years**: The text mentions a $249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. This reduction in liabilities contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset.\n\n2. **Impact of Changes in Uncertain Tax Positions**: The image shows that the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions was a reduction of 4.0% in 2020, compared to a reduction of 0.1% in 2019. This indicates a more significant adjustment in tax positions in 2020, which likely contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset.\n\n3. **Valuation Allowance**: The text states that the valuation allowance decreased by $1 million in 2020. A decrease in the valuation allowance would increase the net deferred tax asset, as it reduces the amount of deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized.\n\n4. **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: The image shows that the total deferred tax assets increased from $197 million in 2019 to $343 million in 2020, while the total deferred tax liabilities decreased from $78 million in 2019 to $90 million in 2020. This net increase in deferred tax assets and decrease in deferred tax liabilities directly contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset.\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020 due to a combination of factors including the settlement of uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances, and the net increase in deferred tax assets and liabilities. This reflects a more favorable tax position for the company in 2020 compared to 2019. \n\n![Net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020](image3)  \n![Total deferred tax assets increased from $197 million in 2019 to"}

The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared.

The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million, adjusted for currency, was driven by various factors including the decline in financing assets and the company's portfolio management strategy. This increase in assets was accompanied by a decrease in long-term debt of $3,560 million, adjusted for currency, primarily due to lower funding requirements. These changes reflect a strategic shift in IBM's financial management, aiming to optimize its asset base and reduce debt levels.\n\nThe impact on cash flows is evident from the data provided. In 2020, net cash used for acquisitions decreased by $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year, and there was a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations. Additionally, there was an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million. These changes in cash flows indicate a more conservative approach to financing and investment, aligning with the reduction in debt and the strategic management of assets.\n\nFurthermore, the decrease in total equity by $258 million from December 31, 2019, was primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments. This decrease in equity was partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million. The overall decrease in equity, despite the increase in net income, suggests that IBM was prioritizing shareholder returns through dividends and managing its equity base in response to the changing financial landscape.\n\nIn summary, the financial changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt between 2019 and 2020, along with the shifts in cash flows and equity, reflect IBM's strategic efforts to optimize its financial structure, reduce debt, and manage its asset base effectively. These changes have contributed to a more stable and resilient financial standing for the company. ![The table shows the financial changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt between 2019 and 2020, highlighting the impact on IBM's overall financial standing.](image2) !["}

The decline in credit card purchase volumes suggests lower retail spending, while the decrease in home equity portfolio balances could reflect reduced borrowing for home improvements or other purposes.

For coal, the underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021, largely due to lower price impacts and decreased volumes. The average realized sales price for metallurgical coal dropped from US$130.97 per tonne in FY2020 to US$106.64 per tonne in FY2021, and for energy coal, it decreased from US$57.10 per tonne to US$58.42 per tonne. These price declines, along with lower volumes, contributed to the reduction in EBITDA. Additionally, controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by higher maintenance costs and increased stripping volumes at Queensland Coal. However, cost reduction initiatives partially offset these increases.\n\nFor nickel, the underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021. This increase was primarily due to higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year. The average realized sales price for nickel rose from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021. Despite the positive impact of higher prices, unfavorable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these gains.\n\nIn summary, the key drivers behind the impacts of commodity price changes on BHP's financial results include fluctuations in average realized sales prices, changes in production volumes, and variations in controllable cash costs.

The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue primarily due to delivery of regulatory credits in 2020 under a previous arrangement where we had received payment in advance as of December 31, 2019, a larger increase in operating lease vehicles as Model 3 direct leasing was introduced in the second quarter of 2019 and Model Y direct leasing was introduced in the third quarter of 2020, and a larger increase in accounts receivables of government rebates already passed through to customers. \n\n![Tesla's total liabilities increased from $34,309 million in 2019 to $52,148 million in 2020](image4) \n\n![Tesla's total liabilities increased from $34,309 million in 2019 to $52,148 million in 2020](image5) \n\n![Tesla's total liabilities increased from $34,309 million in 2019 to $52,148 million in 2020](image3) \n\n![Tesla's total liabilities increased from $34,309 million in 2019 to $52,148 million in 2020](image2) \n\n![Tesla's total liabilities increased from $34,309 million in 20"}

This is significantly higher than the net cash consideration for IDT and Others in 2018, which was $2,173 million, as shown in image1. The increase in net cash consideration from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to the larger scale of the Cytiva Acquisition compared to the IDT acquisition. The Cytiva Acquisition involved a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion, while the IDT acquisition involved a total consideration of $95 million. Additionally, the Cytiva Acquisition required the divestiture of certain product lines, which generated a pretax gain of $455 million, further increasing the net cash consideration. In contrast, the IDT acquisition did not involve any divestitures or significant gains.

The net income increased from a loss of $5,561 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,689 million in 2021. This improvement was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs.

The financial activities that contributed to these changes include higher realizations, higher margins on refined product sales, and higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem. Additionally, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, higher asset sales gains, and favorable foreign currency effects also contributed to the improvement in net income and comprehensive income.

In contrast, 98,347 male employees were entitled to parental leave, with 2023 availing it and 1,941 returning to work.

However, this was partially offset by an increase in workforce rebalancing payments and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes. The net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables. The net cash used in financing activities was $9,721 million, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, driven by early retirements and debt maturities. Overall, these changes resulted in a net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $5,361 million in 2020, compared to a decrease of $3,290 million in 2019. This indicates that IBM's cash flow improved in 2020 due to increased cash from operating activities and decreased cash used in investing activities, despite increased cash used in financing activities. ![Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3,426 million in 2020](image4) ![Net cash used in investing activities decreased $23,908 million in 2020](image4) ![Net cash used in financing activities was $9,721 million in 2020](image4) ![Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5,361 million in 2020](image4) ![Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $3,290 million in 2019](image4) ![Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3,426 million in 2020](image4) ![Net cash used in investing activities decreased $23,908 million in 2020](image4) ![Net cash used in financing activities was $9,721 million in 2020](image4) ![Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5,361 million in 2020](image4)"}

The risk-based capital ratios, which include the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, and Total capital ratio, increased under both approaches in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. Additionally, the credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both approaches, mainly due to increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility. The leverage-based capital ratios, which include the Tier 1 leverage ratio and the SLR, also increased in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in the SLR was due to the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, as per a Federal Reserve interim final rule in effect until March 31, 2021. The increase in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was due to an increase in Adjusted average assets, which is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the firm's own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets, and other capital deductions. The increase in the Supplementary leverage exposure was due to an increase in derivatives, potential future exposure, and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection, as well as an increase in the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions and the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.

The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position. The significant year-over-year increase in \"average\" and \"high\" impact on the value at risk computation above was primarily due to an increase in interest rate and foreign currency volatility during the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a \"parametric delta-gamma\" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year. We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive and foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation. The fair values of PMI’s short-term borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the amounts disclosed above. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.

This represents a growth of approximately $798.2 million or about 3.3% year-over-year. The increase in net property and equipment value can be attributed to fixed asset additions and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by depreciation. The company's net property and equipment value is a significant component of its total assets, representing approximately 50% of the total assets at year-end 2020. This indicates that McDonald's has a substantial investment in physical assets, which is essential for its operations and growth strategy. The increase in net property and equipment value suggests that the company is continuing to invest in its physical assets, which could potentially lead to future growth and profitability. However, it is important to note that the company's net property and equipment value is also subject to depreciation, which can impact its financial performance over time.

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with the Tokyo Olympics, revenue in the Media segment increased by 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period. The text also mentions that advertising revenue increased due to higher pricing in the current year period, reduced spending from advertisers in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, increased advertising revenue in Peacock, and an increased number of sporting events, partially offset by continued audience ratings declines at the networks. Additionally, distribution revenue increased due to contractual rate increases, increased distribution revenue at Peacock, and credits accrued in 2020 at some of the regional sports networks from fewer games played due to COVID-19 as certain distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur.

The Underlying EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2020 was US$22,071 million, while for the year ended 30 June 2021, it increased to US$37,379 million. This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Change in Sales Prices:**\n   - The net price impact due to higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal contributed to an increase of US$16,965 million. This was partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG, which resulted in a decrease of US$870 million.\n\n2. **Change in Volumes:**\n   - The change in volumes had a negative impact of US$312 million. This was due to natural field decline at Petroleum, lower volumes due to adverse weather impacts in the Gulf of Mexico (Petroleum) and NSWEC, combined with dragline maintenance and higher strip ratios at BMC. However, this was partially offset by the acquisition of the additional 28% working interest at Shenzi and increased volumes at Nickel West following resource transition and major quadrennial maintenance shutdowns in the prior period.\n\n3. **Change in Controllable Cash Costs:**\n   - The change in controllable cash costs had a positive impact of US$34 million. This was due to higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam due to stronger mill and smelter performance and at Nickel West as volumes increased following planned maintenance shutdowns in the prior period and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of South Flank. This was largely offset by strong cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across assets, lower technology costs, and a gain from the optimized outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence.\n\n4. **Exploration and Business Development:**\n   - Lower exploration expenses due to lower seismic activity in Petroleum resulted in a positive impact of US$109 million.\n\n5. **Change in Other Costs:**\n   - The impact of the stronger Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar resulted in a negative impact of US$1,588 million.\n   - The impact of inflation on the Group's cost base resulted in a negative impact of US$28"}

The graph shows that both indices started at a normalized value of 100 in April 2002. Over the year, both indices experienced fluctuations, with GPI showing a more volatile trend compared to BSE Sensex.

This represents a significant increase in the value of financial instruments over the period. The increase in the value of financial instruments can be attributed to various factors, including changes in market conditions, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates. The company's use of derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to manage exposure to foreign exchange market risks may have also contributed to the increase in the value of financial instruments. The company's net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was $39 million at September 26, 2021, and negligible at September 27, 2020, as mentioned in text quote [1]. This indicates that the company's use of derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk has increased over the period. The company's use of interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate risks related to long-term debt may have also contributed to the increase in the value of financial instruments. The company's net gains and losses on interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fixed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized in earnings as interest expense in the current period, as mentioned in text quote [2]. The company's use of forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuances through 2025 may have also contributed to the increase in the value of financial instruments. The fair values of the company's forward-starting interest rate swaps recorded in total liabilities were $105 million at September 26, 2021, as mentioned in text quote [7]. This indicates that the company's use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk has increased over the period.

In 2020, the gross margin percentage was 10.04%, which decreased to 8.88% in 2022. This decline can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Decrease in Core Merchandise Categories**: The gross margin in core merchandise categories decreased by 27 basis points, with the most significant decline in fresh foods. This reduction was across all categories, impacting the overall gross margin percentage negatively.\n\n2. **Impact of Gasoline Prices**: The company's gasoline business, while enhancing traffic, generally has a lower gross margin percentage compared to non-gasoline business. The rapidly changing gasoline prices significantly impacted the near-term net sales growth. Rising gasoline prices, although benefiting net sales growth, negatively impacted the gross margin percentage due to the higher sales base.\n\n3. **LIFO Charge**: The U.S. segment was negatively impacted by a LIFO charge, which contributed to the decrease in gross margin percentage.\n\n4. **Increased 2% Rewards**: The Other International segment was negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards, further contributing to the decline in gross margin percentage.\n\n5. **Inflation and Cost Increases**: Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what the company had experienced in recent years. The company's merchandising and pricing strategies, such as reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meeting competition, negatively impacted the gross margin and gross margin percentage.\n\n6. **Impact of COVID-19**: The cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19 positively impacted the gross margin, but this was partially offset by other factors.\n\nIn summary, the gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022 due to a combination of factors including a decrease in core merchandise categories, the impact of gasoline prices, a LIFO charge, increased 2% rewards, inflation and cost increases, and the cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19. \n\n![Gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022](image1) \n![Gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022](image2) \n![Gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022](image3) \n![Gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 202"}

The main contributing sectors to this change were Financials, Real estate, and Industrials, which saw increases in exposure from $40,992 million to $44,358 million, $28,348 million to $25,484 million, and $13,136 million to $15,861 million, respectively. Additionally, the Commercial real estate sector also contributed to the increase, with exposure rising from $9,461 million to $10,064 million. The overall increase in exposure was primarily due to growth in securities-based loans and Residential real estate loans within the Wealth Management business segment and an increase in Relationship lending commitments within the Institutional Securities business segment. The sectors currently in focus, which are more sensitive to the current economic environment, include retail, air travel, upstream energy, lodging and leisure, and healthcare services and systems. As of December 31, 2020, exposures to these sectors represented less than 10% of total Institutional Securities business segment lending exposure, with approximately 90% of these exposures being either investment grade and/or secured by collateral. The future developments of COVID-19 and related government actions and their effect on the economic environment remain uncertain, which may impact the sectors and the extent of the impacts over time. The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment principally resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19, partially offset by charge-offs. The provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19. Charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment. The base scenario used in the ACL models as of December 31, 2020, was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models.

This is a substantial increase from the $7,548 million reduction in core gross profit in 2020, as shown in the table in image4. The increase in the impact of these adjustments on core gross profit from 2020 to 2021 indicates that the company's cost of goods sold was higher in 2021, which negatively affected its core gross profit. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as changes in the cost of raw materials, increased production costs, or other factors that affected the company's ability to produce goods at a lower cost. Overall, the adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the company's core gross profit in both 2020 and 2021, and the increase in the impact of these adjustments from 2020 to 2021 suggests that the company may need to take steps to reduce its cost of goods sold in order to improve its core gross profit in the future. ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020](image3) ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2020](image4) ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020](image3) ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2020](image4) ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020](image3) ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2020](image4) ![The adjustments to 'Cost of Goods Sold' had a significant impact on the core gross profit in 2021 compared to 2020](image3) ![The adjustments"}

The retained earnings decreased from $13,837 million in 2020 to $13,474 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in the company's accumulated profits. This decrease could be attributed to various factors such as increased dividend payments, share repurchases, or higher expenses. Additionally, the other comprehensive income (loss) also decreased from a loss of $2,895 million in 2020 to a loss of $2,945 million in 2021. This decline in other comprehensive income could be due to foreign currency translation adjustments, net unrealized gains or losses on debt securities, or changes in the fair value of pension and postretirement benefits. Overall, these changes in shareholders' equity suggest that the company's financial position may have been negatively affected during this period.

In 2019, the total net periodic benefit cost was $638 million, which increased to $239 million in 2020. This increase was largely due to a net mark-to-market loss of $468 million in 2019, as indicated by the image1 data. In 2021, the total net periodic benefit cost dropped to $(1,122) million, with a net mark-to-market gain of $833 million, as shown in image1. For 2022, the expected total net periodic benefit cost is $(121) million, with a net mark-to-market loss of $1 million, as per image1. This trend highlights the significant impact of mark-to-market losses or gains on the total net periodic benefit cost, with gains leading to a decrease in the cost and losses leading to an increase. The expected increase in expense in 2022 compared to 2021, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, is primarily due to changes in assumptions causing higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2021 and lower expected return on plan assets in 2022, as mentioned in text quote [9].

In 1998, the majority of investments were in the seed stage, with 78% of the funds allocated to this stage. By 2007, the distribution had changed dramatically, with only 10% of the funds going to the seed stage, 14% to the early stage, and 74% to the mid-stage. This indicates a trend towards investing in more mature companies that are closer to market readiness and have a higher likelihood of generating returns. The shift can be attributed to the lessons learned from the dot-com bubble and the desire to mitigate risk by investing in companies with proven business models and market traction. The data from the image supports this conclusion, showing a clear increase in the proportion of funds allocated to later stages of investment over the years. This trend is consistent with the broader industry shift towards more selective and strategic investment approaches. The image also highlights the increasing importance of later-stage funding in the venture capital landscape, reflecting a more mature and sophisticated investment environment. The data from the image provides a clear visual representation of this shift, with the mid-stage investment category growing significantly over the years. This trend is likely to continue as venture capitalists seek to maximize returns and minimize risk by investing in companies with a higher probability of success. The image also shows that the early-stage investment category has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the proportion of funds allocated to this stage over the years. This suggests that there is still a demand for early-stage funding, but the focus has shifted towards later stages of investment.

According to the data, 41% of foreign-born and second-generation self-identified Hispanics report that all or most of their neighbors share their heritage, while this figure drops to 30% among third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics. This indicates a trend where the closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the more likely they are to live in neighborhoods with a high concentration of Hispanics. The data also shows that self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are more dispersed across the country, with only 17% reporting that all or most of their neighbors are Hispanic. This suggests that as generations move further from their immigrant roots, the likelihood of living in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood decreases. The implications of these trends for the future of Hispanic identity in the U.S. are significant, as lower immigration levels and continued high intermarriage rates may lead to a growing number of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestors who may not identify as Hispanic or Latino. Even among those who do self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, those in the second and third or higher generations may see their identity as more tied to the U.S. than to the origins of their parents. This pattern has been observed in many previous Pew Research Center Latino surveys. The data also highlights the importance of considering the generational context when examining Hispanic identity and experiences in the U.S. The findings suggest that the shape of Hispanic identity today is influenced by the varying views and experiences with Hispanic culture and identity among U.S.-born Hispanics of Hispanic and non-Hispanic heritages.

At that time, more expressed concern that government policies had gone too far restricting civil liberties (47%) than that they did not go far enough to protect the country (35%). However, by 2015, the share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points – from 72% to 46% – and now stands at its lowest point in the post-9/11 era. This indicates a growing concern that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, with 56% now saying their greater concern is that these policies have not gone far enough, compared to 28% who say their greater concern is that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties. This shift is particularly pronounced among Republicans, with 71% now saying their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January (57%) and 33 points since July 2013 (38%).

In March 2014, more said relying too much on force creates hatred (57%), compared with 37% who say overwhelming military force was the best way to defeat terrorism. Views were similar to those in 2014 when the question was previously asked in 2011 and 2004. Overall, the public is now more concerned that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country than that these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties. ![Public opinion regarding anti-terror policies has shifted significantly from 2004 to 2015](image3) ![The share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points – from 72% to 46% – and now stands at its lowest point in the post-9/11 era](image4) ![The balance of opinion has shifted since"}

Initially, in 2008, a majority of both Democrats and Republicans held the view that the U.S. was the leading global economy. However, by 2020, this perception had changed notably. Democrats became significantly less likely to see the U.S. as the leading global economy, with the percentage dropping from 54% in March to 44% today [1]. This decline in confidence is also reflected in the image, which shows a decrease in the share of Democrats who see the U.S. as the world's top economy [6].\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans' views have mostly held steady over the past four months, but there has been a notable increase in the share of Republicans who see China as an enemy, rising by 21 percentage points since the question was last asked in 2012 [7]. This shift is also evident in the image, which illustrates the increase in the percentage of Republicans who view China as an enemy [3].\n\nOverall, the perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power has become more polarized, with Democrats becoming less confident in the U.S.'s economic dominance and Republicans increasingly viewing China as a threat. This polarization is further highlighted by the image, which shows a significant increase in the percentage of Republicans who see China as an enemy [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power has changed significantly among Democrats and Republicans from 2008 to 2020, with Democrats becoming less confident and Republicans increasingly viewing China as a threat.

But Asians comprise a far smaller share of veterinarians (3%) and emergency medical technicians and paramedics (2%). \n\n[1] Using a broad definition of the STEM workforce, women make up half (50%) of all U.S. workers in STEM occupations, though their presence varies widely across occupational clusters and educational levels.

The data shows a clear trend of younger Republicans being more supportive of this policy compared to their older counterparts.

Initially, the population was very low, with only 130 residents in 1870. However, it surged dramatically in the late 1800s, reaching 14,096 by 1890. This rapid growth was largely due to the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which facilitated westward expansion and settlement. The railroad provided easier access to the area, while the Homestead Act offered land to settlers, encouraging immigration and settlement.\n\nThe population peaked in 1890 and then began a slow decline, with the number of residents dropping to 9,403 by 2000. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including the consolidation of farms, which reduced the need for a large rural population. The average farm size increased from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres by 2002, indicating a shift towards larger, more mechanized farming operations that required fewer workers. Additionally, the decline in rural school districts and the consolidation of schools contributed to the population decrease, as fewer families were needed to support the educational infrastructure.\n\nThe ethnic composition of Hamilton County also played a role in the population trends. Immigrants from various countries, including Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, settled in the county, creating distinct cultural enclaves. These ethnic groups often formed strong religious congregations, which served as focal points for their communities. The presence of these congregations, such as the Danish Lutheran Church in northeastern Hamilton County, helped to maintain a sense of cultural identity and community cohesion, even as the overall population declined.\n\nIn summary, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000, were shaped by a combination of factors, including the impact of the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, the consolidation of farms and schools, and the influence of ethnic and religious communities. These factors contributed to a period of rapid growth followed by a gradual decline in population. ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image3) ![A map of Hamilton County, Nebraska, showing the locations of various towns and communities](image5) ![A photograph of a church in Hamilton County, Nebraska,"}

The image shows that Republican support for increased defense spending from Europe has waned since 2017, with a notable drop from 62% in 2017 to 48% in 2019. Similarly, among Democrats, the support decreased from 34% in 2017 to 28% in 2019. This indicates a general trend of reduced enthusiasm for increased defense spending in Europe among both Republicans and Democrats over the two-year period. \n\n![Republican support for increased defense spending from Europe has waned since 2017](image2) \n\nIn summary, views on increased defense spending in Europe have become less favorable among both Republicans and Democrats from 2017 to 2019."}

A quarter of the respondents feel the U.S. response has been about as effective as other nations. This negative perception is consistent across different political affiliations, with Democrats overwhelmingly viewing the U.S. response as less effective (87%) compared to Republicans (22%). The survey also indicates that a significant majority of Americans (73%) believe the more effective way to help the economy recover is by significantly reducing the number of infections, rather than reopening businesses and schools without a significant decline in infections.

According to the text quote [10], the current peak hour capacity is 25 train cars (5 cars x 5 trains per hour). This is depicted in the image5, which shows a table with the \"Today\" scenario having 25 peak hour train cars.\n\nNow, let's examine the different scenarios for service improvement:\n\n1. **Metrolink Used Cars**: The text quote [5] mentions that 6 trains per hour with 8 cars each would result in 48 train cars. This is also shown in image5 under the \"Metrolink used cars\" scenario, which lists 30 peak hour train cars (6 cars x 5 trains per hour).\n\n2. **Electrification**: The text quote [2] states that 8 trains per hour with 8 cars each would result in 64 train cars. This is reflected in image5 under the \"Electrification\" scenario, which lists 36 peak hour train cars (6 cars x 6 trains per hour).\n\n3. **Longer Platforms**: The text quote [9] indicates that 6 cars x 5 trains per hour would result in 30 train cars. This is shown in image5 under the \"Longer platforms\" scenario, which lists 48 peak hour train cars (6 cars x 8 trains per hour).\n\n4. **Increase Frequency (w/HSR)**: The text quote [2] again mentions 8 trains per hour with 8 cars each, resulting in 64 train cars. This is depicted in image5 under the \"Increase frequency (w/HSR)\" scenario, which lists 64 peak hour train cars (8 cars x 8 trains per hour).\n\nIn summary, the peak hour train car requirement changes significantly with different scenarios for Caltrain service improvement. The current peak hour capacity is 25 train cars, while the scenarios for improvement range from 30 to 64 train cars. The \"Increase frequency (w/HSR)\" scenario shows the highest peak hour train car requirement of 64, indicating a substantial increase in capacity.\n\n![Current peak hour capacity of Caltrain](image5)\n![Metrolink used cars scenario](image5)\n![Electrification scenario](image5"}

Additionally, men are around twice as likely as women to say they more often see people trying to be deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%). However, majorities of both men (58%) and women (67%) see an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation.\n\nThe most common types of content encountered on social media include posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated, with 58% of users saying they see this type of content frequently. Another common type of content is people making accusations or starting arguments without waiting until they have all the facts, with 59% of users reporting frequent encounters with this type of content. Users also frequently encounter posts that teach them something useful they hadn't known before (21% frequently, 57% sometimes), and posts that appear to be about one thing but turn out to be about something else (33% frequently, 45% sometimes).\n\nIn terms of the acceptability of social media sites using data about users and their online activities, three-quarters of social media users find it acceptable for those platforms to use data to recommend events in their area, while a smaller majority (57%) thinks it is acceptable if their data are used to recommend other people they might want to be friends with. However, majorities of users across a range of age categories feel it is not acceptable for social platforms to use their data to serve them ads from political campaigns.\n\nOverall, users' comfort level with social media sites using their data is heavily context-dependent, and their experiences on social media are accompanied by both negative and positive interactions.

According to the Pew Research Center survey, 74% of women in computer jobs say they have experienced gender-related workplace discrimination, compared to only 16% of men in these jobs. This disparity is evident in various aspects, including pay inequities, being treated as if they were not competent at work because of their gender, and perceptions of fairness in opportunities for promotion and advancement. Women are also more likely to feel the need to prove themselves at work all or some of the time, and they perceive their workplace as paying too little attention to increasing gender diversity. In contrast, men in computer jobs are more likely to believe that women are usually given a fair shake where they work when it comes to opportunities for promotion and advancement.

According to the data, 23% of older adults have a physical or health condition that makes reading difficult or challenging, and 29% have a disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents them from fully participating in many common daily activities. This is higher than the 16% of all adults who have a physical or health condition that makes reading difficult or challenging, and the 18% of all adults who have a disability, handicap, or chronic disease that prevents them from fully participating in many common daily activities. As a result, older adults with physical health conditions are less likely to go online, have broadband at home, and own most major digital devices compared to older adults without these conditions. However, differences in technology adoption between these \"physically challenged\" seniors and the rest of the older adult population are somewhat more modest when it comes to tablets and e-book readers. Some 22% of seniors with a life-impacting disability or chronic disease, or a physical condition that makes reading difficult, own either a tablet computer or an e-book reader.

According to the provided image1, the proportion of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the exhaust gas from a gasoline engine is 13.7%, and the proportion of nitrous oxide (N2O) is 0.1%. These gases contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect, as they trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. The transportation sector, which includes gasoline engines, is a major source of these emissions, accounting for a significant portion of the total CO2 emissions in industrialized economies and worldwide. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps the Earth warm enough to support life, but human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased the concentration of these gases, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and climate change. The image2 illustrates the process of the greenhouse effect, showing how solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface and re-emitted as infrared radiation, which is then trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This process is essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature, but excessive greenhouse gases can lead to an increase in global temperatures, causing various environmental and health impacts. The image3 and image4 show microscopic views of cells, which are not directly related to the question about greenhouse gases. However, they can be used to illustrate the potential health impacts of air pollution, as particulate matter and other pollutants can enter the respiratory system and cause damage to cells and tissues.

For instance, the BLEU score for GL to EN increased from 2.2 to 13.2, and for PT to EN from 26.2 to 30.3. This improvement is more pronounced in low-resource languages like GL and PT, as shown in the table and graph. The gains are consistent across different language pairs, with the highest gains observed in GL to EN, which achieved a gain of up to 11 BLEU points. This indicates that pre-trained word embeddings are particularly useful for bootstrapping models that are on the threshold of being able to produce reasonable translations. The qualitative analysis of the translations from GL to EN also showed that pre-training helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary and generate sentences that are more grammatically well-formed. The results in the table clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. The increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings, indicating that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence. The comparison of the f-measure of target words, bucketed by frequency in the training corpus, also shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus. The results in the table also show that the BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT do generally follow the hypothesis that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases. RU and HE have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger. The results in the table also show that the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with GL/PT showing the largest gains, and BE/RU showing a small decrease.

The main components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**: This component is responsible for creating and storing multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions. It serves as the backbone of the RAR pipeline, enabling the system to retrieve relevant information from a large external memory or database. The retriever is designed to optimize retrieval speed through index construction techniques, such as the HNSW algorithm, which significantly reduces the dimensionality of the embeddings, thereby enhancing the speed of retrieval.\n\n2. **Retrieving and Ranking**: Upon receiving an input image at the inference stage, the RAR pipeline retrieves the top-$k$ class names most similar to the image. These retrieved candidate results are then ranked by the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to produce the final prediction results. This ranking process is guided by a prompt that merges the input image with the category information retrieved from memory, facilitating the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity.\n\n3. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: In object detection datasets, the methodology for extracting image embeddings is slightly different. The pipeline begins with cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing the cropped region to a fixed proportion. Additionally, a blurring technique is employed on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks.\n\n4. **Ranking Prompt**: The ranking prompt plays a critical role in guiding the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity. It integrates the input image with the category information retrieved from memory, ensuring that the MLLMs can make accurate and contextually aware classification predictions.\n\n5. **Memory Integration**: The RAR pipeline seamlessly integrates the memory with the retrieval process, using MLLMs to rank the retrieval results and enhance the performance in few-shot/zero-shot perception tasks. This integration allows the system to handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision and flexibility.\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline for multimodal retrieval is a comprehensive system that combines the strengths of VLMs and MLLMs to enhance the fine-grained few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs. By integrating a multimodal retriever, a ranking prompt, and pre-processing techniques for detection datasets, the RAR pipeline significantly boosts the performance of MLL"}

This indicates that two iterations are optimal for both tasks, enhancing the model's ability to accurately extract entities and relations. The dynamic span graph framework, which allows for the propagation of global contextual information, plays a crucial role in these improvements [9].

Even though both Faster R-CNN and DETR are still likely to further improve with longer training, we can conclude that DETR can be competitive with Faster R-CNN with the same number of parameters, achieving 42 AP on the COCO val subset. The way DETR achieves this is by improving AP  $\\mathrm{L}$   (+7.8), however note that the model is still lagging behind in AP S  (-5.5). DETR-DC5 with the same number of parameters and similar FLOP count has higher AP, but is still sign i cant ly behind in AP S  too.

This is achieved by receiving four segments: the source, the reference, a \"better\" hypothesis, and a \"worse\" one. These segments are independently encoded using a pre-trained cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer on top. The triplet margin loss then helps in ranking the hypotheses based on their similarity to the source and reference segments. This is illustrated in the figure where the triplet margin loss is applied to the sentence embeddings obtained from the pooling layer. The model aims to improve the correlation with human judgments by effectively ranking the translations. This is further supported by the results in Table 4, which show that including the source improves the overall correlation with human judgments. The architecture of the model, as depicted in Figure 2, highlights the importance of the triplet margin loss in achieving this goal. The model is trained to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted scores and quality assessments (DA, HTER or MQM), as illustrated in Figure 1. The combined features are then concatenated to the reference embedding and hypothesis embedding into a single vector that serves as input to a feed-forward regressor. The strength of these features is in highlighting the differences between embeddings in the semantic feature space.

These object queries are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network, resulting in final predictions. The model uses self- and encoder-decoder attention over these embeddings to reason about the relations of the objects and the global image context, allowing it to output the final set of predictions in parallel. This approach simplifies the detection pipeline by removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation. The model's architecture is depicted in Figure 2, where the object queries are part of the transformer encoder-decoder structure. The detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, including the positional encodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Figure 10. The model's performance is comparable to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO dataset, and it achieves significantly better performance on large objects, likely due to the processing of global information performed by the self-attention.

As shown in Figure 3 (left) and Figure 4, controlling for repetition leads to improvements across all aspects of conversational quality, including question-asking. Specifically, the repetition-controlled baseline model shows a notable increase in question-asking rates compared to the greedy and beam search baselines. This is evident from the bar graphs in Figure 4, where the repetition-controlled model (purple bars) consistently outperforms the other models in terms of question-asking frequency.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate when the model is set to produce 100% questions (z=10). This is because the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, which prevents the model from producing common question bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is.\" To address this, an extra setting (z=10 boost) is introduced, allowing the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\nIn summary, repetition control plays a crucial role in enhancing the frequency of question-asking in generated text, as it helps to maintain a balance between asking questions and avoiding repetition, ultimately leading to more engaging and high-quality conversations. ![Repetition control improves question-asking frequency](image1) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate at z=10](image4) ![Repetition control enhances overall conversational quality](image5) ![Repetition control improves question-asking frequency](image1) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate at z=10](image4) ![Repetition control enhances overall conversational quality](image5) ![Repetition control improves question-asking frequency](image1) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate at z=10](image4) ![Repetition control enhances overall conversational quality](image5) ![Repetition control improves question-asking frequency](image1) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate at z=10](image4) ![Repetition control enhances overall conversational quality](image5) ![Repetition control improves question-asking frequency](image1) ![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate at z=10](image4) ![Repetition control enhances overall conversational quality](image5) ![Repetition control improves question-"}

It aims to enhance the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop.\n   - **Example**: IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide the retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained retrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that systematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query.\n\n2. **Recursive Retrieval**:\n   - **Process**: Recursive retrieval is used in complex search scenarios where the user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. It allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\n   - **Example**: Recursive retrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process.\n\n3. **Adaptive Retrieval**:\n   - **Process**: Adaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced.\n   - **Example**: Adjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such as the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework and the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-RETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module outputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a sophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\n\nIn summary, iterative retrieval refines queries through feedback loops, recursive retrieval adapts to complex and nuanced search scenarios, and adaptive retrieval dynamically determines the optimal moments and content for retrieval, enhancing efficiency and relevance. \n\n![Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes](image5) \n\n![Modular RAG framework](image3) \n\n![Evaluation Framework](image4) \n\n![Evaluation Metrics](image1) \n\n![Task and Subtask](image2) \n\n![RAG Process"}

This indicates that RetrieveNRefine++ outperformed the Memory Network model in the majority of the evaluated dialogues. The win rate is a measure of how often one model's responses were preferred over the other's by human evaluators. In this case, RetrieveNRefine++ was preferred more often than the Memory Network model, suggesting that it generated more engaging and coherent responses. The win rate is calculated by comparing the number of times one model's responses were preferred over the other's, and then dividing that number by the total number of comparisons. In this case, RetrieveNRefine++ was preferred 340 times out of 1196 comparisons, resulting in a win rate of 54.5%. This is a significant improvement over the Memory Network model, which had a win rate of only 284 out of 1196 comparisons, or 23.7%.

When gold paragraphs are included, the F1 score increases, as seen in the comparison between the open-domain setting with 500 paragraphs (39.12 F1) and the same setting with an additional gold paragraph (53.12 F1) [5]. This indicates that the presence of relevant information (gold paragraphs) is crucial for model performance. On the other hand, the introduction of distractors can decrease the F1 score, as observed when the model is trained on adversarial distractors, leading to a drop from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 [4]. However, retraining the model on these adversarial distractors can help recover some of the original accuracy, suggesting that the model can adapt to more challenging distractors with additional training. The implications of these findings are that the quality and relevance of the distractors and gold paragraphs play a critical role in the performance of multi-hop question answering models, and future work should focus on developing improved methods for distractor collection and retrieval systems to enhance model performance. ![Types of questions and their F1 scores](image4) ![F1 scores for different settings](image5) ![F1 scores for different training data](image2) ![F1 scores for different models](image3) ![Types of questions and their F1 scores](image1) ![F1 scores for different settings](image5) ![F1 scores for different training data](image2) ![F1 scores for different models](image3) ![Types of questions and their F1 scores](image1) ![F1 scores for different settings](image5) ![F1 scores for different training data](image2) ![F1 scores for different models](image3) ![Types of questions and their F1 scores](image1) ![F1 scores for different settings](image5) ![F1 scores for different training data](image2) ![F1 scores for different models](image3) ![Types of questions and their F1 scores](image1) ![F1 scores for different settings](image5) ![F1 scores for different training data](image2) ![F1 scores for different models](image3) ![Types of questions and their F1 scores](image1) ![F1 scores for different settings](image5) ![F1 scores for different training data](image2)"}

The retrieval granularity is an important factor in the performance of the retrieval model, as it can affect the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved information. In the case of RAPTOR, the use of chunks may help to ensure that the retrieved information is both relevant and concise, which can improve the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the use of chunks may also help to reduce the computational cost of the retrieval process, as it allows for a more efficient indexing and retrieval of the data. Overall, the use of chunks as the retrieval granularity in RAPTOR is a key aspect of the method's design, and it plays an important role in the system's ability to provide accurate and relevant information to the user. ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) [2] [4] [5] [6] [8] [9] [10] ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of RAPTOR method](image2) ![Retrieval granularity of"}

The graph shows the performance of the collapsed tree and tree traversal methods across different context lengths, with the collapsed tree method consistently outperforming the tree traversal method. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy, with higher scores indicating better performance. The context length refers to the number of tokens used in the retrieval process, with longer context lengths allowing for more information to be considered. The graph indicates that the collapsed tree method is more effective at retrieving relevant information, even as the context length increases. This is likely due to the method's ability to consider all nodes in the tree simultaneously, rather than layer-by-layer as in the tree traversal method.

This is evident from the diagram in image1, where the sentence-level BiLSTM is shown as a foundational step in the model's architecture, feeding into the span enumeration and iterative inference processes for relations and coreference. The token representations are obtained by stacking the forward and backward LSTM hidden states, as described in [6]. This step is fundamental for the model to effectively identify and classify entities, relations, and coreferences in a multi-task setup, as outlined in [1].

This encoding is a crucial step in the dialogue system as it transforms the natural language input from the user into a format that can be processed by subsequent components of the system, such as the dialogue state tracker and the policy network. The encoder uses a bidirectional LSTM to capture the context from both directions of the user's input, enhancing the system's ability to understand and respond appropriately to the user's requests. This is evident from the system architecture diagram in image1, where the user utterance is first processed by the Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder before being passed on to the dialogue state tracker and other components.

This stage concludes only when satisfactory in-context examples are identified. Once the instruction-response pairs are obtained, the pipeline expands them into Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja), Spanish (es), German (de), French (fr), Korean (ko), and Arabic (ar). For further details, please refer to Appendix C, and task-specific prompts can be found in Appendix D. ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to prompt ChatGPT.](image5) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ![The first step of cold start is to use system messages and visual annotations to"}

This is shown in the table in image3, where the DS-DST column for the hotel-type slot has a value of 86.36%. This indicates that DS-DST correctly predicted the hotel-type slot 86.36% of the time. This is a significant improvement over DS-Span, which had an accuracy of 667/1395 for the hotel-type slot. The improvement is likely due to the fact that DS-DST uses a dual strategy for DST, which allows it to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots. This is in contrast to DS-Span, which only uses span extraction and may not be able to handle slots with different expressions. The DS-Picklist method also performed well for the hotel-type slot, with an accuracy of 85.91%. However, DS-DST still outperformed DS-Picklist for this slot. Overall, the results suggest that DS-DST is a more effective method for DST, particularly for slots with different expressions. ![The DS-DST model has a higher accuracy for the hotel-type slot than DS-Span and DS-Picklist](image3) ![The DS-DST model uses a dual strategy for DST, which allows it to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots](image1) ![The DS-Span model only uses span extraction and may not be able to handle slots with different expressions](image1) ![The DS-Picklist method also performed well for the hotel-type slot, with an accuracy of 85.91%](image3) ![The DS-DST model outperformed DS-Picklist for the hotel-type slot](image3) ![The results suggest that DS-DST is a more effective method for DST, particularly for slots with different expressions](image3) ![The DS-DST model has a higher accuracy for the hotel-type slot than DS-Span and DS-Picklist](image3) ![The DS-DST model uses a dual strategy for DST, which allows it to handle both categorical and non-categorical slots](image1) ![The DS-Span model only uses span extraction and may not be able to handle slots with different expressions](image1) ![The DS-Picklist method also performed well for the hotel-type slot, with an accuracy of 85.91%](image3) ![The DS-DST model outperformed"}

The training set specifically has 600 documents. \n\n![Training set contains 600 documents](image1) \n\n[1] We provide examples in Table 5 to highlight qualitative differences between KGLM, trained on 600 documents, and the recent state-of-the-art language model, GPT-2, trained on the WebText corpus with over 8 million documents (Radford et al., 2019). For examples that both models get factually correct or incorrect, the generated tokens by KGLM are often much more specific, as opposed to selection of more popular/generic tokens (GPT-2 often predicts “New York” as the birthplace, even for popular entities). KGLM, in particular, gets factual statements correct when the head or tail entities are rare, while GPT-2 can only complete facts for more-popular entities while using more-generic tokens (such as “January” instead of $20$). \n\n[2] Modeling human language requires the ability to not only generate fluent text but also encode factual knowledge. However, traditional language models are only capable of remembering facts seen at training time, and often have difficulty recalling them. To address this, we introduce the knowledge graph language model (KGLM), a neural language model with mechanisms for selecting and copying facts from a knowledge graph that are relevant to the context. These mechanisms enable the model to render information it has never seen before, as well as generate out-of-vocabulary tokens. We also introduce the Linked WikiText-2 dataset, a corpus of annotated text aligned to the Wikidata knowledge graph whose contents (roughly) match the popular WikiText-2 benchmark (Merity et al., 2017). In experiments, we demonstrate that the KGLM achieves significantly better performance than a strong baseline language model. We additionally compare different language models’ ability to complete sentences requiring factual knowledge, and show that the KGLM outperforms even very large language models in generating facts. \n\n[3] Even with these omissions and mistakes, it is clear that the annotations are rich and detailed, with a high coverage, and thus should prove beneficial for training knowledge graph language models. \n\n[4] For these reasons we introduce the Linked WikiText-2"}

However, this recipe was not enough to stabilize Chameleon-34B, which required an additional re-ordering of the norms. Specifically, we use the strategy of normalization proposed in Liu et al. (2021), within the transformer block. The benefit of the Swin transformer normalization strategy is that it bounds the norm growth of the feed forward block, which can become additionally problematic given the multiplicative nature of the SwiGLU activation function. If h represents the hidden vector at time-step t after self-attention is applied to input x,\n- [3] We found that the standard LLaMa architecture showed complex divergences due to slow norm growth in the mid-to-late stages of training. We narrowed down the cause of the divergence to the softmax operation being problematic when training with multiple modalities of significantly varying entropy due to the translation invariant property of softmax (i.e., softmax(z)=softmax(z+c)). Because we share all weights of the model across modalities, each modality will try to “compete” with the other by increasing its norms slightly; while not problematic at the beginning of training, it manifests in divergences once we get outside the effective representation range of bf16 (In Figure 6b, we show that ablations without image generation did not diverge). In a unimodal setting, this problem has also been named the logit drift problem (Wortsman et al., 2023). In Figure 5a, we plot the norms of the output of the last transformer layer as training progresses and we find that although training divergences can manifest after as much as even 20–30% of training progress, monitoring uncontrolled growth of output norms is strongly correlated with predicting future loss divergence.\n- [6] There was no difference in perplexity when training a model from scratch with and without the normalization re-ordering until the divergence of the LLaMa-2 parameterization. Additionally, we found that this type of normalization did not work well in combination with dropout and therefore, we train Chameleon-34B without dropout (Figure 6c).

Amazon-AWS has a distribution of 17% renewable energy, 24% gas, 30% coal, and 26% nuclear. Microsoft, on the other hand, has 32% renewable energy, 23% gas, 31% coal, and 10% nuclear. \n\nFrom this, we can see that Microsoft has a higher percentage of renewable energy (32%) compared to Amazon-AWS (17%). This suggests that Microsoft is using more sustainable energy sources, which could potentially lead to lower CO2 emissions. Conversely, Amazon-AWS has a higher percentage of coal usage (30%) compared to Microsoft (31%), which is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions.\n\nThe implications of these differences in energy consumption distributions are significant. Renewable energy sources generally produce less CO2 compared to fossil fuels like coal. Therefore, Microsoft's higher use of renewable energy could result in lower CO2 emissions compared to Amazon-AWS. This is important for companies aiming to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, Microsoft's energy consumption distribution shows a higher reliance on renewable energy and a lower reliance on coal compared to Amazon-AWS. This could lead to lower CO2 emissions for Microsoft, highlighting the importance of sustainable energy practices in reducing environmental impact. \n\n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![CO2 emissions from different activities](image2) \n![Estimated cost of training models](image3) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4) \n![Energy consumption distribution of Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image4)"}

This indicates that lexical matching with a single support document is not enough to build a strong predictive model for both datasets [1]. The two neural models, BiDAF and FastQA, are able to largely retain or even improve their strong performance when answers are masked. However, their performance drops under masking for MED HOP, while for the open-domain setting of WIKI HOP, a reduction of the answer vocabulary to 100 random single-token mask expressions clearly helps the model in selecting a candidate span [4]. The best model reaches 54.5% on an annotated test set, compared to human performance at 85.0%, indicating ample room for improvement [5]. The Document-cue baseline can predict more than a third of the samples correctly for both datasets, even after sub-sampling frequent document-answer pairs for WIKI HOP [6]. The models improve greatly in the gold chain setup, with up to 81.2%/85.7% on WIKI HOP in the masked setting for BiDAF. This demonstrates that RC models are capable of identifying the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned, which is particularly evident for MED HOP, where documents tend to discuss only single drug candidates [7]. The usage of bidirectional LSTMs and attention over the full sequence theoretically gives BiDAF and FastQA the capacity to integrate information from different locations in the (super-)document. In addition, BiDAF employs iterative conditioning across multiple layers, potentially making it even better suited to integrate information found across the sequence [9]. To investigate if the neural RC models can draw upon information requiring multi-step inference, an experiment was designed where all documents that do not contain candidate mentions, including the first documents traversed, were discarded. The results show that performance drops across the board for BiDAF, demonstrating that it is able to leverage cross-document information. FastQA shows a slight increase for WIKI HOP and a decrease on MED HOP, indicating that it has problems integrating cross-document information [10].\n\n![BiDAF and FastQA models' performance on WIKI HOP and MED HOP datasets](image1)\n![BiDAF and FastQA models' performance on WIKI HOP and MED HOP datasets](image2)\n![Document-cue, Majority"}

This is supported by the image showing the number of positive, negative, and neutral examples in each dataset. D3 and D4 have a much smaller number of neutral examples, which makes the prediction of neutral instances very difficult for all previous methods. This is further supported by the text, which states that the lack of training examples makes the prediction of neutral instances very difficult for all previous methods. The combination of PRET and MULT overall yields better results, especially on D3 and D4 where the labels are extremely unbalanced. This is because knowledge from document-level examples with balanced labels compensates for this disadvantage. Therefore, the distribution of neutral examples is a critical factor in the performance of aspect-level sentiment classification models.

These steps are crucial for enhancing the model's ability to focus on the relevant objects within an image, thereby improving the accuracy of object detection and recognition.\n\n1. **Cropping**: The image is cropped based on proposal bounding box coordinates. This step is essential because object detection datasets often contain multiple objects of varying sizes. By cropping the image regions, the model can concentrate on the specific areas of interest, which are more likely to contain the objects to be detected. This is particularly important in scenarios where some objects dominate a large portion of the image, while others occupy minimal space. Cropping ensures that the model's attention is directed towards the objects of interest, rather than being distracted by irrelevant parts of the image.\n\n2. **Blurring**: After cropping, the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest are blurred. This technique is designed to direct the model's focus towards the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks. Blurring the non-target areas helps to reduce the noise and distractions in the image, allowing the model to better understand and recognize the objects within the cropped regions.\n\nBy integrating these pre-processing steps, the zero-shot recognition system can more effectively handle the challenges posed by object detection datasets, where objects are smaller and their positions more varied compared to image classification tasks. The combination of cropping and blurring ensures that the model's attention is directed towards the relevant objects, leading to improved performance in object detection and recognition tasks.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing step contributes to the zero-shot recognition system by enhancing the model's ability to focus on the relevant objects within an image, thereby improving the accuracy of object detection and recognition. This is achieved through the use of cropping and blurring techniques, which help to direct the model's attention towards the objects of interest and reduce distractions in the image. The provided diagram illustrates these steps in the context of the zero-shot recognition system, highlighting their importance in achieving high performance in object detection tasks. ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection Datasets](image2) ![Pre-processing for Detection D"}

The critical point is where the generator has become robust enough to challenge the discriminator effectively, leading to a significant decrease in the discriminator's performance. This is a key aspect of the adversarial training process described in the text, where the generator's ability to produce true positive samples improves over time, eventually collapsing the discriminator's classification ability. The critical point marks the transition where the generator's performance surpasses the discriminator's, indicating the generator's success in identifying true positive samples from the noisy dataset. This is further supported by the text's explanation that the generator's performance steadily increases, reflecting the robustness of the DSGAN adversarial learning strategy. The decline in accuracy at this critical point is a direct result of the generator's improved ability to generate true positive samples, which challenges the discriminator's ability to correctly classify the samples. This is a crucial milestone in the adversarial training process, as it signifies the point at which the generator has learned to effectively identify true positive samples, leading to a significant improvement in the overall performance of the relation extraction system.

Therefore, when most of the slot values can be found directly in the dialog context, these slots can be treated as either non-categorical slots or categorical slots.\n- [4] Examples Table 6 shows three examples of dialogue turns in the validation set.

In terms of text evaluation, GPT-4 also scores higher in coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance, suggesting that it produces more coherent and relevant text.\n\nUnder the specific setting, the performance gap between GPT-4 and ChatGPT narrows, but GPT-4 still maintains a lead in most metrics. GPT-4's alignment score improves to 92.0, while ChatGPT's score is 84.5. This suggests that GPT-4 is better at generating citations that are specific and relevant to the context.

This is similar to the approach used by Clark and Gardner (2018). The model uses the lowest y_empty score to determine the best paragraph, as shown in the figure. This process is part of the single-paragraph BERT model's evaluation, which is designed to handle questions that require multi-hop reasoning. The model's performance in the distractor setting is comparable to the state-of-the-art, indicating that it can effectively handle questions with distractor paragraphs. The model's ability to select the best answer from multiple paragraphs is a key feature that allows it to perform well in the HOTPOT QA dataset, which contains mostly compositional questions. The model's performance in the open-domain setting is also noteworthy, as it achieves a high F1 score despite the challenges posed by the large number of distractor paragraphs. Overall, the model's ability to select the best answer from multiple paragraphs is a critical component of its success in handling complex questions. ![The model scores each paragraph independently and selects the answer from the paragraph with the best score.](image2) ![The model uses the lowest y_empty score to determine the best paragraph.](image5) ![The model's performance in the distractor setting is comparable to the state-of-the-art.](image3) ![The model's performance in the open-domain setting is also noteworthy.](image3) ![The model's ability to select the best answer from multiple paragraphs is a key feature that allows it to perform well in the HOTPOT QA dataset.](image4) ![The model's ability to select the best answer from multiple paragraphs is a critical component of its success in handling complex questions.](image4) ![The model's performance in the distractor setting is comparable to the state-of-the-art.](image3) ![The model's performance in the open-domain setting is also noteworthy.](image3) ![The model's ability to select the best answer from multiple paragraphs is a key feature that allows it to perform well in the HOTPOT QA dataset.](image4) ![The model's ability to select the best answer from multiple paragraphs is a critical component of its success in handling complex questions.](image4) ![The model's performance in the distractor setting is comparable to the state-of-the-art.](image3) ![The model's performance in the open-domain setting is also noteworthy.]("}

This requires the establishment of appropriate technology transfer agreements. NMRC's technology transfer collaborations leverage research capabilities found in the public and private sectors to stretch research dollars and accomplish the mission of supporting the health and readiness of the military's men and women in uniform. The NMRC enterprise excels at technology transfer, which is a key part of what the Presidential Memorandum was all about. The Presidential Memorandum - Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses was released toward the end of last year. This memorandum's objectives directed Federal agencies to establish goals and measure performance, streamline administrative processes, and facilitate local and regional partnerships in order to accelerate technology transfer and support private sector commercialization.

This is a crucial step where chromosomes are positioned equidistant from the two poles of the cell, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each pair. This alignment is facilitated by the spindle fibers, which attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes.\n\n2. **Spindle Fiber Attachment**: The spindle fibers, which are part of the mitotic spindle, attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. The kinetochores are protein structures located at the centromere of each chromosome. The attachment of spindle fibers to the kinetochores is essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes during anaphase.\n\n3. **Chromosome Condensation**: Chromosomes are highly condensed during metaphase I, making them visible under a microscope. This condensation is necessary for the accurate alignment and separation of chromosomes.\n\n4. **Crossing Over**: Although crossing over occurs during prophase I, its effects are visible during metaphase I. The exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes during crossing over results in genetic recombination, which increases genetic diversity.\n\n5. **Tetrad Formation**: The tetrad, a structure formed by the pairing of homologous chromosomes, is visible during metaphase I. Each tetrad consists of four chromatids, two from each homologous chromosome.\n\n6. **Centromere Positioning**: The centromeres of the chromosomes are positioned at the metaphase plate, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each pair.\n\n7. **Nuclear Envelope Breakdown**: The nuclear envelope breaks down during prophase I, but its remnants may still be visible during metaphase I. This breakdown allows the spindle fibers to access the chromosomes and facilitates their alignment at the metaphase plate.\n\n8. **Spindle Fiber Dynamics**: The spindle fibers are dynamic structures that continuously polymerize and depolymerize, allowing them to move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate and hold them in place.\n\n9. **Chromosome Movement**: The chromosomes move towards the metaphase plate under the influence of the spindle fibers. This movement is facilitated by the motor proteins that are part of the spindle fibers.\n\n10. **Chromosome Segregation**: The chromosomes are segregated into two daughter cells during anaphase I, which follows metaphase I.

This means that while the nuclear envelope is reforming and the chromosomes are decondensing during telophase, the cell is also preparing to divide its cytoplasm. \n\nIn [2], it is described that the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cells. This process is visually represented in `![Cell membrane growing inward to divide the cell](image1)`. The image shows the cell membrane beginning to pinch inward, which is a crucial step in cytokinesis.\n\nFurthermore, [5] explains that the mitotic phase includes both mitosis (division of the nucleus) and cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm). This is depicted in `![Cell undergoing cytokinesis](image2)`, where the cell is visibly splitting into two daughter cells.\n\nAdditionally, [6] states that chromosomes duplicate during the S phase and appear as sister chromatids joined at the centromere. This is relevant to the telophase stage, where the sister chromatids have separated and are moving to opposite poles of the cell.\n\nLastly, [8] describes the interphase stages, including the G1, S, and G2 phases, which precede the mitotic phase. This information provides context for the events leading up to telophase and cytokinesis.\n\nIn summary, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear envelope reforms, chromosomes decondense, the cell membrane grows inward, and the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two daughter cells. This process is essential for cell division and is visually represented in the provided images. \n\n`![Cell membrane growing inward to divide the cell](image1)` and `![Cell undergoing cytokinesis](image2)` illustrate the physical changes occurring during these stages. \n\nIn conclusion, the cellular structures undergo significant changes during telophase and cytokinesis, including the reformation of the nuclear envelope, decondensation of chromosomes, and division of the cytoplasm, ultimately resulting in two daughter cells."}

In 2005, the top security concerns in healthcare included internal breaches of security, inadequate business continuity/disaster recovery, limits of existing technology, HIPAA compliance, and connecting IT at hospitals and remote facilities. By 2006, these concerns remained largely the same, with internal breaches of security still being the most significant issue, followed by inadequate business continuity/disaster recovery and limits of existing technology. The implementation of security tools has also seen notable changes. In 2005, firewalls were the most commonly used security tool, followed by user access controls, audit logs, multi-level passcodes, off-site storage, electronic signature, data encryption, and disaster recovery. By 2006, the use of firewalls had increased significantly, with 98% of organizations using them, followed by user access controls, audit logs, multi-level passcodes, off-site storage, electronic signature, data encryption, and disaster recovery. Looking ahead to the next two years, the trend is expected to continue with an increase in the use of firewalls, user access controls, audit logs, multi-level passcodes, off-site storage, electronic signature, data encryption, and disaster recovery. This indicates a growing awareness and concern for security in the healthcare industry, as well as a proactive approach to implementing security measures to protect patient data and ensure compliance with regulations such as HIPAA. The future trends in security tools suggest that organizations will continue to prioritize the protection of patient data and the implementation of robust security measures to prevent breaches and ensure the integrity of healthcare information systems. The adoption of new technology, such as electronic medical records and bar coded medication management, is also expected to increase, further emphasizing the importance of security in the healthcare industry. Overall, the changes in perceptions of security concerns and the implementation of security tools from 2005 to 2006, as well as the future trends in security tools, highlight the ongoing efforts of the healthcare industry to address security challenges and protect patient data. ![Top Security Concerns of 2005 and 2006](image4) ![Security Tools in 2005 and 2006](image2) ![Future Trends in Security Tools](image2) ![Top Security Concerns of 2005 and 2006]("}

In a monohybrid cross, such as the one between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants, the F1 generation is heterozygous (Pp) and exhibits the dominant phenotype (purple flowers). When these F1 plants are crossed, the F2 generation shows a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers and a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio of PP, Pp, and pp. This is because each F1 plant produces gametes with equal probabilities of carrying either the dominant (P) or recessive (p) allele, leading to a variety of possible combinations in the F2 generation. The phenotypic ratio is a direct result of the genotypic ratio, with the dominant phenotype (purple flowers) being expressed in both homozygous dominant (PP) and heterozygous (Pp) individuals, while the recessive phenotype (white flowers) is only expressed in homozygous recessive (pp) individuals. This pattern of inheritance is consistent with Mendel's laws and provides a clear explanation for the observed ratios in the F2 generation. ![Shows the inheritance of a trait in a family through multiple generations](image1) ![Example of a mono hybrid cross Parental generation:purple flowers x white flowers F generation:all plants with purple flowers F 2 generation: of plants with purple flowers of plants with white flowers Mendel needed to explain Why one trait seemed to disappear in the  $\\mathsf{F_{1}}$  generation Why that trait reappeared in one quarter of the  $\\mathsf{F_{2}}$  offspring 2](image4) ![P generation (true-breeding parents) Purple flowers x White flowers All plants have purple flowers F1 generation Fertilization among F1 plants (F1 x F1) 1 F2 generation 3/4 of plants have purple flowers 1/4 of plants have white flowers](image5) ![Genotype: PP Homozygous for the dominant allele aa Homozygous for the recessive allele Bb Heterozygous](image3) ![P plants Gametes F1 plants (hybrids) Gametes F2 plants Phenotypic ratio 3 purple : 1 white Genotypic ratio 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1"}

It involves understanding the high-level requirements and the context in which the project will be delivered.\n- **Strategies**: This phase includes various strategies such as goals-driven requirements envisioning, detailed specification, and usage modeling. It also involves domain modeling, process modeling, and user interface modeling to get a comprehensive understanding of the project's requirements.\n- **Outcome**: The outcome of Needs Exploration is a clear and agreed-upon initial scope that sets the direction for the project.\n\n**Elicitation Methods**:\n- **Purpose**: Elicitation Methods are used throughout the project lifecycle to continuously gather and refine stakeholder requirements. These methods ensure that the project remains aligned with stakeholder needs as they evolve.\n- **Strategies**: Elicitation Methods include active stakeholder participation, indirect participation via proxies, and electronic means. Techniques like just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, and iteration demos are also used to elicit and validate requirements.\n- **Outcome**: The outcome of Elicitation Methods is a dynamic and responsive approach to requirements gathering, ensuring that the project adapts to changing stakeholder needs.\n\nIn summary, while Needs Exploration focuses on defining the initial scope and understanding high-level requirements, Elicitation Methods are about continuously gathering and refining requirements to ensure the project meets stakeholder needs throughout its lifecycle. Both strategies are essential for effective agile management and ensuring project success. \n\n![Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) framework](image2) ![Explore Initial Scope](image4) ![Address Changing Stakeholder Needs](image5) ![How Does Agile Analysis Work?](image3) ![Produce a Potentially Consumable Solution](image1) \n\n**Answer**: Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods are both critical in agile management, with Needs Exploration focusing on defining the initial scope and Elicitation Methods ensuring continuous alignment with stakeholder needs.

The image shows the word 'GESTALT' with various visual elements that illustrate these principles:\n\n- **Proximity**: The letters are grouped together closely, which makes them appear as a single unit. This is evident in the way the letters are arranged in a compact form, with no significant gaps between them.\n\n- **Continuity**: The design of the letters follows a continuous flow, guiding the viewer's eye from one letter to the next. This is seen in the smooth transitions between the letters, which create a sense of movement and connection.\n\n- **Closure**: The design includes incomplete shapes and patterns that the viewer's mind completes. For example, the letter 'A' in 'GESTALT' is not fully enclosed, but the viewer perceives it as a complete letter due to the closure principle.\n\n- **Similarity**: The letters share similar visual characteristics, such as color and style, which makes them appear as part of the same group. This is evident in the consistent use of black and white colors and the uniform font style.\n\n- **Unity**: The overall design of the word 'GESTALT' creates a sense of unity, where all the elements work together to form a cohesive whole. This is achieved through the careful arrangement of the letters and the use of visual elements that reinforce the Gestalt principles.\n\nIn conclusion, the design of the word 'GESTALT' effectively demonstrates the principles of Gestalt psychology by using proximity, continuity, closure, similarity, and unity to create a visually cohesive and meaningful representation of the concept. ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image1) ![The word 'GESTALT' is designed to demonstrate Gestalt principles](image"}

This shift could be related to the trends in banana exports during the same period, as shown in the image of the 3D bar chart. The chart indicates a fluctuating pattern in banana exports from various countries, with some countries experiencing an increase and others a decrease. This could suggest that changes in economic activities, such as banana exports, might influence how people allocate their time during weekends. For instance, increased economic activity could lead to more time spent on work-related activities and less time with family and friends. However, without specific data on the correlation between banana exports and weekend activities, this remains a speculative connection. The image of the 3D bar chart provides a visual representation of the changes in banana exports, which could be a factor in understanding the broader economic context that might influence weekend activities. The image of the pie charts clearly shows the changes in weekend activities over time, with a significant decrease in time spent with family and friends.

This is evident from the diagram in image5, which shows a neural network with 8 distinct layers, each connected by lines representing the flow of information. The layers are arranged in a hierarchical manner, with the input layer at the bottom and the output layer at the top. The diagram also shows the connections between the layers, indicating the flow of information from the input layer to the output layer. The number of layers in a neural network is an important factor in its ability to learn and generalize from data. In this case, the 8-layer neural network is likely designed to learn complex features and patterns in the input data, such as faces, in order to accurately distinguish between different individuals. The use of multiple layers allows the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input data, with each layer building on the representations learned by the previous layer. This hierarchical learning process is a key feature of deep neural networks, which have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. In summary, the 8-layer neural network mentioned in the PPT is a deep neural network designed to learn complex features and patterns in the input data, such as faces, in order to accurately distinguish between different individuals.

This module focuses on creating simple maps that can display data points and layers, allowing users to toggle different groups of items on and off in the map. The maps created in this module are primarily for use within the Wikidata query interface.\n\n- **Module 2**: The objective is to understand the steps to embed Wikidata-driven maps in other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia and Commons. This module builds on the skills learned in Module 1 and introduces the use of OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the MediaWiki Kartographer extension. The maps created in this module are designed to be embedded within Wikimedia projects, providing a more integrated and interactive experience for users.\n\n- **Module 3**: The objective is to understand the steps to create interactive, layered Wikidata-driven maps that can be used off-Wiki, i.e., in regular HTML pages. This module combines the skills learned in Modules 1 and 2 and introduces the use of basic Python and Jupyter notebooks. The maps created in this module are designed to be used outside of Wikimedia projects, providing a more flexible and customizable experience for users.\n\nThe key difference between the modules is the level of complexity and the intended use of the maps.

This implies that the more hot dogs consumed, the less satisfaction or utility is derived from each additional hot dog. This is a classic example of diminishing marginal utility, where the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good decreases as more units are consumed. This behavior suggests that consumers will eventually reach a point where the utility gained from consuming an additional hot dog is zero or negative, leading them to stop consuming. This is consistent with the concept of rational behavior in economics, where consumers aim to maximize their utility given their budget constraints. The table also shows that the utility from consuming hot dogs can become negative, indicating that consuming too many hot dogs can lead to negative consequences, such as discomfort or illness.

Ensure that serving dishes and lids are positioned on the side of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm. The maximum diameter for plates in front of the detergent dispenser should not exceed 19 cm to prevent hindering the opening of the dispenser.\n\n2. **Load the Upper Basket**: The upper basket is designed for more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee, and tea cups. Long-bladed knives should be stored in an upright position, but be cautious as they can be a potential hazard. Long and/or sharp items of cutlery, such as carving knives, must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket.\n\n3. **Arrange Cutlery**: Knives and other utensils with sharp points must be loaded in the basket with their points facing down or placed in a horizontal position to avoid damage to the door seal. Curved items or those with recesses should be loaded at an angle so that water can run off easily.\n\n4. **Avoid Overloading**: Do not overload the dishwasher. This is important for good results and reasonable consumption of energy.\n\n5. **Check for Leveling**: Ensure the dishwasher is level for proper dish rack operation and wash performance. Use a spirit level on the door and rack track inside the tub to check and adjust the leveling legs individually.\n\n6. **Safety Precautions**: Do not modify the plug provided with the appliance. If it does not fit the outlet, have a proper outlet installed by a qualified electrician. Do not abuse, sit on, or stand on the door or dish rack of the dishwasher. Do not operate the dishwasher unless all enclosure panels are properly in place. Open the door carefully if the dishwasher is operating to avoid water squirting out. Do not place any heavy objects on or stand on the door when it is open to prevent the appliance from tipping forward.\n\n**Potential Consequences of Improper Loading**:\n\n- **Inefficient Cleaning**: Improper loading can lead to inefficient cleaning, as items may not be properly exposed to the water spray and detergent.\n- **Damage to Dishwasher**: Overloading or improper placement of items can cause damage to the dishwasher, such as blocking the spray arms or causing the racks to become misaligned.\n- **Safety"}

As we move up the value chain, analysis becomes more sophisticated, involving query drilldowns, alerts, and statistical analysis to understand why things happened and what actions are needed.\n\nBusiness analytics, as depicted in image3, builds on this foundation by incorporating predictive modeling, forecasting, and optimization to anticipate future trends and outcomes. This advanced stage of analytics enables organizations to make informed decisions and drive strategic objectives.\n\nIn summary, reporting and analysis are critical components of the analytics value chain, with reporting providing a backward-looking view and analysis offering forward-looking insights. Together, they support the transition from business intelligence to business analytics, enabling organizations to leverage data for strategic advantage. ![Reporting and analysis are foundational steps in the analytics value chain](image1) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business intelligence and business analytics are stages in the analytics value chain](image3) ![Business"}

It receives input from multiple sensors, including the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor. These sensors provide the ECU with real-time data about the engine's condition and performance. Based on this information, the ECU adjusts the fuel injection timing and amount, ignition timing, and other parameters to optimize engine performance, efficiency, and emissions. The ECU also manages the idle speed by controlling the throttle stop or idle air bypass control step per motor. Additionally, it regulates the opening and closing of the injector valves to ensure proper fuel delivery to the engine. The ECU's control over these components is essential for maintaining the engine's optimal operation and ensuring that it runs smoothly and efficiently.

In contrast, off-campus supermarkets like Lotus Supermarket and BHG Supermarket have longer hours, typically from 9:00am to 9:00pm or 8:30am to 10:00pm. This difference in hours may affect students' shopping schedules by limiting their ability to shop on campus during late evenings or early mornings, potentially leading them to rely more on off-campus options for convenience. Additionally, the extended hours of off-campus supermarkets might attract students who prefer to shop later in the day or need to purchase items not available on campus. The availability of off-campus supermarkets could also impact the frequency of students' visits to on-campus stores, as they might choose to make fewer, larger purchases at off-campus locations to save time.

The mitotic phase includes mitosis (division of the nucleus) and cytokinesis (division of cytoplasm) [10]. \n\n![The cell cycle diagram shows interphase and mitotic phase](image1)\n\nDuring interphase, the cell grows and duplicates its chromosomes. The S phase is crucial for DNA synthesis, as chromosomes duplicate [2, 3, 6]. \n\n![Chromosomes duplicating during the S phase](image4)\n\nThe mitotic phase involves the separation of chromosomes and the division of the cell into two daughter cells. This is visually represented in the images provided, where the chromosomes are seen separating and moving towards opposite poles of the cell [2, 4].\n\n![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2)\n\nIn summary, the cell cycle consists of interphase (G1, S, G2) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), with each stage playing a critical role in cell division and growth. ![The cell cycle diagram shows interphase and mitotic phase](image1) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2) ![Chromosomes duplicating during the S phase](image4) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image5) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image3) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image5) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image3) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image5) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image3) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image5) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image3) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image5) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image3) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image5) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image3) ![Chromosomes separating during mitosis](image2"}

This significant difference in conversion rates could be attributed to various factors such as the quality of leads, the effectiveness of the sales team, and the alignment between marketing and sales strategies.\n\nA higher conversion rate, as seen in image5, suggests that the marketing efforts are generating leads that are more likely to be accepted by the sales team, indicating a better alignment between marketing and sales. This could lead to more efficient use of resources and potentially higher sales performance. On the other hand, a lower conversion rate, as seen in image4, may indicate that the leads generated by marketing are not meeting the sales team's criteria, which could result in wasted resources and missed sales opportunities.\n\nTo improve the conversion rate, it is essential to ensure that the marketing and sales teams are aligned and that the leads generated by marketing are of high quality and meet the sales team's criteria. This can be achieved through regular communication and collaboration between the two teams, as well as by implementing lead scoring and qualification processes to ensure that only the most promising leads are passed on to the sales team.
