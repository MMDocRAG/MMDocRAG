According to the text quotes, there is a significant difference in opinion based on political affiliation and education level. Specifically, [1] states that more than half of Democrats believe the U.S. should help other countries, with a notable difference between liberal Democrats (64%) and conservative/moderate Democrats (44%). Furthermore, [9] indicates that higher education levels correlate with a greater likelihood of supporting assistance to other countries, with 60% of postgraduates in favor.\n\nThe image `![The image shows percentages of various demographics' views on whether the U.S. should deal with its own problems or help other countries.](image2)` also highlights this trend.

[2] reports that by a slim margin, more Americans believe the U.S. has done a poor job (52%) than an excellent or good job (47%). Additionally, [10] notes that around three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical of the U.S.'s response (73%), while a similar share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise the country’s handling of the outbreak (71%).\n\nThe image `![This image shows survey results regarding people's evaluation as \"Only fair/poor\" or \"Good/excellent\" across various demographic groups.](image5)` provides a detailed breakdown, showing that overall, 64% evaluate the U.S.'s handling of the outbreak as \"only fair/poor.\"\n\nCombining these insights, we can see that while 60% of people believe the U.S. should help other countries, 64% believe the U.S. has done a poor job in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

Fully 85% have heard or read about this concept, with 24% indicating they have heard or read “a lot” about it [2]. Among those who have heard a lot about the concept, nearly half (48%) find it extremely realistic that machines might one day do many of the jobs currently done by humans [12].\n\nWhen it comes to specific impacts, Americans anticipate significant changes to the nature of jobs and work due to automation. Roughly three-quarters (77%) think it’s realistic that robots and computers might one day be able to do many of the jobs currently done by humans, with 20% describing this prospect as extremely realistic [8].\n\nHowever, the perception of the outcomes of this automation is mixed. According to the survey results depicted in the bar graph, people are more likely to foresee negative outcomes than positive ones. For example, 76% of respondents believe that inequality between the rich and poor will worsen, and 64% think people will struggle to find meaningful activities outside of work [image1].

In May 2018, among Republicans, the distribution is 19% and 80%, suggesting strong support, whereas among Democrats, it's 88% and 12%, indicating overwhelming disapproval. Similarly, in August 2017, among Republicans, the distribution is 30% and 69%, still showing majority support, while among Democrats, it's 93% and 6%, again reflecting overwhelming disapproval.\n\nAdditionally, the text indicates that conservative Republicans are significantly more likely than their moderate or liberal counterparts to say they like Trump’s conduct (44% to 25%, respectively) [6].

For instance, younger adults and those with higher levels of education tend to disapprove of Trump’s job performance more than their counterparts with lower education levels [2]. This trend is further supported by the bar graph in the image, which visually represents the disapproval and approval ratings among different demographic groups, including education levels [image1].\n\nMoreover, critiques about ethical standards extend to both political parties. Just 41% of Americans say the GOP has high ethical standards, while a nearly identical share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party [3]. When combining views of both political parties on ethics, a quarter of the public says “high ethical standards” describes neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party [5]. This is illustrated in the bar chart where the data is broken down by education levels, showing that among those with at least a college degree, 31% say “high ethical standards” does not describe either party [image6].\n\nPolitical affiliations also significantly influence these perceptions. Conservative Republicans express largely positive views of the ethical standards of Trump administration officials, whereas moderate and liberal Republicans are more critical [6].

In the U.S., a majority of Americans, particularly those on the right, believe that military force is sometimes necessary to maintain order in the world. For instance, nine-in-ten American conservatives see military force as necessary, while only 65% of liberals agree [1]. In contrast, only about half of Germans agree that military force is sometimes necessary [9].\n\nThese differences are further reflected in attitudes towards defense spending. In the U.S., there has been a notable shift in views regarding European allies' defense spending. Half of Americans now say that spending levels should remain the same, marking a change from 2017, when 45% felt that more resources should be dedicated to national defense [3]. On the other hand, Germans are more divided on the issue of increasing or maintaining their own defense budgets, with about four-in-ten taking each view [7]. \n\nThe differences in opinion on defense spending are illustrated in the comparative bar chart, where the data shows that in 2019, 50% of Americans favored keeping defense spending the same, whereas 41% of Germans were in favor of maintaining their defense budgets [image6].\n\nAge demographics also play a significant role in shaping views on U.S.-Germany relations. Both in the U.S. and Germany, younger individuals have more positive views of the relationship. For example, in the U.S., 82% of people aged 18 to 29 say the relationship is good, compared to 73% of those aged 65 and older [11]. Similarly, in Germany, 40% of young people view the relationship positively, compared to only 28% of those aged 65 and older [11].

In both the U.S. and Germany, individuals on the ideological right are more likely to justify the use of military force compared to those on the left [1].\n\nWhen it comes to defense spending, fewer Americans see a need for European allies to increase their defense budgets, with a majority preferring to maintain current levels of spending [2][12]. Germans, however, are divided on the issue of increasing national defense spending, with about four-in-ten supporting each view [9].

College graduates are more likely to own both cell phones and smartphones, with 87% owning a cell phone and 35% owning a smartphone, while those with less education have lower rates, with 70% owning a cell phone and only 10% owning a smartphone [5][11][1][image5]. Additionally, higher-income seniors are more likely to own smartphones; for instance, 42% of seniors earning $75,000 or more annually own a smartphone, compared to only 8% of those earning less than $30,000 [9][image5].\n\nThese patterns indicate that both internet and broadband adoption, as well as cell phone and smartphone ownership, are influenced by educational attainment and income levels among seniors. However, smartphone adoption remains relatively low overall, with only 18% of seniors owning a smartphone, which is significantly lower than the national average [7][image5].\n\nTo summarize, seniors with higher education and income levels exhibit higher rates of internet, broadband, cell phone, and smartphone adoption, but smartphone adoption is notably lower across the board.\n\n![The chart shows the percentage of seniors owning cell phones and smartphones, with higher rates observed among those with higher education and income levels.](image5)"}

Younger users, in particular, are more likely to experience a range of emotions such as amusement, loneliness, and depression when using social media [4].\n\nIn terms of the types of posts they encounter, a significant number of users frequently come across overly dramatic or exaggerated content (58%) and posts where people start arguments without waiting for all the facts (59%) [8]. This aligns with the data in the bar chart, which shows that these types of posts are seen frequently by a large percentage of users, with net percentages of 88% and 87%, respectively [image3].\n\nWhen it comes to gender differences, men are slightly more likely than women to encounter mean or bullying behavior, while women are more likely to see supportive behavior [9]. This is reflected in the bar graph showing that 29% of men more often see mean or bullying behavior compared to 19% of women, and 24% of women more often see kind behavior compared to 17% of men [image7].\n\nAge groups also vary in their emotional responses to social media. Younger users (ages 18-29) tend to report stronger emotions like amusement, anger, and even loneliness compared to older age groups [image8]. For example, 54% of the youngest users report feeling amused, while only 30% of users aged 65+ feel the same way.\n\nMoreover, there are differences in the acceptability of data usage by social media sites among different age groups.

Furthermore, there's a significant disparity between younger and older users when it comes to using data for recommending connections, with younger users more accepting of this practice compared to older users [4].\n\nMoreover, users across different age groups generally express discomfort with their data being used for political messaging. For instance, a substantial majority of users think it is not acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to deliver messages from political campaigns [2], and this trend holds true across age groups [8]. \n\nAdditionally, users are less comfortable with their data being used to show them ads for products or services, with around half thinking this behavior is acceptable, while a similar share finds it not acceptable [2]. However, younger users are slightly more accepting of this practice compared to older users [4].\n\nInterestingly, users’ comfort levels with data usage are heavily context-dependent. For example, a majority of social media users are comfortable sharing their data with these sites if it were used to recommend events they might like to attend, but this share drops significantly if their data are being used to deliver messages from political campaigns [6]. This indicates that the context in which data is used greatly influences users' comfort levels.\n\nThe image also illustrates these trends. The chart shows that older users (ages 65+) are less likely to find it acceptable for social media platforms to recommend events in their area, recommend people they might know, or show them ads for products and services, compared to younger users [image3]. Specifically, only 67% of users aged 65+ find it acceptable for social media platforms to recommend events in their area, whereas 80% of users aged 30-49 do [image3]. \n\nIn conclusion, different age groups perceive the acceptability of social media platforms using their data for various purposes differently, with younger users generally being more accepting than older users, except when it comes to political messaging, which is largely considered unacceptable across all age groups."}

For instance, voters who have recent experience with early or absentee voting are more likely to favor no-excuse absentee voting policies. This trend is particularly significant among Republicans, where those who voted early or absentee in 2020 are more supportive of no-excuse absentee voting compared to those who voted in person on Election Day. Specifically, just 22% of Republicans who voted in person on Election Day favor this policy, whereas 52% of Republicans who voted early or absentee in the 2020 presidential election support it [1].\n\nThe image provides further detail on these opinions. The bar chart in the image shows that 62% of Republicans or Republican-leaning voters believe a voter should only be allowed to vote early or absentee if they have a documented reason for not voting in person on Election Day, while 38% support open early or absentee voting. In contrast, among Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters, only 16% require documented reasons, with 84% supporting open voting [image1].\n\nMoreover, when it comes to redistricting proposals, more adults approve (49%) than disapprove (13%) of a Democratic proposal to require that commissions with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans draw congressional district maps, rather than state legislatures. However, a significant portion of adults (38%) are unsure about this proposal. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to favor replacing state legislatures with independent commissions for drawing congressional maps [8]. The image also supports this conclusion, showing that among total respondents, 49% approve, 13% disapprove, and 38% are not sure about the proposal. Among Republicans, 38% approve, 19% disapprove, and 42% are unsure, whereas among Democrats, 59% approve, 8% disapprove, and 32% are unsure [image3].\n\nIn summary, Republicans and Democrats exhibit distinct views on voting methods and redistricting proposals, with Democrats generally more supportive of open early or absentee voting and independent redistricting commissions, while Republicans tend to favor stricter requirements and traditional legislative control over redistricting."}

This perception is consistent across the general public and is reflected in the belief that STEM jobs offer better compensation and attract more of the brightest, most qualified young people [1][2].\n\nHowever, when it comes to specific job characteristics, men and women in STEM jobs tend to have differing priorities. Men in STEM jobs are more likely to value having higher pay and opportunities for promotion, while women are more inclined to prioritize job characteristics that focus on helping others and making a meaningful contribution to society [8][11]. \n\nFor instance, about 59% of men in STEM jobs value having a high-paying job, compared to 48% of women. Similarly, 57% of men value opportunities for promotion, whereas 46% of women do [11]. On the other hand, 60% of women in STEM jobs find it important to have a job that focuses on helping others, which is significantly higher than the 31% of men who feel the same way [11].\n\nFurthermore, the image provides a visual representation of these differences. It shows that men and women in STEM jobs value the flexibility to balance work and family obligations equally, with 71% of men and 76% of women valuing this characteristic. However, there is a notable difference in other aspects, such as the importance of having a high-paying job (+9 percentage points) and opportunities for promotion (+11 percentage points) favoring men, while women place more emphasis on making a meaningful contribution to society (-9 percentage points) and having a job focused on helping others (-28 percentage points) [11].\n\nTo summarize, men and women in STEM jobs value higher pay and job opportunities for promotion more highly, but women place a greater emphasis on job characteristics that focus on helping others and making a meaningful societal contribution. \n\n![Men and women in STEM jobs value different job characteristics](image5)"}

This aligns with the image showing that women in STEM value a job focused on helping others significantly more than men [image7].\n\nMoreover, women in STEM jobs are more inclined to say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work, citing concerns such as pay gaps and unequal treatment from their coworkers due to gender stereotypes [3]. These challenges are further reflected in the image, where a notable percentage of women perceive discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions as a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the image highlights that women are more likely to find it difficult to balance work and family obligations in STEM jobs, with 33% citing this as a major reason for fewer women in STEM [image1]. This is consistent with the text mentioning that flexibility in balancing work and family needs is crucial for both men and women, though women place a higher emphasis on it [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM, particularly the greater emphasis by women on helping others and the challenges related to work-life balance and discrimination, contribute to the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering and succeeding in the STEM workforce."}

Specifically, 27% state that their Hispanic ancestry is too distant or mixed, and 16% note their upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives as reasons [1].\n\nThis trend is further illustrated by the chart in `![The image is a bar chart that shows different reasons why individuals may not identify as Hispanic.](image3)`. The chart breaks down these reasons into percentages, aligning with the textual explanation. For instance, the chart highlights that 27% of individuals cite mixed backgrounds or distant Hispanic ancestry, 16% point to upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives, and 15% mention not speaking Spanish or lacking cultural links [1].\n\nAdditionally, the text notes that 12% identify as another race or do not look Hispanic, and 9% were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American [1].

According to the text, 84% of self-identified Hispanics say that having a Spanish last name is not necessary for being Hispanic [2]. This is reflected in `![The image is a chart comparing two categories among self-identified Hispanics: those who speak Spanish and those who have a Spanish last name.](image1)`, where only 15% of self-identified Hispanics have a Spanish last name, and this percentage drops to 7% for third or higher generations [2].\n\nAnother significant factor is the generational shift in identifying as American.

First-generation immigrants experience higher levels of discrimination, with 42% reporting they have experienced discrimination often (8%) or sometimes (34%). In comparison, 29% of third or higher generation Latinos report experiencing the same level of discrimination [4].\n\nRegarding racial identification, there is a noticeable shift across generations. The majority of self-identified Hispanics identify as Hispanic or Latino, with 69% of overall self-identified Hispanics identifying this way, compared to only 26% among third or higher generation Hispanics. Similarly, among self-identified non-Hispanics, only 9% identify as Hispanic or Latino, while 59% identify as White [3] [image3].\n\nMoreover, the perception of how others view them also changes across generations. While 59% of self-identified non-Hispanics say they are seen as white, the share of self-identified Hispanics who believe passersby see them as Hispanic decreases from 78% among immigrants to 46% among third or higher generation Hispanics [6].\n\nThe image data further reinforces these trends. The bar chart in `![The image illustrates how perceptions of discrimination vary among different generations of Hispanics.](image4)` shows that foreign-born Hispanics feel the most connected to their heritage (82%), while third or higher generation Hispanics feel less connected (only 44%). Additionally, `![The image shows the varying levels of racial identification among different generations of Hispanics.](image3)` indicates that third or higher generation Hispanics are more likely to identify as White (25%) compared to 11% among foreign-born Hispanics.\n\nIn conclusion, generational differences greatly influence the perception of discrimination and racial identification among Hispanics, with later generations experiencing less discrimination and identifying less frequently as Hispanic."}

This sentiment is further reinforced by the fact that an overwhelming majority of young Arabs believe they are entitled to subsidised energy costs while concern about climate change is low across the region [9].\n\nRegarding the differences between GCC and Non-GCC countries, the data reveals interesting trends. For instance, when comparing concerns about the rising cost of living, we see that both GCC and Non-GCC countries report high levels of concern, but there are some variations. In GCC countries, the percentage of people who are very concerned about the rising cost of living tends to be slightly lower compared to Non-GCC countries. Specifically, the Non-GCC countries show a higher percentage of people who are very concerned about the rising cost of living, as illustrated in the chart where the Non-GCC group has a value of 55, while the GCC group has a value of 39. ![Comparison of Concern Levels for Rising Cost of Living](image4)\n\nSimilarly, when looking at unemployment concerns, the chart shows that GCC countries generally have lower levels of concern compared to Non-GCC countries.

This pattern aligns with the radio listening habits observed. For instance, 76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, with 40% using a mobile phone. In rural areas, 77% use a radio, whereas in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone for listening. Gender-wise, 77% of females use a radio compared to 75% of males. ![76% listen via radio, 40% via mobile phone](image4)\n\nMoreover, the frequency of radio listening shows a similar trend. A significant portion, 46%, of respondents never listen to the radio, but 27% listen every day, and 19% listen a few times a week. When we break this down further, we see that in rural areas, 27.4% listen every day, while in urban areas, it is 28%. Females are less likely to listen daily, with only 20% compared to 34.3% of males. ![46% never listened, 27% listened every day](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in technology usage within versus outside the household are evident, with mobile phones being dominant inside homes but rarely used outside. This aligns with the radio listening habits, where radios remain the primary device for listening to the radio, particularly in rural areas and among females."}

Initially, reduced ARPU was due to a massive price war initiated by the government, leading to lower tariffs across the board. Over time, the continued trend of declining ARPU has been driven by the increasing use of data-based services such as instant messaging and VoIP, which reduces the reliance on traditional voice and SMS services.

This trend underscores the shift towards digital consumption over physical formats.\n\nIn contrast, album sales show a different pattern. The same bar chart reveals that physical albums (Phys Albums) still hold a significant share for Rock at 32%, whereas R&B/Hip-Hop has a lower share at 19%. This indicates that Rock fans may still prefer tangible media, whereas R&B/Hip-Hop listeners lean more towards digital formats.\n\nFurthermore, the genre-specific consumption patterns highlight the varying impacts on the music industry. For instance, the chart in `![Genre share of total activity](image6)` shows that Rock dominates album sales with 37%, but its streaming share is only 23%, suggesting that Rock artists and labels might benefit more from album sales. Conversely, R&B/Hip-Hop has a smaller album sales share at 18%, but a larger streaming share at 26%, indicating that this genre benefits more from streaming platforms.\n\nThe implications of these trends are significant. Artists and labels in genres like R&B/Hip-Hop might focus more on promoting their music through streaming platforms, where they can reach a broader audience and capitalize on the higher streaming shares. On the other hand, Rock artists could leverage their strong album sales to maintain revenue from traditional album purchases, even as the industry shifts towards streaming.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in streaming and album sales differ significantly across music genres, with Rock favoring album sales and R&B/Hip-Hop leaning towards streaming. These differences suggest that the music industry should tailor marketing and distribution strategies to the preferences of each genre's fan base."}

This is evident from the analysis in Table 2 and Table 7, where these strategies struggle to cover a wide range of classes effectively.\n\nMoreover, figures like Figure 2 and Figure 7 illustrate that VAAL, in particular, shows a strong bias. In the context of the Organ AM NIST dataset, VAAL prefers selecting data from classes like femur-right and platelet, while largely ignoring classes such as lung, liver, and monocyte.

This is outlined in text quote [2], which explains that the user utterance is mapped to an embedding space and then fed into the bidirectional LSTM, resulting in a concatenated representation of the forward and backward LSTM states.\n\nNext, the system incorporates the dialogue state, which is maintained by the dialogue-level LSTM. The dialogue state is updated continuously as the system processes each turn, integrating the encoding of the user's utterance and the previous system action. This continuous representation of the dialogue state is crucial for maintaining context and understanding the ongoing conversation. As mentioned in text quote [3], the dialogue state tracker updates its estimation of the user's goal, represented by a list of slot-value pairs.\n\nBased on this dialogue state, the system determines the next system action through the policy network. The policy network takes several inputs, including the dialogue state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results. The emitted system action is then used to produce a natural language response, typically through a template-based natural language generator (NLG). Text quote [6] describes how the delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced by values from either the estimated user goal or the retrieved knowledge base entities, depending on the system action.\n\nFor instance, if the user asks for a movie for the day after tomorrow, the system would generate a natural language response like \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" based on the determined system action of requesting the time. This process is illustrated in `![The proposed architecture for an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system shows how user input is processed through various components to generate a natural language response.](image6)`.\n\nIn conclusion, the system generates a response to the user's request by processing the user input through a bidirectional LSTM encoder, updating the dialogue state, determining the next system action via the policy network, and finally generating a natural language response using a template-based NLG."}

According to the ablation studies, the transformer components including the global self-attention in the encoder, FFN, multiple decoder layers, and positional encodings, all significantly contribute to the final object detection performance [1]. Positional encodings are critical in retaining spatial information in the image features. \n\nIn one experiment, when spatial positional encodings are completely removed and only output positional encodings are passed at the input, the model still achieves more than 32 AP, although it loses 7.8 AP compared to the baseline [6]. This indicates that while spatial encodings are important, the model can still perform reasonably without them.\n\nMoreover, passing fixed sine spatial positional encodings and output encodings at the input once, similar to the original transformer, leads to a minor 1.4 AP drop compared to passing positional encodings directly in attention [6]. Learned spatial encodings passed to the attentions yield similar results. Surprisingly, not passing any spatial encodings in the encoder only leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 AP [6].\n\nThis is further supported by the table summarizing results for different positional encoding configurations, where the highest AP and AP₅₀ scores are achieved when positional encodings are passed at every attention layer in both the encoder and the decoder [image3]. This suggests that consistent use of positional encodings throughout the model is beneficial for performance.\n\nRegarding the loss components, the DETR model incorporates a combination of `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` losses. The ablation study shows that the model performs best with the combination of `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` losses, achieving an AP of 40.6 and an AP₅₀ of 61.6 [image7]. Using just `class` and `GIoU` yields slightly lower performance, while omitting `GIoU` results in a more significant drop in AP and AP₅₀ [image7]. This indicates that incorporating all three loss components enhances the model's overall detection accuracy.\n\nFinally, the model's performance across different decoder layers is also analyzed. As the number of decoder layers increases, the AP and AP₅₀ improve, with a substantial gain of +8.2/9.5 AP between the first and the last layer [11]. However, the benefit of applying non-maximum suppression (NMS) decreases as the number of layers increases, and it even starts to negatively impact performance in the later layers [image4].\n\nIn conclusion, the DETR-DC5 model's Average Precision (AP) is significantly affected by the consistent use of positional encodings throughout the model and the incorporation of `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` losses. The model benefits from increasing the number of decoder layers, though the necessity of non-maximum suppression diminishes with deeper layers."}

However, recall (orange line with diamond markers) remains relatively stable, suggesting that the model’s ability to retrieve all necessary knowledge is not substantially affected by the removal of knowledge elements. This stability implies that the model can still identify the presence of missing knowledge to a certain extent. The F1-Score (green line with triangle markers) shows a moderate increase, reflecting a balance between precision and recall. These findings suggest that the model can adapt to missing knowledge, albeit with varying degrees of success in precision and recall. ![Precision increases significantly as more knowledge is removed, while recall remains relatively stable](image1)\n\nIn another set of experiments, the removal of knowledge elements (rows labeled \"0,\" \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3\") demonstrates that correctness remains relatively high even as precision and recall decrease.

For instance, tasks might require the use of advanced concepts like Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory. This depth contrasts sharply with other benchmarks that typically focus on simpler forms of reasoning or common sense knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the MMMU benchmark is characterized by its diverse image formats, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, and more, as mentioned in text [1]. This diversity is crucial for testing the perceptual capabilities of models across various modalities. Additionally, the benchmark features interleaved text-image inputs, requiring models to jointly understand both components and recall deep subject knowledge to derive solutions.\n\n![The table presents statistics on a dataset of questions: Total Questions: 11,550, Total Disciplines/Subjects/Subfields: 6/30/183, Image Types: 30, Dev:Validation:Test Split: 150:900:10,500, Difficulties (Easy: Medium: Hard): 28% : 45% : 27%.

Initially, the system employs pre-processing techniques such as cropping and blurring to isolate and emphasize the objects of interest in the image. This involves cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing the cropped regions to a fixed proportion. Blurring is applied to the non-target areas to guide the MLLMs' focus towards the relevant objects. Once the pre-processing is complete, the system retrieves the top-$k$ similar results from the memory bank, which has been constructed using multimodal embeddings created by the retriever. The retrieved results are then ranked by the MLLMs based on their contextual appropriateness, ultimately leading to the final prediction.\n\nFor instance, in the object detection task, the system uses the visual encoder to process the input image and obtain the corresponding image embeddings. These embeddings are then navigated through the memory index to retrieve the top-$k$ related images and categories. The MLLMs further refine these results by assessing the contextual fit, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.

Additionally, the incorporation of entity detection (ED) significantly contributes to the model's overall effectiveness, as seen in the ablation study where the performance of the model with ED markedly surpasses the variant without it ([2]).\n\nThe SnapNTell dataset, which is distinct from traditional VQA datasets, further highlights the model's capability.

However, the focus has shifted towards document-level representation learning, an area that remains relatively under-explored [1]. SPECTER, a new method introduced in this paper, aims to address this gap by incorporating inter-document context into Transformer language models, leveraging citations as a supervision signal to learn document representations [3].\n\nIn evaluating the performance of SPECTER, we observe significant improvements across a range of document-level tasks, including classification, citation prediction, and recommendation. Compared to other models like Doc2vec, Fasttext-sum, ELMo, Citeomatic, SGC, SciBERT, and Sent-BERT, SPECTER demonstrates superior performance in almost all metrics [image1]. For instance, in classification tasks, SPECTER achieves an F1 score of 86.4, which is a notable improvement over the best baseline [8]. Similarly, in user activity prediction tasks, SPECTER shows MAP scores of 83.8 for co-view and 84.5 for co-read, outperforming the best baseline (Citeomatic) by 2.7 and 4.0 points, respectively [8].\n\nHowever, the inclusion of additional metadata such as authors and venues in the input can affect performance. Removing the abstract from the input and relying solely on the title leads to a substantial decrease in performance, indicating the importance of abstract content for accurate document representation [2]. Interestingly, adding author names as input unexpectedly hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and the suboptimal tokenization of author names using Wordpieces [2]. Furthermore, adding venue information slightly decreases performance across most tasks, except for document classification, where it makes sense due to the high correlation between venues and document categories [2].\n\nTo further evaluate the effectiveness of SPECTER, we also compared it with variations of SciBERT fine-tuned on specific tasks. The results indicate that SPECTER outperforms these fine-tuned versions across multiple metrics, including classification, user activity prediction, citation prediction, and recommendation tasks [image2]. This suggests that SPECTER's pretraining approach using citation-based signals is highly effective and versatile, even without task-specific fine-tuning.\n\nFinally, the visualization of academic topic clustering using SPECTER and SciBERT reveals that SPECTER produces more compact and homogeneous clusters, indicating better separation of topics in the embedding space [4][image3]. The DBScan clustering algorithm confirms this, with SPECTER achieving higher homogeneity and completeness values compared to SciBERT [4].\n\nIn conclusion, SPECTER outperforms other models across various document-level tasks, with the inclusion of certain metadata such as authors and venues having mixed effects on performance.

Here's a breakdown: - **Models Evaluated**: - QANet (Yu et al., 2018b) - BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) with variants: - BERT+FL - BERT+DL - BERT+DSC - XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) with variants: - XLNet+FL - XLNet+DL - XLNet+DSC - **Datasets & Metrics**: - **SQuAD v1.1**: Measures EM and F1 scores. EM indicates exact matches between the predicted and gold answers, while F1 considers the overlap. - **SQuAD v2.0**: Includes questions that do not have an answer, evaluating model robustness to predict unanswerable questions. - **QuoRef**: Another dataset for EM and F1 score evaluations. - **Performance Summary**: - **BERT** and its variants show improvements with FL, DL, DSC enhancements, providing small incremental gains in EM and F1. Notably, BERT+DSC achieves the highest scores among BERT variants. - **XLNet** itself performs better than BERT on all datasets and metrics. Its enhancements (FL, DL, DSC) further improve performance slightly, with XLNet+DSC achieving the highest scores overall. The improved scores due to the enhancements are shown in parentheses as differences over the base model's scores. Overall, the table highlights that while baseline BERT and XLNet models are strong performers in question answering, applying additional techniques (FL, DL, DSC) can bring about further improvements.](image8).\n\nThese comparisons indicate that the DSC loss consistently improves the F1 scores for both BERT and XLNet across different tasks and datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing model performance.\n\nThe DSC loss consistently improves the F1 scores for both BERT and XLNet across various datasets and tasks, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing model performance."}

Here, the data augmentation technique labeled as \"+positive\" outperforms the original setup, whereas \"+negative\" underperforms the original. This observation aligns with expectations, as \"+positive\" creates a balanced dataset, while \"+negative\" leads to a more imbalanced dataset. Furthermore, although \"-negative\" also creates a balanced dataset, the reduction in the number of training data negatively impacts performance. ![Performance metrics of BERT models under different data augmentation conditions](image2)\n\nAdditionally, the study explores the effect of dice loss on accuracy-oriented tasks like text classification. Experiments were conducted on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets, including SST-2 and SST-5. Fine-tuning BERT with different training objectives revealed that BERT with Cross-Entropy (CE) achieves the highest accuracy on SST-5 (55.57), while Dice Loss (DL) and Dice-Sigmoid-Cross Entropy (DSC) perform slightly worse (54.63 and 55.19, respectively). Similar trends were observed for SST-2. These findings confirm that dice loss is not suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks. ![Accuracy results for BERT models on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets](image6)\n\nMoreover, the imbalance in the dataset significantly affects performance due to two primary issues: the training-test discrepancy and the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples. Cross-entropy or MLE objectives handle neither of these issues effectively. The proposed dynamic weight adjusting strategy helps mitigate the dominating influence of easy-negative examples by associating each training example with a weight proportional to \\( (1-p) \\), allowing the model to focus more on hard-negative examples. ![Comparison of different models evaluated on the English OntoNotes 5.0 dataset](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, the performance of BERT models on the QOP dataset and other sentiment analysis and named entity recognition tasks is significantly influenced by the choice of data augmentation techniques and loss functions.

Specifically, the down-sampled balanced set contains 269,165 examples, while the augmented balanced dataset has 458,477 examples, maintaining a 50% split for positive and negative examples. This balance is crucial for training models effectively.\n\nIn Image2, we see a comparative performance table of different BERT configurations under various conditions. The original BERT model serves as a baseline, while the variations include positive and negative augmentations. The table clearly shows that adding positive elements generally improves performance, whereas introducing negative elements leads to a decline. Removing negative elements also results in poorer performance, likely due to the reduced amount of training data.\n\nAdditionally, Text Quote [4] aligns with the observations from Image2, noting that positive augmentation creates a balanced dataset and thus performs well, while negative augmentation, which creates an imbalanced dataset, underperforms. Similarly, removing negatives reduces the number of training data, leading to inferior performance.\n\nIn Image4, we observe the performance of BERT and XLNet models across different datasets, including SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef. Enhancements like FL, DL, and DSC significantly improve the F1 and EM scores. For instance, BERT+DSC achieves the highest scores among BERT variants, while XLNet+DSC provides the overall best performance. This is supported by Text Quote [2], which states that the proposed DSC loss provides significant boosts in performance on both EM and F1 scores.\n\nFurthermore, Image5 highlights the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the Tversky Index (TI), showcasing how different \\(\\alpha\\) values affect performance on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets. For Chinese OntoNotes4.0, the highest F1 score is 84.67 when \\(\\alpha\\) is 0.6, while for QuoRef, the highest F1 score is 68.44 with \\(\\alpha\\) set to 0.4. This aligns with Text Quote [6], which discusses the flexibility of TI in controlling the trade-off between false-negatives and false-positives and demonstrates the importance of hyperparameters in TI.\n\nIn conclusion, the performance of BERT model configurations varies significantly across different augmentation techniques and datasets, with positive augmentation and enhancements like DSC generally leading to the best performance."}

Additionally, it is noted that the performance on GLUE tasks benefits significantly from additional training data, particularly for tasks like CoLA and RTE [10].\n\nSecondly, the text also highlights that the structure of the training data matters.

Furthermore, multi-sentence training examples are crucial for many tasks, such as those involving sentence pairs [9].\n\nThirdly, the text discusses the impact of different datasets.

According to the study, aligning word embeddings helps to increase BLEU scores for all three tasks when pre-trained embeddings are applied [2]. This is particularly evident when a single encoder is used for both source languages, as the alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces. This allows the model to learn more effectively, akin to training on a single language.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of embedding alignment can vary depending on the specific language pairs involved. For instance, in the case of bilingual systems, the alignment of word embeddings was not necessarily beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages [7]. This suggests that while alignment can be useful, it may not always lead to substantial improvements in BLEU scores, especially in bilingual scenarios.\n\nMoving to the visual evidence, `![The table shows BLEU scores for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs, demonstrating that alignment can provide the highest scores in each case.](image2)` This table shows that alignment leads to the highest BLEU scores across different language pairs, indicating that alignment can indeed be effective in enhancing translation performance.\n\nAnother piece of visual evidence, `![The table shows BLEU scores for different datasets, comparing unaligned and aligned embeddings, with changes noted in parentheses.](image3)` illustrates the impact of alignment on BLEU scores for various language pairs. While the changes are small, they still suggest that alignment can contribute positively to BLEU scores, even if the improvements are marginal.\n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of word embeddings generally has a positive impact on BLEU scores in different language translation tasks, though the extent of this impact can vary and may be less pronounced in bilingual scenarios compared to multilingual systems."}

From the data presented in the tables and figures, it becomes evident that pre-training can enhance BLEU scores, particularly in low-resource scenarios. For instance, the improvements observed in BLEU scores for different language pairs (ES → PT, FR → PT, IT → PT, RU → PT, HE → PT) show that pre-training has a substantial positive effect, with the most significant gains seen in pairs like RU → PT and HE → PT, which have very low baseline BLEU scores. This aligns with the hypothesis that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases due to pre-training. ![Improvement in BLEU scores for various language pairs, with the largest gains in less similar languages](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores further elucidates the conditions under which pre-training is most beneficial. The top graph in the image shows that pre-training yields higher BLEU scores, especially when the training data is limited. This suggests that pre-training is particularly advantageous when there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all. The bottom graph illustrates the gain in BLEU score achieved by using pre-trained models over standard models, highlighting that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases. ![Pre-training improves BLEU scores more significantly at smaller training set sizes](image2)\n\nMoreover, the similarity between source and target languages plays a crucial role in the efficacy of pre-trained embeddings.

This is further supported by the data in `![The table shows BLEU scores for aligned and unaligned embeddings across different language pairs, with mixed results depending on the language similarity.](image4)`, which demonstrates that alignment can lead to slight improvements or even minor declines in scores, depending on the specific language pair.\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, the findings suggest that pre-training significantly improves the accuracy of translation for less frequent words. This is evident from the qualitative analysis of translations where pre-trained embeddings help in capturing rare vocabulary and generating grammatically well-formed sentences [2]. Furthermore, `![A bar chart showing that pre-training outperforms standard training for higher frequency target words in terms of F-measure scores.](image6)` illustrates that pre-training boosts F-measure scores across different frequency ranges, with notable improvements in higher frequency ranges.

However, the coreference layer significantly improves pronoun performance, with DyGIE achieving a 6.6% improvement on pronoun categorization [12]. This suggests that coreference propagation is particularly beneficial when dealing with ambiguous pronouns that require broader context understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, RelProp plays a crucial role in enhancing both entity and relation extraction. The performance metrics show that DyGIE without RelProp has a lower F1 score for relations compared to the full DyGIE model [4][8]. This is further supported by the observation that relation propagation significantly benefits entity and relation extraction in datasets like ACE05 and SciERC, where sentences often contain multiple relation instances across different entities [8][9].\n\nTo illustrate, the graph in ![Entity and Relation F1 Scores Across Iterations](image2) shows that both entity and relation F1 scores peak at two iterations for CorefProp and RelProp, respectively. This indicates that iterative processes enhance the model's ability to capture complex interactions between entities and relations.\n\nMoreover, the comparative performance table in ![Performance Comparison Across Systems](image3) highlights that DyGIE consistently outperforms other systems across different datasets, with the highest Entity F1 scores on ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA [3].\n\nIn conclusion, DyGIE performs well on entity and relation extraction across various datasets, with CorefProp playing a moderate role in improving entity categorization, especially for pronouns, and RelProp significantly boosting overall extraction performance."}

Specifically, DyGIE incorporates a coreference propagation layer, which is particularly beneficial when coreference annotations are available. For instance, in the ACE04-O and GENIA datasets, where coreference annotations are present, DyGIE achieves substantial improvements in entity F1 scores compared to previous methods [5]. DyGIE attains an Entity F1 score of 84.7 on ACE04-O and 76.2 on GENIA, which are notably higher than the scores achieved by other systems like \"Katiyar and Cardie (2018)\" and \"Wang and Lu (2018)\" [5].\n\nIn contrast, for the ACE05-O dataset, which lacks coreference annotations, DyGIE still performs well but with slightly lower gains. This suggests that the absence of coreference annotations may limit the effectiveness of the coreference propagation layer, thereby affecting the overall performance improvement [5].\n\nFurthermore, the coreference layer is crucial for handling pronouns, which often require understanding cross-sentence contexts. For example, in the ACE05 dataset, disambiguating the entity class for pronominal mentions is challenging due to the necessity of reasoning with cross-sentence contexts [3]. The coreference propagation layer helps DyGIE achieve a 6.6% improvement in pronoun performance, confirming its utility in such scenarios [3].\n\nIn summary, DyGIE benefits substantially from coreference annotations in datasets, leading to improved entity recognition performance, especially in handling complex linguistic phenomena like pronouns. However, the absence of such annotations can limit these benefits. \n\n![The table shows the performance metrics for different models on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.](image1)\n![The table provides performance metrics of different models on entity and relation extraction tasks.](image2)\n![The table presents the performance of different systems on various datasets, measured by the Entity F1 score.](image5)\n\nThe presence of coreference annotations positively influences DyGIE's performance in entity recognition tasks, particularly in datasets where such annotations are available."}

This suggests that the model benefits from two rounds of coreference propagation before the performance starts to plateau or decline slightly.

The word error rate (WER) is calculated for each model under various attacks, revealing that a low error rate often comes at the cost of increased sensitivity [12].\n\nIn the context of closed vocabulary models (word-only), the WER and sensitivity values vary depending on the backoff strategy. For instance, the Pass-through variant shows WER values of 17.6, 19.7, 0.8, and 7.3 for Swap, Drop, Add, and Key attacks, respectively, with an overall average of 11.3 [6]. Meanwhile, the Neutral variant exhibits similar WER values and an average of 11.3, indicating comparable performance to the Pass-through variant [6].\n\nOn the other hand, open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece) demonstrate different characteristics. The Pass-through variant has notably higher WER values of 39.6, 35.3, 19.2, and 26.9 for Swap, Drop, Add, and Key attacks, respectively, with an overall average of 30.3 [6]. The Background variant performs better, with WER values of 20.7, 25.1, 1.3, and 11.6, averaging 14.7 [6]. The Neutral variant has the lowest WER values of 17.5, 19.7, 0.8, and 7.2, averaging 11.3 [6].\n\nThe diagram in the image illustrates a hybrid model combining a \"Background Model\" and a \"Foreground Model,\" suggesting that the background model handles unseen inputs effectively by providing a fallback mechanism. This supports the idea that the Background and Neutral variants have lower WER and sensitivity, making them more robust against various attacks.\n\nThe scatter plots in the image show that the Neutral variant generally has lower sensitivity and WER values compared to the Pass-through and Background variants, indicating higher robustness. Specifically, the Neutral variant in the char-only model has a WER of 11 and a sensitivity of approximately 12, with robustness value 55.2, while the Pass-through variant has a WER of approximately 10 and a sensitivity of approximately 30, with robustness value 51.6 [12].\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity and word error rate (WER) differ between closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies, with the Neutral variant showing the best balance between low WER and sensitivity, making it the most robust option.\n\n![Sensitivity and WER for Different Backoff Strategies](image3)"}

Despite these reductions in fee rates, the overall increase in AUM could still positively impact the firm's revenues, given the substantial growth in asset base.\n\n![The table shows a decrease in fee rates across most categories from 2018 to 2020, with equity remaining constant.](image5)\n![The table illustrates a significant growth in AUM across all categories from 2018 to 2020.](image8)\n\nDespite the decline in fee rates, the firm's asset management revenues increased by 15% in 2020 compared to the previous year, driven by higher average AUM and strong investment performance, as well as positive net flows. Thus, the growth in AUM appears to have outweighed the negative effects of reduced fee rates, contributing to higher revenues.\n\nThe firm's revenues are likely to benefit from the increase in AUM despite the decline in fee rates, as the substantial growth in managed assets can compensate for lower rates."}

This substantial growth can be attributed to multiple factors, including increased revenues and improved operational efficiency. Specifically, the revenues were $33.6 billion, an increase of 43% compared to revenues of $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020, with a corresponding increase in net income of 74%. This growth was driven by a 64% increase in QCT revenues and a 26% increase in QTL revenues, primarily due to an increase in demand for 5G products and a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19 [10].\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 was $8,964 million, slightly lower than the net income due to other comprehensive losses, which amounted to $79 million. These losses were mainly due to foreign currency translation losses, unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale securities, and unrealized losses on derivative instruments [7].\n\nIn contrast, the comprehensive income for fiscal year 2020 was $5,305 million, and for fiscal year 2019, it was $4,272 million. The comprehensive income in 2020 saw positive contributions from foreign currency translation gains and unrealized gains on derivative instruments, which helped offset the lower net income compared to 2021 [7].\n\nFurthermore, the acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion on March 16, 2021, added to the company's technological capabilities and could contribute to future growth opportunities [10]. The integration of NUVIA's technologies into certain QCT products is expected to enhance Qualcomm's product offerings and potentially drive further revenue growth.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income for the fiscal year 2021 showed significant improvement compared to the previous years, driven by substantial revenue growth, particularly in QCT and QTL segments, and partially offset by other comprehensive losses.\n\n![The table provides financial information for the years ended September 26, 2021, September 27, 2020, and September 29, 2019.

The company’s insurance subsidiaries maintained exceptionally high capital strength, with a combined statutory surplus of approximately $301 billion at December 31, 2021 [4].\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years' retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021, resulting in pre-tax earnings of $142 million, contributed positively to the overall equity position [12].\n\nIn summary, the key factors contributing to the changes in liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 were increases in net earnings, investment gains, and higher insurance-related liabilities, as reflected in their financial statements."}

Specifically, the International Operated Markets segment experienced substantial declines due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations [2]. This resulted in a 10% decrease in total company-operated sales and franchised revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 [5].\n\nMoreover, the detailed revenue breakdown from image3 shows that:\n- Company-operated sales in the U.S. decreased by 4% in 2020, while International Operated Markets saw a 19% decrease.\n- Franchised revenues in the U.S. decreased by 2%, whereas International Operated Markets experienced a 14% decrease.\n\nThese declines in revenues contributed to a decrease in overall operating income. Image4 provides further details on the financial metrics, indicating that operating income decreased by 19% in 2020, primarily due to the aforementioned revenue declines and increased expenses, such as higher selling, general, and administrative expenses [11].\n\nFurthermore, the dilution of earnings per share can be seen in image1, where the GAAP earnings per share-diluted decreased from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020, a 20% drop. This decrease is also reflected in the Non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted, which fell from $7.84 in 2019 to $6.05 in 2020, a 23% decrease. The strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which amounted to $268 million or $0.26 per share, partially offset these declines [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in both company-operated and franchised revenues across different markets, especially in the International Operated Markets segment, significantly impacted McDonald's GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share, leading to a 20% and 23% decrease, respectively, from 2019 to 2020."}

Although the exact figures for net income are not explicitly stated in the text quotes, we can infer changes from the earnings reported by different business segments. For instance, the U.S. upstream segment reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 [4]. Similarly, the international upstream segment reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $825 million in 2020 [7]. These substantial improvements suggest a significant positive shift in overall net income from 2020 to 2021.\n\nNext, let's consider the return on stockholders' equity. While the exact figures for return on stockholders' equity are not provided, we can refer to the financial tables in the images. Image2 provides a financial table spanning 2019 to 2021, which likely includes net income and other key financial metrics. Without specific labels, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact figures, but the overall trend suggests a positive shift. Additionally, Image3 shows bold numbers for 2021, indicating highlights or significant changes from previous years, which could imply improved financial performance [image3].\n\nFinally, the general financial trends indicated by the earnings in various segments support the conclusion that both net income and return on stockholders' equity likely improved significantly from 2020 to 2021.\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's net income and return on stockholders' equity improved from 2020 to 2021, reflecting better financial performance across multiple business segments.

Specifically, the table shows that the impact of foreign exchange translation was 2%, and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures was -10%. These adjustments help explain the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\n\nThe GAAP measure reflects the actual financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles, while the non-GAAP measure adjusts for certain items affecting comparability, such as foreign exchange impacts and acquisitions. Therefore, the core non-GAAP measure provides a clearer view of the underlying operational performance by excluding these one-time or non-recurring items.\n\nIn summary, the APAC segment's reported GAAP measure increased by 18% in 2020, whereas the core non-GAAP measure increased by 8%, with foreign exchange translation and acquisitions being the primary factors affecting these changes. ![APAC segment's financial changes in 2020](image4)"}

According to the table, the comprehensive income for 2020 was $4,626.4 million, which was significantly lower than the $6,152.2 million recorded in 2019 and $5,493.2 million in 2018.\n\nOne major factor contributing to the decline in comprehensive income in 2020 was the decrease in net income, which fell from $6,025.4 million in 2019 to $4,730.5 million in 2020. This reduction in net income can be attributed to several factors, such as the overall economic downturn caused by the pandemic, which led to decreased consumer spending and operational challenges.\n\nAdditionally, the table in image7 shows that other comprehensive income also experienced fluctuations across the years. In 2020, other comprehensive income was a loss of $104.1 million, whereas it was a gain of $126.8 million in 2019 and a loss of $431.1 million in 2018. The loss in 2020 was primarily due to the significant losses in cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans, which amounted to $123.3 million and $43.9 million, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the financial statement in image1 shows that McDonald's total assets increased by $5.1 billion or 11% in 2020, mainly due to an increase in cash and equivalents, driven by lower capital expenditures and fewer treasury stock purchases. However, this positive change in assets did not sufficiently offset the decrease in net income and the negative impact of other comprehensive income.\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's comprehensive income for 2020 was $4,626.4 million, which is lower than the $6,152.2 million in 2019 and $5,493.2 million in 2018.

These declines can be attributed to several factors. First, the ongoing effects of the pandemic, particularly the delays in cancer care and a weak flu season, negatively impacted the generics sales. Additionally, the segment faced increased competition and pricing pressures, which contributed to the overall decline in financial performance. Despite these challenges, there were some positive developments within the segment, such as growth in the biopharmaceuticals category, which showed a 10% increase in USD and a 7% increase in constant currencies.

According to the data provided, net interest income decreased from $7,683 million in 2019 to $6,674 million in 2021, which represents a 7% decrease over the two-year period. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including lower interest income and reduced interest expense, although the latter had a smaller impact. Specifically, interest income declined by 13% from 2019 to 2020 and by an additional 10% from 2020 to 2021, while interest expense decreased by 39% from 2019 to 2020 and by 32% from 2020 to 2021 [7].\n\nOn the other hand, card member receivables increased substantially from $22.8 billion in 2019 to $22.4 billion in 2021, representing a 20% increase over the same period. This increase can be largely attributed to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and portfolio quality, particularly driven by the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The improvement in the unemployment rate projections also contributed to this positive trend, as it led to reserve releases in the current year compared to reserve builds in the prior year [9]. Additionally, there was a notable increase in billed business, which rose 21% from 2020 to 2021, reflecting a recovery from the prior year's adverse economic conditions [10].\n\nFurthermore, the decrease in provisions for credit losses played a significant role in the overall financial performance.

This growth is visible in the detailed breakdown of the tax provision across different categories, such as federal, state, and foreign taxes, which all demonstrate increases over the years. For instance, the federal tax provision increased from $2,897 million in 2018 to $4,098 million in 2020, while the foreign tax provision rose from $404 million in 2018 to $491 million in 2020.

This increase was largely driven by higher accrued expenses and allowances, nondeductible liabilities, and lease liabilities. Conversely, the deferred income tax liabilities also increased significantly, rising from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020. The primary contributors to this increase were higher U.S. federal and state intangible assets, capitalized software, and lease right-of-use assets.\n\nThese changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities contributed to the overall increase in the provision for income taxes, as they reflect the difference between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities.

In comparison, in 2019, the total current liabilities were $3,205 million, and the total noncurrent liabilities were $5,351 million, resulting in a combined total of $8,556 million. Thus, the total liabilities increased by approximately $4,575 million from 2019 to 2020. This increase is reflected in the detailed breakdown of liabilities provided in the tables, where most categories show an uptick, particularly in compensation and benefits, taxes, income, and other liabilities.\n\nNext, we need to consider how these changes in liabilities relate to the changes in total debt during the same period. According to the text, the total debt was approximately $21.2 billion and $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively [4]. This indicates a slight decrease in total debt from 2019 to 2020. However, the decrease in total debt is relatively small compared to the significant increase in liabilities, suggesting that other factors might have influenced the overall financial structure.\n\nThe increase in liabilities could be attributed to several factors, including acquisitions and the issuance of new financial instruments. For instance, the table showing the outstanding balances of various debt instruments as of December 31, 2020, includes specific details about new issues like Euronotes and U.S. Notes [image4]. These new issues contribute to the higher total liabilities despite the minor decrease in overall debt.\n\nIn summary, while the total debt slightly decreased from 2019 to 2020, the total liabilities significantly increased, primarily due to a rise in various current and noncurrent liabilities. This change reflects a more complex financial situation influenced by factors such as acquisitions and the issuance of new financial instruments.\n\nThe total current and noncurrent liabilities increased from $8,556 million in 2019 to $13,131 million in 2020, despite a slight decrease in total debt from $21.7 billion in 2019 to $21.2 billion in 2020."}

This change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 compared to the prior year. In 2020, the net discrete tax benefits were mainly related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [3][5].\n\nThe net discrete tax benefits in 2019 were significantly higher, totaling $475 million, which included benefits related to remeasurement of reserves and related interest as well as conversion of employee share-based awards [8][10]. In contrast, the lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 contributed to a higher effective tax rate, reflecting a reduction in tax benefits that had previously lowered the overall tax burden.\n\nLooking at the compensation expenses, the total recognized in compensation expense increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020. This increase is attributed to several factors, including higher discretionary incentive compensation, higher payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and higher expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation associated with carried interest [1].\n\nAdditionally, the table in image1 shows that the compensation expenses for Wealth Management grew from $760 million in 2019 to $1,000 million in 2020, which aligns with the overall trend of increasing compensation expenses and contributes to the higher effective tax rate observed in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is related to the lower net discrete tax benefits and higher earnings, which coincided with a significant rise in total compensation expenses, particularly in Wealth Management.

This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the decrease in net income and changes in other comprehensive income components. Specifically, the net of tax adjustments for foreign currency translation, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit pension plans contributed to the overall reduction in comprehensive income. The table in the financial statements clearly shows that other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, decreased from $126.8 million in 2019 to $(104.1) million in 2020, further impacting the comprehensive income.\n\n![Net Income and Comprehensive Income Data](image1)\n\nCash provided by operations was $6.27 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.9 billion or 23%, primarily due to the reduction in operating earnings caused by the pandemic [5].

The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\\S137$ million and $\\S101$ million, respectively.

According to the data in ![The table displays financial data for various countries, focusing on two main metrics: Net Revenue and Long-Lived Assets for the years 2020, 2019, 2018](image1), the net revenue has generally increased over the three-year period, with notable growth in the United States, China, and Canada. Specifically, the United States saw an increase from $37,148 million in 2018 to $40,800 million in 2020, while China experienced a substantial rise from $1,164 million in 2018 to $1,732 million in 2020. However, South Africa had a decline in net revenue from $432 million in 2018 to $1,282 million in 2020, indicating a volatile trend.\n\nIn ![The table displays the net revenue and operating profit for different divisions of a company over three years (2018, 2019, and 2020)](image2), the net revenue and operating profit for each division are summarized. For instance, the FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) division saw a steady increase in net revenue from $28,355 million in 2018 to $30,274 million in 2020, and its operating profit also rose from $4,899 million in 2018 to $5,706 million in 2020. Similarly, the PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) division showed growth in net revenue from $24,547 million in 2018 to $26,703 million in 2020, and its operating profit increased from $2,382 million in 2018 to $3,058 million in 2020. This indicates that both divisions have seen positive trends in both net revenue and operating profit over the years.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across different regions and PepsiCo overall is provided in ![The table presents the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018](image6). For example, in Europe, the percentage of beverage sales increased from 50% in 2018 to 55% in 2020, while the percentage of food/snack sales decreased correspondingly. This shift could be indicative of a change in consumer preferences or strategic focus by the company.\n\nMoreover, the impact of the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories on net revenue and operating profit can be seen in the percentages provided. For instance, the consistent dominance of food/snack sales in regions like LatAm and APAC, where food/snack sales account for 90% and 75% respectively, suggests that these divisions rely heavily on food/snack products for their revenue. Conversely, the increasing share of beverage sales in Europe may correlate with the observed growth in net revenue and operating profit in that region.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 reflect positive trends, with significant contributions from key regions like the United States and China. The distribution of beverage and food/snack categories within these regions appears to influence these financial outcomes, with regions focusing more on beverages experiencing growth in beverage sales and regions dominated by food/snack sales maintaining high percentages of net revenue from these products."}

This is evident from the cash flow statement provided in the table where the financing activities section shows a large influx of funds in 2021, primarily due to borrowing and financing activities related to the acquisition. Additionally, the table indicates that Siemens Healthineers received €10 billion in borrowings and an additional €850 million in financing from the Siemens Group to support this acquisition [9].\n\nOn the other hand, cash outflows from investing activities increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million, mainly due to the payout for the acquisition of Varian. This significant increase in cash outflows is also clearly shown in the table, reflecting the substantial investment made in acquiring Varian [6]. Furthermore, the increase in cash outflows from investing activities was also driven by additional investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, which rose by €117 million [6].\n\nThe table also highlights the impact of these activities on the company's overall cash position. Despite the large outflows from investing activities, the net cash flow from operating activities remained robust, increasing from €1,928 million in 2020 to €2,933 million in 2021.

According to the text quotes, NBCUniversal's total revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion in 2021, compared to 2020 [8]. This significant increase was largely driven by the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics and improved performance across various segments. Specifically, the Media segment saw a substantial rise in revenue, although Adjusted EBITDA declined due to increased investments in Peacock and other factors [12].\n\nRegarding the Sky segment, the text does not provide specific figures for revenue changes, but it mentions that expenses for the Sky segment increased primarily due to direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as foreign currency translation impacts [9]. However, the overall trend suggests that while expenses increased, there might have been a positive shift in revenue, given the broader improvement in NBCUniversal's financials.\n\nFrom the image quotes, image1 offers a detailed financial snapshot for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, showing revenue growth from $248 million in 2020 to $461 million in 2021, representing an 86.1% increase.

Specifically, derivative financial instruments are often included in these categories. According to ![Derivative financial instruments data for 2020 and 2019](image2), the derivative financial instruments for 2020 and 2019 are:\n\n- **Derivative financial instruments (fair value through income statement)**:\n  - 2020: 2,332 million DKK\n  - 2019: 188 million DKK\n\nThis significant increase in derivative financial instruments from 2019 to 2020 suggests that the company may have engaged in more hedging activities or speculative trading, which can impact the income statement through gains or losses on these instruments.\n\n### Cash Flow Changes\n\nTo understand the cash flow changes, we can look at the data provided in ![Cash flow change in working capital for 2020 and 2019](image4):\n\n- **Change in working capital including exchange rate adjustments**:\n  - 2020: (2,624) million DKK\n  - 2019: (3,564) million DKK\n\n- **Cash flow change in working capital**:\n  - 2020: (4,353) million DKK\n  - 2019: (3,388) million DKK\n\nThe decrease in the change in working capital and cash flow change in working capital indicates a reduction in the cash outflow required to support the company’s operations. This could suggest better management of receivables and payables, or changes in inventory levels.\n\n### Impact on Financial Statements\n\nThe significant increase in derivative financial instruments from 2019 to 2020 will likely result in higher volatility in the income statement due to changes in the fair value of these instruments. These changes can either increase or decrease financial income or expenses depending on market conditions.\n\nThe cash flow changes, particularly the reduction in cash outflows, indicate improved cash management and potentially stronger liquidity. This can positively impact the company’s financial health and ability to invest in growth opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, the increased derivative financial instruments and changes in cash flow reflect a shift in the company's financial strategy, likely aimed at managing risk and improving cash flow efficiency, which has a direct impact on the volatility of the income statement and overall financial stability."}

According to the provided text quotes, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021 [9]. This suggests a reduction in the proportion of SG&A expenses relative to net sales, indicating efficiency improvements. The decrease was largely attributable to leveraging increased sales and ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases [9].\n\nRegarding the trend in Interest Income and Other, Net, the text indicates that the increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates [3]. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021 [2].\n\nTurning to the relevant images, `image2` provides financial figures for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020.

The negative values suggest expenses or outflows, and the trend here shows a slight increase in expenses from 2020 to 2022, but the overall net effect seems to have improved slightly from a loss of $6,488 in 2021 to a smaller loss of $4,283 in 2022.\n\nTo summarize the trends:\n- SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales showed a decrease from 2021 to 2022, indicating better efficiency.\n- Interest Income and Other, Net saw an improvement due to higher global interest rates and a decrease in interest expense from the repayment of notes.\n\nTherefore, the trends in SG&A expenses and Interest Income and Other, Net from 2020 to 2022 indicate an improvement in both areas, with reduced SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and a positive shift in interest income and other net expenses.\n\n![Financial figures for 2022, 2021, and 2020 showing slight increase in expenses but improved net effect](image2)"}

The image showing the comparison between GPI and the BSE Sensex over the period from April 2002 to March 2003 (`![The image is a line graph comparing the performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex over a series of months from April 2002 to March 2003.](image2)`) indicates that GPI's performance fluctuated between a high of 106 and a low of 84, while the BSE Sensex varied between 98 and 84. This suggests that GPI's performance was relatively consistent with the broader market trends.\n\nAdditionally, the table displaying the monthly high and low prices of the company's stock from April 2002 to March 2003 (`![The table displays the monthly high and low prices (in Rupees) over a span from April 2002 to March 2003.](image4)`) shows that the stock prices ranged from a high of 420.00 to a low of 286.00, indicating some volatility but generally staying within a moderate range.\n\nGiven this context, the remuneration for directors was likely structured to align with the company's financial stability and performance. The directors' salaries and other allowances, along with additional benefits like sitting fees, were set in a manner that reflected the company's financial health and market conditions. \n\nIn conclusion, the remuneration structures for directors in the financial year 2002-03 included specific amounts for managing/executive/whole-time directors, with non-executive directors receiving only sitting fees, and these structures were designed to reflect the company's financial performance and market conditions."}

This increase can be attributed to a rise in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities within the \"Insurance and Other\" category.\n\nConcurrently, shareholders' equity also increased significantly, from $506,200 million at the end of 2020 to $506,200 million at the end of 2021, as noted in the consolidated balance sheet ![The table shows financial data for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

This increase reflects the strong performance of the company in terms of net earnings and comprehensive income. Specifically, the net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $89,800 million in 2021, up from $43,253 million in 2020, as seen in the financial data table ![The table presents financial data for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. It includes Net Earnings, Other Comprehensive Income, and Comprehensive Income](image2).\n\nMoreover, the comprehensive income attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders increased from $43,521 million in 2020 to $90,011 million in 2021. This significant rise in comprehensive income is driven by both higher net earnings and other comprehensive income, including unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities and defined benefit pension plans, as indicated in the same table ![The table presents financial data for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. It includes Net Earnings, Other Comprehensive Income, and Comprehensive Income](image2).\n\nIn summary, the increases in total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 are closely tied to the strong performance in net earnings and comprehensive income during this period. The rise in liabilities is balanced by the substantial growth in shareholders' equity, reflecting the company's robust financial health and profitability."}

This approach is evident in its dividend policies, where Toyota consistently pays dividends and maintains a payout ratio around 30%, as seen in the financial data from 2017 to 2021. For instance, the dividend per share increased from 210 yen in 2017 to 240 yen in 2021, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns. Additionally, the total shareholder return, which includes dividends and share repurchases, has fluctuated but remained substantial, indicating a consistent effort to enhance shareholder value. ![Toyota's financial data shows consistent dividend payments and shareholder returns](image1)\n\nMoreover, Toyota strategically invests in next-generation growth areas, particularly in environmental technologies aimed at realizing a carbon-neutral society [1]. This includes investments in electrified vehicles and advanced technologies, which are crucial in responding to climate scenarios. For example, under the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, the company aims to reduce CO₂ emissions significantly by 2050, with specific milestones set for 2030. By 2020, Toyota had already achieved a 23% reduction in CO₂ emissions compared to 2010 levels, and it plans to further enhance this through the expansion of electrified vehicles and the implementation of innovative technologies. ![Toyota’s environmental goals and progress towards reducing CO₂ emissions](image4)\n\nFurthermore, Toyota evaluates the risks and opportunities associated with climate change, recognizing the need for measures such as adopting new technologies and responding to stricter government regulations. The company has endorsed and signed on to the recommendations of the TCFD, ensuring appropriate disclosure of information concerning climate-related risks and opportunities [9]. This proactive stance helps Toyota prepare for potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities, thereby enhancing its competitiveness and sustainability. ![Toyota's strategic planning and adaptation in response to climate challenges](image5)\n\nIn summary, Toyota’s financial strategy supports its response to climate scenarios by ensuring stable shareholder returns while investing in electrification measures to meet environmental goals."}

Furthermore, impairment losses recognised on intangible assets not yet available for use related to research and development projects are presented in research and development costs [2].\n\nIn 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognised, substantially all of which related to patents and licences.

Image4 provides a comprehensive view of the costs and losses for various categories, including research and development costs, administrative costs, and total amortisation and impairment losses. For instance, the total amortisation and impairment loss in 2019 was DKK 1,469 million, while in 2020 it was DKK 1,446 million. Specifically, the total impairment losses were DKK 982 million in 2019 and DKK 350 million in 2020, indicating a significant reduction in impairment losses from 2019 to 2020.\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides detailed financial information about intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, including categories such as patents and licences, software and other intangibles, land and buildings, plant and machinery, and other equipment.

In contrast, the Cable Communications segment only grew by 0.7%, indicating slower growth in this area. ![The table presents financial data for Comcast Corporation, broken down by its business segments: Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, Sky, and Corporate and Other, for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, the main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021 were the NBCUniversal and Sky segments, with the NBCUniversal segment being the primary driver. The operating expenses increased across all segments, particularly in NBCUniversal and Cable Communications, though these increases were partially offset by decreases in certain areas like the Corporate and Other segment."}

According to the table in image1, the net operating income for the Corporate Centre improved significantly from 2019 to 2020, increasing by $392 million (a 60% increase). Additionally, the profit before tax also saw a substantial improvement, rising by $387 million (a 42% increase). These improvements can be attributed to several factors, including a decrease in operating expenses and a reduction in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, as noted in the text [2] and [3]. The Corporate Centre also experienced a decline in the share of profit in associates and JVs, which decreased by $243 million (an 11% decrease), but this did not outweigh the positive changes in other areas.\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking and Markets segment showed more mixed results. Image2 provides a detailed breakdown of the revenue changes across various sectors within this segment. The Global Markets sector saw a significant increase in revenue, with FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) experiencing a substantial boost, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit. However, other areas like Securities Services and Global Liquidity and Cash Management experienced declines in revenue. Overall, the Global Banking and Markets segment had a net decrease in revenue, as indicated by the decreases in some key areas despite the increases in others.\n\nFrom the perspective of financial metrics, the Corporate Centre's performance in terms of net operating income and profit before tax improved markedly, driven by cost reductions and better control over credit losses. On the other hand, the Global Banking and Markets segment faced challenges in maintaining consistent revenue growth across all sectors, leading to a more nuanced picture where some areas performed well while others did not.\n\nIn conclusion, the Corporate Centre experienced a significant improvement in net operating income and profit before tax from 2019 to 2020, whereas the Global Banking and Markets segment showed a mix of gains and losses across different sectors, resulting in a more complex overall financial picture. \n\n![The table displays adjusted financial results for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, showing improvements in net operating income and profit before tax for the Corporate Centre](image1)\n![The table outlines the management's view of adjusted revenue across various sectors for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, indicating a mix of gains and losses in the Global Banking and Markets segment](image2)"}

According to the provided data, the revenues generated by the VIEs accounted for nearly 99.8% in 2020 and 99.1% in 2021 of the total net revenues. This indicates a slight decrease in the proportion of revenues contributed by the VIEs in 2021 compared to 2020. However, this does not necessarily reflect a reduction in absolute revenue but rather a shift in the overall business structure or revenue mix.\n\nRegarding total assets, the total assets of the VIEs, excluding amounts due from other companies in the Group, were 26.5% in 2020 and 26.9% in 2021 of the consolidated total assets. This suggests a slight increase in the proportion of total assets held by the VIEs in 2021 relative to 2020.\n\nTo visualize the comparison of assets, let's look at the provided table from `image4`:\n![The table presents a financial statement as of December 31, 2021, detailing assets and liabilities for a parent company, VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries, WOFE, other subsidiaries, and consolidated totals.

According to the data, the total stock-based expense decreased slightly from $558 million in 2020 to $540 million in 2021, and further to $528 million in 2022 [5]. This suggests a modest decline in stock-based compensation expenses over the period, which could indicate a reduction in the number of stock-based awards issued or changes in their valuation assumptions. Specifically, the expected volatility decreased from 20% in 2021 to 19% in 2022, which would likely reduce the fair value of the stock options granted [4].\n\nSecondly, examining the net earnings per share (EPS), we see that the diluted EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021 and further to $5.81 in 2022 [7]. This increase indicates a positive trend in profitability, as the company's net earnings grew despite a slight decrease in the total stock-based compensation expenses. Additionally, the basic EPS also increased from $5.13 in 2020 to $5.69 in 2021 and $6.00 in 2022, suggesting that the company's earnings have been robust enough to support these higher per-share figures [7].\n\nFurthermore, the decrease in the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding from 2,625.8 million in 2020 to 2,539.1 million in 2022 reflects a reduction in the number of shares, which contributes positively to the EPS growth [7]. This could be attributed to the company's efforts to manage its share count, although it does not have a specific policy to repurchase shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of stock-based awards [10].\n\nIn summary, the slight decline in stock-based compensation expenses coupled with a significant increase in net earnings per share indicates that Procter & Gamble has experienced a positive financial trend from 2020 to 2022, characterized by improved profitability and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding.\n\n![The table shows financial metrics for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, including interest rates, dividend yields, expected volatilities, and expected lives.](image4)\n![The table displays financial data for Procter & Gamble (P&G) for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, showing net earnings, shares outstanding, and net earnings per share.](image7)\n![The table shows stock-based expenses and income tax benefits for the years ended June 30 for 2022, 2021, and 2020.](image5)"}

Specifically, the balance at September 27, 2020, had foreign currency translation adjustments, while the balance at September 26, 2021, showed a minor adjustment of $6 for the current year.

Specifically, the decline in other comprehensive income (loss) from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in net unrealized debt securities gains and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nTherefore, the changes in shareholders' equity, particularly in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), impacted the comprehensive income by contributing to a lower overall increase in comprehensive income despite the substantial rise in net income. The comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, slightly lower than the net income of $8,060 million, mainly due to the negative other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in shareholders' equity, specifically the decline in other comprehensive income (loss), moderated the growth in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021."}

Additionally, total equity, including non-controlling interests, grew from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021. This substantial increase can be attributed to the capital increase in March 2021, which raised the issued capital by €53 million and the capital reserve by €2,284 million, as noted in Text Quote [7]. The increase was offset somewhat by the dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020, which decreased unappropriated net income by €856 million. However, the overall increase in equity is evident. ![Equity details show a significant increase from 2020 to 2021](image4)\n\nSecondly, looking at the cash flows from operating activities, the data shows a notable improvement from €1,928 million in 2020 to €2,933 million in 2021.

KG, although income tax payments had an offsetting effect. The year-on-year decline in cash generated from operating activities was primarily caused by higher income taxes paid. ![Cash flows from operating activities show a significant increase from 2020 to 2021](image6)\n\nIn summary, the total equity of Siemens Healthineers AG increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, while the cash flows from operating activities improved from €1,928 million in 2020 to €2,933 million in 2021."}

This includes a thorough examination of portfolio impacts, demand for commodities, and associated price outlooks, as well as the costs of decarbonization and Scope 3 emissions considerations [2].\n\nFurthermore, climate change is identified as a material governance and strategic issue, routinely discussed on the Board agenda, including in strategy discussions, portfolio reviews, and investment decisions [6].

The table in the image illustrates the changes in various components of Stockholders’ Equity over these years, including Common Stock, Treasury Stock, Additional Paid-In Capital, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and Retained Earnings.\n\nIn 2015, the Total Stockholders’ Equity was $10,741 million. By the end of 2016, it had grown to $19,285 million, and by 2017, it further increased to $26,961 million. These changes can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the Net Income for each respective year contributed significantly to the Retained Earnings, which is a component of Total Stockholders’ Equity. The Net Income for 2015 was $596 million, increasing to $2,371 million in 2016, and then to $3,033 million in 2017. This positive trend in Net Income directly boosted Retained Earnings and, consequently, Total Stockholders’ Equity.\n\nSecondly, the Additional Paid-In Capital also saw substantial growth. In 2015, it stood at $11,135 million and grew to $17,186 million by the end of 2016. By 2017, it had further increased to $21,388 million. This growth was driven by various stock-based compensation adjustments and the issuance of additional shares through common stock options.\n\nMoreover, the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) also played a role, although it showed losses each year. In 2015, it was $(511) million, which worsened to $(723) million by the end of 2016, and further to $(985) million by 2017. Despite the losses, the overall increase in Total Stockholders’ Equity was still significant due to the aforementioned contributions from Net Income and Additional Paid-In Capital.\n\nFinally, the number of Common Shares used in the computation of diluted earnings per share also increased, reflecting the growth in the company’s equity base. From 2015 to 2017, the shares used in the computation of diluted earnings per share grew from 477 million to 493 million, indicating an expansion in the shareholder base.\n\nIn conclusion, the Total Stockholders’ Equity increased from $10,741 million in 2015 to $19,285 million in 2016, and further to $26,961 million in 2017, primarily due to strong Net Income, significant increases in Additional Paid-In Capital, and a growing number of shares.

According to the text quotes, total revenue decreased by $22 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in transportation services revenue by $53 million, allowance oil revenue by $12 million, and product revenue by $21 million. However, there were increases in terminaling services revenue by $63 million and lease revenue by $1 million, which partially offset these declines [11]. Additionally, transportation services revenue was affected by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower rates on Zydeco committed contracts, and the impact of storms and related shut-ins of production [3].\n\nOn the other hand, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, largely due to the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, and the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 [5].\n\nMoreover, interest income increased by $19 million due to interest income related to the financing receivables recorded in connection with the Norco Assets, while interest expense decreased by $3 million due to lower interest rates in 2020 [4].\n\nConsidering these factors, the operating income likely saw a mixed trend due to the decrease in transportation services revenue but was positively impacted by increases in other areas like terminaling services and investment income.\n\nRegarding cash from investing activities, the cash flow statement in image6 provides specific details. The net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $64 million in 2020, compared to $(87) million in 2019, indicating a significant improvement in cash inflow from investing activities in 2020. This positive change can be attributed to a reduction in capital expenditures, which decreased from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of certain projects like the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco [2].\n\nIn conclusion, Shell Midstream Partners, L.P.'s operating income faced mixed changes in 2020, with decreases in some revenue categories offset by gains in others, while cash from investing activities improved significantly due to reduced capital expenditures and better management of investments.\n\n![The table provides a comprehensive overview of the financial performance of a partnership, including revenue, costs, operating income, net income, and per-unit data over three years.](image2)\n![The table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, measured in millions of dollars.](image6)"}

This substantial drop was partly due to higher adjusted ECL, reflecting the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, and a fall in adjusted revenue, primarily due to lower global interest rates [1].\n\nThe table in ![Net Operating Income and Profit Before Tax Adjustments](image1) provides a detailed comparison of financial performance measures across 2018, 2019, and 2020.

However, operating costs and expenses like programming and production increased by 1.3%, and direct network costs saw a rise of 17.1% [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the table in `![Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation across different segments and years](image7)` shows that depreciation and amortization expenses have been consistent, increasing from $8,663 million and $4,290 million in 2019 to $8,628 million and $5,176 million in 2021, respectively. Interest expense also fluctuated, decreasing from $4,567 million in 2019 to $4,281 million in 2021 [image7].\n\nThe reasons for these changes can be attributed to several factors. For instance, the increase in advertising revenue could be due to a market recovery post-COVID-19, as noted in the text [12]. Furthermore, the increase in direct network costs could be linked to investments in new technologies and services like Sky Glass and XClass TV, which are expected to incur higher costs in 2022 [7][11].\n\nOverall, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation has seen a steady recovery from 2019 to 2021, with fluctuations in specific segments driven by changes in revenue and operating costs.\n\n`![Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation across different segments and years](image7)`"}

Specifically, the Global Markets segment saw a substantial increase in revenue, rising by $1,562 million (27%) to reach $7,290 million in 2020. This was driven by robust performances in FICC, where revenue increased by $1,541 million (33%), particularly in Credit, which saw a remarkable 90% increase to $1,171 million. However, Securities Services experienced a decline of $234 million (12%) in revenue [1].\n\nDespite these positive trends in Global Markets, Global Banking revenue decreased by $71 million (2%) to $3,804 million in 2020, reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions. Nevertheless, capital markets revenue grew, and net interest income increased from corporate lending [7].\n\nOn the Corporate Centre side, the allocation of certain funding costs that were previously retained in the Corporate Centre to the global businesses had an impact on the overall revenue figures. Additionally, the allocation of revenue and expenses relating to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses improved the reflection of revenue and expense related to these activities [9].\n\nMoreover, HSBC managed to deliver gross RWA reductions of £37bn globally in 2020, contributing to a net reported RWAs fall of £8bn. This reduction mitigated RWA growth from asset quality deterioration, elevated market volatility, and regulatory changes [10]. Despite these efforts, the overall financial performance showed a decline, with reported profit before tax falling by 34% to £8.8bn and adjusted profit before tax decreasing by 45% to £12.1bn. However, Global Banking and Markets still performed particularly well, and Asia remained the most profitable region [11].\n\nOverall, HSBC demonstrated resilience in its financial performance amidst the challenges posed by the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position to support customers [5].\n\n![The table outlines the management's view of adjusted revenue across various sectors for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, and includes comparisons between 2020 and 2019.](image1)\n\n![The table shows the adjusted financial results for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, highlighting the changes from 2019 to 2020.](image2)\n\nIn 2020, HSBC's Global Markets segment saw a significant increase in revenue, while Global Banking experienced a slight decrease, and the Corporate Centre underwent changes in the allocation of funding costs and revenue."}

According to the text quote [12], interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn declined by $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were mainly due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, likely reflecting the low-interest-rate environment that persisted throughout 2021. Despite this, dividend income saw a modest increase, rising by $170 million (3.5%) in 2021 compared to 2020, but this did not compensate for the substantial drop in interest income.\n\nIn terms of asset allocations, the changes reflect a shift in focus towards maintaining liquidity and safety over yield.

Meanwhile, fixed maturity securities saw a decrease from $20,317 million to $16,386 million. This suggests a strategic move to prioritize liquidity and safety over yield, given the prevailing low-interest-rate environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was largely due to reduced interest and other investment income, exacerbated by low-interest rates, while asset allocations shifted towards safer and more liquid assets."}

In fiscal 2020, unallocated revenues were primarily from licensing revenues from Huawei and royalties for sales made in the March 2020 and June 2020 quarters. By fiscal 2021, unallocated revenues were significantly lower, with only a release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results being noted [5].\n\nLooking at the financial data provided in `image6`, we see a significant decrease in unallocated revenues from $4,891M in 2019 to $182M in 2021. This substantial decline can be attributed to the reduced settlement-related revenues in 2021 compared to previous years.\n\nRegarding unallocated expenses, `image6` also provides insight into the changes from 2019 to 2021. For instance, unallocated research and development expenses increased from $989M in 2019 to $1,820M in 2021, while unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $413M in 2019 to $538M in 2021. Despite these increases, the overall impact on EBT was still a net positive due to the substantial decrease in unallocated revenues.\n\nNow, let's consider the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021. According to the text, the acquisition was completed for $1.1 billion, with the assumption or replacement of unvested NUVIA stock awards with Qualcomm stock awards, having an estimated fair value of $258 million [4]. The net assets acquired, as shown in `image4`, amounted to $1,264 million, indicating a significant investment.\n\nComparatively, the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021 ($1,264 million) far outweigh the changes seen in unallocated revenues and expenses, which saw a reduction in revenues and a slight increase in expenses. Thus, the acquisition of NUVIA represents a much larger financial event relative to the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses.\n\nIn summary, the changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 show a significant decrease in revenues and an increase in certain expenses, whereas the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021 represented a large-scale financial investment, dwarfing the changes in unallocated figures.\n\n![The table shows financial data across different regions for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.](image1)\n![The table shows the financial information related to various categories of marketable securities for two reporting periods: September 26, 2021, and September 27, 2020.](image2)\n![The table presents financial data segregated into assets and liabilities across different levels.](image3)\n![The table provides a breakdown of assets and liabilities, likely related to a company or business acquisition.](image4)\n![The table presents financial data categorized by \"Years to Maturity\" as of September 26, 2021.](image5)\n![This table provides financial data across three years (2019, 2020, and 2021) regarding revenues and EBT (Earnings Before Taxes) from nonreportable segments and unallocated revenues and expenses.](image6)\n![The table shows the changes in unrecognized tax benefits over three years: 2019, 2020, and 2021.](image7)\n![The table compares financial data across three years: 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image8)"}

According to the text in [7], in 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 billion, compared to $9.6 billion in the prior year. This increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. The table in `![The table highlights the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, noting percentage changes for each from 2019 to 2020.](image6)` further supports this by showing a 10% increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a 15% increase in free cash flow from $5.587 billion in 2019 to $6.428 billion in 2020.

The table in `![The table shows a breakdown of contractual commitments and liabilities due over several time periods.](image2)` outlines the contractual commitments for PepsiCo, indicating that the total contractual commitments amount to $66,321 million, with the largest portion due in 2026 and beyond.

According to the text quote [1], as of December 31, 2020, the TLAC ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. This indicates that the methodologies used for calculating the RWAs remained consistent with the previous year. However, the actual numbers for RWA under the standardized and advanced approaches can be found in the images.\n\nFrom ![Financial Metrics Comparison](image2), we see the following RWA values:\n- For December 31, 2020:\n  - Standardized Approach: $1,480 billion\n  - Advanced Approach: $1,371 billion\n- For December 31, 2019:\n  - Standardized Approach: $1,493 billion\n  - Advanced Approach: $1,447 billion\n\nThis indicates a slight decrease in RWA for both approaches from 2019 to 2020. Specifically, under the standardized approach, there was a decrease from $1,493 billion to $1,480 billion, and under the advanced approach, there was a decrease from $1,447 billion to $1,371 billion.\n\nNext, let's examine the TLAC ratios. According to the text quote [10], TLAC consists of the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. From ![TLAC Ratios](image8), we can extract the TLAC ratios for both years:\n- For December 31, 2020:\n  - TLAC: 27.4%\n  - Regulatory Minimum Percentage: 22.0%\n- For December 31, 2019:\n  - TLAC: 24.6%\n  - Regulatory Minimum Percentage: 22.0%\n\nThese figures show that the TLAC ratio increased from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020, surpassing the regulatory minimum of 22.0% in both years.\n\nIn conclusion, the risk-weighted assets decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020 under both the standardized and advanced approaches, while the TLAC ratios increased from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020, exceeding the regulatory minimum of 22.0%."}

In 2018, dividends declared and paid were \\$2.63 per share [9], increasing to \\$3.21 per share in 2019 [4], and further to \\$3.72 per share in 2020 [8]. This indicates a steady increase in dividend payouts, which directly affects retained earnings.\n\nAdditionally, stock repurchases played a role in reducing the number of outstanding shares. In 2020, share repurchases of \\$2.6 billion reduced outstanding shares by 1.4 percent [12]. Such activities reduce retained earnings as well.\n\nRegarding net income, the company generated strong cash with free cash flow at 38 percent of revenue in 2020 [12]. The three-year compound annual growth rate for TSR was 19.5 percent, slightly below the median competitor comparison [12]. This suggests a relatively stable net income performance, with a focus on returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThe image quotes also provide insights into financial data organization and trends.

These figures indicate fluctuations in various financial metrics, but without specific labels, it is challenging to determine the exact impact on net income and retained earnings.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's retained earnings decreased due to higher dividend payouts and share repurchases, while net income showed a relatively stable trend with a focus on strong cash generation and shareholder returns.\n\n![The table provides numerical data across three years: 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image3)"}

This is evident from the substantial decrease in interest income across various financial instruments and deposit categories, as seen in the data provided. Specifically, the decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expense, leading to a net decrease in net interest income. For example, interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments saw a decrease of $1,464 million from 2019 to 2020, compared to only a $103 million decrease from 2018 to 2019. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in interest income from time deposits and federal funds, with a net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, contrasting with a net increase of $4,452 million from 2018 to 2019. ![The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.](image2)\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest expense also decreased, but the reduction was less pronounced. For instance, interest-bearing deposits saw a consistent decrease, with total deposits declining by $5,245 million from 2019 to 2020. However, this decrease was still less than the decrease in interest income, contributing to the overall decline in net interest income. The net decrease in interest expense by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020 was significantly smaller compared to the decrease in interest income, leading to a notable downturn in net interest income. ![The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.](image2)\n\n### Reflection on Organizational Structure\nThese changes in net interest income and net interest expense reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, which operates through four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with remaining operations recorded in All Other. The decrease in net interest income can be attributed to the overall economic conditions and lower interest rates, impacting all segments. For instance, the Consumer Banking segment experienced a decrease in net interest income due to lower rates, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances. ![The image displays an organizational chart of the Bank of America Corporation with five main divisions.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the major differences in changes of net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 were primarily driven by lower interest rates and the economic downturn related to COVID-19, affecting all business segments of Bank of America."}

This reduction was primarily attributed to a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a decrease of 44.4%. Despite this, dividend income saw a modest increase from $4,890 million to $5,060 million, or 3.5%, which helped mitigate some of the decline in overall investment income. Additionally, the effective income tax rate also decreased slightly, from 15.3% in 2020 to 14.9% in 2021, indicating a more favorable tax environment for the company's investments. [7]\n\nIn terms of asset composition, there was a notable shift in the balance of various asset types. Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills saw a significant increase from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, indicating a preference for holding more liquid assets. Conversely, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, suggesting a reduction in longer-term fixed-income investments. Meanwhile, equity securities increased from $269,498 million to $334,907 million, a rise of 24.3%, highlighting a growing allocation towards equities. Overall, the total assets grew from $363,117 million to $446,277 million, a substantial increase of 22.9%. [3]\n\nThese changes reflect a strategy focused on maintaining liquidity and safety amidst uncertain economic conditions, particularly given the impact of the pandemic on interest rates and investment returns. The significant increase in cash and cash equivalents suggests a cautious approach to managing risk, while the growth in equity securities points to a willingness to seek higher returns despite increased volatility.\n\n![The table shows a significant increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, along with a decrease in fixed maturity securities and an increase in equity securities.](image3)\n![The table highlights a substantial decline in interest and other investment income, but a modest increase in dividend income, leading to a slight overall decrease in net investment income.](image7)\n\nThe changes in net investment income and asset composition suggest a strategic shift towards more liquid and potentially higher-yielding investments, which could enhance the company's financial flexibility and resilience."}

The upstream operations, which include oil and gas extraction, saw substantial improvements. In 2021, the U.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion, marking a stark contrast from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. This turnaround was driven by higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and higher sales volumes [3].

According to the text, the liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on the company's Consolidated Balance Sheets [9]. Specifically, the balance of uncertain tax positions dropped from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. This reduction can be attributed to a substantial decrease in reductions for tax positions of prior years, which was $249 million in 2020 compared to $41 million in 2019, as shown in the table in `![The balance of uncertain tax positions reduced from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020 due to a significant reduction for tax positions of prior years.](image8)`.\n\nSecondly, concerning fair value assets and liabilities, we can examine the breakdown provided in `![Table showing the allocation of assets and liabilities by levels of valuation inputs.](image3)`.

The medical costs payable at the end of 2019 were $21,690 million, and they increased to $21,872 million by the end of 2020. This indicates a slight increase of $182 million in medical costs payable from 2019 to 2020.\n\nTo summarize, the net carrying value of intangible assets increased by $507 million from 2019 to 2020, and the medical costs payable increased by $182 million during the same period.\n\n![Net carrying values of intangible assets for 2019 and 2020](image7)\n![Medical costs payable for 2019 and 2020](image3)"}

This represents a substantial improvement in profitability. Additionally, the total comprehensive income for 2021 was €2,446 million compared to €825 million in 2020, indicating a marked increase in overall financial performance. The components of other comprehensive income also varied, with remeasurements of defined benefit plans and currency translation differences contributing positively to the comprehensive income in 2021. Specifically, the remeasurements of defined benefit plans went from €-5 million in 2020 to €154 million in 2021, and currency translation differences improved from €-768 million to €724 million.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income comparison between 2020 and 2021](image1)\n\nMoving on to the balance sheet components, image6 provides a detailed comparison of assets, liabilities, and equity. The total assets increased significantly from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021, primarily due to a substantial increase in non-current assets from €14,827 million to €31,338 million. This increase can largely be attributed to the acquisition of Varian, which contributed to the significant rise in goodwill and other intangible assets. The total liabilities also saw a notable increase from €12,583 million to €25,823 million, with both current and non-current liabilities growing substantially. Specifically, non-current liabilities increased from €5,294 million to €15,758 million, reflecting the significant financing activities associated with the Varian acquisition.\n\nFurthermore, the equity attributable to shareholders increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021. This increase was driven by the capital increase in March 2021, which contributed to a rise in subscribed capital and capital reserves. However, this was partially offset by the dividend paid and the acquisition of treasury shares.\n\n![Balance sheet components comparison between 2020 and 2021](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the key differences in the comprehensive income and balance sheet components of Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 include a significant improvement in net income and comprehensive income, a substantial increase in total assets and liabilities due to the acquisition of Varian, and a notable rise in equity attributable to shareholders despite the dividend payments and treasury share acquisitions."}

This significant improvement in net income can be attributed to several factors, including higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, despite lower net interest income [8].\n\nAdditionally, noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating losses, restructuring charges, and professional and outside services expense, partially offset by higher incentive and revenue-related compensation in personnel expense [8].

According to the detailed equity changes table ![Overall, the table provides a comprehensive insight into how the company's equity structure changed over these periods, driven by financial performance, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions.](image5), Chevron paid out cash dividends to shareholders, which reduced the retained earnings component of equity. Additionally, the company had transactions involving treasury stock, which can either increase or decrease equity depending on whether shares were repurchased or reissued. Specifically, the purchase of treasury shares reduces stockholders' equity, while the reissuance of treasury shares increases it. In 2021, the movement in treasury shares and the issuance of common stock affected the overall equity structure.\n\nIn terms of cash flow, the cash dividends paid out by the company are a significant outflow under financing activities. The consolidated cash flow statement ![The table presents consolidated cash flow data for a company over three years, ending December 31 for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image6) indicates that the net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was $23,113 million, which includes the payment of dividends. This large outflow of cash for dividends directly impacts the company's liquidity and overall cash balance.\n\nMoreover, treasury stock transactions can also affect cash flow. When the company repurchases shares, it is a cash outflow, reducing the cash balance, and when it reissues treasury shares, it is a cash inflow. The exact impact on cash flow depends on the specifics of the transactions in 2021, which are detailed in the cash flow statement.\n\nIn conclusion, cash dividends and treasury stock transactions in 2021 resulted in a reduction of retained earnings and fluctuations in stockholders' equity, respectively, and led to significant cash outflows under financing activities, impacting the company's cash balance."}

This approach ensures that executive compensation is closely linked to corporate performance.\n\nThe table in image5 clearly illustrates these relationships. Consolidated operating income is an indicator for evaluating Toyota’s efforts based on business performance, while the volatility of Toyota’s share price acts as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota’s efforts.

Similarly, home equity production in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation decreased by $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020, primarily driven by a decline in applications [6].\n\nMoving to **Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)**, MLGWM revenue decreased by $1.53 billion or 5% primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, but this was partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows [7]. Within GWIM, Bank of America Private Bank revenue decreased by $1.5 billion or 4%, also primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates [12].\n\nNet income for Consumer Lending was $2.3 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion, primarily due to higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined $295 million to $11.0 billion, primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by loan growth [3]. Noninterest income decreased $555 million to $4.9 billion, primarily driven by lower card income due to lower client activity, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results [3].\n\nExamining the financial data provided in the tables, we can see a general decline in net income and revenue figures from 2019 to 2020, with detailed insights into each major aspect of banking operations such as deposits, consumer lending, and total consumer banking. Notably, the total revenue, net of interest expense, for all segments combined dropped from $17,046 million in 2019 to $14,604 million in 2020, indicating a significant decrease in overall profitability ![The table provides financial data related to different banking segments for the years 2020 and 2019, showing a decline in total revenue, net of interest expense, for all segments combined.](image1).\n\nIn summary, both Consumer Banking and Global Wealth & Investment Management experienced a decline in revenue and net income from 2019 to 2020, with the decreases primarily attributed to lower interest rates and reduced client activity. The decline in Consumer Banking was more pronounced due to higher provisions for credit losses and higher expenses, while GWIM saw a smaller reduction influenced by lower interest rates but offset by higher market valuations and positive AUM flows.\n\n![The table shows a decline in net income and revenue figures from 2019 to 2020 for Deposits, Consumer Lending, and Total Consumer Banking, highlighting a general decrease in profitability.](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the financial performance of both Consumer Banking and Global Wealth & Investment Management segments showed a decline in revenue and net income from 2019 to 2020, with Consumer Banking experiencing a more significant decrease."}

Changes in these assumptions can significantly impact the financial health of pension plans. According to the text, Siemens Healthineers measures entitlements from defined benefit plans using the projected unit credit method, where the obligation reflects an actuarially calculated present value of future benefits. This calculation relies on key assumptions such as discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression rates [3].\n\nDiscount rates are derived from yields on high-quality corporate bonds, with individual spot rates from a full yield curve approach typically applied for significant plans. These rates affect the present value of future benefit obligations [3]. The discount rates for different currencies increased slightly from 2020 to 2021, as seen in the table in image2, which shows the discount rate rising from 1.5% to 1.7% for the euro, and similarly for other currencies.\n\nThe sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions is demonstrated in image7. For instance, a half-percentage-point decrease in the discount rate leads to a substantial increase in the defined benefit obligation: from -227 million euros in 2020 to -242 million euros in 2021. Similarly, changes in compensation increases and pension progression rates also affect the defined benefit obligation [7].\n\nIn terms of plan assets, the composition and valuation of these assets can be seen in image6. Total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021, reflecting growth in equity securities, fixed income securities, alternative investments, multi-strategy funds, and derivatives. These changes in asset values can offset or exacerbate the impacts of changes in actuarial assumptions on the funded status of the pension plans [12].\n\nOverall, the changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly the discount rate, had a notable impact on the defined benefit obligation from 2020 to 2021, leading to a higher obligation. Meanwhile, the increase in plan assets helped to partially offset this effect.\n\n![The table shows actuarial gains and losses in millions of euros for fiscal years 2021 and 2020](image4)\n![The table provides data on compensation increases and pension progression rates for two different years, 2021 and 2020](image3)\n![The table displays financial data in millions of euros as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020](image6)\n![The table shows the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage point in three categories: Discount rate, Compensation increase, and Pension progression](image7)\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions, especially discount rates, led to a higher defined benefit obligation in 2021 compared to 2020, while plan assets also increased over the same period."}

According to the financial data provided, the net interest income (NII) for 2020 was $27.6 billion, a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared with 2019 [9]. This decrease was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across the major currencies compared with 2019. However, this decline was partly offset by interest income associated with the increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) of $170.1 billion or 8.8% [9].\n\nSimilarly, the interest income for 2020 of $41.8 billion decreased by $12.9 billion or 24%, primarily due to the lower average interest rates compared with 2019, as the yield on AIEA fell by 84bps [4]. The interest expense of $14.178 billion in 2020 was down $2.9 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts [11].\n\nThese changes in net interest income and interest expense contributed to a decrease in the net operating income before credit provisions. The decrease in reported profit before tax of £8.8 billion decreased by 34%, while adjusted profit before tax of £12.1 billion decreased by 45%. The fall in reported profit was due to an increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL) and a reduction in reported revenue. These factors were partly mitigated by lower reported operating expenses [1].\n\nOverall, the decrease in net interest income and interest expense had a notable impact on the organization's profitability. The return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was 3.1%, and given the significant changes in the operating environment during 2020, the organization no longer expects to reach its RoTE target of between 10% and 12% in 2022, as originally planned [1].\n\n![Key financial data showing interest income, interest expense, net interest income, and average interest-earning assets for 2018, 2019, and 2020, measured in millions of dollars ($m) and percentages (%).](image1)\n\nThe changes in net interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a decrease in the net operating income and overall profitability of the organization."}

According to the data, the operating lease Right of Use (ROU) assets increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020, reflecting a significant rise in the company's lease commitments. Similarly, the total operating lease liabilities rose from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020. This increase indicates that the company has taken on more leasing obligations, likely to support its growing operations and asset base. Additionally, the total operating lease payments for 2020 were $1,080 million, compared to $901 million in 2019, further supporting this trend. These changes are evident in the financial statements as an increase in both assets and liabilities related to operating leases. ![The table shows an increase in lease assets and liabilities from 2019 to 2020, reflecting more leasing obligations.](image4)\n\nNext, considering the inventory data, the total inventory value grew from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. Specifically, finished goods increased from $833 million to $1,232 million, work in process from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials from $510 million to $691 million. This substantial rise in inventory suggests that the company has ramped up production and procurement activities, possibly to meet higher demand or prepare for future sales. The increase in inventory levels would be reflected in the balance sheet as a higher current asset value. ![Inventory levels increased across all categories from 2019 to 2020, indicating higher production and procurement activities.](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the company's lease assets and inventories both saw significant increases from 2019 to 2020, reflecting expansion in operational scale and asset investment.

According to the report, fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to substantial changes in financial outcomes. For instance, a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and US$1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of US$163 million and US$24 million, respectively [4]. This volatility is evident in the coal sector, where Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, primarily due to lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$0.7 billion [2].\n\nThe decrease in Underlying EBITDA for Coal is further exacerbated by lower volumes, which decreased EBITDA by an additional US$168 million. Moreover, controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and higher stripping volumes, although cost reduction initiatives helped mitigate some of these increases [2]. Moving forward, Queensland Coal unit costs are expected to range between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by anticipated higher diesel prices, despite efforts to optimize mine plans and improve efficiency [3].\n\nIn contrast, the nickel sector experienced a different trajectory. Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following major quadrennial shutdowns in the previous year [9]. However, this growth was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements and increased costs associated with third-party concentrate purchases [9].\n\nOverall, the key drivers behind these impacts are the market prices of commodities, operational efficiencies, and cost management. Changes in commodity prices directly affect revenue and profitability, while operational challenges and cost structures play a crucial role in determining the overall financial performance. ![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA.](image5)\n\nTo summarize, changes in commodity prices significantly impact BHP's financial results, with coal and nickel experiencing distinct trends driven by market prices, operational costs, and volume changes."}

As noted in [1], the issued capital as of September 30, 2021, was €1,128,000,000, which is divided into 1,128,000,000 ordinary registered shares with no-par value. This reflects the issuance of new shares in March 2021, increasing the issued capital by €53,000,000 [12].\n\nMoreover, the capital reserves also saw a substantial rise, largely driven by the capital increase in March 2021. According to [7], the capital reserves increased by €2,284 million, contributing to the overall increase in equity. This increase is further corroborated by the information in [8], where the capital reserve rose by €2,275 million, including effects from transaction costs and taxes.\n\nAdditionally, the retained earnings component also contributed to the equity growth. The net income for the fiscal year 2021 was €1,746 million, as seen in the comprehensive income data provided in `![The table displays comprehensive income data for two fiscal years, 2021 and 2020, in millions of euros (€).

Despite this reduction, the overall unappropriated net income still increased by €497 million, indicating a positive contribution to equity.\n\nFurthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares played a role in the equity changes. By September 30, 2021, Siemens Healthineers AG held 5,328,965 treasury shares, an increase from 898,249 treasury shares held the previous year [7].

The average discount rate was 2.30 percent in 2021 compared to 2.28 percent in 2020 [1].

For instance, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.54 billion to $5.94 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was largely due to the rise in net income, decreased net operating assets and liabilities, and repayment of convertible senior notes [11].\n\nAdditionally, cash flows from financing activities contributed significantly to the increase in cash and cash equivalents.

According to text quote [2], the assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. This translation adjustment is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are also reported in the same manner as translation adjustments [2].\n\nMoreover, text quote [5] states that for designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2020, it was anticipated that approximately $62 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months [5].\n\nFor the changes in property and equipment values, text quote [10] mentions that for a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized [10].\n\nThe image quotes provide specific financial data that illustrate these changes over the fiscal years 2019 and 2020. `![The table displays financial data related to accumulated other comprehensive loss over the fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

This issuance significantly contributed to the company's total stockholders' equity.\n\nSecondly, the balance sheet in image2 shows the stockholders' equity section for the years ending December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. Specifically, the preferred stock increased from $1,600 million in 2019 to $3,268 million in 2020, reflecting the issuance of the MCPS Series B in 2020. This substantial increase in preferred stock directly contributed to the overall rise in total stockholders' equity, which grew from $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the table in image6 outlines the changes in preferred stock, common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) over the years from 2018 to 2020.

This increase can be attributed to several key factors. First, the company experienced an overall improvement in its operating income, rising from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021 [6]. Additionally, the decrease in payments of income taxes from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021 contributed positively to the cash flow, partly due to tax deductions resulting from the senior notes exchange [4].\n\nFurthermore, the company saw an increase in proceeds from investments and other sources, which rose from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021 [3]. This increase in cash inflows from investments also supported the growth in net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nMoreover, changes in operating assets and liabilities had a smaller negative impact in 2021, reducing from a decrease of $178 million in 2020 to $1,499 million in 2021, indicating better management of working capital [9].\n\nFinally, the decrease in payments of interest from $3,878 million in 2020 to $3,908 million in 2021, despite the overall reduction in debt, also contributed to the positive change in cash flow from operations.\n\nOverall, these factors collectively led to a substantial increase in the net cash provided by operating activities from 2020 to 2021.\n\n![The table provides financial data for a company over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, showing an increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2020 to 2021](image6)"}

This improvement can be attributed to several key financial activities. For instance, the U.S. upstream segment reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020, largely due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion [1].

According to the provided table, 21,746 females and 98,347 males are entitled to parental leave [5]. However, the usage of this leave shows a stark contrast: only 1,025 females and 2,023 males have actually availed themselves of the parental leave [5]. Furthermore, when it comes to return rates after availing parental leave, 967 females (94%) and 1,941 males (96%) returned to work, indicating a slightly higher return rate for males [5].\n\nThis data reflects on the gender diversity policies in the workplace, particularly regarding the balance between professional and personal life. Despite the high return rates, the lower number of females availing parental leave compared to males might suggest that women face additional barriers or pressures that deter them from taking full advantage of these policies. The bank's commitment to diversity and inclusion is evident in initiatives aimed at supporting women's careers, such as the 'Careers 2.0' program, which has successfully onboarded 33 women professionals who had taken a break due to family/personal reasons [5].\n\nAdditionally, the bank has introduced policies and processes to enable women employees to manage professional and personal commitments, such as offering flexible work hours and part-time work arrangements [5]. These measures aim to address the challenges faced by women and promote a more equitable work environment.\n\n![The image shows a group of four individuals, likely in a professional setting, gathered around a desk with a laptop, suggesting a collaborative work environment.](image1)\n\nDespite these efforts, the differences in parental leave usage highlight ongoing challenges in achieving true gender equality.

This increase indicates improved operational efficiency and cash generation capabilities.\n\nIn contrast, the net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly from $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020, largely due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and a decline in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [9]. This suggests a more conservative approach to investment spending and a winding down of certain financing operations.\n\nHowever, financing activities saw a notable change, shifting from a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of cash of $(9,721) million in 2020. This reversal was driven by several factors, including payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals, increases in workforce rebalancing payments, and higher cash payments for income taxes [1][2].\n\nOverall, these changes resulted in a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $5,361 million in 2020, compared to a net decrease of $(3,290) million in 2019, as shown in the same table ![Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash](image1).

Similarly, comprehensive income attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders rose from $10,469 million in 2018 to $15,167 million in 2020. This growth can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the company experienced an increase in premiums and other revenue streams, which contributed to higher earnings. As noted in the financial statements, premiums increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020, indicating robust growth in core business areas. Additionally, the cost of products sold and operating costs grew but at a slower pace compared to revenue increases, thereby improving margins and overall profitability.\n\nMoreover, the financial statements highlight that the company made strategic investments and acquisitions that enhanced its operational efficiency and market presence. For instance, the expansion in risk-based care delivery led to organic growth and increased earnings at OptumHealth, serving approximately 98 million people as of December 31, 2020, up from 96 million in 2019.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor.

One significant factor was the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which was imposed in 2018 and 2020 but not in 2019 due to a moratorium [2][11]. The tax contributed $552 million in 2018 and $626 million in 2020 [7], leading to higher tax provisions in these years.\n\nAnother notable component is the excess tax benefit from share-based awards, which reduced the tax provision in 2018, 2019, and 2020 by $161 million, $132 million, and $130 million, respectively [7]. Despite this reduction, the overall tax provision still increased due to other factors.\n\nFinally, we can observe that the foreign rate differential also played a role in reducing the tax provision, though the effect was smaller in 2020 compared to previous years [7].\n\nOverall, the increase in the provision for income taxes from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to the reinstatement of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2020 and other underlying factors such as changes in state income taxes and foreign rate differentials.\n\n`![This table displays financial data related to income taxes over three years (2020, 2019, and 2018).](image7)`\n\nIn conclusion, the provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020."}

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $10,865 million, which grew to $14,821 million in 2019, and further increased to $15,533 million in 2020. This growth can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the earnings from operations increased significantly over this period, contributing positively to the comprehensive income. According to the text, earnings from operations increased by 14% in 2020, with United Healthcare seeing a 20% increase and Optum a 7% increase [1]. This trend is also reflected in the financial data shown in the tables, where the earnings from operations grew from $17,344 million in 2018 to $22,405 million in 2020 ![The table shows financial data for UnitedHealth Group from 2018 to 2020, highlighting the growth in earnings from operations](image5).\n\nSecondly, the company experienced growth in various revenue streams, including premiums, products, and services. For instance, premiums increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020, while services revenue rose from $17,183 million to $20,016 million during the same period ![The table shows financial data for UnitedHealth Group from 2018 to 2020, indicating significant growth in revenue streams](image5).\n\nThirdly, the company's ability to manage costs effectively also played a role. Despite the growth in revenue, the cost of medical services increased at a slower pace, leading to higher margins. For example, medical costs increased from $145,403 million in 2018 to $159,396 million in 2020, but the growth was lower compared to the increase in premiums ![The table shows financial data for UnitedHealth Group from 2018 to 2020, demonstrating controlled medical cost growth](image5).\n\nMoreover, the company’s investment and other income, although fluctuating, remained positive, contributing to the overall comprehensive income. Investment and other income was $1,376 million in 2018, $1,886 million in 2019, and $1,502 million in 2020 ![The table shows financial data for UnitedHealth Group from 2018 to 2020, reflecting investment and other income contributions](image5).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the company faced some challenges, particularly in 2020, with the impact of the pandemic reducing care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements, which partially offset the increases in revenues and earnings ![Revenue and earnings at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery, but reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements partially offset these increases](image12).\n\nIn conclusion, UnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income grew from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020, driven by increased earnings from operations, robust revenue growth across multiple streams, effective cost management, and positive investment income, despite challenges posed by the pandemic."}

This represents an increase of approximately $945 million.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this change. In 2020, the company issued multiple principal amounts of fixed-rate, long-term debt, which added to the total debt. Specifically, in March 2020, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025, and in May 2020, another $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030 [9][7]. These issuances were used for general corporate purposes and the repayment of maturing debt [9].\n\nMoreover, the company had already issued significant amounts of long-term debt in previous years. For instance, in March 2019, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039, and in September 2019, another $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2029 [5][10]. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2018, the company issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2048 [3].\n\nDespite these increases, the company also retired some maturing debt. In 2020, the company retired $500 million of maturing debt, which helped offset the overall increase in long-term debt [12].\n\nIn conclusion, the long-term debt increased from $5,303 million in 2019 to $6,248 million in 2020 primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in 2020, despite retiring some maturing debt."}

This improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including a strategic investment approach and a significant increase in the U.S. discount rates, which led to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and a 2 percentage point increase in the funded status for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan.[4]\n\nFor the International segment, the funded status showed a slight improvement from a deficit of $(765) million in 2017 to $(795) million in 2018. Despite a minor increase in the deficit, the overall funded status remained relatively stable, with the international pension plans being 89 percent funded at year-end 2018.[4]\n\nFor the Benefits segment, there was a slight reduction in the deficit, moving from $(1,013) million in 2017 to $(915) million in 2018. This improvement indicates a positive trend in managing the postretirement benefits obligations.\n\nOverall, the funded status improvements in the United States and Benefits segments contrast with the slight increase in the deficit for the International segment, highlighting the varying financial dynamics across different regions.\n\n![This table details the change in benefit obligations and plan assets for the United States, International, and Benefits for the years 2018 and 2017](image8)\n\nIn summary, the funded status at the end of the year for the United States improved from $(1,674) million in 2017 to $(1,145) million in 2018, for International it worsened slightly from $(765) million in 2017 to $(795) million in 2018, and for Benefits it improved from $(1,013) million in 2017 to $(915) million in 2018."}

According to the data provided, net interest income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020. Specifically, it dropped from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021 [3][5][image3]. This decline was largely due to lower loan balances driven by weak demand and the lower interest rate environment, partially offset by higher income from higher deposit balances [4][5].\n\nRegarding total loans, there was a significant decrease from 2020 to 2021. As shown in the table, total loans (average) decreased from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021, representing a 14% decline [image1].

As seen in the shareholders' equity table, the company experienced a decrease in total shareholders' equity from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021. This decline is largely attributed to a reduction in retained earnings, which fell from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021. Additionally, the table highlights that the company saw a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021. These reductions in retained earnings and other comprehensive income suggest a weakening in the company's overall financial health, as they represent lower retained profits and adverse impacts from foreign currency translation and pension obligations. ![The table provides financial details related to Shareholders’ Equity, showing a decrease in total shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021.](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the comprehensive income data illustrates that the company's net income for 2021 was $8,060 million, a significant improvement from $3,135 million in 2020.

Despite the increase in net income, the company still experienced a net decrease in comprehensive income from $2,977 million in 2020 to $8,010 million in 2021.

According to the information provided in the text and images, the deferred tax assets decreased slightly from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022. This reduction is primarily due to decreases in the deferred tax assets related to pension and other retiree benefits, as well as loss and other carryforwards. Specifically, the pension and other retiree benefits decreased from $1,476 million in 2021 to $740 million in 2022, and the loss and other carryforwards decreased from $1,030 million to $914 million over the same period.

This increase can be attributed to growth in several categories, particularly goodwill and intangible assets, which rose from $5,761 million in 2021 to $5,783 million in 2022, and other retiree benefits, which increased from $645 million to $1,031 million. The overall increase in deferred tax liabilities is reflective of the company's ongoing investments and operations, which have resulted in higher future tax obligations.\n\nThese changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities impact the financial position of the company by affecting the net deferred tax position, which in turn influences the company's tax expense and financial statements. Specifically, the net deferred tax liability (deferred tax liabilities minus deferred tax assets) increased from $3,939 million in 2021 to $5,197 million in 2022, indicating a higher future tax obligation.

Specifically, half (50%) of women in STEM jobs have experienced any of eight forms of discrimination in the workplace because of their gender, compared to just 19% of men in STEM occupations [2][10]. The most common forms of discrimination include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders than a man doing the same job (18%) [8].\n\nMoreover, women in computer jobs are particularly vulnerable, with 74% reporting they have experienced discrimination, which is significantly higher than the overall rate of 50% for women in STEM jobs [6]. These women are especially likely to report pay inequities (46%) and being treated as if they were not competent (40%) [6].\n\nAdditionally, women in STEM jobs who work in male-dominated workplaces, those with advanced degrees, and those working in computer jobs are more likely to have concerns about gender equity and to have experienced gender discrimination [1][4][9]. For instance, 78% of women in workplaces where men outnumber women have experienced gender-related discrimination, compared to only 44% of women in workplaces with more women or an even gender mix [image3].\n\nIn conclusion, women in STEM jobs experience significantly more gender discrimination compared to men in the same field."}

Foreign-born Hispanics are more likely to often self-identify as Hispanic compared to subsequent generations. Specifically, 57% of foreign-born individuals often self-identify as Hispanic, whereas this drops to 50% for second-generation and 33% for third or higher generation individuals. This trend aligns with the notion that closer proximity to immigrant roots correlates with stronger Hispanic self-identification [1].\n\nMoreover, the preference for self-identification terms also changes across generations. While 50% of self-identified Hispanics prefer to use their country of origin or heritage, this preference shifts towards identifying as \"American\" or \"Hispanic/Latino\" as generations progress [2]. This shift underscores the evolving nature of cultural identity and assimilation patterns among later generations.\n\nIn contrast, self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry show a markedly different pattern. Only 15% of these individuals often self-identify as Hispanic, with a majority (53%) never identifying as such [3]. This indicates that as generations move further away from immigrant roots, the likelihood of maintaining a Hispanic identity diminishes significantly.\n\nThe data from the bar charts further reinforces these observations. For instance, the prevalence of Hispanic identification among younger individuals decreases as we move from foreign-born to third or higher generation categories [4]. Additionally, the percentage of individuals who do not speak Spanish or have a Spanish last name increases dramatically from the foreign-born to the third or higher generation, highlighting the diminishing influence of Spanish language and surnames as markers of Hispanic identity over time [5].\n\nTo conclude, the generational breakdown of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics reveals a clear trend where closer proximity to immigrant roots correlates with stronger Hispanic self-identification, while further generations exhibit a decreased tendency to maintain a Hispanic identity."}

Initially, the population grew rapidly from just 130 in 1870 to a peak of 14,096 in 1890. This growth was driven by the influx of settlers attracted by opportunities in agriculture and the expansion of railroads, which facilitated easier access to the area. The Homestead Act of 1862, which provided 160 acres of land to settlers who could establish residency, played a crucial role in this surge. However, the population began to decline gradually after 1890, reaching 9,403 by 2000.\n\nThe dramatic increase in population during the late 1800s is evident from the data shown in ![Hamilton County Population Data](image2). The county saw a substantial rise from 130 in 1870 to 8,267 in 1880, further increasing to 14,096 in 1890. After peaking in 1890, the population fluctuated but generally declined until 1950, with a slight rebound thereafter. This pattern reflects the broader trends of rural depopulation and urbanization that occurred across the Midwest and Great Plains.\n\nAs the population surged, numerous rural school districts were established to meet the educational needs of the growing population. Each district represented a small geographical area, and by 1885, Hamilton County had ninety-eight organized districts [1]. Over time, however, these districts consolidated, leading to the closure of many rural schools.\n\nAnother factor influencing population trends was the consolidation of farms, which began in earnest in the early 20th century. Mechanization and increased operational costs led to fewer but larger farms, reducing the need for a dispersed rural population [6]. The number of farms in Hamilton County peaked in 1900 and steadily declined, with the average farm size increasing significantly. This trend is illustrated by the data in ![Number of Farms in Hamilton County](image8).\n\nReligious institutions also played a significant role in shaping the demographic landscape. Ethnic groups, such as Danes, Swedes, Germans, and others, settled in clusters and established churches that served as focal points for their communities. For instance, the Danish Lutheran Church in Kronborg maintained strong ties to Danish heritage and continues to serve the community [12]. Similarly, the Zion Lutheran Church in northeastern Hamilton County has been a central institution for the German settlement [4].\n\nOverall, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000, reflect a period of rapid growth followed by a gradual decline, influenced by the expansion of railroads, the Homestead Act, agricultural consolidation, and shifting economic conditions.\n\nThe population of Hamilton County, Nebraska, peaked in 1890 and has seen a general decline since then, with minor fluctuations, until reaching 9,403 by 2000."}

As the generations progress, there's a noticeable shift towards identifying as white, increasing from 11% for foreign-born to 25% for third or higher generation Hispanics. This trend aligns with the textual evidence suggesting that the closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the more likely they are to identify as Hispanic [1].\n\nFurthermore, the data in the chart shows a decrease in the proportion of individuals identifying as Hispanic or Latino as we move from foreign-born (78%) to second-generation (66%), and then to third or higher generation (46%) [1].

However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains can be either quite small or very large, as seen in GL which achieves a gain of up to 11 BLEU points [2].\n\nLooking at the data in Table 5, we can see that the BLEU scores for GL/PT show the largest gains when pre-trained embeddings are used, whereas BE/RU shows a small decrease [10].

Recursive retrieval is particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the initial query might not be fully defined or the information sought is highly specialized. ![Recursive retrieval refines the user query and divides problems into sub-problems.](image2)\n\n3. **Adaptive Retrieval** enables the RAG system to decide autonomously when external knowledge retrieval is needed and when to stop the retrieval and generation process.

However, when repetition control is introduced, as depicted by the purple line with squares, the question-asking rate reaches a lower maximum percentage near 80%.

This encoder transforms the user's utterance into a continuous vector representation, capturing the meaning and context of the input comprehensively. As described in the text [8], the user utterance vector is generated by concatenating the last forward and backward LSTM states, thus providing a robust encoding of the user's input at turn \\( k \\).\n\nThe Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder ensures that the system can effectively understand and interpret the user's input, enabling subsequent components of the dialogue system to operate efficiently. For instance, the dialogue-level LSTM uses this encoding, alongside the previous system action, to maintain and update the dialogue state, which is essential for tracking the user's goals and managing the conversation flow.\n\nTo illustrate this process, consider the example provided in `![The Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder processes the user input and generates a continuous vector representation that is used for further dialogue state updates.](image1)`. Here, the user input \"Movie for the day after tomorrow, please\" is encoded into a vector by the Bi-LSTM, which then contributes to updating the dialogue state.\n\nIn conclusion, the function of the Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder in the system architecture is to convert the user's natural language input into a continuous vector representation that can be utilized by other components of the dialogue system for effective dialogue management."}

Depending on the nature of the problem, different methods like Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, or Constraint Optimization are employed. For example, a deductive reasoning problem might use a logic programming engine like Pyke, while a first-order logic problem would utilize a first-order logic prover such as Prover9 (refer to `![The table presents an overview of different problem types and their corresponding formulations](image6)`).\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** module translates the symbolic answer back into natural language to provide a comprehensible response to the original problem.

The following year, 2014, saw the incorporation of word embeddings, exemplified by the use of \"word2vec,\" which significantly enhanced the modeling of semantic shifts [10].\n\nIn 2015, the field progressed with the development of \"Models alignment,\" allowing for more precise comparisons between word vectors across different time periods [3]. The year 2016 marked significant strides with the analysis of diachronic data using the New York Times (NYT) corpus and the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), demonstrating the robustness of computational methods in detecting subtle semantic shifts [8].\n\nBy 2017, the field had gained deeper insights into the \"Laws of semantic change,\" indicating statistical regularities in how word meanings evolve.

Image1 provides a detailed illustration of the Dataset Maps for the CIFAR-10-LT dataset, which includes sections for overall distribution, data map by ground truth, and data map by pseudo-labels. While it primarily focuses on CIFAR-10-LT, the principles discussed are applicable to PathMNIST as well.\n\nIn the data map by ground truth (part (b) of Image1), data points are stratified based on their confidence and variability, where easy-to-learn data points have high confidence and low variability, and hard-to-learn data points have low confidence and high variability. This method requires manual annotations and can lead to poor label diversity.\n\nOn the other hand, the data map by pseudo-labels (part (c) of Image1) identifies easy-to-contrast and hard-to-contrast data based on the model's understanding. Easy-to-contrast data have higher confidence and lower variability, while hard-to-contrast data have medium confidence and higher variability. This strategy is label-free and offers a more diverse selection of data points, alleviating the cold start problem.\n\nNow, turning specifically to PathMNIST, Image6 provides a detailed overview of the PathMNIST dataset, including its overall distribution, data map by ground truth, and data map by pseudo-labels. In the data map by ground truth (part (b) of Image6), the scatter plot shows data categorized by different classes, with easy-to-learn and hard-to-learn samples marked.

Conversely, the data map by pseudo-labels, relying on the model's understanding, typically exhibits a more consistent distribution of confidence, leading to less variance.\n\nTherefore, the map by ground truth has a larger confidence variance compared to the map by pseudo-labels.\n\n![Data map by ground truth showing confidence and variability](image6)\n![Data map by pseudo-labels showing confidence and variability](image6)\n\nThe map by ground truth has a larger confidence variance compared to the map by pseudo-labels."}

Another significant museum is the Old Bergen Museum, which reconstructs the city as it was in the 19th and 20th centuries, featuring around 50 original wooden buildings that once stood in the city center, along with a beautiful English-style park and a seawater pool [5].\n\nHaakon’s Hall, a 13th-century royal banqueting hall, stands out as a remarkable historical site. As the first stone-built hall of its kind, it was the largest and most imposing building of the royal residency in Bergen and is now a living national cultural heritage site [6]. Nearby, the Salhus Tricotage Factory, dating from 1859, provides insight into the textile industry in Western Norway, showing visitors how wool is turned into clothes [7]. The Arne Fabrikker museum in Ytre Arna tells the story of the region's industrialization, which began in 1846, and includes a visit to the Oleana textile factory [9].\n\nThe image of traditional Nordic-style wooden houses with grass roofs (image2) illustrates the type of architectural heritage that can be explored in these museums, particularly at sites like the Old Bergen Museum. Such buildings with grass roofs are a traditional feature in Scandinavian countries, highlighting the cultural significance of these structures.\n\nIn conclusion, the museums in Bergen associated with historical or cultural heritage include the oldest Latin School, Old Bergen Museum, Haakon’s Hall, Salhus Tricotage Factory, and Arne Fabrikker, each offering unique insights into different aspects of Norway's past and cultural traditions."}

When these gametes combine during fertilization, all F₁ offspring inherit one P and one p allele, resulting in heterozygous plants (Pp) that all express the dominant purple phenotype due to the presence of the P allele. ![The image illustrates a genetic cross diagram, showcasing the inheritance of traits in plants.](image1)\n\nWhen the F₁ hybrids are crossed, the F₂ generation exhibits a 3:1 phenotypic ratio because each F₁ plant produces gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. This leads to four possible combinations in the F₂ generation: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp. Since both PP and Pp express the dominant purple phenotype, while pp expresses the recessive white phenotype, the phenotypic ratio becomes 3 purple to 1 white. The genotypic ratio is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. ![This image illustrates Mendelian inheritance.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of segregation and independent assortment of alleles."}

In this scenario, the parental generation consists of homozygous plants, one with purple flowers (PP) and the other with white flowers (pp). When these plants are crossed, all offspring in the F1 generation are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype [3].\n\nMoving to the F2 generation, the heterozygous F1 plants (Pp) are self-crossed. This results in a variety of genotypes among the offspring. Specifically, the possible genotypes in the F2 generation are PP (homozygous dominant), Pp (heterozygous), and pp (homozygous recessive). The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is therefore 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp [3].\n\nPhenotypically, the F2 generation will show a ratio of 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower, as the dominant purple allele (P) will mask the presence of the recessive white allele (p) in the heterozygous (Pp) and homozygous dominant (PP) genotypes. Only the homozygous recessive (pp) genotype will express the white flower phenotype.\n\n![Illustration of a genetic cross diagram, showcasing the inheritance of traits in plants](image3)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1 (purple:white), and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (PP:Pp:pp)."}

According to the diagram in ![The diagram illustrates various strategies for needs exploration, including active stakeholder participation, high-level requirements specification, split testing, detailed requirements specification, and acceptance test-driven development.](image2), these strategies include active stakeholder participation, high-level requirements specification, split (A/B) testing, detailed requirements specification, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). This phase ensures that the team has a comprehensive understanding of the stakeholders' needs and expectations, which can significantly influence the solution's success.\n\nIn contrast, 'Elicitation Methods' focus on the techniques used to gather these needs. As depicted in ![The mind map outlines various strategies for managing work items, prioritizing, accepting changes, interacting with stakeholders, and eliciting requirements through methods like just-in-time model storming and look-ahead modeling.](image4), these methods include just-in-time (JIT) model storming and look-ahead modeling. These methods allow for flexibility and adaptability, ensuring that the team can quickly respond to changes and evolving needs without getting bogged down in extensive documentation or planning.\n\nBoth phases are interconnected and essential for effective agile management. By combining these strategies, teams can ensure they are not only capturing but also adapting to the dynamic requirements of their stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' are complementary strategies that together help address stakeholder requirements effectively in agile management."}

These barriers remained relatively consistent or slightly increased over the two-year period. For instance, the lack of financial support rose from 18% in 2005 to 20% in 2006, and the vendors' inability to deliver products increased from 12% to 18%. These findings suggest that despite the gradual adoption of IT systems, persistent financial and operational challenges continue to impede progress. ![Barriers to Implementing IT](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the top security concerns in healthcare IT, as shown in another survey, highlight the need for robust security measures. Internal breach of security was the primary concern, decreasing slightly from 56% in 2005 to 51% in 2006, while external breaches also decreased from 25% to 12%. HIPAA compliance, a critical regulatory requirement, saw a substantial drop from 35% to 18%. These trends indicate that while security remains a significant issue, there is a growing awareness and potential improvement in addressing these concerns. ![Security Concerns in Healthcare IT](image4)\n\nOverall, the trends in healthcare IT adoption from 2005 to 2006 show a slow but steady increase, with persistent challenges in financial support and vendor capabilities. Meanwhile, security concerns, particularly internal breaches, remain a key focus, suggesting ongoing efforts to enhance IT security measures.\n\n**Direct Answer:** The adoption of healthcare IT applications from 2005 to 2006 showed a gradual increase, with persistent barriers such as lack of financial support and staffing resources, alongside significant security concerns like internal breaches."}

Similarly, HIPAA compliance saw a significant drop from 35% to 18%, and external breach of security fell from 25% to 12%.\n\nLooking ahead, certain security measures are expected to see changes in their implementation rates. According to `![The image is a bar graph comparing the implementation of various security measures today versus the next two years.](image4)`, firewalls, which are currently implemented by 98% of organizations, are expected to drop to 53% in two years. User access controls, currently at 88%, will similarly decrease to 53%. However, disaster recovery is expected to rise from 68% to 74% in two years, indicating a growing focus on ensuring business continuity.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceived barriers to IT implementation and security concerns in healthcare organizations have shifted from 2005 to 2006, with some barriers decreasing while others have increased. Furthermore, specific security measures like firewalls and user access controls are expected to decline in implementation, while disaster recovery is anticipated to increase."}
