For the first time, a majority (52%) stated the government is doing \"not too well\" or \"not at all well,\" while 46% rated its performance as \"very\" or \"fairly well\" [2].\n![The table shows overall ratings of government performance on terrorism (46% very/fairly well, 52% not too/not at all well) and breakdowns by age, education, and political affiliation.](image7)\n\nThese perceptions vary notably by political affiliation. Assessments of government efforts have become more negative across the political spectrum [3]. While Democrats are the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) still said the government was doing at least fairly well by late 2015, this was a significant drop from 85% in January of that year. Positive ratings among Independents fell from 69% to 44%, and among Republicans, they plummeted from 63% to just 27% [3]. Conservative Republicans, in particular, showed a sharp turn, with only 18% saying the government was doing very or fairly well by late 2015, down from 59% in January [11]. Reflecting this dissatisfaction, both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, though this shift is more pronounced among Republicans (71% say not far enough) [7]. A narrower majority of Democrats (54%) also now express this concern [5].\n![Concern that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough increased for Republicans (red line, to 71% in 2015), Democrats (blue line, to 54%), and Independents (beige line, to 49%) by 2015.](image2)\n\nAge also plays a significant role in these perceptions.

A majority of those aged 50 and older (57%) stated the government was not doing well in these efforts, whereas younger adults aged 18-29 were more positive, with 53% saying the government was doing very or fairly well [6]. These differing evaluations align with their primary concerns: older individuals are more likely to believe that government policies have not gone far enough to protect the country. For instance, 71% of those aged 65 and older and 60% of those aged 50-64 feel policies have not gone far enough. In contrast, younger adults aged 18-29 are more divided, with 43% saying policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties and 44% saying they have not gone far enough to protect the U.S.\n![The table shows that in 2015, a higher percentage of older individuals (e.g., 71% of those 65+) felt anti-terror policies had not gone far enough to protect the U.S., while younger individuals (43% of 18-29) were more likely to feel policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties.](image8)\n\nOverall, public perception has shifted towards greater concern that anti-terrorism measures are insufficient, with declining confidence in government performance, and these views differ significantly by political affiliation and age, with Republicans and older Americans being more critical of government efforts and more concerned about the adequacy of protection."}

For instance, a majority of those aged 50 and older (57%) believe the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat, whereas a smaller percentage of younger adults aged 18-29 (46%) share this negative assessment [4]. This demographic difference is further highlighted in broader survey data. `![A table indicates older individuals (50+) are more likely to rate government anti-terrorism efforts negatively compared to younger adults (18-29).](image7)` When considering the balance between security and civil liberties, adults under 30 are somewhat divided, with 43% concerned that U.S. policies overly restrict civil liberties and 44% worried that these policies do not go far enough to protect the country [9].

In contrast, Democrats are more divided; over half believe the U.S. should assist other countries with their problems [3].

Approximately three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical of the U.S. response, whereas a similar proportion of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise the nation's efforts [11].

There was a notable difference in how Republicans and Democrats voted in the 2020 presidential election, with 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters saying they voted absentee or by mail, compared to 34% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters [7].\n![A bar chart illustrates voting patterns in the 2020 election, showing that 52% of Republican/Lean Republican voters who voted absentee favored no-excuse absentee voting, compared to 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day.](image7)\nConservative Republicans are more likely to insist on documented reasons for absentee or early voting (70%) compared to moderate/liberal Republicans (49%) [10].\n\nWhen it comes to redistricting, about half of all adults (49%) approve of a proposal to have commissions with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans draw congressional district maps instead of state legislatures [1, 8, 9].\n![A bar chart shows that 49% of total respondents approve of independent redistricting commissions, with 59% of Democrats/Lean Democrats approving and 38% of Republicans/Lean Republicans approving.](image3)\nDemocrats are more likely to favor this proposal, with 59% approving, compared to 38% of Republicans [1, image3].

A somewhat higher share of men than women in STEM say that having higher pay and opportunities for promotion is important to them [11].\n![A bar chart comparing job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM shows that 59% of men value a high-paying job compared to 48% of women, and 57% of men value opportunities for promotion versus 46% of women.](image5)\nConversely, women in STEM jobs are more inclined to prioritize the societal impact and altruistic aspects of their work.

Conversely, a significantly higher share of women in STEM (59%) value jobs that focus on helping others, compared to 31% of men in STEM [4], [9]. Women in STEM are also more likely to consider a job that makes a meaningful contribution to society as important [9].\n\nThese differing values can intersect with the challenges women report in the STEM workforce. Many Americans, and particularly women in STEM, identify gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion as a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in these fields [1], [3]. About 48% of women in STEM jobs cite this as a major factor, compared to 29% of men in STEM jobs [1].

If STEM careers are not effectively framed from an early age to align with values such as helping others or making a societal contribution—qualities more highly prioritized by women—this could contribute to a pipeline issue. The challenge of balancing work and family in STEM jobs is also cited as a reason for fewer women in these roles [image1], which, despite the shared value of flexibility, suggests that the reality or perception of STEM environments may not meet this need adequately for women.\n\nMen and women in STEM value flexibility, but men prioritize pay and promotion more, while women place greater importance on jobs that help others; these differing values, coupled with issues like gender discrimination and lack of early encouragement, contribute to the difficulties women face in entering and thriving in the STEM workforce."}

This means individuals determine for themselves if they are Hispanic. Consequently, a segment of the U.S. adult population, about 5 million adults or 11% of those with Hispanic ancestry, do not identify as Hispanic [4]. For a significant majority of these individuals (81%), they report never having considered themselves Hispanic or Latino [1].\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this, often linked to mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and fewer Hispanic cultural links [1]. Key reasons cited by those with Hispanic ancestry for not identifying as Hispanic include having a mixed background or feeling their Hispanic ancestry is too distant (27%). Other factors include their upbringing or having little contact with Hispanic relatives (16%), not speaking Spanish or lacking a connection to Hispanic culture (15%), identifying as another race or not looking Hispanic (12%), and being born in the U.S. and primarily identifying as American (9%) [1].\n![A bar chart details reasons for not identifying as Hispanic, with having a mixed background or distant Hispanic ancestry being the most cited reason at 27%, followed by upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives at 16%.](image3)\n\nThese influences on self-identification vary considerably across different generations, largely depending on an individual's proximity to their family’s immigrant experiences [6]. As generations progress further from the immigrant experience, cultural markers traditionally associated with Hispanic identity, such as speaking Spanish, are often viewed as less essential. For example, while a majority of Latino adults overall believe speaking Spanish is not required for Latino identity, this sentiment is even more pronounced among U.S.-born Latinos: 84% of second-generation and 92% of third or higher-generation Latinos share this view [7]. This perspective is also reflected in data showing that increasing percentages across generations do not believe speaking Spanish or having a Spanish last name is necessary for Hispanic identity ![A chart indicates that the perceived necessity of speaking Spanish or having a Spanish surname for Hispanic identity decreases significantly with later U.S. generations, with over 90% of third or higher generation Hispanics saying these are not required.](image1). In fact, the vast majority (84%) of all self-identified Hispanics state that having a Spanish last name is not a prerequisite for being considered Hispanic [2].\n\nConcurrently, there is a growing identification as \"typical American\" across successive generations. While 36% of immigrant Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, this figure rises to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and further to 73% among those of the third or higher generation [3]. This shift aligns with the reason some individuals with Hispanic ancestry cite for not identifying as Hispanic—namely, that they were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American [1].\n\nThis generational evolution directly impacts Hispanic self-identification rates. By the third generation (U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents and immigrant grandparents), the proportion of those with Hispanic ancestry who self-identify as Hispanic drops to 77%. This figure decreases further to about half by the fourth or higher generation [10]. Even among those who do self-identify as Hispanic, the frequency or salience of this identity can lessen in later generations. For instance, the share of self-identified Hispanics who report \"often\" thinking of themselves in terms of their Hispanic identity decreases from 57% among the foreign-born to 33% among the third or higher generation ![A bar chart shows that the frequency of \"often\" self-identifying as Hispanic decreases from 57% for foreign-born individuals to 33% for third or higher generation individuals among those who do identify as Hispanic.](image4). These trends, potentially amplified by lower immigration levels and high intermarriage rates, suggest that future Hispanic identity in the U.S. will continue to evolve, with many identifying more strongly with their American nationality [11].\n\nFactors influencing Hispanic self-identification include ancestral distance, cultural connections like language, upbringing, and American identity, with later generations increasingly viewing cultural markers as less essential and identifying more as American."}

The conversations parents have with their children and the cultural cues they provide during upbringing play a substantial role in shaping their children's identity, though engagement in Hispanic cultural activities tends to decrease with each generation [9]. These trends may have implications for the shape of Hispanic identity, as views and experiences with Hispanic culture vary depending on proximity to family immigrant experiences [4, 10].\n\nFor instance, attendance at Hispanic cultural celebrations shows a clear generational decline among self-identified Hispanics. Among immigrants who self-identify as Hispanic, 59% report that their parents often took them to such celebrations during their childhood [8].

Although tariffs were reportedly stabilizing, suggesting an end to aggressive price wars [2], the market had previously seen reduced ARPU due to intense price competition, partly driven by government initiatives and CDMA operators compelling GSM providers to lower their rates [11, 8].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, Telkomsel and XL saw growth in smartphone users, particularly Android, while their ARPU was likely impacted by declining voice/SMS revenues and fluctuating data ARPU due to changing user habits and market competition."}

Traditional datasets often feature a narrow scope of entity categories or overly simplistic question-answer pairs, sometimes lacking specific entity identification [2]. SnapNTell focuses on entity-centric knowledge-based VQA, evaluating how well models can identify entities and generate responses that demonstrate a deep understanding of them [2], [10].\n\n![The image contrasts SnapNTell's detailed, entity-focused Q&A with simpler answers from other VQA datasets.](image1)\nThis focus means that answers within the SnapNTell benchmark are predominantly entity-centric, characterized by a greater depth of knowledgeable information pertaining to the specific entity depicted in the image [4]. The dataset was curated to include a diverse range of fine-grained entities, each with representative images, and question-answer pairs that necessitate knowledge-intensive responses, with entity names specifically mentioned in the answers [1]. For example, while WebQA has categorization, it often lacks fine-grained entities in many QA pairs, resulting in more general questions and answers; SnapNTell, by contrast, provides a wide range of fine-grained entities and demands more knowledgeable responses [7].\n\nSnapNTell encompasses 22 major categories, including landmarks, paintings, animals, and celebrities, totaling 7,568 unique entities [5], [10]. For each entity, the dataset provides 10 illustrative images and 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs [10].\n\n![The table shows SnapNTell surpasses ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA in categories, unique entities, QA pairs, images, average answer length, and features question anonymity.](image7)\nCompared to other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, which also incorporate entity-level knowledge, SnapNTell stands out with more categories (22), a higher number of unique entities (7,568), and a vastly larger set of QA pairs (75,680) and images (75,680).

The most common features for these unverifiable claims include \"The claim does not have enough matching evidence\" (33.3%), \"The claim lacks open-domain knowledge\" (25.0%), and \"The claim lacks closed-domain knowledge\" (15.0%) [5].\n`![Table listing top reasons for refuted claims, such as incorrect calculations (41.7%), and NEI claims, such as insufficient evidence (33.3%).](image6)`\nThese distinct and complex reasoning types for both refuted and NEI claims significantly impact how different models perform, especially in the zero-shot 3-class classification task. The results in the 3-class setting are notably poorer than those in the 2-class setting, which primarily reveals the substantial challenges most models face when confronted with the NEI class [10]. For example, an analysis of InstructGPT and GPT-4 under the zero-shot 3-class setting shows that both models have difficulty accurately predicting the NEI class. InstructGPT often displays a \"less confident\" pattern, frequently classifying supported and refuted claims as ‘NEI’, while GPT-4 exhibits \"overconfidence\", incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [7].\n`![Confusion matrices for InstructGPT and GPT-4 show their difficulty in correctly classifying NEI claims in a 3-class zero-shot setting.](image7)`\nThis difficulty in distinguishing whether a claim is verifiable is highlighted as one of the key challenges for SCITAB [7]. The inclusion of the NEI class tends to diminish the models’ confidence, causing a shift in their predictions from ‘supported/refuted’ to ‘NEI’ [10]. In general, all open-source LLMs do not achieve very promising results on SCITAB and still have a large gap from human performance, with the best 3-class result being only moderately better than random guessing, whereas a well-trained human annotator can achieve a high F1 score [12].\n`![Table comparing LLM performance to human annotators, highlighting significantly lower scores for models in 3-class zero-shot scenarios.](image1)`\nThe primary reasons for refuted claims in SCITAB include incorrect calculations and approximations, while NEI claims often result from insufficient evidence or a lack of necessary domain knowledge; these diverse and complex reasons, particularly those associated with NEI claims, lead to significantly reduced accuracy and present substantial challenges for models in zero-shot 3-class classification."}

This foundational structure can be visualized as a sequence:\n![Naive RAG involves three main steps: indexing documents, retrieving information, and then prompting a language model to generate output.](image5)\n\nTo overcome the limitations inherent in Naive RAG, Advanced RAG was developed. It focuses on improving the quality of retrieval by employing pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies [1]. For example, Advanced RAG refines its indexing techniques through methods like a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata, and also incorporates optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process [1].\n![Advanced RAG enhances Naive RAG by adding optimization strategies in pre-retrieval and post-retrieval stages.](image5)\nThese advancements are a direct response to the specific shortcomings identified in the Naive RAG approach [4].\n\nModular RAG represents a further leap, offering remarkable adaptability and versatility by allowing for the substitution or reconfiguration of modules to address specific challenges [3], [11]. This paradigm moves beyond the more fixed structures of its predecessors by integrating new modules or adjusting the interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its applicability across different tasks [3]. The Modular RAG framework introduces a variety of specialized components to boost retrieval and processing capabilities. These include a Search module for diverse data sources, RAG-Fusion for multi-query strategies, a Memory module that leverages the LLM's memory to guide retrieval, Routing to navigate through different data sources and select optimal pathways, a Predict module to reduce redundancy by generating context directly through the LLM, and a Task Adapter module to customize RAG for various downstream applications [9].\n![Modular RAG offers enhanced flexibility with various specific functional modules and allows for dynamic interactions such as iterative and adaptive processes.](image5)\nThis modular architecture not only streamlines the retrieval process but also significantly improves the quality and relevance of the information retrieved, adapting to a wide array of tasks with enhanced precision [9]. It represents a shift towards more flexible and powerful RAG systems, building upon the foundations laid by Naive and Advanced RAG [11].\n![The evolution of RAG shows Modular RAG as a system that combines multiple specialized modules organically, offering greater model adaptation.](image6)\n\nAdvanced RAG improves upon Naive RAG by incorporating sophisticated pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies along with refined indexing techniques, while Modular RAG enhances retrieval-augmented generation by introducing a flexible, adaptable framework with specialized modules and dynamic processing flows to significantly improve retrieval quality and task-specific applicability."}

These are broadly categorized as Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG [12].\n\nNaive RAG employs a traditional and straightforward \"Retrieve-Read\" process [9]. In this model, document retrieval involves indexing a corpus of documents, performing a similarity search based on the user's query to find relevant chunks, and then passing these chunks along with the original query to a large language model (LLM) for answer generation. This approach is characterized by a relatively simple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism [1].\n![The left part of the diagram shows Naive RAG's simple indexing, retrieval, and generation flow.](image4)\n\nAdvanced RAG was developed to address the limitations inherent in the Naive RAG approach, primarily by focusing on enhancing the quality of retrieval. It achieves this through the implementation of pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies [10]. For query processing, Advanced RAG can utilize pre-retrieval techniques such as query rewriting or expansion to refine the user's initial query, aiming for more relevant search results. After documents are retrieved, post-retrieval strategies like reranking the retrieved information or summarizing it can be applied to ensure that the most pertinent and concise context is provided to the LLM [image4].\n\nModular RAG represents the most adaptable and versatile paradigm, moving beyond the more rigid structures of its predecessors [11]. It offers remarkable adaptability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges and can integrate new modules or adjust the interaction flow among existing ones [1].\n![The right part of the diagram illustrates Modular RAG's flexible architecture with various functional modules and dynamic processes.](image4)\nIn terms of query processing, Modular RAG can employ sophisticated techniques; for example, the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read model uses an LLM to refine retrieval queries through a rewriting module [8]. RAG-Fusion employs a multi-query strategy, expanding user queries into diverse perspectives to uncover a broader range of knowledge [6]. For document retrieval, Modular RAG introduces specialized components such as a Search module for scenario-specific searches across varied data sources (like search engines or databases), and a Routing module to select the optimal pathway for a query through different information streams [6]. Furthermore, Modular RAG supports adaptive retrieval techniques, which allow the system to evaluate the necessity of retrieval based on the specific scenario, rather than a fixed process [3].\n\nThe frameworks differ in their complexity and methods for document retrieval and query processing: Naive RAG uses a simple linear sequence, Advanced RAG introduces optimization stages around the retrieval step, and Modular RAG offers a highly flexible and dynamic system with specialized, interchangeable modules for tailored operations."}

For instance, with GPT-4, RAPTOR scored 55.7%, surpassing DPR by 2.7 points and BM25 by 5.5 points [2].\n![RAPTOR achieves the highest F-1 Match scores on the QASPER dataset compared to BM25 and DPR across three different language models.](image2)\nFurther comparisons show that RAPTOR with GPT-4 sets a new benchmark on QASPER with a 55.7% F-1 score, outperforming models like CoLT5 XL (53.9%) [8].\n![RAPTOR + GPT-4 achieves the highest F-1 Match score on QASPER, surpassing CoLT5 XL and LongT5 XL.](image7)\nEven when comparing base models with and without RAPTOR enhancement on QASPER, the addition of RAPTOR, for example to SBERT, improves the Answer F1 score [image1].\n\nIn the context of the Narrative QA dataset, RAPTOR also shows strong results. When paired with UnifiedQA 3B, RAPTOR surpasses BM25 and DPR across multiple metrics, including ROUGE-L, BLEU-1, BLEU-4, and METEOR [4, 5]. Notably, it sets a new state-of-the-art METEOR score of 19.1 [9].\n![RAPTOR + UnifiedQA sets a new state-of-the-art METEOR score and shows strong performance on other metrics on the Narrative QA dataset against several benchmarks.](image4)\nCompared to the recursively summarizing model by Wu et al. (2021), RAPTOR outperforms it on all metrics, benefiting from its intermediate layers and clustering approaches [6]. The general improvement RAPTOR brings is also evident when it's added to models like SBERT, BM25, and DPR, which then show better scores across ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR metrics [image8].\n![Augmenting SBERT, BM25, and DPR with RAPTOR leads to improved ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR scores on the Narrative QA dataset.](image8)\n\nThe QuALITY dataset further highlights RAPTOR's capabilities. Paired with GPT-4, RAPTOR achieved a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.6%, significantly outperforming the previous best of 62.3% by CoLISA. This includes a notable 21.5% improvement on QuALITY-HARD, which contains more challenging questions [7].\n![On the QuALITY dataset, RAPTOR + GPT-4 demonstrates superior accuracy over other models, including on the Hard Subset.](image3)\nOn the QuALITY dev dataset, RAPTOR also outperformed BM25 and DPR by at least 2.0% in accuracy with both GPT-3 and UnifiedQA [9].\n![RAPTOR consistently shows higher accuracy on the QuALITY dev dataset than BM25 and DPR when paired with GPT-3 and UnifiedQA.](image5)\nThe benefits of integrating RAPTOR are also clear here, as models like SBERT, BM25, and DPR show increased accuracy on QuALITY when RAPTOR is used [image1].\n![RAPTOR enhancement improves accuracy on QuALITY and Answer F1 on QASPER for SBERT, BM25, and DPR.](image1)\nThe effectiveness of RAPTOR's full tree structure, which provides both original text and higher-level summaries, is crucial for handling a diverse range of queries [11]. Studies on the QuALITY dataset confirm that utilizing the full tree, or more layers within it, generally leads to better performance compared to using only specific layers [12].\n![Ablation study results on QuALITY indicate that utilizing more layers in RAPTOR's tree structure, such as Layer 2 when 3 layers are queried, yields better performance.](image6)\n\nOverall, the RAPTOR model consistently outperforms other models across multiple datasets and metrics, often setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks."}

For instance, PaLM-2L with Step-Back and RAG achieves 42.8% on MuSiQue and 86.4% on StrategyQA, significantly outperforming GPT-4 on both [1].\n![Table shows PaLM-2L combined with Step-Back and RAG achieves the highest accuracy on MuSiQue and StrategyQA.](image5)\nThis demonstrates a substantial improvement over standard PaLM-2L and even GPT-4, as seen in overall comparisons.\n![Bar chart compares PaLM-2L with Step-Back Prompting outperforming GPT-4 and other PaLM-2L variants on several reasoning tasks.](image3)\n\nIn Knowledge QA tasks such as TimeQA, baseline models like GPT-4 (45.6%) and PaLM-2L (41.5%) highlight the task's difficulty [10]. Augmenting the baseline model with RAG improves accuracy to 57.4%, emphasizing the factual intensity of TimeQA. However, combining Step-Back with RAG (Step-Back + RAG) is even more effective, achieving 68.7% on TimeQA [10]. This combination leverages the step-back question to retrieve relevant facts, which serve as additional context for the final reasoning step [11].\n![Table shows PaLM-2L with Step-Back and RAG achieving top performance on TimeQA and TQA Easy, while GPT-4 leads on SituatedQA.](image4)\nOn the SituatedQA benchmark, PaLM-2L with Step-Back + RAG achieves 61%, which is a moderate improvement from the PaLM-2L baseline (54.3%) and slightly trails GPT-4's 63.2% [12].\n\nFor STEM subjects like MMLU Physics and Chemistry, Step-Back Prompting enhances PaLM-2L performance by 7% and 11% respectively [2].\n![Table shows PaLM-2L with Step-Back Prompting achieving the highest scores on MMLU Physics and MMLU Chemistry, surpassing GPT-4.](image7)\nSpecifically, PaLM-2L with Step-Back reaches 73.2% in MMLU Physics and 81.8% in MMLU Chemistry, outperforming GPT-4 which scored 70.3% and 79.9% respectively.\n\nRegarding error analysis for Step-Back Prompting, on TimeQA, it's noted that \"StepBack rarely fails\" in terms of generating a helpful abstraction [5]. The more dominant error sources are reasoning errors and failures in RAG [3, 5].\n![Error distribution for Step-Back on TimeQA shows Reasoning and RAG errors are most common.](image1)\nSpecifically, 52% of errors are attributed to reasoning failures, and 45% are due to RAG failing to retrieve relevant information, even when the step-back question is on target [5, 9]. The \"StepBack\" error, where the generated step-back question itself is not helpful, accounts for only a small fraction (1%) of issues [9].\n\nIn tasks requiring complex reasoning like MMLU, more than 90% of errors occur during the Reasoning step, with \"Reasoning Error\" and \"Math Error\" being the major loss buckets [6]. The \"Principle Error,\" which signifies a failure in the Abstraction step of Step-Back Prompting, constitutes only a small fraction of the errors [6].\n![Charts show prediction outcomes and error types for Step-Back Prompting on MMLU Physics, with reasoning errors being dominant.](image8)\nFor MMLU Physics, reasoning errors are the most frequent (55%), followed by math errors (25%), while principle errors are relatively low (9%) [6].\n\nStep-Back Prompting, especially with RAG, generally enhances performance across various QA tasks compared to baselines and often GPT-4, with primary error types being reasoning failures and RAG retrieval issues rather than the abstraction step itself."}

In contrast, DS-DST and DS-Picklist can predict these values directly from candidate-value lists [12].\n\nAn error analysis further highlights the benefits of DS-DST and DS-Picklist, particularly for categorical slots [3].

CHAI, on the other hand, involves a 3D house environment (CHALET) and requires both navigation and simple manipulation, such as moving objects and opening containers; its corpus contains 1,596 instruction sequences, averaging 7.7 instructions each [3].\nThe statistical differences between the two datasets highlight their varying demands.\n![Comparative statistics of LANI and CHAI datasets including instruction and action counts.](image8)\nLANI has more paragraphs but fewer instructions per paragraph and a larger vocabulary, while CHAI has fewer paragraphs but more instructions per paragraph and significantly more actions per instruction, suggesting more complex, multi-step sequences [3].

However, on CHAI, while the approach shows improvement on stop distance (SD), all models, including the presented one, perform poorly, especially on manipulation (MA) [4]. This indicates that while similar trends in improvement are observed, the results on CHAI are overall weaker, underscoring its higher complexity [8]. Human performance on these tasks reveals inherent ambiguities; on LANI, humans achieve a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and 63% task completion (TC), while on CHAI, human SD is 1.34 with 100% manipulation accuracy [10].

This is notably better than previous methods such as MISRA17, which scored 28.3% on TC, and CHAPLOT18, which achieved 31.8% [image8].

The decomposition of instruction execution into goal prediction and action generation, a core aspect of the proposed model [5], is suggested to significantly improve instruction execution performance on this navigation task [6].\n\nFor the CHAI benchmark, which involves executing household instructions, the comparison focuses on manipulation accuracy (MA). Here, \"Our Approach\" achieves an MA of 39.97% [image8]. This score is higher than that of MISRA17 (33.3% MA) and CHAPLOT18 (33.3% MA) [image8]. A crucial observation from these figures is that MISRA17 and CHAPLOT18 perform identically to basic baselines like STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT on MA for CHAI [image8], which aligns with the assessment that \"C HAP - LOT 18 and M ISRA 17 both fail to learn\" effectively on this task, particularly regarding manipulation [3]. While the proposed approach does show an improvement, the paper notes that \"all models perform poorly on C HAI , especially on manipulation (MA)\" [3]. The overall weaker results on CHAI illustrate its complexity [6]. This difficulty is further underscored by the fact that even when provided with \"oracle goals,\" the model \"completely fails to learn a reasonable manipulation behavior for C HAI\" [7]. Human manipulation accuracy on CHAI is $100\\%$ [11], which starkly contrasts with the model's 39.97%, emphasizing that \"the gap to human-level performance still remains large across both tasks\" [6].\n\nInsights drawn from this comparison include:\n1.

A large performance gap to humans exists on both tasks [11], highlighting them as largely unresolved problems in instruction following [6].\n\nThe proposed approach outperforms other methods in task completion (TC) for LANI and manipulation accuracy (MA) for CHAI, though performance on CHAI remains particularly challenging for all models with a substantial gap to human capabilities."}

It achieved a Stop Distance (SD) of 8.43 and a Task Completion (TC) rate of 36.9% [5]. This represents a 5% improvement in TC accuracy over the C HAPLOT 18 method [5]. Experiments indicate that this decomposition of goal prediction and action generation significantly enhances instruction execution performance on LANI [8]. The table below presents a comparison of \"Our Approach\" with several baselines on both LANI and CHAI datasets.\n`![Table showing performance metrics (SD, TC for LANI; SD, MA for CHAI) for 'Our Approach' and various baseline methods.](image6)`\nFor the CHAI dataset, which involves more complex household instructions, the evaluation uses Stop Distance (SD) and Manipulation Accuracy (MA), not Task Completion (TC) [12]. While \"Our Approach\" demonstrates an improvement in SD on CHAI (achieving 3.34 as shown in the table above), all models, including \"Our Approach,\" generally perform poorly on this benchmark, especially in manipulation (MA), which highlights the inherent complexity of the CHAI task [5], [8].\n\nSeveral factors influence the performance of \"Our Approach.\" The core design, which explicitly separates goal prediction from action generation, is beneficial, particularly for navigation-focused tasks [8]. However, this design also has potential limitations. One such limitation is the risk of cascading errors, as the action generation phase relies entirely on the predicted goal and has no other access to the original language instruction [4]. This means inaccuracies in goal prediction can significantly hinder subsequent actions. Furthermore, the model may struggle with instructions that impose constraints on the execution path itself, rather than just specifying the final destination [4].\n\nThe complexity of the CHAI task, particularly its intricate planning and manipulation requirements, poses a significant challenge [2], [5]. Interestingly, when evaluated on a subset of CHAI instructions that only involve navigation, \"Our Approach\" achieves a more substantial reduction in SD error (17%) compared to its performance on the entire CHAI corpus (8% reduction) [11]. The quality of goal prediction is paramount. Access to \"oracle goals\" (perfectly predicted goals) has been shown to significantly improve navigation performance on both LANI and CHAI tasks [2]. For instance, on LANI, providing oracle goals boosts Task Completion.\n`![Table illustrating the impact of oracle goals on the performance of 'Our Approach' (OA) on LANI and CHAI, showing improved SD and TC for LANI and improved SD for CHAI.](image8)`\nHowever, even with oracle goals for navigation, the model still fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for the CHAI task, underscoring the profound planning complexity within that domain [2].\n\nIn summary, \"Our Approach\" generally outperforms other methods on the LANI dataset in terms of Task Completion and Stop Distance, and shows competitive Stop Distance on the CHAI dataset, with its performance influenced by its goal-prediction and action-generation decomposition, the complexity of the task (especially for CHAI), and the accuracy of its goal predictions."}

Stacking these task-specific architectures can lead to new state-of-the-art performance levels for both NER and constituency parsing [4].\n\nWhen comparing these methods, fine-tuning generally offers a more significant performance improvement. Both stacking approaches can outperform previous benchmarks, but \"ﬁne tuning gives the biggest gain\" [5].\n\n![The table shows F1 scores for different models on development and test datasets, comparing ELMo_BASE, CNN Large + ELMo, CNN Large + fine-tune, and BERT models.](image6)\n\nFor example, the performance data shows that \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieved a development F1 score of 96.9 and a test F1 score of 93.5. In comparison, \"CNN Large + ELMo\" (which represents stacking without fine-tuning the base CNN model) scored 96.4 on development and 93.2 on the test set, indicating that the fine-tuning approach yields superior results [5].\n\nCNN models combined with fine-tuning of task-specific architectures generally outperform those using stacking methods without fine-tuning the base model on NLP tasks like NER, with fine-tuning providing the largest performance improvements."}

For the \"ccrawl\" dataset, the average GLUE score generally increases with more tokens, for example, from 80.3 with 562M tokens to 81.3 with 18,000M (18B) tokens.\n![The table displays GLUE performance metrics for models trained on datasets like ccrawl, news crawl, and BWiki, showing that increasing training data tokens generally improves average scores.](image6)\nDifferent GLUE tasks also respond variably to increased data from specific sources. For example, when pretraining on Common Crawl, CoLA and RTE benefit most from additional training data [10]. In contrast, News Crawl data, which generally performs less well than Common Crawl (especially on sentence-pair tasks due to its single-sentence examples), shows most benefit for CoLA and STS-B with more data [10]. Even with data sources like BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia, which have their own characteristics and perform well on specific tasks like QNLI and MNLI, the underlying principle of data quantity affecting performance holds [12]. The investigation into how pretraining benefits from larger training corpora and how data domain influences end-task performance is a key area of study [4].\n\nGenerally, increasing the amount of training data leads to higher average GLUE scores across different datasets, although the specific tasks benefiting most and the overall performance can vary based on the characteristics of the dataset itself."}

For instance, models trained on larger amounts of \"ccrawl\" data generally achieve higher average scores on GLUE tasks [10].\n![The table shows that models trained on larger amounts of Common Crawl data (e.g., 18B tokens) achieve higher average GLUE scores compared to those trained on smaller amounts (e.g., 562M tokens), and that BWiki-blck (blocks of tokens) outperforms BWiki-sent (individual sentences).](image6)\nThe structure and domain of the pretraining data also play a crucial role. Pretraining on corpora that retain paragraph structure, such as Common Crawl with its multi-sentence examples (averaging 50 words), performs better than using data with individual sentences, like News Crawl (averaging 23 words) [3, 10]. This is particularly true for end-tasks based on sentence pairs; for example, there's a notable accuracy gap on RTE between News Crawl and Common Crawl when using 4.5B tokens [3]. The general conclusion is that having multiple sentences in each training example is crucial for many tasks [2, 11].\n\nRegarding modeling approaches, the choice of training objective is important. A novel cloze-driven training regime, where the model predicts every token in the training data by considering both left and right context, has been shown to be more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately or using a bidirectional language model (bilm) loss [2, 11, 12].\n![The table shows that the \"cloze\" modeling approach achieves a higher average performance (80.9) across various NLP tasks compared to the \"bilm\" approach (79.4) or a combination of \"cloze + bilm\" (80.5).](image1)\nSpecifically, the cloze loss performs significantly better than the bilm loss, and combining the two does not improve over the cloze loss by itself [4]. Different model architectures and fine-tuning strategies also impact results. For example, BERT_LARGE generally demonstrates superior performance across multiple GLUE tasks compared to other models like OpenAI GPT or CNN variants.\n![The table compares various models on GLUE tasks, with BERT_LARGE achieving the highest average score (82.6).](image3)\nFurthermore, for structured prediction tasks like NER and constituency parsing, stacking task-specific architectures on top of pretrained models and fine-tuning them can lead to state-of-the-art performance [2, 6]. For instance, a \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" approach achieved high F1 scores on NER.\n![The table shows \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieving the highest F1 scores (96.9 dev, 93.5 test) for NER compared to other models including BERT variants.](image4)\n\nIncreasing the amount and structural richness of pretraining data, combined with effective modeling approaches like the cloze objective and appropriate fine-tuning, significantly improves performance on NLP tasks."}

To investigate this, researchers adopted methods to learn orthogonal transformations, converting word embeddings of multiple languages into a single shared space [6].\n\nIn bilingual translation scenarios, the alignment of word embeddings surprisingly did not prove to be significantly beneficial. The gains or losses in BLEU scores were essentially insignificant across all tested languages [7]. This suggests that *a priori* alignment might not be a necessary step for improving bilingual NMT systems [7].\n![The table shows BLEU scores for various language pairs to English with unaligned and aligned embeddings, where changes are minimal (e.g., GL → EN shows -1.3, PT → EN shows -0.2, RU → EN shows +0.3).](image3)\nThis indicates that for these individual language pairs translated to English, aligning embeddings resulted in very small changes to the BLEU score, sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive, but generally not substantial [7].\n\nHowever, the situation changes in multilingual translation tasks. When applying pre-trained embeddings in a multilingual setup (where a single encoder is used for multiple source languages), aligning the word embeddings was found to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks reported [2]. This is because alignment helps ensure that the word embeddings of the different source languages are brought into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn more effectively, similar to how it would if training on a single language [2].\n![The table shows that for multilingual training setups (e.g., GL+PT evaluated on GL), the 'align' metric (22.4) is higher than 'pre' (20.8), 'std' (17.5), and 'bi' (2.2), indicating improvement with alignment.](image2)\nFor instance, in tasks like translating Galician (GL) and Portuguese (PT) to English using a shared model, the aligned embeddings (score of 22.4 for GL evaluation) outperformed setups without alignment [2].\n\nThe alignment of word embeddings has a different impact depending on the translation scenario: it is generally not significantly beneficial for bilingual systems but proves helpful in multilingual training scenarios [8]."}

This suggests that a better encoding of the source sentence contributes most of the gain [8]. The underlying hypothesis is that pre-training makes the embedding space more consistent, placing semantically similar words closer together [3].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is influenced by the size of the training data.\n![The graphs show that pre-training (dashed lines) generally yields higher BLEU scores than standard training (solid lines), especially with smaller training set sizes, and the gain diminishes as training data increases.](image2)\nThere appears to be a \"sweet-spot\" where pre-training is most effective: when there is very little training data, but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all [12]. The gain in BLEU score is often highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4]. This indicates that a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes full effect [4].\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a crucial role. It's hypothesized that if the source and target languages are more linguistically similar, their semantic neighborhoods will also be more similar, potentially leading to larger gains from pre-training [3]. This is examined by selecting Portuguese as the target and source languages from different levels of its language family tree: Spanish (West-Iberian), French (Western Romance), Italian (Romance), Russian (Indo-European), and Hebrew (no common family listed with Portuguese) [3, 9].\n![The table shows BLEU score improvements from pre-training for translations into Portuguese (PT) from Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), and Hebrew (HE), with varying gains across language families.](image1)\nFor translations into Portuguese (ES, FR, IT), the BLEU scores generally support the hypothesis that more similar languages benefit more from pre-training [1]. However, for very different languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE), which have low baseline BLEU scores, the accuracy gains can be larger due to having more room for improvement [1]. In multilingual systems, gains from pre-trained embeddings are roughly in order of language similarity, with more similar pairs like GL/PT showing larger gains [11].\n![The table displays evaluation scores for multilingual models, showing that pre-training and alignment generally improve performance, especially for the GL+PT pair evaluated on GL.](image8)\n\nQualitatively, pre-training helps models capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [6]. For instance, in GL→EN translations, pre-training enabled the successful translation of a person's name (\"chris\") and multi-word phrases (\"big lawyer,\" \"patent legislation\") [6].\n![The table compares translations, where the 'multi:pre-align' version shows improved translation of phrases like \"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\" compared to 'bi:std'.](image7)\nFurthermore, pre-training improves translation accuracy for the entire vocabulary, but especially for low-frequency words in the training corpus [7].\n![The bar chart illustrates that pre-training ('pre' bars) leads to higher F-measure scores for target words across various frequency ranges compared to standard training ('std' bars), particularly for less frequent words.](image4)\n\nIn summary, pre-training generally enhances translation accuracy, especially with limited training data and for more linguistically similar language pairs, by improving vocabulary capture and grammatical structure."}

In bilingual translation settings, the alignment of word embeddings was found to be largely unbeneficial, with any gains or losses being essentially insignificant across various languages [6]. This suggests that NMT systems can learn a reasonable projection of word embeddings during their standard training process without needing prior alignment [1, 6]. The data presented for several language pairs translated into English further illustrates this point.\n![The table shows BLEU scores for unaligned and aligned embeddings in bilingual translation, with minimal changes for most language pairs.](image4)\nFor instance, for GL → EN, the unaligned score was 12.8, while the aligned score was 11.5, a decrease of 1.3. For PT → EN, the scores were 30.8 (unaligned) and 30.6 (aligned), a change of -0.2. Other pairs like AZ → EN, TR → EN, BE → EN, and RU → EN also showed minimal changes, indicating that alignment did not consistently improve performance in these bilingual contexts [6]. The hypothesis was that consistent embedding spaces across languages might be beneficial by allowing the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between source and target [7]. However, results indicate that *a priori* alignment might not be necessary in such bilingual scenarios [6, 11].\n\nIn contrast, when considering multilingual translation systems, particularly those sharing an encoder between multiple source languages, aligning word embeddings proves to be helpful [4, 11]. For multilingual systems trained on two similar source languages and evaluated on a low-resource language, alignment helped increase BLEU scores [4].\n![This table shows evaluation metrics for multilingual training, where the 'align' column generally shows the highest scores, indicating benefits in this setup.](image8)\nFor example, in a system trained on GL + PT and evaluated on GL, the score with alignment was 22.4, higher than the pre-trained (20.8) or standard (17.5) multilingual scores. Similarly, for AZ + TR evaluated on AZ, alignment yielded 7.5, and for BE + RU evaluated on BE, it was 9.6. This improvement is intuitive because a single encoder for multiple source languages would face a more complex task if the word embeddings for these languages were in semantically separate spaces. Pre-training combined with alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the source languages are mapped into similar vector spaces, facilitating learning akin to training on a single language [4].\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency, pre-training improves translation accuracy across the entire vocabulary. However, this improvement is particularly notable for words that appear with low frequency in the training corpus [10].\n![This bar chart shows that pre-training (red bars) generally leads to higher F-measure scores than standard training (blue bars), especially for words with lower frequency in the training corpus.](image6)\nAs seen in the comparison, while both standard (\"std\") and pre-trained (\"pre\") systems show increasing F-measure scores with higher word frequency, the \"pre\" system often achieves higher scores, and the relative gain is more pronounced for less frequent words [10]. This indicates that pre-trained embeddings provide better representations for less frequent concepts [2].\n\nIn summary, word embedding alignment is generally not beneficial for bilingual NMT but helps in multilingual systems, and pre-training particularly improves the F-measure for low-frequency target words."}

Ablation studies where different types of relations are removed independently show that coreference links (COREF) seem to play a more marginal role compared to other connections like document-based (DOC-BASED) or exact match (MATCH) connections [8].

For instance, DyGIE shows relative improvements of 5.7% and 9.9% over previous state-of-the-art on the ACE05 entity and relation extraction tasks, respectively [6]. Its effectiveness is also highlighted in overlapping entity extraction, where it improved the state of the art by 11.6% on ACE04-O and 11.3% on ACE05-O [2].\n\n![DyGIE consistently outperforms other systems like Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and Wang and Lu (2018) in Entity F1 scores across ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA datasets.](image3)\n\nFurther comparisons show DyGIE surpassing other models on datasets like ACE04, ACE05, SciERC, and WLPC for both entity and relation metrics [6].\n![DyGIE achieves the highest entity and relation scores compared to other models on ACE04, ACE05, SciERC, and WLPC datasets.](image5)\n\nThe model's performance and the roles of its CorefProp (coreference propagation) and RelProp (relation propagation) components vary depending on the dataset and task configuration. Analysis on the ACE2005 development set reveals specific behaviors [4]. For ACE05, coreference propagation (CorefProp) is particularly helpful for entities, showing a 6.6% improvement in pronoun categorization, which is crucial for disambiguating entity types for pronominal mentions that require cross-sentence context [12]. However, on ACE05, CorefProp appears to hurt relation extraction [8]. The table below illustrates the performance on the ACE05 dev set:\n![On the ACE05 dev set, DyGIE (with CorefProp and RelProp) achieves the highest entity F1, while DyGIE without CorefProp shows the best relation F1.](image8)\nSpecifically, for entities on ACE05, DyGIE (F1 87.1) benefits from CorefProp when compared to DyGIE without CorefProp (F1 85.7). For relations, DyGIE without CorefProp (F1 60.2) performs better than the full DyGIE model (F1 58.4), indicating CorefProp's negative impact on relations in this dataset [8]. Relation propagation (RelProp) on ACE05 benefits both entity and relation extraction, though the F1 lift in the overall scores from image8 is modest (Entity: 87.1 with RelProp vs 86.9 without; Relation: 58.4 with RelProp vs 58.0 without). However, RelProp's advantage is more pronounced in sentences with a higher number of entities, where broader context is more critical [9].\n![The DyGIE model (with RelProp) shows improved Relation F1 scores compared to DyGIE without RelProp, especially as the number of entities in a sentence increases.](image6)\n\nOn the SciERC dataset, the effects of these components differ. CorefProp provides a small benefit for both entity and relation tasks [8]. However, its effect on entity F1 is much smaller compared to its effect on ACE05 [5], partly because pronouns in SciERC are uniformly assigned a 'Generic' label, diminishing CorefProp's impact on entity extraction performance [1]. Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction on SciERC [8]. The component analysis on the SciERC dev set is shown below:\n![On the SciERC dev set, the full DyGIE model shows the best F1 scores for both entity and relation tasks, with RelProp providing a more significant boost than CorefProp.](image4)\nHere, for entities, DyGIE (F1 68.2) is slightly better than DyGIE without CorefProp (F1 68.0) and notably better than DyGIE without RelProp (F1 67.5). For relations, DyGIE (F1 42.0) outperforms configurations without CorefProp (F1 41.2) and significantly outperforms the one without RelProp (F1 40.4) [8]. The number of propagation iterations for CorefProp and RelProp also influences performance, with studies indicating that two iterations often yield the best F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction tasks.\n![Entity F1 scores for CorefProp and Relation F1 scores for RelProp generally peak at two iterations.](image2)\n\nThe DyGIE model's performance varies across datasets and configurations; CorefProp generally aids entity extraction, particularly for pronouns in datasets like ACE05, while RelProp tends to enhance both entity and relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple entities, though their precise benefits differ by domain and task."}

This feature is especially advantageous for resolving ambiguities in pronominal mentions, a challenge that often requires understanding cross-sentence contexts. For example, within the ACE05 dataset, the application of coreference propagation in DyGIE led to a 6.6% enhancement in performance related to pronoun categorization, underscoring its value [3].\n\nThe positive impact of coreference propagation on entity recognition is further demonstrated by comparative performance metrics. In a setting conducive to coreference benefits, DyGIE equipped with coreference propagation achieved an entity F1 score of 87.1, surpassing the 85.7 F1 score of a DyGIE version without this component ![\"Table showing DyGIE with CorefProp (Entity F1: 87.1) outperforms DyGIE without CorefProp (Entity F1: 85.7) for entity recognition.\"](image2). This highlights a tangible improvement in entity recognition accuracy when coreference information is leveraged.\n\nHowever, the degree of improvement from coreference propagation is not uniform across all datasets and can be influenced by how coreference is annotated. For instance, in the SciERC dataset, pronouns are consistently labeled as 'Generic,' which diminishes the potential benefits of coreference propagation for entity extraction tasks [8]. This situation is reflected in results where DyGIE with coreference propagation (Entity F1: 68.2) performs similarly to DyGIE without it (Entity F1: 68.0), indicating a minimal impact in this specific context ![\"Table showing DyGIE with CorefProp (Entity F1: 68.2) has similar performance to DyGIE without CorefProp (Entity F1: 68.0) on a specific dataset.\"](image1).\n\nNevertheless, DyGIE generally shows strong performance when coreference annotations are available and utilized. For tasks like overlapping entity extraction, the coreference propagation layer is included for datasets such as ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA [11]. This has contributed to DyGIE achieving state-of-the-art results, with notable improvements on datasets like ACE04-O (Entity F1: 84.7) and ACE05-O (Entity F1: 82.9) [9] ![\"Table showing DyGIE achieves high Entity F1 scores on ACE04-O (84.7), ACE05-O (82.9), and GENIA (76.2).\"](image5). The coreference layer's parameters can be trained using external annotations like OntoNotes, even for specific dataset variants such as ACE04-O and ACE05-O [12].\n\nThe presence of coreference annotations generally enables the DyGIE model to enhance entity recognition performance by better resolving ambiguous mentions, though the magnitude of this benefit can vary with dataset-specific annotation practices."}

In document classification tasks, particularly for topic categorization (e.g., Yahoo! Answer, AG News) and ontology classification (DBpedia), SWEM models, especially SWEM-concat, have shown stronger performance, even outperforming a 29-layer deep CNN model in topic prediction [1]. This is attributed to leveraging both average and max-pooling features from word embeddings [1].\n![The table shows SWEM-concat achieving the highest performance on Yahoo! Answers, AG News, and DBpedia datasets compared to various CNN and LSTM models.](image2)\nFor instance, on datasets like Yahoo! Answers, AG News, and DBpedia, SWEM-concat achieved the top scores, while deep CNNs or LSTMs performed better on sentiment analysis datasets like Yelp Polarity and Yelp Full [1]. The SWEM-hier variant also shows strong results, particularly in sentiment analysis, by abstracting spatial (word-order) information [2].\n\nWhen considering sentence-classification tasks, which involve shorter texts (around 20 words on average), SWEMs tend to yield inferior accuracies on sentiment analysis datasets (MR, SST-1, SST-2) compared to CNN/LSTM models [5].\n![The table indicates that SWEM models generally have lower accuracy on MR, SST-1, and SST-2 datasets compared to various CNN and LSTM models, but are competitive on Subj and TREC.](image3)\nHowever, on other short text tasks like subjectivity classification (Subj) and question classification (TREC), SWEMs exhibit comparable performance to CNNs and LSTMs, often with fewer parameters and faster training [5]. Generally, SWEMs are less effective at extracting representations from short sentences than from long documents, possibly because word-order features, which SWEMs (except SWEM-hier) largely ignore, are more critical for shorter sequences where semantic information from embeddings alone is more limited [5].\n\nIn sentence matching tasks, such as natural language inference (SNLI), answer sentence selection (WikiQA), and paraphrase identification, SWEMs again show strong performance, often surpassing CNN and LSTM encoders on several datasets [12].\n![The table shows SWEM models, particularly SWEM-max and SWEM-concat, achieving the best or competitive results on SNLI, MultiNLI, Quora, and MSRP datasets, often outperforming CNN and LSTM.](image4)\nNotably, on the SNLI dataset, SWEM-max achieved a test accuracy of 83.8% with only 120K parameters, highlighting its competitiveness [12].\n\nRegarding performance with varying subspace dimensions, studies using subspace training reveal that SWEM models can be more parameter-efficient [10, 11].\n![The graphs show that SWEM accuracy increases with subspace dimension, often outperforming CNN at lower dimensions on AG News, while CNN can achieve higher accuracy with larger dimensions on Yelp P.](image5)\nFor example, on the AG News dataset, SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN across a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating it can reach a good solution with fewer effective parameters [10]. This suggests SWEM is more parameter-efficient in finding a decent solution, especially when the intrinsic dimensionality of the task is low.\n![These graphs illustrate that SWEM can achieve high accuracy even at very small subspace dimensions (d < 10), sometimes matching or exceeding CNN performance.](image8)\nHowever, on other datasets like Yelp P., CNNs can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy when the subspace dimension 'd' is large [10]. An interesting insight into SWEM-max is that it tends to learn sparse word embeddings, meaning it may rely on a few key words for predictions, as most embedding values concentrate around zero [3].\n![The histogram shows SWEM-max embeddings are highly concentrated around zero, indicating sparsity, while GloVe embeddings are denser.](image7)\nThis contrasts with denser embeddings like GloVe and suggests SWEM-max learns to identify important words for a given task through its embedding structure [3]. Furthermore, SWEMs generally have no compositional parameters and are computationally more efficient and parallelizable than CNNs and LSTMs [9].\n\nOverall, SWEM models offer competitive or even superior performance to CNNs in many document classification and sentence matching tasks, especially when computational resources are a concern or when the task benefits from simpler feature aggregation, while CNNs may have an edge in tasks heavily reliant on local word order in short texts or when a larger number of parameters can be effectively utilized."}

Experiments involving pre-training on four domains and then fine-tuning on a new (held-out) domain indicate that fine-tuning the base TRADE model generally yields better results on the new domain compared to training from scratch using the same amount of data [2, 3, 5].

Furthermore, in some cases, like when considering 'hotel' and 'attraction' as new domains, fine-tuning with GEM not only preserves knowledge of learned domains but also helps achieve better performance on the new domain itself compared to naive fine-tuning [4].\n\nThe similarity between slots, or the ability to transfer knowledge about slots across domains, significantly affects performance. Knowledge about common slots like 'people', 'area', 'price range', and 'day' can be successfully transferred from seen domains to new ones, as observed in zero-shot analyses of 'hotel' and 'restaurant' domains [2].\n![Figure 5 shows bar charts for Hotel (a) and Restaurant (b) domains, indicating successful knowledge transfer for shared slots like 'people', 'area', 'price range', and 'day' in zero-shot DST.](image4)\nThis suggests that if slots in a new domain share characteristics or values with slots in previously learned domains, the model can leverage this existing knowledge. Conversely, slots that are unique to a new domain and have not been encountered before are very hard for the model to track correctly [2]. The relationships and similarities between slot embeddings can be visualized, where higher similarity suggests that slots have learned comparable representations, often due to sharing similar or correlated values, which can aid in knowledge transfer.\n![This heatmap visualizes cosine similarity between slot embeddings, with darker colors indicating higher similarity due to shared or correlated values (e.g., 'destination' and 'departure').](image8)\n\nFine-tuning strategies like GEM are more effective than EWC and naive approaches in adapting to new domains while minimizing forgetting, and slot similarities facilitate knowledge transfer, improving performance on shared or similar slots across domains."}

These studies examined four widely used commercial MT systems and two recent state-of-the-art academic models across eight diverse target languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German [1, 2].\n\nThe overall performance regarding correct gender translation shows considerable variation. Table 2 from the research, detailed below, presents the gender accuracy (`Acc`), the difference in F1 score performance between masculine and feminine instances (`ΔG`), and the difference in F1 score performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments (`ΔS`) for commercial systems [1]. Higher numbers in `ΔG` and `ΔS` metrics indicate stronger biases [1]. Generally, most tested systems across these languages perform quite poorly, often not much better than random guessing for correct gender inflection, though translation accuracies for German tend to be higher, possibly due to its similarity to the English source language [7].\n![Table 2 shows the performance of commercial MT systems (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, SYSTRAN) on the WinoMT corpus across eight languages, detailing accuracy and bias metrics.](image4)\nAcademic models also exhibit these biases, as indicated by performance metrics on French and German [9].\n![Table 3 shows accuracy and bias metrics for two academic MT models on French (Ott et al., 2018) and German (Edunov et al., 2018).](image5)\n\nA consistent finding is that all tested MT systems are significantly prone to gender-biased translation errors, favoring stereotypical gender roles [2, 4, 9]. For instance, systems show significantly better performance when presented with pro-stereotypical assignments (e.g., a female nurse) while their performance deteriorates when translating anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., a male receptionist) [11]. This trend is evident in Google Translate's performance across all tested languages, and other systems show similar patterns [11].\n![Figure 2 depicts Google Translate's higher accuracy for stereotypical gender roles (purple bars) compared to non-stereotypical roles (red bars) across eight languages.](image1)\nAn example of this bias can be seen when translating sentences like \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen.\" In one instance, \"baker\" was translated into Spanish with a male inflection (\"el panadero\") despite the female pronoun \"ella\" [image2].\n![Table 1 provides examples of biased translation in Spanish where \"baker\" is male-inflected despite a female pronoun, and how adding \"pretty\" corrects it; also shows a French example.](image2)\nInterestingly, experiments have shown that it's possible to affect these translations.

The idea is to see if these explicit gender cues can counteract existing biases, for instance, where a profession like \"doctor\" might bias the translation towards a male inflection even if the context implies a female doctor [9].\n\nAn example of this can be seen in translations from English to Spanish. When translating \"The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen,\" the word \"baker\" might be incorrectly translated with a male inflection. However, by adding the adjective \"pretty,\" forming the sentence \"The janitor does not like the pretty baker because she always messes up the kitchen,\" the translation can be corrected to use a female inflection for \"baker,\" aligning with the female pronoun \"she\" [image5].\n![An example shows that adding the stereotypically female adjective \"pretty\" to \"baker\" changes the Spanish translation from a male baker (\"el panadero\") to a female baker (\"la panadera bonita\"), correcting the gender to match the pronoun \"she.\"](image5)\n\nThis technique of adding stereotypical gender adjectives has demonstrated an improvement in gender translation accuracy for some languages. Specifically, in tests using Google Translate with a modified WinoMT dataset, this approach significantly reduced bias and improved performance in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [9], [5]. For these languages, the gender prediction accuracy saw a notable increase when such adjectives were prepended to entities.\n![A table shows that adding stereotypical adjectives increased gender prediction accuracy for Google Translate in Spanish from 53.1% to 63.5% (+10.4%), in Russian from 37.7% to 48.9% (+11.2%), and in Ukrainian from 38.4% to 42.9% (+4.5%).](image7)\n\nStereotype-based adjustments, such as adding gender-specific adjectives, can improve gender accuracy in machine translation for certain languages by providing stronger gender cues that help counteract existing biases."}

For instance, a single-paragraph BERT model can achieve a strong F1 score of 67.08 in a standard distractor setting [6].\n`![F1 scores for various models including Single-paragraph BERT in Distractor and Open settings.](image2)`\nHowever, introducing more challenging evaluation conditions affects these scores. When models trained on standard distractors are evaluated against adversarially selected distractors, their performance can significantly decline; for example, from 67.08 F1 down to 46.84 F1 [4]. Retraining the model on these adversarial distractors can help recover some of this performance, bringing the F1 score up to 60.10 on the same adversarial set [4].\n`![Table showing F1 scores for original and adversarial training evaluated on original, adversarial, and adversarial + type data.](image8)`\nFurther evaluation strategies, such as filtering distractors by entity type, can also impact scores. A model trained on original distractors sees its F1 drop to 40.73 when tested on adversarial distractors with type filtering. In contrast, a model trained on adversarially selected distractors can achieve a higher F1 of 58.42 under the same conditions [1, 10].\n\nThe evaluation setting also plays a crucial role. In open-domain settings, single-hop models tend to struggle, largely due to difficulties in retrieving all necessary evidence paragraphs [8].\n`![Table showing F1 scores for distractor and various open-domain settings, including with gold paragraph.](image7)`\nFor example, a model might achieve an F1 score of 39.12 when evaluated with 500 retrieved paragraphs in an open-domain setting. This score can improve to 53.12 F1 if the gold (correct) paragraphs are manually added to the set of 500 paragraphs, demonstrating the critical role of effective information retrieval [8]. Single-hop models also show limitations with inherently multi-hop questions, such as many comparison questions, where they might achieve near chance accuracy [7].\n`![Table showing F1 scores for multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop question types.](image1)`\nThis is reflected in varying F1 scores for different question types, where multi-hop questions generally yield lower F1 scores compared to single-hop questions for the same model.\n\nDifferent training strategies like using adversarial distractors and evaluation settings such as open-domain or type-filtered conditions significantly impact F1 scores by testing model robustness and generalization."}

Instead, BERT was found to be exploiting spurious statistical cues within the dataset, such as the presence of specific words like \"not\" in the warrant, and its surprising performance could be entirely accounted for by this exploitation [1], [2].\n\nTo create a more robust evaluation, an adversarial dataset was constructed. This process involves taking each original data point, negating its claim, and inverting the label, effectively mirroring the distribution of statistical cues across both labels and eliminating the signal they provided [8], [9].\n`![This image illustrates the transformation of an original data point into an adversarial one by negating the claim and altering the warrant.](image6)`\nWhen models, including BERT, were trained from scratch and then evaluated on this adversarial dataset, their performance plummeted [6].

The adversarial dataset, by removing these easily exploitable cues, therefore provides a more reliable benchmark for assessing true argument comprehension abilities and should be adopted as the standard for future work on ARCT [1], [3], [6].\n\nThe adversarial data setup causes BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset to drop to random levels, demonstrating that its initial high scores were based on exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuine argument comprehension."}

Sensitivity quantifies the number of unique outputs a word recognition model produces when faced with perturbed inputs; a lower sensitivity means fewer options for an attacker [3], [5], [11]. There's often a trade-off: a low error rate can come at the cost of increased sensitivity, though sensitivity is generally the more dominant factor when error rates are already reasonably low [12].\n\n![The scatter plots show the trade-off between sensitivity and word error rate (WER) for word-only (left) and char-only (right) models using Pass-through, Background, and Neutral backoff strategies, with bubble size indicating robustness.](image3)\n\nFor **closed vocabulary models** (e.g., word-only models), where out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are often treated similarly [8], the differences in sensitivity and WER across backoff strategies are observed. In these models, the pass-through strategy can be less sensitive than the background variant because it renders all OOV character combinations identical [6]. The Neutral backoff, which involves mapping unknown (UNK) predictions to a fixed neutral word like ‘a’ [1], is designed to have low sensitivity [3].\nThe data in `image6` under \"Closed Vocabulary Models (word-only)\" shows \"All\" values (which can be interpreted as overall sensitivity) of 11.3 for both Pass-Through and Neutral strategies, and a higher 13.1 for the Background strategy.\n\n![This table shows aggregated performance metrics, likely related to sensitivity, for closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies (Pass-Through, Background, Neutral) across various attack types.](image6)\n\nThis aligns with the left plot in `image3` for word-only models, where Pass-through and Neutral variants exhibit a sensitivity of approximately 12.

The pass-through version is considerably more sensitive than the background variant in these models because it passes words as they are, allowing each unique combination [6]. Conversely, the neutral backoff variant consistently demonstrates the lowest sensitivity as it maps all UNK predictions to a single, fixed neutral word, thus reducing the variety of unique outputs [8].\nThe data for open vocabulary models in `image6` indicates that the Neutral strategy has the lowest \"All\" value (sensitivity) of 11.3. The Background strategy follows with 14.7, and the Pass-Through strategy has the highest sensitivity at 30.3.\nThis pattern is clearly illustrated in the right plot of `image3` for char-only models:\n*   The Neutral strategy has the lowest sensitivity (around 12) but a relatively high WER (11).\n*   The Background strategy offers a good balance with the lowest WER (7) and low sensitivity (around 10).\n*   The Pass-Through strategy has a moderate WER (around 10) but a markedly high sensitivity (around 30).\n\nUsing background models as a backoff can lead to additional gains due to lower WER, especially under certain attacks, because they might be trained on larger, more general corpora, helping to handle rare or unseen words effectively [3], [4].\n\n![This diagram illustrates a hybrid model that can use a Background Model to supplement a Foreground Model, especially for inputs the Foreground Model might recognize as UNK (unknown).](image1)\n\nFor closed vocabulary models, Neutral and Pass-Through backoffs generally yield lower sensitivity, while for open vocabulary models, Neutral backoff is the least sensitive, Pass-Through is the most sensitive, and Background offers a balance between WER and sensitivity."}

Aggregating these key segment results indicates a substantial improvement in overall profitability, moving from a consolidated net loss calculated from these segments of approximately $2.378 billion in 2020 to a consolidated net income of approximately $18.725 billion in 2021.\n\nRegarding shareholder returns, one of the key metrics listed in the company's financial and operating highlights is the \"Return on stockholders’ equity\" [3]. Financial tables, such as the one described in image6, are expected to contain such data. The description of image6 notes that the table includes \"Percentages such as 18.4%, 25.2%, 15.6%, etc.\" ![The financial table in image6 includes example financial percentages, one of which is 15.6%.](image6). If \"15.6%\" represents the Return on Stockholders' Equity for 2021, it would indicate a positive return for that year. However, the provided quotes do not contain a corresponding specific percentage for the 2020 Return on Stockholders' Equity, which makes it difficult to describe the precise change in this metric between the two years.\n\nChevron Corporation's net income improved substantially from a net loss in 2020 to a significant net income in 2021; while a return on stockholders' equity of 15.6% is suggested for 2021 from available data, the 2020 figure is not provided in the quotes, thus the change in this specific metric cannot be fully determined."}

The Company's heavily franchised business model, which usually generates stable revenue, was negatively impacted by government regulations due to COVID-19 resurgences, affecting revenue in the near term [11].\n\nOther comprehensive income (OCI) also played a significant role in the year-over-year changes. In 2020, McDonald's experienced a total OCI loss, net of tax, of $(104.1) million.

The expansion in receivables was influenced by a significant rise in commercial billed business, which increased by 21 percent in 2021, signaling a recovery from the prior year's pandemic-related impacts [10]. An improved macroeconomic outlook and enhanced portfolio quality also played a role in this upward trend in receivables [7, 9].\n\nOverall, GCS net interest income increased from 2019 to 2021 primarily due to reduced funding costs, and GCS card member receivables rose largely because of increased commercial billed business and a more favorable economic environment."}

Key trends in OCI components included:\n*   **Foreign currency translation:** This shifted from losses of $(305,225) thousand in 2018 and $(132,707) thousand in 2019 to a gain of $197,696 thousand in 2020.\n*   **Defined benefit plans:** This component experienced fluctuations, with income of $21,335 thousand in 2018, a substantial loss of $(253,039) thousand in 2019, and then income of $57,100 thousand in 2020.\n*   **Cash flow hedges:** These moved from a loss of $(198,645) thousand in 2018 to gains of $123,003 thousand in 2019 and $24,721 thousand in 2020.\n*   **Investments:** This had a minor impact, showing a small gain in 2018 and small losses in 2019 and 2020.\n\nComprehensive income directly impacts shareholders' equity. Net income increases the retained earnings component of equity, while OCI items are accumulated in the \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" section of shareholders' equity. The Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity Statements provide a detailed account of these changes for the years ended August 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 [7].\n![The table shows a summary of shareholder equity changes for Accenture plc as of August 31, 2020, detailing how net income increases retained earnings and how other comprehensive income contributes to total shareholders’ equity.](image3)\nFor instance, the equity statement for the year ending August 31, 2020, reflects additions to retained earnings from net income and adjustments from other comprehensive income, both contributing to the overall change in total shareholders' equity.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Accenture's total comprehensive income grew due to rising net income and a turnaround in other comprehensive income from loss to gain, with these financial results directly accumulating within and increasing total shareholders' equity."}

However, other factors also influenced the change in equity. For instance, Berkshire continued its share repurchase program, acquiring $27,014 million of its treasury stock in 2021, which reduces shareholders' equity [12].\n![This cash flow statement shows $27,014 million was used for acquisition of treasury stock in 2021.](image1)\nWhen considering the net earnings of $89.8 billion [10] (or $89,795 million attributable to shareholders), less the $27,014 million for share repurchases, and adding the net effect of other comprehensive income attributable to shareholders (approximately $216 million, derived from the difference between comprehensive income attributable to shareholders of $90,011 million and net earnings attributable to shareholders of $89,795 million), the resulting figure closely aligns with the $63.0 billion increase in shareholders' equity. The substantial after-tax gains on investments, amounting to approximately $61.6 billion, were a major component of the net earnings [10], and these unrealized gains also contributed to the increase in deferred tax liabilities observed on the balance sheet.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, total liabilities increased by $21.46 billion and shareholders' equity grew by $63.0 billion; this equity growth was primarily driven by $89.8 billion in net earnings, partially offset by share repurchases, and also reflected the impact of other comprehensive income."}

This turnaround was influenced by several key factors across IBM's cash flow activities.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3,426 million in 2020, reaching $18,197 million compared to $14,770 million in 2019 [3], [8]. This increase was driven primarily by a significant rise in cash provided by receivables, which included sales of financing receivables [9].\n\nNet cash used in investing activities saw a dramatic decrease. In 2020, IBM used $3,028 million for investing activities, substantially less than the $26,936 million used in 2019. This decrease of $23.9 billion was primarily driven by a $32.3 billion decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, as the major acquisition of Red Hat occurred in the prior year (2019) [7], [1]. This was partially offset by a $6.2 billion decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, mainly due to the wind-down of OEM IT commercial financing operations [7], [1].\n\nFinancing activities shifted from being a net source of cash in 2019 to a net use of cash in 2020. Net cash used in financing activities was $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 [12]. This year-to-year change of $18,763 million was largely due to a decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions; there was a higher level of net additions in the prior year to fund the Red Hat acquisition [12], [6]. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases [6]. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash also played a minor role, contributing a negative $87 million in 2020 compared to a negative $167 million in 2019.\n\nThe significant reduction in cash used for acquisitions (investing activities) and a robust increase in cash from operations more than compensated for the shift in financing activities from a source to a use, leading to a positive net change in cash for 2020."}

These revenue declines were particularly significant in international markets, stemming from temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key countries such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3]. The shift in revenue contribution from different segments can be seen in the changing proportions over the years.\n`![Pie charts showing the percentage breakdown of total revenues by segment for 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image3)`\nAlthough the U.S. market demonstrated positive sales performance, this was insufficient to counteract the international downturn and the costs associated with marketing support initiatives, including the provision of free Thank You Meals to first responders and healthcare workers [1]. The company acknowledged that its heavily franchised business model, while typically generating stable revenue, was impacted, with expectations that government regulations related to COVID-19 resurgences would continue to negatively affect revenue in the near term [12].\n\nSimilarly, total restaurant margins also saw a significant decrease in 2020. Total restaurant margins decreased by 13% (13% in constant currencies) during the year [8].\n`![The table shows total restaurant margins were $9,677.2 million in 2020, down from $11,114.7 million in 2019, a decrease of 12.9%.](image2)`\nThis reduction in margins was largely attributed to the same sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment due to COVID-19, though positive sales performance in the U.S. provided a partial offset [8]. Furthermore, Company-operated margins were specifically impacted by incremental COVID-19 related expenses, which included costs for employee support, personal protective equipment, and restaurant signage [10]. In the U.S., franchised margins were affected by higher depreciation costs linked to investments in Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\"), as well as the previously mentioned marketing support efforts [11]. The nature of the operating model, where franchised margin expenses like lease and depreciation are mainly fixed, means that sales declines disproportionately affect these margins [7].\n\nTotal revenues decreased by 10% and total restaurant margins decreased by 13% from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to COVID-19 related sales declines in international markets, alongside increased operational and marketing support costs."}

NBCUniversal experienced higher expenses, largely due to increased activities and investments in its Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [7]. This included costs associated with the Universal Beijing Resort, which had pre-opening costs prior to its launch in September 2021 and subsequent operating costs [1, 9]. The Cable Communications segment's expenses rose primarily due to increased programming costs, technical and product support expenses, franchise and other regulatory fees, and spending on advertising, marketing, and promotion [7]. For the Sky segment, an increase in direct network costs and other expenses led to higher overall expenses, though this was partially offset by lower programming and production costs and favorable foreign currency translation effects [7]. In contrast, Corporate and Other expenses decreased, mainly because the prior year period (2020) included severance charges that were not repeated in 2021 [7].\n\nThe main contributors to Comcast's consolidated revenue increase from 2020 to 2021 were primarily the NBCUniversal and Cable Communications segments, while operating expense changes were driven by increased activities and specific cost pressures within NBCUniversal, Cable Communications, and Sky, alongside a decrease in corporate expenses."}

Consequently, the segment's Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE), excluding significant items and the UK bank levy, decreased from 9.8% in 2019 to 6.7% in 2020 [image7].

This change is reflected in the consolidated statements of income `![A financial table detailing revenues, expenses, operating income, net income, and per unit data for 2018-2020.](image2)`. A key factor was a $22 million decrease in total revenue in 2020 [11]. This included a $53 million fall in transportation services revenue, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower rates on Zydeco contracts, planned turnarounds, and storms, though new volumes at NaKika and Odyssey, and increased tariffs on Delta provided some offset [3]. Allowance oil revenue also declined by $12 million and product revenue by $21 million, while terminaling services revenue increased by $63 million [11]. On the expense side, certain operating costs were lower; for instance, aggregate expenses charged by Shell Pipeline and Chevron decreased from approximately $23.5 million in 2019 to $10.7 million in 2020 [6].

This positive change was partly due to a decrease in capital expenditures, which fell from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020, a result of the completion of projects like the Houma tank expansion and Zydeco directional drills [2]. Additionally, the Partnership made no contributions to investment in 2020, further reducing cash outflows for investing activities [2]. While the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020 would have been a cash outflow [5], the substantial swing to a net provision of cash suggests that other investing activities, such as returns of investment or proceeds from asset disposals not detailed in the text quotes but typically found in the cash flow statement, likely played a role in this change.\n\nShell Midstream Partners, L.P.'s operating income decreased from 2019 to 2020 mainly due to reduced revenues outweighing some cost decreases and new amortization, while its cash from investing activities changed from a net use to a net provision primarily because of lower capital spending and no investment contributions, alongside other potential investing inflows."}

This performance was supported by continued strong concentrator throughput, which reached record levels, alongside lower deferred stripping costs and higher by-product credits. Additionally, a one-off gain from the optimisation of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts, as part of Escondida's shift towards 100 per cent renewable energy, contributed positively. These strong results were achieved despite challenges such as unfavourable exchange rate movements, a 4 per cent decline in copper concentrate feed grade, and lower cathode volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions [2]. For FY2021, Escondida's financial figures included revenues of $9,470 million, an Underlying EBITDA of $6,483 million, and sales of 2,350 million pounds of copper, maintaining a cost per pound of $1.00 ![Escondida's financial and sales data for FY2021, detailing revenue, EBITDA, gross and net costs, sales volume in kt and Mlb, and cost per pound.](image1).\n\nWAIO also had a strong year, with production increasing by 1 per cent to a record 252 Mt (284 Mt on a 100% basis) [11]. This increase was driven by record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, which saw first ore from South Flank in May 2021, combined with robust operational performance across the supply chain. These achievements were realized despite significant weather impacts and temporary rail labour shortages due to COVID-19 related border restrictions [11]. WAIO's financial performance in FY2021 reflected this strong production and favourable market conditions, with revenues reaching $34,337 million and an Underlying EBITDA of $26,270 million.

The increase in Iron Ore's Underlying EBITDA by US$11.7 billion to $26.3 billion was largely due to favourable price impacts, net of price-linked costs, amounting to US$12.1 billion, while higher volumes contributed an additional US$148 million. However, unfavourable foreign exchange impacts negatively affected Underlying EBITDA by US$416 million [12].\n\nThe prices obtained for products are a key driver of value, and fluctuations in commodity prices significantly affect financial results, including cash flows and asset values [4]. The sensitivity of Underlying EBITDA to commodity price changes in FY2021 was notable: a US¢1 per pound increase in the copper price was estimated to impact Underlying EBITDA by $33 million, while a US$1 per ton increase in the iron ore price would impact Underlying EBITDA by $233 million ![Table showing the estimated financial impact of a unit change in various commodity prices on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA.](image5).\n\nIn FY2021, WAIO generated substantially higher revenue and EBITDA than Escondida, largely driven by a significant rise in iron ore prices, while Escondida maintained stable unit costs and strong production despite operational challenges."}

In contrast, consumer loans decreased, mainly driven by a reduction in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio. This was attributed to loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment and a significant transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) [8]. The loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, included substantial commercial and consumer segments with varying maturities.\n![{The table details loan maturities and interest rate structures as of December 31, 2021, with commercial loans including $350,436 million in commercial and industrial, and consumer loans including $242,270 million in residential mortgage first liens.}](image1)\nConcurrently, the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) for loans decreased by $5.9 billion, or 30%, from December 31, 2020, reflecting better portfolio credit quality and continued improvements in economic conditions [2].\n\nOn the funding side, total deposits increased from December 31, 2020 [7].\n![{The table shows total deposits increased by 6% from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, alongside a breakdown by deposit type.}](image3)\nThis growth included a 13% increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a 9% increase in savings deposits (image3). However, there were significant declines in time deposits, which fell by 41%, and in interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, which decreased by 44% (image3). These reductions were influenced by \"actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of deposit (CDs), and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices\" [10]. All non-U.S. time deposits are uninsured [1].\n![{The table details time deposit balances as of December 31, 2021, with domestic time deposits at $4,597 million and non-U.S. time deposits at $551 million, totaling $5,148 million.}](image5)\nOverall, total deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits, or are otherwise uninsured, were estimated to be $590 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase from $560 billion at the end of 2020 [3].\n\nThese changes in loan and deposit figures suggest a financial strategy focused on growing the commercial loan book while actively managing and rebalancing the consumer loan portfolio, particularly residential mortgages. The reduction in certain deposit categories, like time deposits and non-U.S. office deposits, points towards an effort to optimize the funding mix and manage the balance sheet size, likely in response to regulatory constraints such as an asset cap [10], while growing lower-cost core deposits.\n\nFrom December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, total loans increased slightly due to commercial loan growth offsetting a decrease in consumer loans, while total deposits grew with a strategic shift towards core deposits and a reduction in time and non-U.S. office deposits, indicating a strategy of commercial lending expansion, consumer portfolio rebalancing, and deposit optimization likely influenced by asset cap management."}

This significant decrease of $4,669 million was largely due to substantial one-time licensing revenues in earlier years, such as those from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in fiscal 2019 and licensing revenues from Huawei in fiscal 2020, which did not recur at the same scale in 2021. In fiscal 2021, unallocated revenues were primarily comprised of the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results [5].\n\nConcurrently, total unallocated expenses increased in magnitude. Based on the components detailed in the financial data, these expenses include unallocated cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, other income (expenses), and interest expense.\n![The table displays unallocated revenues of $4,723M in 2019, $1,841M in 2020, and $54M in 2021, alongside other unallocated financial items including R&D expenses of ($989M) in 2019 and ($1,820M) in 2021.](image6)\nThe sum of these unallocated expenses was approximately $2,865 million in 2019 (calculated as $430M cost of revenues + $989M R&D + $413M SG&A + $414M other expenses + $619M interest expense). By 2021, this sum increased to approximately $3,194 million (calculated as $277M cost of revenues + $1,820M R&D + $538M SG&A + $0M other expenses + $559M interest expense). This represents an increase in the magnitude of unallocated expenses by $329 million from 2019 to 2021. A significant driver of this increase was unallocated R&D expenses, which rose from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021. Unallocated charges can include items such as certain share-based compensation, certain R&D expenses, and acquisition-related charges [3].\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the company completed the acquisition of NUVIA [4]. The net assets acquired in this transaction totaled $1,264 million.\n![The table shows assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the NUVIA acquisition, resulting in net assets acquired of $1,264 million.](image4)\nThis acquisition occurred on March 16, 2021, for $1.1 billion (net of cash acquired) [4]. While the operating results of NUVIA in fiscal 2021 were not material [7], acquisition-related costs, such as a portion of the $258 million in Qualcomm stock awards replacing NUVIA stock awards (recognized as compensation expense over the post-acquisition service period) [4], could contribute to unallocated expenses.\n\nComparing these changes, the decrease in unallocated revenues of $4,669 million from 2019 to 2021 was substantially larger—more than 3.5 times—the $1,264 million in net assets acquired from NUVIA. The increase in the magnitude of unallocated expenses by $329 million over the same period was considerably smaller, representing about one-fourth of the NUVIA net assets acquired.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, unallocated revenues decreased by $4,669 million primarily due to non-recurring large settlements, while the magnitude of unallocated expenses increased by $329 million, with these changes significantly differing in scale compared to the $1,264 million in net assets acquired from NUVIA in 2021."}

This growth was primarily fueled by higher net cash provided by operating activities, which climbed to $10.6 billion in 2020 from $9.6 billion in the prior year [7]. The rise in operating cash flow was mainly due to lower net cash tax payments and reduced pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in 2020 [7]. Capital spending remained relatively consistent. PepsiCo typically uses its free cash flow for acquisitions and various financing activities, such as debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases [5].\n\nThe company's financial activities in 2020 were significant. Net cash used for investing activities saw a substantial rise to $11.6 billion. This was largely driven by acquisitions, including Rockstar for $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods for $1.2 billion, and Be & Cheery for $0.7 billion, in addition to net capital spending of $4.2 billion [9].\n`![Summary of PepsiCo's cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities for 2020 and 2019.](image8)`\nAs detailed here, net cash used for investing activities was $11,619 million in 2020, a considerable increase from $6,437 million in 2019.\n\nFinancing activities also played a key role. In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $3.8 billion, chiefly from proceeds of $13.8 billion in long-term debt issuances [12]. This inflow was partly offset by $7.5 billion returned to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases, $1.8 billion in payments of long-term debt borrowings, and $1.1 billion in debt redemptions [12]. Looking ahead to 2021, PepsiCo anticipated returning about $5.9 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases [6]. In contrast, 2019 saw net cash used for financing activities of $8.5 billion, mainly due to $8.3 billion in dividend payments and share repurchases, $4.0 billion in payments of long-term debt, and $1.0 billion in debt redemptions, which were partially offset by $4.6 billion from long-term debt issuances [3].\n\nThese financial maneuvers, especially the increased debt, influenced PepsiCo's contractual commitments.\n`![Breakdown of PepsiCo's contractual commitments and liabilities by due period.](image2)`\nBy December 26, 2020, PepsiCo's total contractual commitments reached $66,321 million.

Other commitments include interest on debt obligations ($15,988 million), operating leases, and tax liabilities, as detailed with further context in the notes [10]. The increased issuance of long-term debt in 2020 was a primary contributor to these heightened obligations. For instance, commitments also encompass elements tied to acquisitions, such as estimated future tax benefits from the Rockstar acquisition and support for socioeconomic programs in South Africa linked to the Pioneer Foods acquisition [10] (e).\n\nPepsiCo's financial activities in 2020 resulted in an increased free cash flow compared to 2019, primarily due to higher operating cash flow, and also led to greater contractual commitments, largely driven by increased debt issuance to finance acquisitions and shareholder returns."}

Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, such an increase in discount rates generally reduces the present value of plan obligations [6]. This reduction in obligations contributed to actuarial gains in 2022 for both pension and other retiree benefit plans [8].\n\nDuring the same period, the expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022.

The expected return on plan assets assumption is a significant component in determining the defined benefit expense; a lower expected rate of return, as seen with Pension Benefits, typically leads to a higher net periodic benefit cost [4].\n\nThese changes in key actuarial assumptions influenced the net amount recognized on the balance sheet. For Pension Benefits, the net liability decreased from $(5,428) million as of June 30, 2021, to $(2,435) million as of June 30, 2022.

The significant increase in discount rates directly lowered the calculated benefit obligations, thereby playing a primary role in improving the net recognized amounts for both pension and other retiree benefits [6, 8]. Conversely, the decrease in the expected return on plan assets for pension benefits would tend to increase the annual pension expense [4], which could, over time, put pressure on the net funded status if not offset by other factors such as higher actual returns or contributions.\n\nThe increase in discount rates directly reduced benefit obligations, thus improving the net amount recognized for both pension and other retiree benefits, while the decrease in the expected return on pension assets would primarily increase the pension expense."}

Interest and other investment income saw a substantial decrease of $470 million, or 44.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities as low interest rates persisted through 2021 [4]. Despite these conditions, the company maintained significant holdings in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, prioritizing liquidity and safety over higher yields [4]. In contrast, dividend income provided a partial offset, increasing by $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019, and further by 3.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reaching $5,060 million in 2021 [5].\n\nThe asset composition of the insurance business also underwent notable changes between year-end 2020 and 2021.\n![Asset composition as of Dec 31, 2021, and Dec 31, 2020, shows an increase in cash and equity securities, and a decrease in fixed maturity securities.](image3)\nSpecifically, holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills rose from $67,082 million at December 31, 2020, to $90,688 million at December 31, 2021. Equity securities also increased, from $269,498 million to $334,907 million over the same period. Conversely, fixed maturity securities declined from $20,317 million to $16,386 million.\n\nThese shifts in net investment income and asset composition have several implications. The decline in investment income, particularly from interest-bearing assets, underscores the negative impact of low interest rates on returns from substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills [1, 4]. The decision to increase cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bill holdings, despite their low yield, highlights a strategic emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity [4]. Concurrently, the increased allocation to equity securities, while potentially offering higher returns, also heightens the portfolio's exposure to market fluctuations, as unrealized gains and losses from these investments significantly affect periodic net earnings [7].\n\nNet investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to lower interest income, while the asset composition shifted towards increased cash and equity securities and reduced fixed maturity securities, reflecting a strategy of prioritizing liquidity and seeking growth amidst low interest rates, which also implies greater exposure to equity market volatility."}

Country-level data reveals significant declines in Argentina (down by 12.2%), Colombia (down by 14.2%), and Mexico (down by 18.0%) [12]. Canada also saw an 18.6% decrease in shipment volume, largely attributed to the unfavorable impact of the deconsolidation of Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) [12]. This deconsolidation of RBH was a significant financial activity that reduced PMI's total shipment volume by approximately 1.0 billion units globally [9] and had a considerable effect on the region's figures [10], [11].

Despite this decrease in net revenues, operating income for Latin America & Canada more than doubled, surging from $235 million in 2019 to $564 million in 2020 [image5]. This significant improvement in operating income was chiefly due to favorable pricing, contributing a $135 million positive impact, and a substantial positive effect from \"Cost/Other\" factors, amounting to $523 million [image5]. These \"Cost/Other\" improvements may be linked to ongoing global manufacturing infrastructure optimization efforts, such as the plant closures in Argentina and Colombia during 2019, which involved asset impairment and exit costs [1], potentially leading to reduced operating costs in 2020.

This capital increase led to a €53 million rise in issued capital and a €2,275 million increase in capital reserves [7]. Net income for the year also contributed positively to this growth [4].

Additionally, cash flow benefited from lower actual payments for this short-term incentive compensation [5]. These positive factors were somewhat moderated by increased working capital requirements during the year [5].\n\nThe implications of these financial changes are generally positive for business operations. A change in total assets, particularly an increase, if directed towards productive capacity or strategic investments, can lay the groundwork for future revenue growth. The substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities is particularly significant as it indicates a stronger ability of the core business to generate cash. This enhanced cash generation improves liquidity, provides greater financial flexibility for investments in growth initiatives, allows for debt reduction, or enables increased returns to shareholders. The fact that this cash flow growth was achieved through improved profitability, even while accommodating higher working capital needs, points to robust operational performance in 2021 [5].\n\nTherefore, the company experienced a change in its consolidated total assets and a significant improvement in its consolidated cash flow from operating activities between 2020 and 2021, indicating enhanced financial health and operational strength."}

This higher sales volume was a result of increased end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as the impact from changes in dealer inventories [3]. Specifically, dealers decreased their inventories by a smaller amount in the fourth quarter of 2021 (about $100 million) compared to a more substantial decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020 (about $1,100 billion) [8]. This trend was observed across various regions; for instance, North America saw a 29 percent sales increase due to changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand [2], EAME sales rose 24 percent for similar reasons [4], and Asia/Pacific sales increased by 9 percent, also influenced by dealer inventory changes and end-user demand [6]. Construction Industries experienced a 27 percent increase in total sales, driven by higher sales volume from changes in dealer inventories and increased end-user demand [9].

Higher sales volume positively impacted profit by $687 million, and favorable price realization added another $507 million. However, these gains were partially offset by increased manufacturing costs (which reduced profit by $816 million) and higher SG&A/R&D expenses (reducing profit by $272 million) [12]. The increased manufacturing costs were attributed to higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs [1]. Despite the absolute increase in operating profit, the operating profit margin slightly decreased from 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 11.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021 [5]. Financial Products' segment profit also contributed positively, increasing by $53 million, mainly due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower provision for credit losses [10].\n\nSales volume increased by $2,049 million and operating profit increased by $231 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher end-user demand, changes in dealer inventories, and favorable price realization, though offset by increased manufacturing and operational costs."}

As a lessee, the Group now recognizes a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use underlying assets, and lease liabilities, representing its obligation to make lease payments [4].\n\nA key financial impact of this transition was the initial recognition of lease liabilities.\n![Table showing lease liabilities for 2020, including the initial recognition of $143,621 thousand due to AASB 16.](image1)\nAs shown, on the initial application of AASB 16, a lease liability of $143,621 thousand was recognized, establishing the adjusted balance at 1 July 2019 [image1]. For leases previously classified as operating leases under AASB 117, these new lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 July 2019 [9]. Correspondingly, right-of-use assets were measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by any prepaid or accrued lease payments [9].\n\nThe transition to AASB 16 also altered the accounting for specific lease-related items. For instance, the Group no longer recognizes provisions for operating leases deemed onerous; instead, the payments due under these leases are now accounted for within the Group's lease liability [image2].\n![Table describing that from July 1, 2019, provisions for onerous operating leases are no longer recognized and are part of the lease liability.](image2)\nSimilarly, provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives are no longer recognized; instead, payments due under the lease are included in its lease liability. Any straight-lining prepaid rent account was capitalized as part of the right-of-use asset upon transition [image7].\n![Table explaining that upon transition to AASB 16, straight-lining prepaid rent is capitalized and provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives are no longer recognized, with payments included in lease liability.](image7)\nFurthermore, since the adoption of AASB 16, site restoration costs are now capitalized as part of the lease right-of-use asset [3]. During the year ended 28 June 2020, there were further additions to lease liabilities of $50,245 thousand, re-measurements, lease payments, and interest, resulting in a total lease liability of $167,154 thousand at year-end [image1].\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, these include obligations for annual leave and long-service leave [1, 10].\n![Table showing consolidated employee benefit liabilities of $4,092 thousand in 2020 and $4,054 thousand in 2019.](image3)\nIn 2020, total employee benefit liabilities amounted to $4,092 thousand, compared to $4,054 thousand in 2019 [image3]. The provided information does not indicate a direct financial impact on employee benefit liabilities resulting from the transition to AASB 16.\n\nThe transition to AASB 16 in 2020 resulted in an initial recognition of lease liabilities amounting to $143,621 thousand and altered accounting for items like onerous leases and site restoration, while employee benefit liabilities stood at $4,092 thousand in 2020 without a specified direct impact from this accounting standard change."}

This charge was due to an existing reseller agreement whose terms were determined not to be at fair value, as it provided the Company's products and services to Salesforce.org at no cost [4, 10].\n\nBoth acquisitions share similarities in that the goodwill recorded was primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities, and the majority of this goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes [6, 8]. In both cases, the initial fair value assessments were based on management's estimates and were subject to finalization within one year [6, 8].\n\nKey differences lie in the scale and nature of the transactions and resulting asset allocations. The ClickSoftware acquisition was substantially larger, leading to higher net assets and goodwill. ClickSoftware's allocation prominently featured specific identifiable intangible assets like developed technology and customer relationships, which were not detailed in the same manner for Salesforce.org's net asset breakdown. Moreover, the ClickSoftware deal led to a recognized gain from a pre-existing investment [7], whereas the Salesforce.org combination resulted in a substantial non-cash expense due to the settlement of a pre-existing reseller agreement [4]. The types of deferred tax items also differed, with a deferred tax liability for ClickSoftware [8] and a deferred tax asset for Salesforce.org [image1].\n\nThe primary differences in fair value allocation were the significantly larger scale and specific intangible asset identification (developed technology, customer relationships) in the ClickSoftware acquisition compared to Salesforce.org, while similarities included the attribution of goodwill and its tax non-deductibility."}

This suggests consumers were more hesitant to take on new home equity debt or were actively paying down existing obligations.\n\nRegarding credit cards, outstanding balances decreased by $18.9 billion in 2020 to $78.7 billion, attributed to lower retail spending and higher payments [11].\n![Credit card purchase volumes decreased while debit card purchase volumes increased.](image7)\nTotal credit card purchase volumes declined by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion, a change driven by the impact of COVID-19, with spending for travel and entertainment remaining particularly low [10]. Conversely, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion in 2020 [10].

These price variations can materially affect revenues and the feasibility of projects [1]. In FY2021, BHP's overall revenue increased by 42% to US$60.8 billion, largely due to higher average realised prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, although this was partly counteracted by lower average realised prices for metallurgical coal and LNG [7].\n\nThe sensitivity of BHP's financial outcomes to these price changes is quantified:\n![The table illustrates the estimated impact on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA from a one-unit change in the price of various commodities, including oil, copper, iron ore, coal, and nickel.](image5)\nFor example, a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price was estimated to reduce FY2021 profit after taxation by US$163 million, while a US$1 per tonne decline in metallurgical coal and energy coal prices would have an impact of US$24 million and US$9 million respectively. Conversely, a US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price would increase profit after taxation by US$1 million [4, image5].\n\nSpecifically for the coal segment, Underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021 [2]. A primary driver for this was lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, which accounted for US$0.7 billion of the decrease [2].\n![This table shows key financial and production data for BHP's coal segment, indicating a decrease in average realised prices for metallurgical coal from $130.97/t in FY2020 to $106.64/t in FY2021, while thermal coal prices slightly increased.](image6)\nThe average realised price for metallurgical coal dropped from US$130.97 per tonne in FY2020 to US$106.64 per tonne in FY2021, whereas thermal coal's average realised price saw a slight increase from US$57.10 to US$58.42 per tonne [image6]. Lower sales volumes further reduced Coal's Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million, and controllable cash costs rose, partly due to increased maintenance [2].\n![This table details the performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC, showing that Queensland Coal's Underlying EBITDA fell from $1,935 million in FY2020 to $593 million in FY2021, while NSWEC's EBITDA loss worsened.](image8)\nQueensland Coal's unit costs are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by factors like higher diesel prices, though the company remains focused on cost reduction [3]. The ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China also affects the outlook for coal [3].\n\nIn contrast, the nickel segment (Nickel West) saw its Underlying EBITDA increase by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021 [9]. This improvement was driven by higher prices and volumes, along with lower maintenance costs [9]. The average realised sales price for nickel increased from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 [6]. This price strength was attributed to positive investor sentiment amid a strong rebound in end-use demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and declining London Metal Exchange stocks [6]. However, these positive factors were partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the increased cost of third-party concentrate purchases due to the higher nickel price [9].\n\nChanges in commodity prices directly impact BHP's revenue and profitability, with lower metallurgical coal prices significantly reducing coal's earnings, while higher nickel prices, driven by strong demand and supply disruptions, boosted nickel's financial results."}

This was a result of new shares being issued, notably a capital increase of 75,000,000 new shares in September 2020 [6] and another 53,000,000 new shares in March 2021 [9], [12].

These share issuances also led to a substantial rise in **Capital Reserve**, as the shares were issued at a premium above their notional value [8], [9]. For example, the March 2021 capital increase resulted in issued capital rising by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,275 million (consolidated) [8].\n\n**Retained Earnings** also grew over this period, bolstered by the company's net income.\n`![Comprehensive income statement for Siemens Healthineers AG for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, showing net income and other comprehensive income components.](image1)`\nThe net income for fiscal year 2021 was €1,746 million, and for fiscal year 2020, it was €1,423 million [image1].

This reduction was primarily due to lower cigarette shipment volume, predominantly in Japan [6]. Japan, a key market, experienced a lower total market, although PMI's market share there was partly bolstered by heated tobacco units [8]. In Korea, a 4.3% decline was noted, mainly due to a lower market share resulting from the growth of the cigarette new taste dimension segment, where PMI has a relatively low presence [10]. A broader factor impacting PMI's total international cigarette sales volume was adult smokers \"out-switching to heated tobacco units\" [3]. In contrast, heated tobacco unit sales in East Asia & Australia grew by 10.4%, increasing from 30,677 million units in 2019 to 33,862 million units in 2020, with this growth largely driven by higher HTU shipment volume in Japan [6, 8].\n\nSimilarly, Latin America & Canada also witnessed a decrease in cigarette shipment volume and an increase in the relatively smaller volume of heated tobacco units during the same period.\n`![PMI shipment volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units in Latin America & Canada for 2020 and 2019, indicating a decrease in cigarette volume and an increase in heated tobacco unit volume.](image7)`\nCigarette shipments in this region fell by 11.8%, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020. This was influenced by a 2.8% decrease in the estimated total market in Latin America & Canada [12]. Several specific country-level factors contributed: Argentina's cigarette volume was down by 12.2%, mainly due to adult smokers down-trading to ultra-low-price local brands and retail out-of-stock issues for PMI brands [1]. Canada experienced an 18.6% decline in cigarette volume, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the deconsolidation of Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) [1, 6, 11]. In Colombia, a 14.2% decrease reflected a lower total market [1], along with reduced product availability and lower adult smoker average daily consumption due to pandemic-related mobility restrictions [5]. Mexico saw an 18.0% decline (related to total market and market share) [1] or a 13.6% decline (related to consumption) [5], driven by a lower total market, adult smoker down-trading after price increases, the impact of excise tax-driven price hikes in January 2020, and pandemic-related effects on consumption patterns [1, 5]. PMI's overall international cigarette market share was also affected by lower cigarette market share in Mexico, among other places [3].\nHeated tobacco unit shipments in Latin America & Canada increased by 50.8%, from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020. While this percentage growth is significant, it is from a small base. The general trend of \"out-switching to heated tobacco units\" [3] likely contributed to this increase.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, both regions saw cigarette sales volumes decline due to market contractions, consumer behavior shifts, and specific local issues, while heated tobacco unit sales volumes increased, notably driven by Japan in East Asia & Australia and reflecting a broader trend of out-switching from cigarettes."}

In 2019, Danaher had offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock which provided approximately $3.0 billion in proceeds, partly to finance the Cytiva Acquisition [12]. In May 2020, the company completed an underwritten public offering of 1.72 million shares of its 5.0% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.67 billion [4]. These issuances directly increased the preferred stock component of stockholders' equity. The Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity show that \"Issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\" amounted to $1,600 million in 2019 and $1,672 million in 2020, raising the preferred stock balance from $0 at the end of 2018 to $3,268 million by the end of 2020. `![The table details increases in preferred stock due to the issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in 2019 and 2020.](image6)`\n\nCash flows from financing activities also played a crucial role. These activities, as a whole, provided net cash of $1,006 million in 2020 and $17,362 million in 2019, a shift from net cash used of $2,674 million in 2018. `![The statement of cash flows indicates substantial net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 and 2020.](image8)` A significant portion of these inflows came from equity financing. For example, the 2020 common stock offering yielded net proceeds of approximately $1.73 billion [4]. The Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity reflect \"Issuance of common stock, net of costs\" contributing $1,395 million in 2019 and $1,730 million in 2020 to equity. While these stock issuances increased equity, other financing activities, such as the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock (e.g., $341 million for common stock and $82 million for MCPS in 2020 as per Image6), reduced retained earnings, a component of stockholders' equity.\n\nCollectively, these financing activities, especially the proceeds from issuing new shares of both common and preferred stock, substantially contributed to the growth in Danaher's total stockholders' equity. The total Danaher stockholders' equity increased from $26,600 million at the end of 2018 to $30,271 million at the end of 2019, and further to $39,766 million by December 31, 2020, as detailed in the financial statements. `![The balance sheet reflects a growth in total Danaher stockholders' equity from $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020.](image2)`\n\nThe issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock directly increased stockholders' equity through additions to preferred stock, and broader changes in cash flow from financing activities, primarily driven by significant net proceeds from stock issuances, further augmented total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020, despite partial offsets from dividend payments."}

A key driver was the increase in operating income, which rose from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021 ![The table details components of net cash provided by operating activities, including operating income for 2020 ($17,493M) and 2021 ($20,817M).](image6). This improvement in operating income was supported by revenue growth across various segments, including a 20.3% increase in Media segment revenue (to $22.8 billion), a 16.2% rise in Studios segment revenue (to $9.4 billion), and a significant 141.2% jump in Theme Parks segment revenue (to $5.1 billion) as operations recovered from COVID-19 impacts and the Beijing park opened [2].\n\nFurthermore, a substantial contributor to the increased operating cash flow was a reduction in income tax payments. These payments decreased from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021 ![The table indicates payments of income taxes were $3,183M in 2020 and $2,628M in 2021.](image6). This decrease was \"primarily due to the tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange... which reduced tax payments by $\\S1.3$ billion in the current year period and more than offset the higher taxable income from operations in 2021\" [4].\n\nAnother positive impact came from \"proceeds from investments and other,\" which surged from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021 ![The table displays proceeds from investments and other increased from $190M in 2020 to $1,246M in 2021.](image6). This increase \"was primarily due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments\" [3].\n\nNon-cash charges, which are added back to net income to calculate operating cash flow, also contributed. Depreciation and amortization increased from $13,100 million in 2020 to $13,804 million in 2021, and noncash share-based compensation rose from $1,193 million to $1,315 million over the same period ![The table lists depreciation and amortization as $13,100M (2020) and $13,804M (2021), and noncash share-based compensation as $1,193M (2020) and $1,315M (2021).](image6).\n\nConversely, \"Changes in operating assets and liabilities\" had a more significant negative impact on cash flow in 2021 (a use of $1,499 million) compared to 2020 (a use of $178 million) ![The table shows changes in operating assets and liabilities were -$178M in 2020 and -$1,499M in 2021.](image6). This greater use of cash in 2021 \"was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics,\" with these decreases partially offset by increases related to theme park operations [9].\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to higher operating income, lower income tax payments, and increased proceeds from investments, partially offset by a greater use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities."}

Consolidated financial data from 2018 shows that sales were $17,049 million and gross profit was $9,505 million.\n![Consolidated financial performance including sales and gross profit for 2018-2020.](image4)\nFor the same year, Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses were $5,391 million, and Research and Development (R&D) expenses were $1,059 million.\n![Consolidated operating expenses including SG&A and R&D for 2018-2020.](image8)\nOperating profit for 2018 is calculated as Gross Profit minus SG&A and R&D expenses ($9,505M - $5,391M - $1,059M), which equals $3,055M. Therefore, the operating profit as a percentage of sales for 2018 was approximately 17.9% ($3,055M / $17,049M).\n\nComparing the 2018 operating profit margin of approximately 17.9% to the 2020 margin of 19.0% [5], there was an increase of about 1.1 percentage points. This increase in operating profit margin from 2018 to 2020 indicates an improvement in the company's overall profitability and operational efficiency during this period. Several factors contributed to this improvement. For instance, total sales increased by 24.5% in 2020 compared to the prior year, driven by acquisitions and core sales growth, which can lead to better absorption of fixed costs [3, 6]. Furthermore, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales saw a decline in 2020, partly due to increased leverage from higher sales volumes and cost-saving initiatives [1]. The positive impact on operating profit margins in 2020 was also due to higher core sales volumes, lower spending on business travel (as a result of the pandemic), and ongoing productivity improvements [7].\n\nThe operating profit as a percentage of sales increased from approximately 17.9% in 2018 to 19.0% in 2020, indicating improved overall profitability and operational efficiency."}

This represents an increase of $2,147 million. This overall change was driven by two main components: the profit of consolidated and affiliated companies and other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nThe profit of consolidated and affiliated companies rose to $6,493 million in 2021 from $3,003 million in 2020 [image6]. This substantial increase in profit was primarily due to a 22% rise in sales and revenues, which reached $50.971 billion in 2021 compared to $41.748 billion in 2020 [5]. This growth in sales was driven by higher sales volume from increased end-user demand for equipment and services, changes in dealer inventories, and favorable price realization [5], [8]. Further contributing to the higher profit were mark-to-market gains from the remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans, a lower effective tax rate (22.9% in 2021 versus 27.8% in 2020, excluding certain discrete items), favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange gains, and lower restructuring expenses [5], [3]. These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses [5], [2].\n\nConversely, the \"Total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\" component saw a negative shift. It changed from an income of $679 million in 2020 to a loss of $(665) million in 2021 [image6]. This decrease of $1,344 million in OCI was mainly due to an unfavorable movement in foreign currency translation, which recorded a loss of $(598) million in 2021 compared to a gain of $577 million in 2020. Other smaller contributors to the OCI decrease included derivative financial instruments, which went from a $97 million gain in 2020 to a $(3) million loss in 2021, and available-for-sale securities, which changed from a $34 million gain in 2020 to a $(34) million loss in 2021 [image6]. The impact from pension and other postretirement benefits on OCI remained relatively stable with a small increase in loss from $(29) million in 2020 to $(30) million in 2021 [image6].\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to shareholders increased by $2,147 million from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a significant rise in net profit driven by higher sales and favorable pricing, which was partially offset by a decrease in other comprehensive income mainly from unfavorable foreign currency translation."}

However, these gains were partially offset by increased workforce rebalancing payments, higher net cash payments for income taxes, and performance-related declines in net income [1].\n\nNet cash used in investing activities experienced a notable decrease of $23,908 million in 2020 [6]. A primary factor for this change was a significant reduction in net cash used for acquisitions, specifically $32,294 million, due to the large Red Hat acquisition that occurred in the prior year (2019) [9].

In 2022, the total gross margin percentage decreased by 65 basis points compared to 2021 [5].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this change. A significant factor was a decrease in core merchandise categories, which predominantly included fresh foods and foods and sundries, leading to a 33 basis-point decrease in gross margin [5]. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of these categories' sales, decreased by 27 basis points, with fresh foods being the most impacted [8]. Additionally, a LIFO charge due to higher merchandise costs negatively impacted the gross margin by 19 basis points [5], and the U.S. segment was particularly affected by this LIFO charge [3]. Increased 2% rewards also contributed a one basis-point decrease to the gross margin [5], with the Other International segment feeling this impact [3]. The company's merchandising and pricing philosophy, which aims to provide competitive prices, sometimes involves absorbing cost increases or reducing prices to drive sales, which can negatively impact gross margin, especially during periods of inflation [10].\n\nOn the other hand, warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted the gross margin by 29 basis points, mainly due to gasoline, though this was partially offset by e-commerce [5]. While gasoline generally has a lower gross margin percentage, rising gasoline prices can boost net sales, which can negatively impact the overall gross margin percentage when calculated against a higher sales base [12]. There was also a net positive impact of five basis points on the gross margin due to the cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19, even with the negative impact of a one-time charge for granting employees an additional day of paid time off [5]. All segments saw a benefit from the end of these COVID-19 related incremental wages [3]. However, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively affected the gross margin by approximately $176 million in 2022 [5].\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022, influenced by factors such as lower margins in core merchandise (especially fresh foods), a LIFO charge, and increased 2% rewards, though partially offset by contributions from ancillary businesses like gasoline and the cessation of COVID-19 incremental wages."}

The company actively managed its debt portfolio by issuing new long-term debt and retiring maturing obligations. During 2020, there were two significant issuances of fixed-rate, long-term debt. In March 2020, a principal amount of $750 million due in 2025 was issued, with proceeds of $749 million after discount, used for general corporate purposes and the repayment of maturing debt [9]. `![The table lists a new $750 million note due in 2025 for the year 2020.](image1)` Later, in May 2020, another $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030 was issued, yielding proceeds of $749 million, also for general corporate purposes [7]. `![The table lists a new $750 million note due in 2030 for the year 2020.](image1)` In total, the company received net proceeds of approximately $1.50 billion from these issuances of long-term debt in 2020 [12].\n\nConcurrently, the company retired $500 million of maturing debt during 2020 [12]. This retirement is reflected in the debt schedule, which shows that $500 million in notes due 2020, outstanding in 2019, were no longer part of the non-current debt in 2020. `![The table shows $500 million of notes due in 2020 were outstanding in 2019 but absent from the 2020 principal amounts, consistent with retirement.](image1)` The net effect of these issuances ($1.5 billion principal) and retirements ($0.5 billion principal) was an increase in the principal amount of debt by $1 billion.\n\nThe overall change in reported long-term debt also reflects changes in the current portion of long-term debt and the amortization of discounts and premiums. The current portion of long-term debt increased from $500 million in 2019 to $550 million in 2020, meaning an additional $50 million of debt was reclassified to short-term. Furthermore, net unamortized discounts, premiums, and issuance costs increased by $5 million (from $47 million in 2019 to $52 million in 2020), which further reduced the carrying value of the debt. `![The table details changes in the current portion of long-term debt and net unamortized discounts between 2019 and 2020.](image1)` These reclassifications and changes in unamortized costs account for the difference between the $1 billion net increase in principal and the $945 million increase in the reported long-term debt figure.\n\nLong-term debt increased by $945 million from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to the issuance of $1.5 billion in new debt and the retirement of $500 million in maturing debt, with further adjustments for changes in the current portion of debt and unamortized costs."}

A primary reason for this overall decline in commercial nonaccrual loans was a reduction in commercial and industrial nonaccruals, particularly due to paydowns in the oil, gas, and pipelines industry [1]. The specific figures for the \"Oil, gas, and pipelines\" sector show a decrease in nonaccrual loans from $1,348 million at December 31, 2020, to $331 million at December 31, 2021, a reduction of $1,017 million, driven by loan paydowns ![This table details nonaccrual loans, total portfolio, and total commitments for various commercial and industrial sectors for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.](image2) [8]. The \"Retail\" sector also contributed to this trend, with nonaccrual loans falling from $344 million to $108 million over the same period ![This table details nonaccrual loans, total portfolio, and total commitments for various commercial and industrial sectors for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.](image2).\n\nOn the other hand, consumer nonaccrual loans increased by $887 million, from $3.9 billion at December 31, 2020, to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2021 [3] [9].\n![This table shows the breakdown of nonaccrual loans by commercial and consumer categories, including specific loan types within each, for year-end 2021 and 2020.](image6)\nThe most significant contributor to this rise was the \"Residential mortgage – first lien\" category, where nonaccrual loans increased from $2,957 million in 2020 to $3,803 million in 2021, an increase of $846 million ![This table shows the breakdown of nonaccrual loans by commercial and consumer categories, including specific loan types within each, for year-end 2021 and 2020.](image6). This increase was predominantly driven by an increase in residential mortgage – first lien nonaccrual loans as certain customers exited from accommodation programs provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [9].\n\nThe oil, gas, and pipelines sector experienced one of the largest decreases in nonaccrual loans, while the residential mortgage – first lien sector saw the largest increase."}

For 2022, the expected total net periodic benefit cost is ($121) million, noting that this 2022 figure does not include an estimate for mark-to-market gains or losses.\n\nThe primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) significantly influenced these total figures [8].\nIn 2019, there was a net mark-to-market loss of $468 million, primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018 [10]. This loss contributed to the overall cost.\nIn 2020, a net mark-to-market loss of $383 million occurred, again primarily due to lower discount rates at year-end compared to the previous year [9]. This loss was a component of the total cost for that year.\nConversely, 2021 experienced a net mark-to-market gain of $833 million, primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020 [5]. This substantial gain was a key reason for the total net periodic benefit reported in 2021.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, the net periodic benefit cost is expected to increase by $168 million compared to 2021 [1]. This increase is primarily due to changes in assumptions, such as higher interest costs resulting from higher discount rates at year-end 2021 and a lower expected return on plan assets in 2022 [1]. The expected total net periodic benefit of ($121) million for 2022 reflects this cost component without an estimate for mark-to-market activity.\n\nThe total net periodic benefit cost decreased from a cost of $638 million in 2019 to a benefit of ($1,122) million in 2021, strongly influenced by mark-to-market gains in 2021 versus losses in prior years, with 2022 expected to be a benefit of ($121) million excluding mark-to-market effects."}

This aligns with the idea that humans are complex and these systems are incapable of capturing that nuance, a concern especially prominent for criminal risk scores where about half of respondents worry about the lack of room for personal growth or development [11].

Additionally, some worry about the lack of human involvement in the process (12%) or that the system might lead to unfair bias or profiling (9%) [7, image4].\n\nThe main reasons people find automated criminal risk scores acceptable include perceived effectiveness and potential for increased fairness, while reasons for unacceptability largely center on the inability of algorithms to account for individual differences, the potential for people to change, and concerns about the lack of human involvement and potential bias."}

This rapid increase was largely due to pioneer overland travel, which intensified even as railroads began to dominate freight traffic [1]. The Homestead Act of 1862 played a crucial role by providing 160 acres of land to pioneers who settled and improved it, initiating a \"great tide of emigration\" towards Nebraska [5]. Additionally, the Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862 transformed Nebraska into a \"booming agricultural state\" [5]. Early settlers primarily came from states like Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and the New England states, later joined by immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia [2].\n\nFollowing its peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population entered a period of general decline, with some fluctuations [1]. A major factor influencing this trend was the evolution of agriculture. Mechanization led to farm consolidation, where \"the number of farms has steadily declined since its peak in 1900 while the number of acres per farm has increased\" [6]. For example, Hamilton County had over 2,000 farms in 1900, but by 2002, this number had dropped to 603, while the average farm size increased significantly [6]. This shift in agricultural practices impacted rural communities, and many small towns, which had relied on rail connections for their survival, either declined or disappeared as populations shifted [10]. While five of the seven rural communities in the county peaked in population between 1900 and 1940, Aurora, the county seat, experienced steady growth from 1940, reaching 4,225 citizens in 2000 [9, 8].\n\nHamilton County's population surged in the late 1800s due to pioneer settlement and land acts, then generally declined from its 1890 peak due to agricultural mechanization and farm consolidation, though Aurora saw continued growth."}

It consists of two primary stages.\n\nFirst, there is the **Multimodal Retriever**. This component is tasked with creating and storing multimodal embeddings that represent visual images and their corresponding text descriptions [11]. The retriever's core function is to query a large external multimodal memory or database to efficiently find information relevant to an input [9]. As illustrated in the diagram, the multimodal retriever takes image datasets, uses an Image Encoder to extract feature embeddings, stores these in a Feature Index (often optimized for speed [7]), and maintains them in an external Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$). The retrieving process, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), is then used for image-image or image-text retrieval.\n![The RAR pipeline consists of a Multimodal Retriever (a) which processes images through an encoder, stores embeddings in a feature index and memory, and uses k-NN for retrieval, and a Retrieving & Ranking stage (b) where an input image is encoded, top-K categories are retrieved from memory, MLLMs rank these categories, and a final prediction is output.](image1)\nThis retriever is crucial for establishing an explicit memory for various categories that might extend beyond an MLLM's immediate context window [12].\n\nThe second major part of the pipeline is the **Retrieving & Ranking** process, which occurs during inference [1]. After the multimodal retriever has fetched the top-k most similar class names or results from memory based on an input image [11], these retrieved candidates are passed to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The MLLMs then rank these retrieved results to make the final prediction [2], [6]. The MLLMs combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction [2]. This design allows the system to handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision [2].\n\nThe RAR pipeline's main components are a multimodal retriever that builds and queries an external memory of embeddings, and a retrieving and ranking stage where MLLMs re-evaluate and order the retrieved candidates to produce the final output."}

Experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM versus using in-context learning (referred to as training-free or with structured prompts) for the ranking task [12].\nThe results from these comparisons, as illustrated in the table below, indicate a consistent improvement in accuracy for the fine-tuned InternLM-XC2 model across almost all evaluated datasets when compared to the in-context learning approach [12].\n![Table comparing fine-tuning (F) and in-context learning (S) strategies for RAR with InternLM-XC2 across various datasets.](image5)\nThis table presents performance metrics on common and fine-grained datasets, where models fine-tuned with a dataset like FGVC-Aircraft (the preferred choice for fine-tuning [6]) are compared against those using in-context learning prompts for ranking. For InternLM-XC2, the fine-tuned version (Strategy 'F') consistently shows higher accuracy than the version using in-context learning (Strategy 'S') across datasets such as ImageNet, Caltech101, RAF-DB, SUN397, EuroSAT, DTD, UCF101, Flower102, Food101, and OxfordPets. This notable enhancement in performance across a diverse range of datasets highlights the efficacy of the fine-tuning strategy in bolstering the model’s ranking capabilities [12].\n\nFor the RAR method on the InternLM-XC2 model, fine-tuning consistently yields better accuracy across various datasets compared to in-context learning for the ranking task."}

Specifically, the most accurate variant is the ScRNN that involves backing off to the background model, which results in the lowest error rate of 6.9% in the 'all' attack setting and leads to the best overall performance in word recognition [6]. This represents a 32% relative error reduction compared to the vanilla ScRNN model with a pass-through backoff strategy [6]. This improved performance is partly because 5.25% of words in the test corpus were unseen in the training corpus and could only be recovered by using the larger background corpus [6].

A common method involves replacing words with their synonyms, but this approach is limited because true synonyms are scarce, meaning only a small portion of the vocabulary can be augmented this way [1]. Prior works often used synonyms as substitutes, but this method cannot generate a wide variety of new patterns from the original texts [9].\n\nTo address these limitations, a novel method called contextual augmentation has been proposed. This approach replaces words with others predicted by a bi-directional language model based on the surrounding context [7, 9, 12]. This allows for a broader range of substitute words, moving beyond simple synonyms [9, 12]. For example, in the sentence \"the actors are fantastic,\" instead of just using synonyms for \"actors\" like \"histrion\" or \"player,\" contextual augmentation might suggest words like \"characters,\" \"movies,\" or \"stories,\" while still preserving the original sentiment [4].\n![The image shows that contextual augmentation can replace \"actors\" with \"performances,\" \"films,\" \"movies,\" and \"stories\" while maintaining a positive sentiment.](image3)\nFurthermore, to ensure that the augmented sentences remain compatible with their original labels, a label-conditional architecture can be integrated into the language model [7, 12]. This allows the model to generate augmentations that align with the sentiment or classification of the original text [7]. For instance, if a sentence is labeled positive, the augmentation will aim to maintain that positivity, and vice-versa for negative labels [6].\n![The diagram shows a conditional bi-directional language model predicting different words for \"fantastic\" based on whether a positive or negative sentiment label is provided.](image2)\nThe effectiveness of these methods has been tested across various text classification tasks [2, 7]. Experimental results indicate that contextual augmentation, especially when combined with a label-conditional architecture, significantly improves model performance compared to synonym-based augmentation [10, 11].\n\nSpecifically, for the RNN architecture, the performance metrics are as follows:\n![The table shows performance scores for CNN and RNN models with different augmentation strategies, including baseline, synonym-based, context-based, and context with label.](image1)\nThe RNN model using synonym-based augmentation (`w/ synonym`) achieved an average accuracy of 77.40.

Among these, Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval represent distinct strategies.\n\nIterative Retrieval, as shown in the diagram, alternates between retrieval and generation steps, aiming to provide richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base with each cycle [image2]. This approach, exemplified by models like ITER-RETGEN, leverages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-enhanced retrieval” [3]. The system uses the content needed to address a task as a basis for retrieving pertinent knowledge, which then facilitates improved responses in subsequent iterations [3]. This can involve a \"Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow\" [8].\n![Iterative retrieval alternates between retrieval and generation to enrich context.](image2)\n\nRecursive Retrieval, on the other hand, focuses on progressively refining the search process, often by decomposing complex queries into sub-problems and continuously solving them through retrieval and generation [image2]. This technique may involve a structured index to process and retrieve data hierarchically, such as summarizing parts of a document before performing a retrieval based on this summary, and then refining the search within the document [4]. The core idea is to iteratively refine search queries based on the results from previous searches, which is especially useful in complex scenarios or when the initial query is ambiguous, allowing for gradual convergence on the most pertinent information [11].\n![Recursive retrieval refines queries and decomposes problems for continuous resolution.](image2)\n\nAdaptive Retrieval enables the RAG system to intelligently decide when external knowledge retrieval is necessary, rather than retrieving information at every step [image2]. Methods like Flare and Self-RAG allow LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the sourced information [12, 8]. The system can autonomously determine when to stop the retrieval and generation process, often using special tokens to manage this dynamic interaction [image2].\n![Adaptive retrieval allows the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed.](image2)\n\nThese three retrieval processes differ in how they manage and refine the information-seeking loop: Iterative retrieval cycles through retrieval and generation, Recursive retrieval progressively refines queries and breaks down problems, and Adaptive retrieval dynamically decides the necessity and timing of retrieval actions."}

In a standard \"distractor setting,\" such as that in HotpotQA where questions are paired with two gold paragraphs and eight TF-IDF selected distractors, a single-paragraph BERT model can achieve a competitive F1 score of 67.08 [7].\n\nThe crucial role of having the correct evidence is evident in open-domain settings. For example, a single-hop model achieves an F1 score of 39.12 when using 500 retrieved paragraphs, but this score increases to 53.12 when the two gold paragraphs are explicitly added [5]. This improvement highlights the significant impact of failing to retrieve the gold paragraphs, a common issue as TF-IDF retrieval often struggles with this even with many candidates [1].\n![The table displays F1 scores for a model in an open-domain setting with 500 paragraphs (39.12 F1) and how it improves when gold paragraphs are added (53.12 F1).](image4)\nThis difficulty in retrieving essential information contributes to why the open-domain setting is particularly challenging for these models [10].\n\nThe nature of distractor paragraphs also substantially affects model performance.

However, models can adapt to some extent; if re-trained on these new, harder distractor distributions, they can recover a portion of their lost accuracy. For example, retraining on adversarial distractors brought the F1 score up to 60.10 [2], and on type-filtered adversarial distractors to 58.42 [8]. This suggests that while more carefully chosen distractors can make questions harder, models may still find ways to answer them without full multi-hop reasoning, especially if retrained [6].\n\nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs generally improves F1 scores by ensuring access to necessary information, whereas the type and difficulty of distractors can significantly lower scores, underscoring that model performance is highly dependent on both the quality of evidence provided and the challenge posed by irrelevant information."}

For example, \"SML\" is the parent entity for its publication date and genre [4].\n\nThe KGLM, when generating tokens, often makes decisions based on these structured relationships. For instance, when generating a token, the model might choose a reference to an existing entity. This involves selecting a parent entity $(p_{t})$, then a specific relation $(r_{t})$ associated with that parent, and finally the entity $(e_{t})$ that is the object of that relation, which is then rendered as a token $(x_{t})$ [1].\n\n![The diagram illustrates the model's decision process: choosing a mention type, selecting a parent entity, identifying a relation, picking an entity to render, and generating the token.](image3)\n\nThis process is exemplified when, after establishing \"Super Mario Land\" in the local knowledge graph, the model selects \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity, \"Publication Date\" as the relation, and then copies a token from the date entity (e.g., \"1989\") [6].

This method seeks to identify informative samples without needing ground truth labels, making it a practical approach for active learning procedures [11].\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy consistently outperforms other querying methods across various datasets and learning cycles. For example, on datasets like BloodMNIST, the 'Hard-to-contrast' initial query strategy (often depicted by red lines in performance graphs) outperforms other initial query strategies in every cycle of active learning [1]. This outperformance is also observed on OrganAMNIST [2], [4] and PathMNIST [2], [12], where it steadily improves model performance in subsequent active learning cycles [2]. This strategy has been shown to significantly surpass random selection and other existing active querying strategies by a large margin, highlighting its effectiveness in determining annotation importance [9]. Quantitative comparisons show that selecting 'hard-to-contrast' data leads to optimal models and yields the highest performance among various active querying strategies [11].\n![Hard-to-contrast strategy generally shows the highest AUC across PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, BloodMNIST, and CIFAR-10-LT datasets compared to other map-based strategies.](image3)\nThe 'Hard-to-Contrast' initial query strategy consistently demonstrates superior AUC performance compared to other methods across an increasing number of labeled images, as illustrated in various studies.\n![The Hard-to-Contrast strategy (red line) generally outperforms other selection methods in AUC across varying numbers of labeled images, both when training from scratch and when fine-tuning.](image5)\nThe strong performance of the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy, especially in the early stages, has crucial implications for initial query selection. The first few choices in active learning are pivotal as they largely define the efficacy and efficiency of the entire subsequent learning procedure [9]. Studies have found a strong positive correlation between the model's performance in the initial cycle (e.g., with 20 labeled images) and its performance in later cycles (e.g., with 50 labeled images), with Pearson correlation coefficients often being high (e.g., r=0.79 to 0.92) and statistically significant [1], [2], [4], [5]. This indicates that an effective initial query, such as one provided by the 'hard-to-contrast' criterion which helps determine typical data to be annotated first, sets a strong foundation for the rest of the active learning process [5].\n\nThe 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy generally achieves higher AUC than other strategies across various numbers of labeled images, and its robust initial performance significantly boosts the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the active learning process."}

The benchmark features a remarkable variety of around 30 image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, and medical images. This is a notable difference from prior benchmarks, which often had more limited image format coverage and were heavily focused on daily knowledge and common sense [6].\n![This table provides statistics for the MMMU dataset, detailing 11,550 questions across 6 disciplines, 30 subjects, 183 subfields, and 30 image types.](image3)\nThis comprehensive coverage in both subject matter and image diversity sets MMMU apart.\n\nIn terms of depth, MMMU presents problems that demand expert-level understanding and deliberate, step-by-step reasoning [1]. Many questions are sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, requiring domain-specific knowledge for concepts such as \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions [2]. This contrasts sharply with earlier benchmarks that typically focused on commonsense knowledge or simpler physical or temporal reasoning tasks [6].\n![This diagram and table compare MMMU to other benchmarks, showing MMMU's superior depth in reasoning and breadth in knowledge.](image4)\nMMMU is specifically designed to evaluate how well models can perceive and understand information across different modalities and then apply reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [5].

The performance of current models, including advanced ones like GPT-4V which achieved an accuracy of only 55.7%, indicates that MMMU poses a significant challenge and reveals \"ample headroom for improvement\" [8]. This suggests that while LMMs have made considerable progress, there is substantial room for development, especially in domains requiring the interpretation of complex visual input and the application of deep subject knowledge and reasoning [12]. MMMU therefore serves as a critical benchmark for measuring progress towards more sophisticated AI systems, and strong performance on it is considered necessary for an Expert AGI to demonstrate broad and deep subject knowledge [3].\n\nMMMU significantly surpasses other benchmarks in breadth by covering numerous college-level disciplines and diverse image formats, and in depth by requiring expert-level domain knowledge and complex reasoning, thereby providing a more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of large multimodal models' advanced capabilities."}

The model then processes this input through a series of modules.\n\n![The LOGIC-LM model processes problems through three stages: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter.](image5)\n\nThe initial stage is **Problem Formulation**. In this stage, an LLM is used to translate the natural language problem and goal into a task-specific symbolic language [2, 12]. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement and converting them into a symbolic representation [12]. For instance, a natural language statement like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing\" would be translated into a symbolic form such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [1].\n\n![This table shows examples of how natural language sentences for different problem types are converted into symbolic formulations.](image6)\n\nNext, the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage takes over. Here, a deterministic symbolic solver, such as a logic programming engine or a first-order logic prover, performs inference on the symbolic formulation generated in the previous stage to obtain a symbolically represented answer [2, 12]. This shifts the burden of complex reasoning from the LLM to a more reliable symbolic solver [9].\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** module translates the symbolic answer obtained from the solver back into natural language, making it understandable and mapping it to the correct answer format for the original goal [2, 12]. LOGIC-LM also incorporates a self-refinement module that uses error messages from the symbolic solver to iteratively revise the generated symbolic formulations, thereby improving accuracy [10, 12].\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by using its Problem Formulator to convert the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, then its Symbolic Reasoner to perform logical inference on this representation, and finally its Result Interpreter to translate the symbolic answer back into natural language."}

The pre-processing begins by **cropping** the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates. These cropped regions are then **resized** to a fixed proportion [8]. This is important because objects in detection datasets can vary significantly in size, with some occupying large portions of the image and others being very small [8].\n\nAdditionally, a **blurring** technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This strategy helps to direct the Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) focus towards the relevant objects, facilitating their identification [8]. Proper blurring can improve classification accuracy by retaining sufficient context while ensuring the foreground object remains prominent [7]. Furthermore, for objects of varying scales, adapting different crop scales is beneficial to maximize classification accuracy [7]. These pre-processing steps ensure that the MLLMs can better understand and identify the objects to be detected.\n\nThe pre-processing steps of cropping, resizing, and blurring are vital for isolating and preparing specific object regions from complex images, thereby enabling the system to more accurately perform zero-shot recognition."}

In 2011, the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" gained prominence, with researchers like Gulordava and Baroni (2011) using it to compare word meanings across different decades, significantly contributing to the field's development [12]. This was followed in 2012 by advancements in \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" a technique where systems aimed to identify the specific time period to which contexts of a shifting word belong, notably explored by Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) [3], [12].\n\nThe year 2013 saw the rise of \"Prediction-based models,\" which became foundational for subsequent research [5]. By 2014, \"Word embeddings,\" exemplified by models like word2vec, were increasingly adopted. The work of Kim et al. (2014) was particularly influential as they were among the first to employ prediction-based word embedding models, such as Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), for tracking diachronic semantic shifts [10]. As these models proliferated, \"Models alignment\" became a key challenge and research focus in 2015, essential for comparing word vectors across different time spans [2]. This period also saw initiatives like SemEval-2015 Task 7 focusing on ‘Diachronic Text Evaluation’ [3] and Kulkarni et al. (2015) developing methods for the statistically significant detection of linguistic change [4].\n\nIn 2016, the range of data sources expanded with the use of corpora like the \"NYT corpus\" (e.g., by Zhang et al., 2015) and the \"COHA corpus\" (e.g., by Hamilton et al., 2016a; Eger and Mehler, 2016) [8]. Hamilton et al. (2016a) also provided evidence for the superiority of SGNS models in semantic shift analysis [10]. The year 2017 was characterized by deeper theoretical and methodological explorations, including investigations into the \"Laws of semantic change\" and \"Diachronic relations\" [2]. New resources like the \"Gigaword corpus\" were employed (e.g., Kutuzov et al., 2017b [8]), and discussions emerged around \"Local measures better for cultural shifts,\" alongside \"Criticism of semantic change laws\" and techniques for \"Joint learning across time spans.\"\n\nKey milestones from 2010 to 2017 in tracing diachronic semantic shifts involved the development of time-sensitive models, the utilization of large-scale corpora, the widespread adoption of prediction-based word embeddings, methods for aligning models across time, and the exploration of underlying principles governing semantic change."}

The OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and ChatGPT, generally outperform LLaMA family models in most metrics, with correctness scores above 94 for OpenAI models [1].\n\nFor text quality evaluation in the \"Specific\" setting, ChatGPT (0.5) scores slightly higher than GPT-4 (0.5) across Coherence (4.57 vs. 4.48), Conciseness (4.94 vs. 4.89), Fluency (4.71 vs. 4.64), and Relevance (4.81 vs. 4.72) (image6).\n![The table shows text quality scores for various models, where ChatGPT versions often score highly across Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, and Relevance.](image4)\nHowever, it's important to note a potential limitation in text quality evaluation: the use of ChatGPT as the evaluator could introduce bias, as the model might prefer its own generation style, potentially explaining why ChatGPT's scores are sometimes higher than GPT-4's in these metrics [6]. Despite this, OpenAI models, in general, are found to have better text quality compared to LLaMA family models [4].\n\nThese differences imply that for tasks demanding high precision and correctness in citations, GPT-4 is generally preferable, especially when prompts are specific. If comprehensive recall of citations is more critical, ChatGPT might offer an advantage, though with lower precision. The superior performance of both models in \"Specific\" settings underscores the importance of clear and explicit instructions for better knowledge utilization and output quality. When assessing text quality, particularly if using an LLM like ChatGPT for evaluation, one should be aware of potential biases that might favor text generated by similar models.\n\nIn summary, both GPT-4 and ChatGPT perform better in specific settings; GPT-4 generally excels in citation precision and correctness, while ChatGPT shows higher citation recall and, according to potentially biased metrics, slightly better text quality, highlighting the importance of prompt specificity and awareness of evaluation biases."}

FRUs are components within a server, such as disk drives or power supplies, that can fail. The reliability technique employed at this level is \"Erasure Code\" [image8]. The benefit of using erasure codes at Level 2 is that it allows the system to withstand the failure of one or more server components (or even entire servers, depending on the erasure coding scheme) without losing data. Data is broken into fragments, and additional parity fragments are created and distributed across different physical servers. If an FRU fails, leading to the loss of some data fragments, the original data can be reconstructed from the remaining fragments and the parity information. This ensures data durability and availability despite common hardware failures at the server level. While OBS has also passed the Trusted Cloud Service (TRUCS) certification, which vouches for its security measures like encryption and access control [4], the specific benefit of Level 2 in its reliability architecture is focused on hardware fault tolerance.\n\nThe benefit of Level 2 in the OBS reliability architecture is that it uses erasure codes to protect data against failures of server components (FRUs), ensuring data can be reconstructed and remains available even if parts of a server fail."}

The PCOF tool's primary role is to enable planners to move beyond anecdotal, rule-of-thumb planning estimates into a repeatable, organized, and robust estimating method, with the potential to dramatically enhance medical mission planning [3].\n\nThe tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk [6]. These PCOF tables exist within casualty categories of wounded in action, nonbattle injuries, disease, and outpatient visits for a given combat or noncombat scenario throughout the range of military operations (ROMO) [6]. ROMO is defined to include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, defense support of civil authorities, and various combat operations [6]. For example, combat data sets from Operation Enduring Freedom, where personnel were deployed,\n![U.S. Marines and Sailors are en route to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom.](image2)\nwere used to populate PCOF tables [12]. Similarly, patient encounter data from humanitarian assistance operations, such as medical aid provided in regions like Djibouti,\n![Lt. j.g. Michael Rucker provides medical treatment to a young girl in Djibouti during a humanitarian mission.](image4)\nwere used for humanitarian assistance PCOF tables [12]. The military medical planning community, until the development of this tool, lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating PCOFs, which are necessary to develop the patient streams used in health care simulations [6].\n\nThe PCOF tool provides an effective, accurate, and repeatable method of generating PCOF estimates using standardized and documented means of adjusting baseline distributions [5]. Using an accredited PCOF tool, planners can employ baselined, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission [7]. This helps inform decision-makers on the types of patient conditions to expect during a contingency, crucial for allocating resources for various medical teams.\n![Military medical personnel from different branches stand in front of a medical helicopter, representing teams that benefit from PCOF planning.](image7)\n\nThe PCOF tool's role is to provide military planners with an effective and accurate method to estimate the occurrence probabilities of various patient conditions for different military operations, thereby significantly enhancing medical mission planning and resource allocation."}

Scientists, for example, are using advanced techniques like mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens from the malaria parasite that could serve as candidates for future vaccines [6]. The mechanism by which the immune system targets malaria parasites, particularly within liver cells, is a key area of this research.\n\n![Illustration of a CD8+ T cell attacking a malaria-infected liver cell.](image5)\nThe illustration depicts a critical interaction where a CD8+ T cell, a type of white blood cell, engages with a liver cell infected by the malaria parasite (shown as a Pf schizont within the liver cell). The infected liver cell presents a fragment of the parasite, a Pf peptide, on its surface using Class I MHC molecules. This presentation acts as a signal to the immune system. The CD8+ T cell is equipped to recognize this specific parasite peptide. Upon recognition, the CD8+ T cell releases cytotoxic substances, namely perforin and granzymes. These molecules work together to induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the infected liver cell, which in turn helps to eliminate the parasite. The illustration also indicates that other immune signaling pathways, such as those involving IFN-γ and Fas/FasR interactions, contribute to this targeted destruction of the infected cell and the parasite within it.\n\nAccording to the illustration, the immune system targets malaria parasites when a CD8+ T cell identifies a parasite peptide presented on the surface of an infected liver cell and then kills this infected cell through the release of perforin and granzymes, as well as through other signaling pathways that induce apoptosis."}

This process is crucial for translating laboratory findings into practical applications. NMRC's approach aligns with the \"Presidential Memorandum - Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses,\" which directs federal agencies to streamline processes and facilitate partnerships to support private sector commercialization [9]. The NMRC enterprise excels in this by leveraging Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) and patent licensing agreements, thereby stretching research dollars and supporting military health and readiness through collaborations with public and private sectors [11, 12].\n\nAn example of such collaboration is seen in malaria research. Lt. Roxanne Burrus from U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 in Lima, Peru, is working with Duke University to evaluate how changing demography and land use affect malaria transmission. This research is vital for understanding malaria prevalence in developing countries and for protecting deployed warfighters [3]. Furthering these efforts, Lt. R. Vince Gerbasi of NMRC's Infectious Diseases Directorate uses mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens for potential malaria vaccine candidates [3].\n![The image illustrates a CD8+ T cell (immune cell) interacting with a liver cell infected with the malaria parasite (Pf schizont), showing the release of perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis (cell death) of the infected cell and parasite, a key mechanism in developing malaria vaccines.](image7)\nCapt. Eileen Franke Villasante, as Head of the Malaria Department at NMRC, also plays a significant role in these research endeavors [6, 10]. These collaborations, while having significant military relevance, also hold considerable potential to benefit the general population through new information and technologies [11].\n\nThe Joint Combat Casualty Research Team (JC2RT) exemplifies the application of research in active military settings.

A third hot dog could offer zero additional utility, and eating even more could lead to negative utility, meaning it becomes an unpleasant experience.\n![The table displays utility from hot dogs: +10 for the first, +4 for the second, 0 for the third, -1 for the fourth, -4 for the fifth, and -10 for the sixth.](image6)\nThis pattern of decreasing satisfaction illustrates how the utility derived from each hot dog changes with consumption.\n\nThe utility derived from each hot dog the boy eats would decrease with each one consumed, starting at +10 for the first and diminishing with subsequent hot dogs based on the provided data."}

He demonstrated that parents pass discrete heritable factors, which we now call genes, to their offspring [4]. This inheritance involves each offspring receiving a unique combination of genes from its two parents [2]. During fertilization, the union of sperm and egg creates a zygote that has a diploid chromosome number, meaning it inherits one set of chromosomes, and therefore one set of genes, from each parent [8].\n\nIn a typical Mendelian monohybrid cross, such as one involving flower color in pea plants, Mendel crossed parental plants with purple flowers with those having white flowers [11].\n![A genetic cross diagram illustrates the inheritance from homozygous parent plants (PP for purple, pp for white) to F1 hybrids (all Pp, purple) and then to the F2 generation.](image1)\nIn this P generation cross, if the purple-flowered parent is homozygous dominant (PP) and the white-flowered parent is homozygous recessive (pp), all plants in the F₁ generation are heterozygous (Pp) and exhibit purple flowers because the allele for purple color is dominant. This explains why one trait, white flowers, seemed to disappear in the F₁ generation [11]. The genes responsible for these traits are located at specific gene loci on homologous chromosomes.\n![A chromosome is depicted with different alleles, such as P, a, and B, located at specific gene loci.](image3)\n\nWhen these F₁ generation plants (Pp) self-pollinate or are crossed with each other, the F₂ generation shows a reappearance of the white flower trait [11].\n![An illustration shows a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered parent plants, leading to all purple-flowered F₁ plants, and an F₂ generation with a ratio of ¾ purple-flowered to ¼ white-flowered plants.](image4)\nThe F₁ plants produce gametes containing either the dominant allele (P) or the recessive allele (p). The random combination of these gametes during fertilization results in the F₂ generation having a genotypic ratio of approximately 1 homozygous dominant (PP) : 2 heterozygous (Pp) : 1 homozygous recessive (pp).\n![Examples of genotypes are shown: PP for homozygous dominant, aa for homozygous recessive, and Bb for heterozygous.](image8)\nPhenotypically, this translates to about three-quarters of the F₂ plants displaying purple flowers (those with PP or Pp genotypes) and one-quarter displaying white flowers (those with the pp genotype), thus explaining the 3:1 phenotypic ratio observed by Mendel [11].\n\nMendelian inheritance explains these observed F2 phenotypic (3:1 dominant to recessive) and genotypic (1:2:1 homozygous dominant:heterozygous:homozygous recessive) ratios through the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the concept of dominant and recessive alleles."}

This move aligns with strategic goals to consolidate information and create a foundation for unifying healthcare efforts [4], addressing existing issues where current systems fragment patient information and lead to inefficiencies [6]. The types of Health IT (HIT) systems commonly found, such as EMR/EHR, CPOE, and pharmacy systems [8], laboratory and imaging systems [11], and even emerging tools like tablet capture devices in some hospitals [9], are central to these evolving intranet capabilities.\n\nThis internal focus on clinical data access is complemented by trends observed in website functionalities and broader technology adoption. For example, recent data (comparing 2005 to 2006) showed website features like \"Physician Portal Link\" reaching 47% utilization and \"Remote Employee Access\" at 53% in 2006 `![Website functions in 2006 included significant physician portal links and remote employee access, with marketing and recruitment also high.](image2)`, suggesting an ecosystem where physicians and staff are better connected. Furthermore, the adoption of technologies such as \"Single Sign On/Identity Management\" (79% in 2006), \"Automated Alerts to Clinicians\" (61% in 2006), and \"Wireless Information Appliances\" (60% in 2006) `![Technology adoption in 2006 showed strong growth in areas like single sign-on, bar code technology, and automated clinician alerts.](image5)` provides the necessary infrastructure for these enhanced clinical workflows.

However, other specific measures like \"Firewalls\" (98% today to 53% in two years) and \"User Access Controls\" (88% today to 53% in two years) are projected to decrease `![Security measure projections show increased disaster recovery but decreases in some individual controls like firewalls and user access controls over the next two years.](image1)`.

The term \"Gestalt\" itself is German, meaning \"shape\" or \"form\" [7]. The principles of Gestalt psychology are creatively applied in the visual design of the word \"GESTALT\" as shown in the provided image.\n![The word 'GESTALT' is designed with each letter or pair of letters illustrating different Gestalt principles such as segregation, closure, proximity, continuity, similarity, prägnanz, and unity.](image2)\nFor example, the principle of **Proximity**, where objects that are visually close together are seen as belonging to a group [1], is exemplified by the letter \"E\" in the image. It is depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely, which makes us perceive them as a single, unified letter.\n\nThe principle of **Similarity** is also utilized. This principle states that objects similar in attributes like shape and color tend to be grouped together [10]. In the design, the letters \"T\" and \"A\" are shown with a similar striped pattern, prompting us to visually group them.\n\n**Closure** is another Gestalt principle at play. It describes our tendency to perceive incomplete objects, such as shapes or letters, as whole by mentally filling in the missing information [11]. The image description for image2 mentions that the \"G\" and \"E\" together can lead us to perceive a closed shape, even if parts are technically missing.\n\nThe letter \"S\" in the word \"GESTALT\" is designed to follow a continuous contour line. This demonstrates the principle of **Continuity**, where elements of objects tend to be grouped [3] or perceived as smooth, continuous patterns rather than disjointed ones.\n\nFinally, the concept of **Prägnanz**, or the Law of Good Gestalt, emphasizes conciseness and simplicity in perception [4]. The clarity and simple form of the letter \"A\" in the visual representation of \"GESTALT\" serves as an example of this principle, as our perception tends towards the simplest possible interpretation.\n\nThe principles of Gestalt psychology manifest in the design of the word 'GESTALT' by using the shapes and arrangements of its letters to visually demonstrate concepts like proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, and prägnanz, thereby making the word itself an illustration of these perceptual laws."}

This can be misleading because a customer's journey often involves exposure to multiple marketing efforts before the final click. For example, if a customer searches for a branded term like \"Commonwealth Bank Home Loans,\" they have likely encountered other forms of advertising prior to that search, yet those earlier touchpoints receive no attribution [5].

This phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal utility [6]. For example, the utility might drop with subsequent hot dogs, eventually reaching zero and then becoming negative, indicating disutility or dissatisfaction from further consumption [image4].\n\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility is further illustrated by observing how enjoyment can drastically decrease; for instance, the utility from the first hot dog might be +6, but by the 66th hot dog, it could plummet to -50 [image2].\n![The table shows diminishing utility for hot dogs, with utility becoming negative after a few, but also a scenario where utility jumps significantly at 64 hot dogs.](image2)\nThis pattern implies that as enjoyment drops, individuals are likely to switch to another choice [6].

This entire process aims to transform raw data into tangible value.\n`![A flowchart shows data transforming through reporting, analysis, and action to generate value.](image1)`\nWithin this value chain, reporting and analysis are distinct yet sequential stages. Reporting is primarily descriptive and backward-looking, focusing on \"What?\" happened [image4]. It converts data into information, often presented as reports, dashboards, and alerts, which serve to raise questions [image4].\n`![A table compares Reporting (descriptive, backward-looking, raises questions) and Analysis (prescriptive, forward-looking, answers questions).](image4)`\nAnalysis, conversely, is prescriptive and forward-looking, seeking to answer \"Why?\" events occurred [image4]. It takes data and the information provided by reporting to generate deeper insights and recommendations, often employing storytelling to convey its findings [image4]. This analytical step is vital for informing decisions and subsequent actions that drive impact [4, 7].\n\nThe progression from Business Intelligence (BI) to Business Analytics (BA) reflects an increasing sophistication in how data is used, leading to greater business value and a higher degree of intelligence [image7].\n`![A diagram illustrates the progression from Business Intelligence (standard reports, ad-hoc reports) to Business Analytics (statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling), showing increasing business value and intelligence.](image7)`\nReporting forms the foundational layer of Business Intelligence, addressing questions such as \"What happened?\" through standard reports and \"How many, how often, where?\" via ad-hoc reports [image7]. These activities provide a clear view of past and current states. Business Analytics, on the other hand, builds upon this foundation by incorporating more advanced analytical techniques. This includes statistical analysis to understand \"Why is this happening?\", forecasting to predict \"What if these trends continue?\", predictive modeling to determine \"What will happen next?\", and optimization to identify \"What's the best that can happen?\" [image7]. Therefore, reporting is essential for establishing a baseline understanding within BI, while analysis powers the predictive and prescriptive capabilities of BA, both contributing to the overarching analytics value chain [8].\n\nReporting provides a descriptive summary of past events which forms the basis of business intelligence, while analysis offers prescriptive insights into why events occurred and what might happen next, thereby driving business analytics and the creation of value within the analytics value chain."}

This is why variety is often preferred; when enjoyment from one item drops, we tend to switch to another [2]. For instance, in standard consumption, focusing on consuming only one thing, like hot dogs, is generally considered bad because the enjoyment wanes with each additional unit [6].\n\n![The table shows that the first hot dog gives +10 utility, but by the sixth hot dog, the utility is -10, illustrating diminishing and then negative returns.](image8)\n\nThis table clearly demonstrates how the utility from eating hot dogs decreases with each one consumed, eventually becoming negative in a typical scenario.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the dynamic can be quite different. The cumulative effect of focus, such as repeatedly engaging in an activity like competitive eating, can be beneficial [9]. Focused practice or engagement can lead to increased utility, not necessarily from the act of consumption itself in the traditional sense, but from improved experience due to skill accumulation and better outcomes due to cumulative experience [11]. The potential for competitive mastery resulting from such focus can be a significant driver [12].\n\n![The image contrasts diminishing marginal utility from hot dogs with a \"differential outcome\" where utility dramatically increases at 64 hot dogs, the point of tying a competitor in a championship.](image1)\n\nThe image above illustrates this contrast well. On one side, it shows the typical diminishing (and negative) utility from consuming many hot dogs. But on the \"Differential Outcome\" side, representing a competitive scenario, the utility skyrockets at the 64th hot dog, likely because this level of consumption leads to a significant competitive achievement, such as tying for a championship. The joy here isn't from the 64th hot dog itself, but from the outcome of winning or achieving a competitive goal.\n\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility leads to decreased enjoyment and a desire for variety with increased hot dog consumption, whereas in a competitive context, the utility can dramatically increase at high levels of consumption if it leads to a winning outcome."}

This means that out of every 100 leads marketing qualifies, only about one or two are accepted by the sales team.\n\nAnother dataset provides cross-industry average conversion rates for various stages of the sales funnel.\n![The image displays cross-industry average conversion rates at different sales funnel stages, indicating that Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) convert to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) at a rate of 45-75%.](image7)\nAccording to these industry averages, the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs typically falls within a much higher range of 45-75%.\n\nComparing these figures, the 1.50% MQL to SAL conversion rate is significantly lower than the industry average of 45-75%. This stark difference has important implications. A very low MQL to SAL rate, like 1.50%, often points to a misalignment between marketing and sales definitions of a qualified lead, potential issues with the lead scoring process, or that the MQLs generated by marketing are not perceived as high quality or sales-ready by the sales team. It could necessitate a review of lead qualification criteria and improved communication between the two departments. Conversely, an MQL to SAL conversion rate within the 45-75% range suggests a stronger alignment, where marketing is effectively delivering leads that the sales team finds valuable and is willing to pursue, indicating a more efficient and collaborative process.\n\nThe MQL to SAL conversion rates observed are 1.50% in one specific dataset and an industry average range of 45-75% in another; the significant discrepancy implies that the lower rate could indicate issues with MQL quality or sales and marketing alignment, whereas the higher range suggests better lead quality and inter-departmental synergy."}

The dishwasher can encounter a variety of issues that you might be able to address without professional help.\n\nFor example, you might experience issues with cleaning performance. These can include the dishes not being clean, glassware appearing cloudy, white spots remaining on dishes and glasses, or black or grey marks on dishes. Another common issue is finding detergent left in the dispenser after a wash cycle ![A troubleshooting guide lists issues like unclean dishes, cloudy glassware, white spots, marks on dishes, and detergent left in the dispenser.](image3). Improper loading is a frequent cause of poor washing results ![A warning sign highlights that incorrect loading can result in poor washing.](image2). For instance, if items are blocking the spray arms, the dishes may not get clean, or if dishes obstruct the dispenser, detergent may not be released properly ![The troubleshooting guide suggests rearranging items for free spray arm movement if dishes are not clean and reloading dishes if detergent is left in the dispenser.](image3).\n\nOperational problems can also occur. The dishwasher might not start, potentially due to power supply issues or the door not being properly closed. You might also find that water is not pumped from the dishwasher, possibly because of a clogged filter or a kinked drain hose. Another issue is the presence of suds in the tub, often caused by using the wrong type of detergent ![A troubleshooting table outlines solutions for a dishwasher not starting, not pumping water, or having suds due to wrong detergent.](image6).\n\nOther concerns include aesthetic or minor functional issues such as a stained tub interior, a white film on the inside surface of the dishwasher, or rust stains appearing on cutlery. Noises during operation can also be a sign of a problem, like a knocking noise if a spray arm is hitting an item, a rattling noise due to loose crockery, or even a knocking noise in the water pipes ![A troubleshooting chart addresses issues such as stained interiors, white film, rust on cutlery, and various operational noises.](image7). Even a spilled rinse-aid is noted as a problem that requires immediate attention by wiping it up ![The troubleshooting guide advises wiping up spilled rinse-aid immediately.](image7).\n\nDrying performance is another area where problems can arise, such as the dishes not drying properly. This could be due to improper loading of the dishwasher or removing the dishes too soon after the cycle finishes ![Troubleshooting guidance indicates improper loading or early removal of dishes can cause poor drying.](image3). Other causes for dishes not drying include selecting an inappropriate wash program or using cutlery with a low-quality coating that hinders water drainage ![A troubleshooting guide suggests wrong program selection or low-quality cutlery can cause drying problems.](image8).\n\nFurthermore, critical issues like an overflow occurring, or discovering water in the base pan due to an overfill or a small leak, are problems that require immediate action, such as turning off the main water supply or removing the water before restarting the dishwasher, prior to calling for service [6].\n\nTherefore, the dishwasher may encounter at least 18 distinct problems that can often be troubleshooted with the provided guidance before calling for service."}
