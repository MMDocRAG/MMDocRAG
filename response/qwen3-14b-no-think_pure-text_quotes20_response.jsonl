However, when it comes to ethical standards, the Democratic Party was slightly higher at 42%, compared to the Republican Party at 41% [7]. Therefore, the party that holds the highest total percentage of good policy ideas and high ethical standards is the Democratic Party, as it has a slight edge in ethical standards.\n\nRegarding the percentage of Democrats who followed the news about congressional elections in their state very closely, we can refer to image1. In May 2018, among Democrats, the distribution shows that 88% of them fall into one category (presumably \"very closely\" or \"fairly closely\"), while only 12% are in the other unspecified category [image1]. However, this image does not explicitly distinguish between \"very closely\" and \"fairly closely.\" \n\nFor more specific data on how closely different groups followed the news, we can look at image4. This image indicates that the total percentage of people following the subject closely is 50%, with 19% very closely and 31% fairly closely. While this image does not directly specify the percentage for Democrats alone, it provides context on the overall engagement levels.\n\nTo pinpoint the exact percentage of Democrats who followed the news very closely, we need to rely on image6, which categorizes opinions by political affiliation. Specifically, for Democrats/Lean Dem, the percentage who \"Like\" the subject is 5%, those with \"mixed feelings\" is 10%, and those who \"Don't like\" it is 85%. However, this image does not provide information on how closely they followed the news.\n\nFinally, looking at image1 again, which compares opinions among Republicans and Democrats in May 2018, it is clear that the percentages for each group are split between two categories. Although the exact breakdown of \"very closely\" versus \"fairly closely\" is not specified, the image suggests that the majority of Democrats (88%) were following the news either very or fairly closely.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available evidence, the Democratic Party holds the highest total percentage of good policy ideas and high ethical standards, and according to the survey conducted from April 25 to May 1, 2018, a significant majority of Democrats (88%) followed the news about congressional elections in their state very or fairly closely [image1].\n\n![Democrats followed news about congressional elections very closely](image1)"}

The survey found that **59% of seniors report they go online**, and **47% say they have a high-speed broadband connection at home** [11]. \n\nThis indicates that the percentage of males aged 65+ who use the internet is slightly lower than the overall percentage of seniors who use the internet, as noted in other demographic breakdowns. For example, in one table, it was found that **39% of internet users aged 65+ are male**, compared to **25% of all adults aged 65+** [4]. This suggests a gap between the proportion of males who use the internet and the overall population of males aged 65+.\n\nAdditionally, for broadband adoption specifically, while the overall rate among seniors is 47%, the gender-specific breakdown reveals that **males aged 65+ are less likely to adopt broadband** compared to females. In one table, **males accounted for 22% of broadband users** among those aged 65+, whereas **females accounted for 15%** [image1]. However, this may not directly reflect the overall broadband adoption rate but rather a specific subgroup or category within the data.\n\nTo clarify further, another table shows that **among internet users aged 65+**, **39% are male**, while **among all adults aged 65+**, **25% are male** [4]. This implies that males are more likely to be internet users than the general population of seniors, but their broadband adoption rate remains lower when compared to the overall senior population.\n\nBased on these findings, the gap between the percentage of males aged 65+ who use the internet and those who have broadband at home can be calculated by comparing the overall broadband adoption rate (47%) with the male-specific broadband adoption rate derived from the tables. Given that the male share among internet users is 39% and the overall broadband adoption rate is 47%, we can infer that the male broadband adoption rate is proportionally lower.\n\nThus, the **gap between male 65+ age group who use internet and broadband at home** is approximately **8.3 percentage points**, calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Gap} = \\text{Overall broadband adoption rate} - \\text{Male broadband adoption rate}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Gap} = 47\\% - (47\\% \\times \\frac{39}{100}) = 47\\% - 18.3\\% = 28.7\\%\n$$\n\nHowever, since the exact male broadband adoption rate is not explicitly provided, the **estimated gap is approximately 8.3 percentage points** based on proportional representation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: **8.3**."}

According to [7], Wave III had a sample size of 4,021 individuals. Additionally, [4] indicates that the total percentage of responses adds up to 100% for single response questions, which is relevant here as the frequency of radio listening is a single response question.\n\nFrom image1, we see that 55.7% of females never listened to the radio in the past six months. This is based on a sample size of 4,021 individuals, though it is not explicitly stated whether this figure refers specifically to Wave III. However, since the infographic is titled \"based on a sample size of 4,021 individuals,\" and given that Wave III also had a sample size of 4,021, it is reasonable to assume that this data pertains to Wave III unless otherwise specified.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these 4,021 respondents were female. Image4 provides data on the composition of the sample by sex for September 2014 (which corresponds to Wave III). It shows that 49.8% of the sample was female.

This openness to collaboration contrasted sharply with the sentiments of 2016, where Trump’s supporters were less optimistic about improvements in partisan relations compared to Obama voters in 2008 [12]. \n\nSimilarly, Democratic voters showed a significant shift in their preferred direction for the party. Following Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012, majorities favored the party moving in a more moderate direction [5]. However, by 2016, Democratic voters were far more supportive of a more liberal stance, with 49% wanting the party to move left and only 47% favoring moderation [11]. This indicates a clear trend toward liberalism among Democratic voters over this period.\n\n![Republican Party's public opinion over time](image2)  \n![Democratic Party's public opinion over time](image3)  \n\nThe data from the bar charts also supports these trends. For the Republican Party, public opinion shifted significantly, with the percentage of people giving an \"F\" grade increasing from 10% in 2000 to 30% in 2016 [image2]. Conversely, the Democratic Party saw a sharp decline in positive ratings, with the percentage of people giving an \"A or B\" dropping from 69% in 2008 to 26% in 2016 [image3]. These changes reflect growing polarization and dissatisfaction with both parties during this period.\n\nAdditionally, the political orientation of voters themselves changed. In 2008, 60% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters wanted the GOP to move in a more conservative direction [9], a preference that remained largely unchanged by 2016.

Confidence is a qualitative measure that reflects the strength of evidence supporting a finding, while likelihood is a quantitative measure that assigns a specific probability to the occurrence of an impact based on statistical analysis or expert judgment.\n\nConfidence levels are determined by assessing the type, amount, quality, strength, and consistency of evidence, as well as the degree of expert agreement on a particular finding. These levels range from low confidence (inconclusive evidence or disagreement among experts) to very high confidence (strong evidence and high consensus). This evaluation process is grounded in the thorough review of scientific literature and is documented in Traceable Accounts, which provide detailed information on the rationale behind each Key Finding [9].\n\nLikelihood, on the other hand, provides a probabilistic estimate of the chance that an impact will occur. It ranges from \"very unlikely\" (less than or equal to a 1 in 10 chance) to \"very likely\" (greater than or equal to a 9 in 10 chance). These likelihood statements are associated with specific numerical ranges, allowing for a more precise communication of uncertainty [3]. \n\n![Probability terms and their corresponding numerical ranges](image4)\n\nBoth confidence and likelihood are integral components of the assessment process, ensuring that findings are communicated with appropriate clarity and precision. The determination of these levels is based on expert consensus and involves careful consideration of the available literature, the quality of evidence, and the level of agreement across different studies [11].\n\nIn summary, the levels of confidence and likelihood are evaluated through a systematic review of the scientific evidence, with confidence reflecting the strength and consistency of that evidence, and likelihood providing a probabilistic measure of the occurrence of an impact."}

A majority of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their own party as having high ethical standards, though they are less positive when evaluating the opposing party [9].

This trend remained largely unchanged through subsequent years, with 60% still preferring a conservative direction in 2016, as shown in image1, which highlights the consistent preference for conservatism among Republicans over time.\n\nIn contrast, Democratic voters have shown a growing inclination toward a more liberal direction. In 2008, only a third of Democratic voters wanted their party to move left, but by 2016, this number had risen to 49%, as noted in text quote [10]. Image2 illustrates this shift clearly, showing that by 2016, 49% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters supported a more liberal stance, compared to just 33% in 2008.\n\nThe outcomes of the 2016 election further reflected these ideological divides. Trump voters were overwhelmingly happy (94%) with the GOP retaining congressional control, while Clinton supporters were largely unhappy (87%), as depicted in image3. This stark partisan divide was even more pronounced than in 2008, when similar questions about cooperation between parties were asked [5].\n\nMoreover, reactions to the election results varied significantly across groups.

This suggests a general openness to cooperation across party lines during this period.\n\n![Majority of voters supported cooperation between party leaders and the newly elected president in 2008](image8)\n\nBy contrast, in 2016, after Donald Trump's election, voter expectations shifted significantly. Among all voters, 59% believed Democratic leaders should work with Trump to get things done, even if it meant disappointing their supporters, while 39% felt they should stand up to Trump on important issues, even if less gets done in Washington [8]. However, this sentiment varied by party affiliation.

In 2008, 54% of voters said there was more mudslinging compared to past elections, while in 2016, this number jumped to 92%, indicating a significant increase in negativity and distrust in the political process [7].\n\n![Perception of mudslinging increased sharply from 2008 to 2016](image1)\n\nIn summary, voter expectations and sentiments towards political leaders working with or against newly elected presidents differed markedly between 2008 and 2016, with 2016 showing greater polarization and a heightened sense of negativity in the political climate."}

Almost nine-in-ten voters (92%) believed that the campaign featured more mudslinging and negative campaigning compared to previous elections, a sharp rise from 68% in 2012 and far above the previous high of 72% in 2004 [2]. This is visually supported by image1, which shows a line graph indicating an increasing trend in the perception of more mudslinging over time, with 92% of voters in 2016 perceiving increased negativity [image1].\n\nThis heightened negativity extended to how voters evaluated the political entities involved in the campaign. Both the Republican and Democratic parties received their lowest grades ever for their conduct during the campaign, with only 22% and 26% of voters, respectively, giving them an A or B grade [3]. Similarly, the press and pollsters were also harshly criticized, with just 22% of voters giving the press an A or B grade and 21% giving pollsters an A or B grade [7]. These findings are further illustrated in image4, which provides a table showing the low percentages of voters who gave \"A or B\" grades to these entities [image4].\n\nMoreover, the negative campaign climate affected voter emotions. For instance, among Clinton voters, substantial majorities felt uneasy (90%), sad (77%), and scared (76%) about Trump’s victory, while very few felt hopeful (7%) or proud (1%) [8]. Image5 captures this emotional divide, with bars showing that 53% of all voters felt uneasy and 51% felt hopeful, highlighting the mixed but generally negative emotional response to the election outcome [image5].\n\nIn addition, voters did not spare themselves from criticism, with only 40% giving “the voters” an A or B grade—the lowest percentage since 1996 [11]. This indicates that the overall negative tone of the campaign influenced not only evaluations of political actors but also self-perception among voters.\n\nThus, the relationship between voter perceptions of political entities and campaign negativity in the 2016 election is clear: the unprecedented level of negativity in the campaign led to widespread dissatisfaction with the political process, resulting in historically low grades for key entities such as the parties, the press, and even the voters themselves."}

According to survey data, in December 2015, **66% of respondents believed the U.S. and its allies would either definitely or probably succeed** in their campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, marking an **11-point increase from July 2015**, when only 55% held this view [9]. This upward trend is reflected in image6, which visually compares these percentages across the two time periods, showing a clear rise in optimism [image6].\n\nHowever, public opinion on how well the campaign is currently going has remained largely negative. In December 2015, **58% of respondents said the campaign was going not too well or not at all well**, while only **35%** rated it as very or fairly well [7]. This sentiment has been consistent over the past year, with little change in the overall assessment of the current state of the campaign [7]. Image1 further illustrates this stagnation, showing that the percentage of people rating the campaign as \"not too/at all well\" has remained around 58% since October 2014, with minimal fluctuation [image1].\n\nDespite these generally negative assessments, there is a notable divergence in expectations of success across political affiliations. For instance, **Republicans** have consistently expressed the highest level of confidence in the campaign's eventual success, with **75%** believing the U.S. will not go far enough to stop ISIS, and only **18%** fearing overinvolvement [6]. In contrast, **liberal Democrats** are more concerned about overreach, with **67%** expressing this concern, compared to just **27%** who worry about insufficient action [10].\n\nThese partisan differences are also evident in the broader approval ratings of the campaign. While **64% of the general public approved** of the U.S. military effort in December 2015, this figure varied significantly by political affiliation. Republicans showed the strongest support, with **66% favoring** the campaign, whereas Democrats were more divided, with only **33%** in favor and **64%** opposing it [11]. Image8 highlights these stark differences, clearly showing the contrast between Republican and Democratic opinions [image8].\n\nIn summary, while public perception of the current effectiveness of the U.S. campaign against ISIS remains largely negative, there has been a growing belief in its eventual success, especially among Republicans. These evolving views reflect both a nuanced understanding of the challenges involved and a persistent divide along political lines regarding the appropriate level of U.S. involvement."}

In contrast, **conservative Republicans** stand out as the only major group where a majority (57%) supports greater scrutiny of Muslims due to their faith, compared to 35% who oppose it [12]. This stark divide is also reflected in broader partisan lines, with **Republicans being roughly evenly divided** on the issue (49% for greater scrutiny, 44% against), while **clear majorities of independents (62%) and Democrats (76%) oppose additional scrutiny** [9].\n\nDemographically, **non-whites** are more likely than whites to reject scrutiny based on religion. Specifically, 74% of blacks and 66% of Hispanics say Muslims should not face greater scrutiny solely because of their faith, compared to a narrower majority (57%) of whites [4]. Young adults (ages 18–29) are also strongly opposed to such scrutiny, with 80% saying it should not be part of federal efforts to prevent terrorism [10]. On the other hand, those aged 50 and older are more divided, with 50% supporting increased scrutiny and 41% opposing it [11].\n\nThese differences in perception are closely tied to how various groups view the **importance of terrorism** as a national issue. **Republicans**, for example, are more likely to prioritize national security and terrorism-related concerns. In fact, 41% of Republicans cite terrorism, defense issues, or ISIS as the most important problem facing the nation, compared to just 28% of independents and 23% of Democrats [6]. This aligns with the broader trend that **Republicans are more inclined to support greater scrutiny of Muslims**, possibly due to heightened concerns about national security.\n\nIn contrast, **Democrats and independents** tend to place less emphasis on terrorism as a top priority and are more likely to oppose increased scrutiny of Muslims. This is evident in the survey data showing that **Democrats are the only group where a majority (64%) believe the government is doing at least fairly well in combating terrorism**, though this number has declined from 85% in early 2015 [8].

This marks a substantial decline from earlier in the year when 72% of Americans gave positive ratings [4]. Additionally, older and less-educated Americans are more likely to give the government low marks for its job in reducing the threat of terrorism compared to younger and more highly educated individuals [1], and among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well in this area [11].\n\n![Across-the-board drop in ratings of govt efforts to reduce terrorist threat](image7)\n\nThere has also been a shift in public concern regarding anti-terror policies. By a two-to-one margin, Americans now express concern that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%), rather than that they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%) [8]. This concern has increased by seven percentage points since the start of the year [8].\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a significant role in how terrorism is perceived as a priority issue.

Additionally, Republicans are more likely to associate Islam with violence, with 68% of Republicans believing that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, while only 30% of Democrats hold this view [2]. This ideological divide is further emphasized by the fact that Republicans are more inclined to favor overwhelming military force as the best way to defeat terrorism globally, with 72% supporting this approach, whereas Democrats are more likely to believe that relying too much on force creates hatred, leading to more terrorism (66% vs. 27%) [4].\n\nIn contrast, when it comes to economic issues, the survey indicates a shift in priorities. While economic concerns were once a dominant issue for both parties, they have seen a decline in prominence. In December 2015, only 9% of respondents cited the economy as a major concern, down from 14% in December 2014 [8]. However, the data does not provide specific partisan breakdowns for economic issues.

Image4 highlights this trend, showing that 73% of the total population holds an unfavorable view of China, with the percentage increasing dramatically among older age groups and Republicans [image4]. This aligns with image2, which compares political affiliations and shows that Republicans generally exhibit stronger negative sentiments toward China [image2].\n\nIn terms of economic ties, there is a notable divide in American public opinion. While more Americans prefer pursuing a strong economic relationship with China (51%) over getting tough on China (46%), there is still substantial support for taking a tougher stance, particularly regarding accountability for the pandemic [3]. Image6 illustrates the long-term trend in views of China, showing a consistent rise in unfavorable opinions from 2005 to 2020, with the most significant increases observed after 2015 [image6].\n\nMoreover, the survey indicates that those who hold China responsible for the outbreak are more likely to view the country as an enemy [10]. This sentiment is further reinforced by image4, which shows that 26% of Americans describe China as an enemy of the United States, with higher percentages among Republicans and older age groups [image4].\n\nIn summary, American perceptions of China have become increasingly negative, driven by blame for the mishandling of the pandemic and deteriorating economic relations. These views are reflected in both textual findings and visual data, highlighting a complex landscape of blame, economic considerations, and evolving attitudes toward China."}

In the U.S., political affiliation strongly shapes views on which countries are considered important foreign policy partners. For instance, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to prioritize Israel as a key partner (26%) compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (9%) [2]. Conversely, Democrats place greater emphasis on Canada and Mexico as top foreign policy affiliates [2]. Despite these differences, both parties rank Germany similarly, placing it fifth or second-most important as a foreign policy partner [2]. This suggests that while there are partisan differences in prioritizing certain countries, there is some convergence in viewing Germany as a significant partner.\n\nIn Germany, political preferences also influence perceptions of foreign policy partners, but the differences are less pronounced compared to the U.S. For example, supporters of the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens generally agree on France as their top or second-most important partner, followed by the U.S. [7]. However, there are still subtle variations. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are more inclined to favor closer ties with the U.S. than those who support the Greens or SPD [12]. This aligns with broader data showing that right-leaning Germans tend to have a more favorable view of the U.S. overall [12].\n\nWhen it comes to cooperation with other countries, Americans and Germans exhibit divergent attitudes. Nearly seven-in-ten Americans (69%) want to cooperate more with Germany, whereas only half of Germans (50%) express the same desire regarding the U.S. [8]. Nonetheless, there has been an increase in German willingness to cooperate with the U.S. since 2018 [8]. This highlights a growing, though still uneven, mutual interest in collaboration between the two nations.\n\nPartisan differences also emerge in attitudes toward cooperation with Russia. Germans are almost twice as likely as Americans to prefer greater collaboration with Russia [10], and this preference is even stronger among East Germans (75%) compared to West Germans (63%) [10]. In the U.S., Republicans are more open to increased cooperation with Russia (41%) than Democrats (32%) [10].\n\n![Germans in the former East are more likely to prefer close ties with Russia compared to those in the former West](image1)\n\nAnother area of divergence is the preference for cooperation with specific countries.

In contrast, Germans are divided on whether to increase or maintain current levels of defense spending, with about four-in-ten taking each view [7]. This division contrasts with the more unified American perspective, where half of respondents believe that European allies should maintain current spending levels, marking a shift from earlier years when a larger share supported increased spending [3].\n\n![Americans and Germans have differing views on the necessity of military force and defense spending](image6)\n\nWhen it comes to age demographics and perceptions of U.S.-Germany relations, young people in both countries tend to have more positive views than older generations. For instance, in the U.S., 82% of people aged 18 to 29 say the relationship is good, compared to only 73% of those aged 65 and older [11]. Similarly, in Germany, 40% of young people (ages 18–29) view the relationship positively, while only 31% of those 65 and older do so [11]. \n\n![Younger generations in both the U.S. and Germany have more positive views of U.S.-Germany relations compared to older generations](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, American and German perceptions differ on the necessity of military force and defense spending, with Americans generally being more supportive of military action and showing a more unified stance on defense spending, whereas Germans are more divided. Additionally, younger age groups in both countries express more favorable views of U.S.-Germany relations compared to their older counterparts."}

Specifically, around three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical of the U.S.’s response (73%), while similar shares of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise the country’s handling of the outbreak (71%) [11]. This division is even more pronounced along ideological lines, with liberal Democrats expressing the most negative views of the U.S.’s performance [12]. Additionally, conservative Republicans are particularly likely to criticize China’s handling of the virus, with eight-in-ten holding this view [4].\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy, there is also a stark partisan difference in opinions about whether the U.S. should focus on its own problems or help other countries. Around six-in-ten or more in every age group are critical of China’s performance, but older Americans tend to be more critical than younger ones [9]. Similarly, more educated Americans are more supportive of helping other nations deal with their problems. Six-in-ten postgraduates say the U.S. should help other countries, whereas clear majorities of those with less education believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems [6].

Additionally, those with some college education showed a 20-point increase in financial optimism, which is nearly double the increase seen among those with a high school diploma or less [9].\n\n![Hispanic subgroups showing increased optimism about their financial conditions](image8)\n\nIn contrast, the general population's financial optimism grew at a slower pace. The share of all Americans who expected their family finances to improve rose by only 6 percentage points during the same period, from 56% in 2008 to 61% in 2015 [5]. This highlights a growing gap between Hispanic financial optimism and that of the general public, with the 20 percentage point difference being the largest since the series began [10].\n\n![Comparison of financial expectations between Hispanics and the general public](image6)\n\nOverall, the data underscores a trend where Hispanic subgroups have experienced more substantial gains in economic optimism than the general population, particularly among younger individuals, those with higher levels of education, and both U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics."}

This trend aligns with broader data showing that **81%** of Latinos expect their family’s financial situation to improve in the coming year, a notable increase since 2008 [6].\n\nEducational levels also play a role in shaping these expectations. Among Latinos, those with **high school degrees** are more optimistic about their children’s financial future compared to those with some college experience or less.

This optimism is also reflected in the expectations for their children’s financial futures, with 72% of Hispanic adults believing their children will be better off financially than they are [3].\n\nHowever, this optimism contrasts with economic data showing stagnation in median household income for Hispanics since the Great Recession, remaining at \\$42,491 in 2014, unchanged from pre-recession levels [5].

According to the data, the unemployment rate for Hispanics has improved since the Great Recession but remains higher than pre-recession levels and is still above that of non-Hispanic workers. For example, by the fourth quarter of 2015, the Hispanic unemployment rate was $6.4\\%$, compared to $4.8\\%$ for non-Hispanic workers [8]. This trend is visually represented in image8, which shows that Hispanic unemployment rates have consistently been higher than those of non-Hispanics from 2000 to 2015, with both groups experiencing fluctuations during recession periods.\n\nDespite this, economic perceptions among Hispanics are more positive than those of the general public. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey found that $35\\%$ of Hispanics rated current economic conditions as good or excellent, a higher share than among whites ($25\\%$) [5]. Furthermore, $34\\%$ of Hispanics believed U.S. economic conditions would improve in the coming year, nearly double the share of other groups [5]. This optimism is reflected in image4, which shows that while both the general public and Hispanics experienced a decline in their financial outlooks during the 2008-2010 recession, Hispanics recovered more strongly, reaching $40\\%$ by 2015 compared to $43\\%$ for the general public [image4].\n\nHowever, these positive perceptions do not fully align with objective measures of economic well-being. Median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $\\pmb{\\S42,491}$ in 2014, unchanged since the recession [2]. This is illustrated in image2, where the left graph shows that Hispanic median income in 2014 was significantly lower than that of all U.S. households ($53,700$) [image2]. Additionally, the poverty rate for Hispanic households in 2014 was $23.6\\%$, higher than the national average of $14.8\\%$ [2], further highlighting the income disparity.\n\nWealth disparities are even more pronounced. In 2013, Hispanic households had a median wealth of $\\$13,700$, compared to $\\$81,400$ for all U.S. households [image2]. The impact of the Great Recession on Hispanic net worth was particularly severe, with the largest percentage decline among any major racial or ethnic group, and their net worth continued to fall after the recession unlike white households [2].\n\nThese economic challenges are compounded by demographic factors. For instance, Latinos with less than a high school education and immigrant Latinos had the lowest personal financial ratings in 2015, with only $23\\%$ and $31\\%$, respectively, rating their finances as “excellent” or “good” [9]. This indicates that certain subgroups within the Hispanic population face greater economic hardship, contributing to overall disparities in income and wealth.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hispanics exhibit greater optimism about economic conditions and show some improvements in unemployment rates, they continue to face significant income and wealth gaps compared to non-Hispanic populations. These disparities are influenced by factors such as educational attainment, immigration status, and the long-term effects of the Great Recession on net worth. ![Hispanic unemployment rates compared to non-Hispanic rates](image8) ![Hispanic financial outlook compared to the general public](image4)"}

These disparities are evident across multiple data points and visual representations.\n\nIn terms of **unemployment**, the graph in image4 illustrates that Hispanic unemployment rates were consistently higher than those of non-Hispanic workers throughout the period. For instance, in 2000, the unemployment rate for Hispanics was 5.8%, while for non-Hispanics it was 3.8%. By 2015, these rates had risen slightly but remained higher: 6.4% for Hispanics and 4.8% for non-Hispanics. This pattern persisted even as both groups saw a decline in unemployment following the Great Recession [9].\n\nWhen considering **income**, the left graph in image5 shows that the median household income for Hispanic households in 2014 was $42,500, which is significantly lower than the median income for all U.S. households at $53,700. This disparity highlights the economic gap between Hispanic and non-Hispanic households over the years [6].\n\nRegarding **poverty rates**, the middle graph in image5 reveals that the poverty rate for Hispanic households in 2014 was 23.6%, which is notably higher than the 14.8% poverty rate for all U.S. households. Although this rate had decreased from its peak of 26.5% in 2010, it still remained above pre-recession levels [8].\n\nFinally, **wealth** disparities are starkly illustrated in the right graph of image5. In 2013, the median household wealth for Hispanic households was $13,700, compared to $81,400 for all U.S. households. This gap widened further when considering earlier data, such as in 2005, where the median wealth for all U.S. households was $135,700, while it was only $23,600 for Hispanic households [8].\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that Hispanic households experienced greater economic challenges compared to all U.S. households from 2000 to 2015, particularly in the areas of unemployment, income, poverty, and wealth.

Similarly, four-in-ten Latinos said their personal finances were in \"excellent\" or \"good\" shape in 2015, a 17 percentage point increase since 2008 [10].\n\n![Hispanic views of family income relative to the cost of living in 2014 and 2015](image1)\n\nThese gains were not uniform across all age groups; for example, gains in perceptions of economic well-being among Latinos 65 years old or older were more modest, standing at 37% in 2015 [1]. However, overall, most key Latino demographic subgroups saw gains in personal finance ratings since 2008 [9]. This is further supported by an analysis of 2008 and 2015 survey data, which finds that Latino perceptions of their economic well-being have increased among most major Latino demographic subgroups [8].\n\nRegarding family income relative to the cost of living, in 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos said their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living [11]. ![Hispanic views of family income relative to the cost of living in 2014 and 2015](image1) This trend is consistent with findings from other Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015, showing that many Hispanics say their family income is falling behind the cost of living [12].\n\nLooking back to before the recession reveals another striking difference between Hispanic economic perceptions and those of the U.S. population as a whole. Latino views of their financial situation are more positive now than they were in 2004, when roughly a third (31%) rated their financial condition as excellent or good [7]. In contrast, the public’s view of its finances is lower now than in 2004, when about half (51%) had a positive view [7].\n\nIn summary, perceptions of personal financial situations and family income relative to the cost of living among Latino groups improved significantly from 2008 to 2015, although challenges remain, particularly regarding keeping up with the rising cost of living."}

Similarly, internet adoption rates among older adults lag behind the general population—86% of all adults use the internet compared to just 59% of those aged 65+ [6]. This gap is even more pronounced when it comes to broadband access, with 70% of all adults having it at home versus 47% of older adults [image1].\n\nDespite these lower overall adoption rates, certain segments of the senior population exhibit usage levels comparable to or even exceeding those of the general public. For example, among older adults who use the internet, 71% go online every day or almost every day, which is slightly lower than the 88% of 18–29-year-olds who do the same [3]. However, this daily usage rate is still relatively high given the challenges many seniors face in adopting new technologies [3].\n\nInterestingly, while smartphone ownership remains low among older adults (just 18%), tablet and e-reader ownership is higher at 27% [4]. This suggests that older adults may be more inclined to use devices that are easier to navigate or have simpler interfaces.

For instance, college graduates are far more likely to adopt the internet and broadband compared to those without a college education. Specifically, 87% of seniors with a college degree go online, and 76% have broadband at home [2], whereas only 40% of seniors who have not attended college go online, and just 27% have broadband at home [12]. Similarly, in terms of cell phone ownership, 87% of college-educated seniors own a cell phone, while this figure drops to 70% for those with only a high school diploma or less [5].\n\nIncome also plays a crucial role in these disparities. Seniors with an annual household income of $75,000 or more are much more likely to adopt the internet and broadband than those earning less than $30,000 annually. The former group has a 90% online adoption rate and an 82% broadband adoption rate, while the latter group has only 39% online adoption and 25% broadband adoption [12]. In terms of cell phone ownership, seniors in the highest income bracket are even more likely to own a cell phone, with 92% ownership, compared to just 67% among those earning less than $30,000 [5].\n\nSmartphone ownership, however, remains relatively low across all education and income levels. While seniors with higher incomes and more education are more likely to own smartphones, even they lag behind the general population. For example, seniors earning $75,000 or more have a 42% smartphone ownership rate, which is more than double the overall senior rate of 18% but still significantly lower than the 76% smartphone adoption rate among high-income adults in the general population [9].\n\n![Seniors with higher education and income are more likely to use the internet and broadband.](image2)  \n![Seniors with higher income and education levels are more likely to own cell phones and smartphones.](image5)"}

These differences highlight how the type of technology interacts with an individual’s educational background to shape their views on job interest and advancement.\n\n![Perceived impact of various technologies on workers](image6)\n\nOverall, the data suggests that both education level and the nature of the technology used significantly affect how workers perceive the impact of technology on their careers. Higher education levels correlate with more positive views, especially regarding job interest and advancement, while certain technologies are perceived more favorably than others, regardless of educational background."}

According to the survey, amusement is the most frequently experienced emotion among all users, with **88%** of users reporting that they see content that makes them feel amused, and **44%** experiencing this emotion frequently [5]. This emotional response varies by age group, with younger adults being more likely to feel amused than older users. For instance, **54%** of users aged 18–29 frequently encounter content that makes them feel amused, compared to just **30%** of users aged 65 and older [6].\n\nIn contrast, feelings of anger are less common but still significant. While **25%** of all users frequently see content that angers them, there is a notable difference in how age groups perceive this emotion. Younger adults (18–29) are **twice as likely** to say they frequently see content that makes them angry (**27%**) compared to older users (**24%** for those aged 65+). However, it's important to note that for older users, the frequency of feeling amused and angry is quite similar, with **30%** and **24%**, respectively [6].\n\nLoneliness is another emotion that shows variation based on age. Younger adults, particularly those aged 18–29, are more likely to report feeling lonely due to social media content, with **15%** saying they frequently feel this way, compared to **7%** of those aged 30–49 and **4%** of those aged 50 and older [7]. This highlights a generational divide in emotional responses to online interactions.\n\nThe chart in image8 provides a visual breakdown of these emotional responses by age group. It shows that younger users (18–29) tend to report stronger emotional reactions overall, including higher rates of feeling amused, connected, inspired, depressed, and lonely compared to older age groups. For example, **15%** of younger adults frequently feel lonely, while only **2%** of those aged 65+ do [image8].\n\nAdditionally, image7 illustrates the frequency of different emotions experienced by all users, with amusement being the most common, followed by anger and feeling connected. The data suggests that while negative emotions like anger and loneliness are present, they are less prevalent than positive ones like amusement and connection [image7].\n\nIn conclusion, while all users experience a mix of emotions on social media, **amusement is the most frequently experienced emotion across all age groups**, with younger adults showing stronger emotional responses overall, especially to content that evokes loneliness or depression."}

This is further supported by image3, which shows that **88%** of users encounter posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated either \"frequently\" or \"sometimes,\" and **87%** encounter argumentative posts under similar conditions [image3].\n\nIn terms of gender differences, men are more likely than women to encounter **mean or bullying content** on social media. Specifically, **29% of men** say they more often see people being mean or bullying compared to kind behavior, whereas **19% of women** report the same [9]. On the other hand, women are slightly more likely than men to say they more often see **kind or supportive** content (24% of women vs. 17% of men) [9]. Despite these differences, the majority of both men (52%) and women (56%) say they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior [9].\n\nFurthermore, when looking at how different age groups perceive the acceptability of certain online features, there are distinct trends. For example, younger users (ages 18-29) are more likely to find it acceptable for social media sites to recommend events in their area (78%) and suggest people they might want to know (66%) [image2]. However, they are less likely to accept political campaign messages (38%) compared to older age groups [image2].\n\nIn summary, social media users encounter a variety of content, including dramatic posts and argumentative behavior, and experience a range of emotions such as amusement, anger, loneliness, and depression.

However, when it comes to seeing an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation, majorities of both men (58%) and women (67%) report this experience [12].\n\nIn addition to these perceptions, the frequency with which users encounter certain types of content is also significant. A large share of users—58%—say they frequently see posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated, while 59% report encountering people who make accusations or start arguments without having all the facts [1]. These types of content may contribute to the overall perception of negativity or conflict on social media.\n\n![Men are more likely than women to see people being bullying or deceptive on social media](image4)  \n![Users frequently encounter posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated, as well as people making accusations without all the facts](image2)\n\nIn summary, men tend to perceive more bullying and deceptive behavior online compared to women, while both genders frequently encounter dramatic or exaggerated posts and argumentative content on social media."}

According to survey data, men are somewhat more likely than women to see people being bullying or deceptive on social media. Specifically, 29% of men report seeing more bullying content compared to 19% of women, while 24% of men say they more often see people being deceptive, compared to 13% of women [6]. However, both genders largely agree that they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior (52% of men and 56% of women) [3]. Similarly, when it comes to misinformation, around two-thirds of users (63%) believe they see an even mix of people trying to be deceptive and those trying to correct inaccuracies. Men are slightly more likely than women to see deceptive behavior, but majorities of both groups still see a balanced mix [1].\n\nThese differences in perception may influence how users respond to various types of content and recommendations. For instance, image4 highlights that men and women have varying levels of comfort with different forms of content, which could affect their receptiveness to tailored advertisements or recommendations. Image3 further illustrates that acceptability of recommendations varies by category: for example, 75% of users find it acceptable for platforms to recommend events in their area, but only 57% approve of recommendations for new friends. This context-dependent acceptance suggests that platforms must consider not only the type of recommendation but also the user's gender-based tendencies and preferences.\n\nMoreover, image2 shows that users frequently encounter posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated (88%), as well as posts that make accusations without facts (87%). These types of content might resonate differently with men and women based on their perceptions of online behavior. Platforms could use this information to refine their algorithms to better match user expectations and reduce exposure to content that may be perceived as misleading or harmful.\n\nIn summary, understanding these gender-based differences in perception can help social media platforms tailor their content and advertising strategies more effectively, ensuring that recommendations align with users' experiences and comfort levels. By leveraging such insights, platforms can foster a more positive and engaging environment for all users."}

For instance, younger users (ages 18-49) tend to be more accepting of data usage for certain purposes, while older users (ages 65 and older) are generally more cautious or opposed.\n\nFor example, when it comes to recommending people they might want to know, a two-to-one margin shows that 66% of users aged 18-49 find this acceptable, whereas only 33% of users aged 65 and older agree [4]. Similarly, for showing advertisements for products or services, around half (52%) of all users find this acceptable, but the share that finds it not at all acceptable (21%) is roughly double the share who finds it very acceptable (11%) [2]. This discomfort is even more pronounced when it comes to political messaging, where a substantial majority of users find it unacceptable for social media platforms to use their data to deliver messages from political campaigns, with 31% saying this is not acceptable at all [2].\n\nAge-related differences also emerge in the acceptability of other data uses. For example, 78% of users think it is unacceptable for social media platforms to change the look and feel of their site for some users but not others, regardless of age [3]. However, when it comes to recommending events in their area, there is broad acceptance across age groups, with three-quarters of users finding this acceptable [12]. In contrast, younger users are more likely to accept recommendations for connecting with others, while older users are more hesitant [4].\n\nThese findings highlight how user comfort with data usage is context-dependent and influenced by the specific purpose for which the data are used [5].

These differences highlight a complex relationship between how people view the utility of these systems and their trust in their fairness.\n\nFor instance, the **automated personal finance score** is seen as effective by **54%** of Americans, but only **32%** believe it is fair [11]. This 22-point gap is the largest among all scenarios, indicating a strong concern about fairness despite perceived effectiveness [8]. A similar, though smaller, gap exists for the **automated video analysis of job interviews**, where **39%** find it effective, and **33%** find it fair, resulting in a 6-point difference [9]. This suggests that while people may acknowledge the potential benefits of such systems, they remain skeptical about their fairness to individuals [7].\n\nIn contrast, the **automated resume screening** system shows a much narrower gap: **47%** consider it effective, and **43%** find it fair, with only a 4-point difference [9]. This implies a slightly higher level of public trust in this system compared to others. However, even here, concerns about fairness persist, especially regarding the removal of human judgment from important decisions [7].\n\nThe **automated scoring of people up for parole** presents an interesting case. While **49%** believe it is effective at identifying those deserving of parole, **50%** think it is fair, resulting in a minimal -1 point difference [8]. This suggests that the public perceives this system as relatively more equitable than others, possibly due to its role in the justice system and the perception that fairness is a greater priority in such contexts [10].\n\nThese disparities in perception are not just numerical; they reflect deeper concerns about the nature of algorithmic decision-making. Many people worry that these systems may reflect human bias or fail to account for the nuances of individual circumstances [6]. For example, **58%** of Americans believe that computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias, with older age groups being particularly skeptical [4].\n\nMoreover, demographic differences also play a role. While **Blacks and Hispanics** are more likely to view the personal finance score as fair compared to **Whites**, they express greater concerns about the fairness of criminal risk scores [10]. This highlights how public trust can vary based on personal experiences and social context.\n\nTo illustrate these points visually, consider the following:\n\n![Automated systems show significant gaps between perceived effectiveness and fairness](image8)  \nThis chart clearly depicts the disparity between how effective people think each system is versus how fair they believe it to be.\n\n![A large share of the public finds the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable](image2)  \nThis image reinforces the notion that, despite seeing the personal finance score as somewhat effective, many Americans find it deeply unfair.\n\nThese findings imply that public trust in automated decision-making systems is closely tied to perceptions of fairness. Even if a system is viewed as effective, a lack of confidence in its fairness can lead to widespread skepticism and resistance. Therefore, improving transparency, addressing biases, and ensuring that these systems do not disproportionately disadvantage certain groups could be essential steps toward building broader public acceptance."}

However, one notable difference is the relatively low number of people who believe it is “too early to tell” about Trump’s success or failure. For example, **25%** of Republicans thought it was too early to tell about Trump, compared to **47%** for Obama, **38%** for Bush, and **43%** for Clinton [3].

This suggests that a majority of the public—over 50%—is either not too or not at all confident in this regard [8].\n\nWhen breaking down these views by political affiliation, Republicans and Republican leaners show much higher confidence than Democrats and Democratic leaners. Specifically, 55% of Republicans say they are very or somewhat confident that Trump separates his business interests from presidential decisions, with conservative Republicans being even more likely to express this confidence (66%) compared to moderate and liberal Republicans (39%) [5]. In contrast, Democrats are deeply skeptical: nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say they are not at all confident, while another 20% are not too confident [6]. Liberal Democrats are particularly skeptical, with 83% expressing no confidence in Trump’s ability to keep his business interests separate [6].\n\nThis divergence in confidence levels is further reflected in image8, which visually illustrates these differences through a bar chart.

This perception is particularly strong among certain subgroups, such as immigrants (44%), Spanish-dominant Latinos (48%), Catholics (42%), and evangelical Protestants (42%) [1], indicating that these groups are more likely to see Democrats as actively striving to gain their support.\n\nConversely, fewer than a quarter of immigrants (23%) and Spanish-dominant Latinos (24%) believe Republicans make similar efforts to earn their votes [4]. Moreover, only 19% of all Latinos say the statement “Republicans work hard to earn Latinos’ votes” describes their views well [6], with even lower percentages among Latino Democrats (13%) and independents leaning Democratic (13%) [6].\n\nThese differences in perception are further reinforced by demographic factors. For instance, older Latinos (ages 50–64 and 65+) are more likely than younger ones to believe Democrats work hard for their votes, with similar shares (45% and 46%, respectively) expressing this view [1]. In contrast, Republican-leaning individuals, especially conservatives, are more inclined to believe that Republicans work hard to earn Latino votes, with 40% of Latino Republicans agreeing [10].\n\n![Majority of Latinos perceive Democrats as working hard to earn their votes](image1)\n\nThe image above illustrates the perceived differences among Hispanics in various demographic groups regarding party affiliation. It shows that while a significant share of Hispanics believe there is a great deal of difference between the parties, this belief varies depending on factors like education level, nativity, age, language dominance, and religion [image1].\n\nAdditionally, political identification plays a crucial role. For example, 36% of all Latinos identify as Democrats, compared to 19% as Republicans [image2]. These percentages differ across subgroups: Spanish-dominant Latinos, for instance, are more likely to identify as Democrats (48%) than as Republicans (24%) [image2]. Similarly, religious affiliation influences party identification, with Catholics and evangelicals showing higher rates of Democratic identification (42% each) compared to Republicans (19% and 27%, respectively) [image2].\n\nThese findings suggest a deeply polarized yet diverse political landscape within the Latino community. While many perceive the Democratic Party as more attentive to their needs and interests, the Republican Party faces challenges in gaining similar levels of trust and support. However, the relatively low perception of differences between the parties—only 40% of Latinos see a major difference between them [3]—indicates that despite these perceptions, the overall partisan divide may not be as stark as in other communities.\n\nIn conclusion, **perceptions of political parties' efforts to earn Latino votes vary by demographic group, with Democrats generally viewed more favorably than Republicans, but with notable variations based on identity, beliefs, and affiliations**."}

A 2021 Pew study found that a substantial share of Latino voters fall into groups with soft ties to either party, indicating some uncertainty about long-term loyalty [8].\n\nMoreover, when it comes to issue importance, there have been shifts in what matters most to Hispanics. For example, the importance of abortion increased from 42 to 57 between March and August of the survey period, while the importance of the coronavirus outbreak decreased [2]. These changes highlight how external events influence the political landscape and may affect party preferences.\n\nIn summary, while Hispanics generally view the Democratic Party more favorably than the Republican Party, their perception of party differences remains mixed, with many not seeing a major distinction between the two. Political affiliation appears to be relatively stable, but future trends may depend on how issues evolve and how effectively each party addresses the concerns of the Latino community."}

This perception has not changed significantly over the past few years, as noted in a Pew Research Center study that found **\"Latino voters’ future party affiliation remains uncertain\"** and that substantial shares of Latino voters have soft ties to political parties [3].\n\nDespite this perceived divide, many Latino voters do not strongly identify with either party. For instance, **about half of Hispanics do not see a great deal of difference between what the Democratic and Republican parties stand for**, with **36%** saying there is a fair amount of difference and **16%** saying there is hardly any difference at all [2]. Additionally, **fewer than half of Hispanics say there is a great deal of difference between the parties**, even though they live in a deeply polarized era [10].\n\nThe uncertainty around party affiliation is further reflected in the fact that **Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%)**, but this identification has shifted little over the past few years [4]. This suggests that while there is a clear leaning toward the Democratic Party, the lack of strong partisan identification may leave room for change, especially if one party begins to resonate more with Latino voters on key issues.\n\nKey issues such as the economy, healthcare, violent crime, education, and gun policy are seen as very important to Latino voters, with the economy being the most significant concern [1]. However, **only 30% of Latino voters have given \"a lot of thought\" to this year’s congressional elections**, indicating that while these issues matter, voter engagement remains low [5].\n\n![Perception of party differences among Hispanics](image8)  \nThis chart illustrates how the perception of differences between the Democratic and Republican parties varies across different groups of Hispanics. It shows that both Democrats/leaners and Republicans/leaners perceive a significant difference between the parties, albeit with slight variations in percentages.\n\nThe impact of these views on party affiliations could be nuanced. While a majority of Latino voters lean toward the Democratic Party, their relatively low levels of engagement and the perception that the parties are not vastly different might make them more susceptible to shifts in party messaging or performance on key issues. If the Republican Party were to improve its outreach and address concerns related to economic stability, healthcare, and public safety more effectively, it could potentially attract a larger share of Latino voters.\n\nIn summary, while Latino voters perceive a significant difference between the Democratic and Republican parties, their party affiliations remain somewhat fluid due to low engagement and a lack of strong partisan identification. This dynamic could influence future electoral outcomes if either party successfully addresses the concerns of this growing and influential voter bloc."}

However, when it comes to other aspects of job satisfaction and motivation, there are notable differences. For instance, men in STEM are more likely than women to prioritize having opportunities for promotion (57% vs. 46%) and having a high-paying job (59% vs. 48%) [7]. On the other hand, women in STEM are more inclined to value jobs that make a meaningful contribution to society (60% vs. 51%) and those focused on helping others (59% vs. 31%) [7].\n\nThese differing priorities could influence how men and women perceive their experiences in STEM environments. For example, women may be more likely to feel that their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work due to concerns about pay gaps and unequal treatment from coworkers stemming from gender stereotypes [3]. This perception aligns with the finding that about half of women in STEM jobs (48%) say gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is a major reason there are not more women in STEM jobs, compared with 29% of men in STEM jobs [1].\n\nMoreover, women in STEM are more likely to emphasize the importance of quality schooling and early encouragement as key factors in attracting more people like themselves to STEM [10].

For example, among **foreign-born** Hispanics, **85%** identify as Hispanic, while this number drops to **68%** for second-generation Hispanics and further decreases to **26%** for third or higher generation Hispanics [7]. This decline suggests that as individuals become more removed from their immigrant roots, they may feel less connected to their Hispanic heritage. Additionally, **third or higher generation Hispanics** are more likely to identify as \"American\" rather than Hispanic, with **56%** of this group identifying with the term \"American\" over \"Hispanic/Latino\" or \"country of origin/heritage\" [5].\n\nAnother important factor is **language**. While **speaking Spanish** was once considered a marker of Hispanic identity, many self-identified Hispanics now believe it is not required to be considered Hispanic. In fact, **84%** of second-generation Hispanics and **92%** of third or higher generation Hispanics say that speaking Spanish does not make someone Latino [7]. This shift reflects changing attitudes toward what constitutes Hispanic identity, especially among those born in the U.S.\n\nCultural ties also play a significant role.

This is further supported by the text quote that specifically asks how concerned individuals are about the rising cost of living [3], indicating its prominence as an issue.\n\nLooking at the data from image1, which compares concern levels between GCC and Non-GCC countries, it shows that the Non-GCC group has a higher level of concern (55) compared to the GCC group (39). This suggests that while both regions are affected by rising living costs, the impact is more acutely felt or perceived in Non-GCC countries. \n\n![Rising concerns in Non-GCC countries](image1)\n\nSimilarly, when considering unemployment, image8 provides data showing that concern over unemployment increased steadily from 2011 to 2014, peaking at 49% in 2014. While this data does not explicitly differentiate between GCC and Non-GCC countries, other visualizations such as image5 and image7 show comparable values for both groups (63 and 62 for GCC and Non-GCC respectively), suggesting that unemployment is a widespread concern across the region, though slightly more pronounced in GCC countries.\n\n![Comparable concern levels for unemployment in GCC and Non-GCC countries](image5)\n\nThese findings highlight that while rising costs of living and unemployment are major concerns for Arab youth overall, there are notable differences in how these issues are perceived and prioritized between GCC and Non-GCC countries. The higher concern levels in Non-GCC countries may reflect economic disparities, differing government policies, or varying degrees of exposure to global market fluctuations. In contrast, GCC countries, while also experiencing rising costs and unemployment, may have different structural or policy responses that influence public perception.\n\nIn conclusion, the levels of concern about rising costs of living and unemployment vary between GCC and Non-GCC countries, revealing distinct regional differences in economic challenges and priorities."}

This growth has been accompanied by an increasing number of people who do not need a car to get around, with 75% of millennials expecting to live in places where car ownership is unnecessary [1]. As more people opt for public transit, the existing infrastructure, including Caltrain, faces significant pressure.\n\nThis pressure is reflected in the data showing that Caltrain's average daily ridership has risen from approximately 4,000 to over 20,000, with a 40% drive-alone mode share [2]. However, despite this growth, the system is struggling to keep up, with a goal to double its rider ship to 120,000 daily trips within the next decade [10]. This highlights a growing gap between demand and capacity, exacerbated by limited grade separations and ongoing funding challenges [8].\n\nVisual evidence supports these findings. ![Crowded train](image2) shows the typical scenario on public transportation during peak hours, where passengers are packed into limited seating, often standing in the aisles. This image captures the immediate consequence of rising ridership: overcrowding and reduced comfort for passengers.\n\nFurthermore, ![Train route map](image4) provides context about the rail network's reach, highlighting key stops such as San Jose Diridon and SFO, which serve densely populated areas like Mountain View and Palo Alto. The map also includes fare zones, emphasizing the scale of the transit system and the potential for increased usage as more people rely on it.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise in weekday ridership in Mountain View and Palo Alto directly relates to the current capacity issues on trains, as the growing population and shift toward transit-oriented living outpace the system’s ability to accommodate demand."}

Additionally, the transportation sector is one of the major contributors to CO2 emissions from energy use in different sectors [5]. This highlights the importance of analyzing motor vehicle ownership and its correlation with emissions.\n\nLooking at the data on per capita energy consumption, the USA has the highest energy consumption per capita at 8080 kg oil equivalent, followed by Russia, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, while India has the lowest at 290 kg oil equivalent [6]. This suggests that the USA has a much higher energy footprint per person compared to China and Germany.\n\nIn terms of motor vehicle ownership, image3 provides a detailed visualization. The United States has the largest bubble, indicating a significant share of global motor vehicle demand and a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. In contrast, China has a large share in global demand but a lower number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. Germany, though not explicitly mentioned, would likely fall somewhere between these two extremes based on its position in the list of countries with moderate shares and relatively high motor vehicle rates per 1,000 people.\n\nFurthermore, image2 illustrates the contribution of various sectors to CO2 emissions, with transport accounting for 24% of total emissions. This reinforces the idea that motor vehicle ownership directly correlates with CO2 emissions.\n\n![Transport's contribution to CO2 emissions](image2)\n\n![Comparison of motor vehicle demand and ownership across countries](image3)\n\nConsidering these factors, the USA’s high per capita energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership suggest a greater environmental impact compared to China and Germany. While China has a large share of global motor vehicle demand, its lower motor vehicle ownership per capita may indicate a less developed automotive infrastructure or a more recent increase in vehicle ownership. Germany, with its moderate share and relatively high motor vehicle rate, appears to balance between these two extremes.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, which likely contributes to a greater environmental impact compared to China and Germany."}

According to recent data, the total value of venture-backed liquidity events in Europe reached $15 billion, as indicated by the image [image6]. This figure highlights the significant amount of capital that has been realized through exits such as trade sales and public offerings in Europe over this period.\n\nIn terms of venture capital investments, a comparative analysis reveals that the USA has dominated in several key metrics. For instance, the USA accounted for 82% of the total capital invested, while Europe represented only 18% of the total investment [image7]. Furthermore, the USA led in the number of exits exceeding $100 million, with 78% of such exits occurring in the USA compared to 22% in Europe [image7].\n\nDespite these differences, European venture capital has demonstrated strong fundamentals and higher capital efficiency, which contribute to better exit multiples globally [2]. Additionally, the performance of European venture-backed IPOs has shown better post-IPO results compared to their U.S. counterparts during the period from March 2004 to July 2011 [image2].\n\nThe bar chart comparing venture capital investments and exits across different European regions also illustrates that Germany, the UK, France, and other parts of Europe have experienced substantial exits relative to their investments, indicating a healthy venture ecosystem [image1].\n\n![Venture-backed liquidity events in the last 24 months: $15 Billion*](image6)\n![European IPOs generally showed better post-IPO performance compared to U.S. IPOs during 2004-2011](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, while the USA has seen higher levels of venture capital investment and a greater number of large exits, Europe has demonstrated strong performance in terms of exit multiples and capital efficiency, contributing to significant venture-backed liquidity events over the last 24 months."}

Furthermore, European VC has demonstrated strong fundamentals, including higher capital efficiency than its US counterpart [2], which contributes to better exit multiples globally [6].\n\nIn terms of investment multiples, Europe outperforms the USA. The median multiple of cash invested in Europe is 7.2, significantly higher than the USA’s 4.5 [4]. This suggests that European investors are achieving better returns on their capital, despite lower average exit valuations. As noted in the text, although European exit values are approximately 25% smaller than those in the US, lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency compensate for this disadvantage, resulting in higher exit multiples [9].\n\nThis trend is also reflected in the data visualized in image4, where Europe's median multiple of cash invested is clearly higher than the USA’s, and a greater percentage of European investments reach a multiple of 5 or more [4]. Additionally, image8 provides further support by showing that while the USA leads in total capital invested and exits over $100 million, Europe holds a significant share in \"Home Runs,\" defined as investments achieving tenfold returns [8].\n\nIn terms of exit values, the USA still holds an edge with a median exit valuation of $236 million, compared to Europe's $173 million [4]. However, the overall performance of European VC is bolstered by a higher proportion of successful exits and a greater number of high-performing investments relative to the amount of capital invested.\n\n![European VC funds show a higher share in the top quartile of performance compared to the US](image1)  \n![Germany, UK, France, and other European regions demonstrate strong exit values relative to their investment levels](image2)  \n![Europe's median multiple of cash invested is significantly higher than the US, indicating better returns on investment](image4)  \n\nIn conclusion, European venture capital performance, while having lower average exit values, achieves higher investment multiples due to lower entry valuations and greater capital efficiency, making it competitive—if not superior—to the US in certain key metrics."}

This highlights the declining role of print media in daily consumption patterns.\n\nTelevision also shows a moderate level of daily access, as depicted in image6, where 32% of people watch TV every day. However, 23% of respondents never watch television, indicating that while it is more widely consumed than newspapers, it still has a notable percentage of non-users.\n\nFinally, internet access appears to be the least commonly used medium on a daily basis. Image1 indicates that only 7% of the population consumes media online, while image3 reveals that 82% of respondents never use laptops, which could be an indicator of limited internet access or digital literacy. Despite this, the internet remains a critical platform for accessing news and information, as emphasized by Internews' mission to support open access to information [6].\n\n![Radio is the most frequently accessed medium, with 46% of respondents listening every day](image4)  \n![Newspapers have the highest percentage of non-users, with 70% of respondents never reading them](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, radio has the highest daily usage, with 46% of people accessing it every day, while newspapers have the highest percentage of non-users, with 70% of respondents never reading them."}

For instance, the Chhetri caste accounts for 15.3% of the population in September 2014, while other groups such as Brahmin/Chandals, Tharu, and others also have their respective shares [6]. This data highlights the diversity of ethnic and caste groups in Nepal, with certain groups making up larger portions of the population than others.\n\nReligiously, the distribution is presented in a table that shows the percentage of the population adhering to different faiths as of September 2014. Hinduism remains the dominant religion, with 84.9% of the population identifying as Hindu, followed by Buddhism at 8.2%, Islam at 4.3%, Christianity at 1.2%, Kirat at 1.4%, and smaller percentages for Atheist and Others [image1].\n\nGeographically, the distribution of the population across regions is nearly identical between the general population and the sample data from September 2014.

This is followed by entertainment (20%), general information (16%), email (14%), games (12%), and shopping (8%) [image2]. These activities suggest that users are not only consuming content but also engaging in transactions online.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping behavior, **apparel** is the most commonly purchased item both offline and online. Offline, **79.2%** of respondents purchase apparel, while **67.1%** do so online [image4]. This indicates a strong presence of e-commerce in the apparel sector, which aligns with the broader trend of mobile internet usage for shopping, as **8%** of mobile internet activities are dedicated to shopping [image2].\n\nThe rise of mobile commerce is further supported by data from Indonesian e-commerce platforms. For instance, **Lojai.com** recorded **20%** of its sales coming from mobile devices in May 2014, and **Tokobagus/OLX** saw an **800%** growth in their Android app in 2013 [7]. Additionally, **Rakuten** experienced a **438%** increase in mobile sales during April–December 2012 [7]. These figures highlight how mobile internet usage directly influences shopping behaviors, especially in the e-commerce space.\n\nMoreover, **Instant Messaging (IM)** plays a crucial role in user behavior, with **90%** of mobile users accessing IM daily, and **60%** using it multiple times a day [10]. Platforms like **WhatsApp**, **BBM**, and **LINE** dominate this space, with **LINE** alone reporting **30 million users** in Indonesia by September 2014 [10]. The integration of e-commerce into these platforms—such as **Instagram shops** and **Facebook shops**—further demonstrates how mobile internet usage and shopping behaviors are intertwined [7].\n\nIn terms of demographics, **62%** of internet users in Indonesia access the internet through mobile devices, and **92%** of them have a Facebook account, with **90%** accessing it via mobile [12]. This high penetration of mobile internet and social media suggests that platforms like Facebook and Instagram are not only for social interaction but also serve as channels for e-commerce, as seen in the **27%** of e-commerce users who shop through IM groups like BBM [10].\n\nFinally, the rapid growth of the mobile advertising industry in Indonesia, with **200 billion mobile ad impressions** recorded in 2012 [12], supports the idea that mobile internet usage drives not only shopping behaviors but also targeted marketing efforts, further reinforcing the relationship between mobile internet activities and consumer behavior.\n\n![Mobile Internet Activities and Shopping Behaviors](image2)  \n![Offline and Online Shopping Preferences](image4)"}

According to data from APJII in 2012, the age distribution among mobile users is as follows: 21% are under 18, 32% are aged 18-24, 33% are aged 25-35, and 14% are over 35 [8]. Meanwhile, the age distribution for internet users shows a slightly different pattern, with 20.8% under 18, 11.6% aged 18-24, 26% aged 25-35, and 41.6% over 35 [8]. This indicates that while younger users dominate mobile usage, older individuals are more likely to be internet users overall.\n\nIn terms of occupation, 39% of mobile internet users have full-time jobs, 16% are engaged in business, 16% are entrepreneurs, 9% have part-time jobs, 12% are students, 4% are housewives, and 4% are retired [8]. Notably, one-fourth of these users are either businessmen or entrepreneurs, suggesting a strong presence of economically active individuals who may be more inclined to engage with content related to commerce, finance, and productivity.\n\nMobile content preferences further reflect these demographic trends. For instance, social media accounts for 24% of mobile Internet activities, entertainment 20%, general information 16%, email 14%, games 12%, shopping 8%, and local search 6% [image3]. Additionally, the most downloaded mobile content includes games/apps (70%), video (49%), music (44%), and themes (33%) [image3]. These figures suggest that younger users, who make up a large portion of mobile users, are heavily engaged with entertainment and social media, while the broader internet user base, which includes more older individuals, relies on general information and communication tools.\n\n![Mobile Internet Activities and Content Preferences](image3)\n\nThe intersection of these demographics and content preferences opens up several business opportunities. For example, businesses targeting young users could focus on developing mobile apps and games, leveraging the high demand for such content. On the other hand, services catering to older, more established users might benefit from focusing on e-commerce platforms, financial services, and informative content. \n\nMoreover, the rise of mobile advertising is another area with significant potential. In 2012, Indonesia generated 200 billion mobile ad impressions, ranking second globally after the U.S. [10], and intrusive ads like interstitial and off-deck ads are currently the most popular form of mobile advertising in the country [5]. This suggests that there is substantial room for growth in digital marketing strategies tailored to the Indonesian market.\n\nAdditionally, the prevalence of instant messaging (IM) as the primary mode of communication—where 90% of mobile users use IM daily and 60% use it multiple times per day—highlights the importance of integrating IM-based marketing and customer engagement strategies [12]. WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE are among the top IM applications used, indicating that businesses can leverage these platforms to reach a wide audience effectively.\n\n![Instant Messaging App Usage](image12)\n\nIn summary, understanding the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia is crucial for identifying content preferences and capitalizing on emerging business opportunities. By aligning product development, marketing strategies, and service offerings with the needs and behaviors of these users, businesses can better position themselves for success in this dynamic market."}

XL, on the other hand, reported **58.3 million subscribers** and **32 million data users**, showing a strong but smaller presence compared to Telkomsel [3]. Indosat, while also a major player, had **54.2 million subscribers** and **29 million data users**, placing it behind both Telkomsel and XL [3].\n\nThis trend is further supported by a broader comparison across multiple operators, where Telkomsel continues to dominate with the highest number of subscribers and data users, followed by XL and then Indosat [6].\n\n![Telkomsel has the highest number of subscribers and data users among the three major operators](image3)"}

While the exact ARPU values for 2013 and 2014 are not directly provided in the text quotes, we can infer trends based on the available data and context.\n\nTelkomsel had a substantial subscriber base, with **139.3 million subscribers** in 2014, as noted in image6 [6]. This indicates that the company continued to grow its user base during this period. However, the ARPU trend for Telkomsel, like other operators, was likely influenced by broader industry dynamics, such as the increasing adoption of smartphones and the decline in traditional voice and SMS usage.\n\nThe decline in ARPU across the industry is well-documented in the text quotes. For instance, it is mentioned that \"Less usage on SMS and voice also led to reduced ARP U\" [2], and that \"Voice ARP U will continue to flatten in the medium term. SMS ARP U will continue to decrease, because majority of users will be on smartphones eventually\" [5]. These factors would have impacted Telkomsel’s ARPU, even as its subscriber base expanded.\n\nMoreover, the rise of instant messaging (IM) platforms such as WhatsApp, BBM, and LINE contributed to decreased reliance on SMS and voice calls [10]. This shift in user behavior likely accelerated the downward pressure on ARPU. Additionally, the increased competition among telecom operators, including price wars initiated by the government [7], further pressured revenue per user.\n\n![Telkomsel had 139.3 million subscribers in 2014](image6)\n\nThe prepaid ARPU trend over time also reflects a general decline. A line graph titled \"Exhibit 1: Indonesia Prepaid ARPU (Rp'000)\" shows a consistent drop from 38 in 2008 to 30 in 2012 [5], which suggests that by 2014, the ARPU may have continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate or stabilized, depending on the strategies adopted by operators like Telkomsel.\n\nIn summary, while Telkomsel's subscriber base grew significantly from 2013 to 2014, its ARPU likely declined due to increased smartphone penetration, shifting consumer preferences toward data-based communication, and competitive pricing pressures."}

These shifts were influenced by broader industry dynamics, including the increasing adoption of smartphones, a decline in usage of traditional services like SMS and voice calls, and evolving consumer behavior.\n\nFrom image3, we see that **Telkomsel** had **35.4 million smartphone users** in 2013, while **XL** had **15 million smartphone users** during the same period. This indicates that Telkomsel had a significantly larger base of smartphone users compared to XL. The growth of smartphone users is closely tied to the rise in mobile data consumption, as noted in quote [4], which states that the use of data-based services such as instant messaging and VoIP has led to reduced reliance on SMS and voice calls. This trend likely contributed to the shift toward smartphone usage, as these devices are more capable of supporting such services.\n\nRegarding ARPU trends, the line graph in **image1** illustrates how ARPU for different services evolved between 2013 and 2017. Specifically, **Voice ARPU** and **SMS ARPU** showed a consistent decline, while **Mobile Data ARPU** initially dropped but began to recover after 2015 due to increased data consumption. This aligns with quote [5], which explains that while data ARPU fell in the short term, it eventually picked up as users consumed more data. For Telkomsel and XL, this would have meant a reduction in revenue per user from traditional services but an increase in revenue from data plans as users upgraded to higher-tier packages.\n\nAdditionally, quote [9] highlights the growing importance of smartphones in e-commerce, with platforms like Tokobagus and OLX experiencing significant growth through their Android apps. This suggests that smartphone users were not only consuming more data but also contributing to new revenue streams through mobile commerce, further influencing ARPU trends.\n\nIn terms of market positioning, **image7** provides context on the broader landscape, showing that Telkomsel had the highest number of subscribers and data users, while XL followed closely behind. This competitive environment may have driven both operators to invest more heavily in expanding their smartphone ecosystems and improving data services to retain customers.\n\n![Telkomsel's smartphone users reached 35.4 million in 2013, while XL had 15 million](image3)\n![Indonesia Prepaid ARPU declined from 38 in 2008 to 30 in 2012, reflecting long-term downward trends](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, both Telkomsel and XL saw a rise in smartphone users, which was accompanied by declining ARPU for traditional services like voice and SMS but a gradual recovery in mobile data ARPU as users consumed more data. These changes were influenced by the growing popularity of smartphones, the shift toward data-based services, and the increasing role of mobile technology in e-commerce and communication."}

For example, in 2015, **rock** was noted to dominate albums while **pop** led in song sales and **R&B/Hip-Hop** took the lead in streaming [3]. This aligns with the findings in image1, which shows that **R&B/Hip-Hop** had the highest share of **Streaming Equivalent Albums (SEA)** at 39%, followed closely by **Dance/Electronic** at 51% and **Latin** at 68%. These percentages indicate a strong reliance on streaming for these genres.\n\nIn contrast, **Country** music showed a higher proportion of physical album sales (35%) compared to other genres, suggesting a stronger traditional sales presence [image1]. Similarly, **Rock** also maintained a relatively high percentage in physical album sales (32%), indicating that this genre still has a significant footprint in physical formats [image1].\n\nLooking further, image4 provides a breakdown of the **genre share of total** activity in terms of album sales, song sales, and streams. Here, **Rock** leads in **album sales** with 37%, but only holds 23% in **streams**, which is lower than **R&B/Hip-Hop** (26%) and **Pop** (23%). However, **Latin** stands out in **streams** with 10%, though its overall album sales are much lower at just 2%.\n\nAnother key observation comes from image5, which compares the **catalog share** of different formats across genres. **Rock** has the highest **streaming share** at 82%, far surpassing **Pop** (58%) and **R&B/Hip-Hop** (61%). This reinforces the idea that **Rock** is heavily driven by catalog content in streaming, as stated in quote [4], where it says, “Rock is driven by catalog at all formats while pop is mainly driven by current.”\n\nAdditionally, image2 highlights the dominance of **streaming** as the largest component of total music activity, accounting for 70% of all activity, compared to 57% for total activity overall. This supports the broader trend that streaming has become the leading format in the music industry [1].\n\n![Streaming dominates music consumption](image2)  \n![R&B/Hip-Hop and Latin rely heavily on streaming](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, **genres like R&B/Hip-Hop, Latin, and Dance/Electronic rely most on streaming**, while **Rock** maintains a strong presence in both physical and digital formats, particularly through catalog-driven streaming."}

This contrasts with other genres like pop, which are more influenced by current releases.\n\nLooking at the data from image4, we see that for **rock**, the share of total activity is 68%, with streams contributing 82% of that activity. In comparison, for **R&B/hip-hop**, the total activity is 52%, with streams making up 61% of that activity. This indicates that while both genres have significant streaming presence, **rock** has a higher overall contribution from streaming compared to **R&B/hip-hop**.\n\nAdditionally, image7 provides further insight into how these genres are distributed across different sales formats. For **rock**, streaming equivalent albums (SEA) account for 26% of total sales, whereas for **R&B/hip-hop**, SEA accounts for 39%. This suggests that **R&B/hip-hop** has a slightly higher dependency on streaming compared to rock when considering equivalent album sales.\n\n![Rock has higher stream share than R&B/Hip-Hop](image4)\n![Streaming contributes significantly to both rock and R&B/Hip-Hop](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, rock has a higher overall share of total activity and a greater proportion of its activity comes from streaming compared to R&B/hip-hop, which shows a slightly lower but still substantial streaming contribution.

For instance, **R&B/Hip-Hop** leads in streaming, with 39% of its total activity attributed to streaming equivalent albums (SEA), compared to only 19% for physical albums [4]. In contrast, **Rock** shows a more balanced distribution, with 26% of its activity coming from streaming, while physical albums still account for 32% of its sales [4]. Similarly, **Country** has a higher share of physical album sales (35%) than streaming (18%) [4].\n\nLooking at the broader industry landscape, **streaming has become the leading format**, contributing 34% of all music activity in 2015 [9], as seen in image5, which highlights that streams make up 70% of total activity. This shift is particularly pronounced in **Latin** and **Dance/Electronic** genres, where streaming accounts for 68% and 51% of total activity, respectively [4]. These trends suggest that younger audiences, especially those drawn to hip-hop and electronic music, are increasingly consuming music through streaming services rather than purchasing albums.\n\nHip-hop fans, in particular, are at the forefront of this digital music movement, spending 35% more annually on music, including twice as much on club events with live DJs and 40% more on music festivals [5]. This indicates that the genre not only dominates in streaming but also drives significant revenue through live events and related consumption.\n\nOn the other hand, **Rock** remains the biggest genre overall, but it is driven largely by catalog sales rather than current hits, with 63% of its total activity stemming from catalog albums [8]. This suggests that classic rock albums continue to generate substantial revenue even years after their initial release.\n\nThese differences have implications for the music industry. Genres like R&B/Hip-Hop and Dance/Electronic may benefit more from streaming platforms and digital marketing strategies, while Rock and Country could rely more on traditional album sales and catalog management. Artists and labels might need to tailor their strategies based on genre-specific trends, emphasizing streaming partnerships for genres like Hip-Hop and investing in catalog promotion for Rock artists.\n\n![Streaming dominates in R&B/Hip-Hop and Latin genres](image4)  \n![Rock relies more on catalog sales than current hits](image8)"}

This figure contains line plots that depict how the training loss changes over time, with one curve diverging after approximately 20% of a training epoch.\n\nSimilarly, [10] mentions that training curves for the first 600k steps for both Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B are plotted in Figure 6a.

Most active querying strategies tend to suffer from **selection bias**, where they favor certain classes over others, leading to poor class coverage and reduced performance [4]. This is especially problematic in low-budget scenarios, where the number of samples selected is limited, and the risk of excluding minority classes increases significantly [2].\n\nFor instance, as illustrated in Figure 7, most existing active querying strategies such as VAAL are biased towards selecting data from dominant classes like \"femur-right\" and \"platelet,\" while largely ignoring other important classes like \"lung,\" \"liver,\" and \"monocyte.\" This kind of imbalance results in a lack of label diversity, which negatively impacts the overall generalization of the model [6]. Similarly, Figure 10 shows that even with a relatively large initial query budget, these strategies still fail to select a balanced distribution of classes, further emphasizing the problem of poor label diversity [1].\n\nLabel diversity has been shown to be an essential criterion for improving the performance of active querying strategies [7]. When label diversity is enforced, it helps reduce redundancy in majority class selections and ensures that minority classes are adequately represented [4]. This is supported by Table 7, which demonstrates that adding label diversity can improve the performance of most querying strategies, especially in low-budget regimes [3].\n\nDespite these findings, some strategies perform significantly worse than others in terms of label diversity. For example, in Figure 7, VAAL selects heavily from the \"femur-right\" and \"platelet\" classes but ignores several other important classes. In contrast, our proposed strategy not only maintains the distribution of major classes but also selects more data from minority classes like \"femur-left\" and \"basophil\" [6]. This suggests that VAAL, along with similar entropy-based methods like Margin and Entropy, suffers from severe label diversity issues.\n\nFurthermore, as seen in Figure 2 and its continuation in Figure 7, many active querying strategies—such as Entropy, Margin, and VAAL—struggle to achieve a balanced class distribution even when given larger query budgets [12]. This is consistent with the findings in Table 2, which show that these strategies often fail to sample at least one data point from each class, especially in low-budget settings [9].\n\nIn conclusion, **VAAL, Entropy, and Margin** are among the querying criteria that yield the worst label diversity generally on all the datasets. These strategies exhibit significant bias toward certain classes and fail to cover minority classes effectively, leading to suboptimal performance in both low- and high-budget scenarios [1][4][6]. \n\n![VAAL shows significant bias towards certain classes and fails to cover minority classes](image7)"}

Unlike many existing VQA datasets, which often focus on simplistic yes/no or choice-based answers, SnapNTell emphasizes detailed, entity-specific knowledge in its responses [1]. This is further supported by the fact that the answers in the SnapNTell benchmark are predominantly entity-centric, with a greater depth of knowledgeable information about the specific entity depicted in the image [4].\n\nIn terms of categorization, the SnapNTell dataset includes 22 major categories, such as landmark, painting, sculpture, food, fruit, vegetable, mammal, amphibian, insect, fish, bird, reptile, celebrity, instrument, plant, electronics, tool, transportation, sport, book, household, and car [5]. This broad range of categories ensures that the dataset captures a wide array of real-world entities, including both commonly encountered and less frequently seen ones. In comparison, datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA have fewer categories—only 3 and 12, respectively—and do not offer the same level of diversity or granularity [9].\n\nRegarding the number of unique entities, the SnapNTell dataset contains 7,568 distinct entities, far exceeding those found in other datasets.

This contrasts sharply with datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, where the exact number of images per entity is not specified [9].\n\nThe dataset also features a significantly higher average answer length compared to other datasets. While the average answer length in ViQuAE is only 1.8 words and in Encyclopedic VQA it is 3.2 words, the average answer length in SnapNTell is 25.7 words [7]. This reflects the emphasis on knowledge-intensive responses rather than simple binary answers.\n\n![SnapNTell dataset surpasses others in categories, entities, and answer length](image7)\n\nAdditionally, the SnapNTell dataset introduces anonymity in its question formulation, meaning that the questions do not directly reveal the identity of the entity being referred to.

These features make it particularly effective for evaluating models' abilities to recognize entities and generate detailed, entity-specific knowledge in their responses [10].\n\nSnapNTell is designed to address the limitations of existing VQA datasets and provides a more robust benchmark for assessing models’ performance in entity-centric knowledge-based VQA tasks."}

Positional encodings are essential in transformer-based models like DETR, as they provide spatial information that helps the model understand the layout of objects within an image [1]. In particular, experiments have shown that not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP [8], emphasizing their importance.\n\nFor instance, Table 3 highlights the results of various positional encoding configurations compared to a baseline. The table shows that when spatial positional encodings are omitted entirely, there is a notable decrease in AP. However, passing them only in the decoder leads to a minor drop, suggesting that while spatial encodings are important, their presence in the encoder may not be as crucial as previously thought [8].\n\nAdditionally, the output positional encodings are required and cannot be removed, with experiments showing that passing them once at the decoder input or adding them to queries at every decoder attention layer affects performance differently [6]. Learned embeddings are shared across all layers, and the results indicate that the choice of positional encoding type influences AP significantly.\n\nLoss components also play a role in determining AP. Ablation studies show that the set-based loss used in DETR eliminates the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is typically used to remove duplicate bounding box predictions [11]. This design choice allows the model to refine its predictions through self-attention mechanisms in the decoder, leading to improved performance over multiple decoder layers. For example, the AP improves after each layer, with a total improvement of +8.2/9.5 AP between the first and last layer [11].\n\n![Positional encoding configuration impacts AP](image3)  \n![Effect of NMS on AP across decoder layers](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, different configurations of positional encodings and loss components significantly affect the AP in the DETR-DC5 model for object detection.

The correlation between initial query performance (with 20 labeled images) and final performance (with 50 labeled images) is particularly strong for hard-to-contrast data, indicating its effectiveness in guiding the learning process from the beginning [5].\n\nIn addition to these medical imaging datasets, the hard-to-contrast strategy also performs well on natural image datasets such as CIFAR-10-LT, achieving a performance improvement of 21.2% when querying 20% of the dataset [3]. This is further illustrated in Table 1, where the \"Ours\" method—representing the hard-to-contrast strategy—achieves perfect accuracy scores at low sampling rates across several medical imaging datasets [4].\n\n![Hard-to-contrast strategy achieves high performance on multiple datasets](image4)\n\nA key advantage of the hard-to-contrast strategy is its ability to enforce label diversity without requiring ground truths, which is critical for addressing the cold start problem in active learning [8]. This is evident in Figure 5, which shows that the hard-to-contrast strategy yields better label diversity than other dominant active querying strategies on OrganAMNIST [4].\n\n![Hard-to-contrast strategy improves label diversity on OrganAMNIST](image5)\n\nMoreover, the influence of the initial query selection is significant. As noted in the text, the performance of the initial cycle (20 labeled images) and the last cycle (50 labeled images) are strongly correlated, emphasizing the importance of selecting high-quality data early in the active learning process [6]. The hard-to-contrast strategy excels in this regard, consistently outperforming other strategies in terms of both initial and subsequent cycles.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"hard-to-contrast\" strategy not only outperforms other querying strategies across various datasets but also plays a crucial role in determining the efficacy of the initial query selection, thereby influencing the overall performance of the active learning process."}

These factors can significantly affect how effectively these large language models (LLMs) perform in few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.\n\nRegarding **instruction formats**, Figure 7 (left graph) shows that different instruction formats (I0 to I5) yield varying F1 scores for ChatGPT on the 20-shot FewNERD dataset. This suggests that the way a task is framed or instructed can have a direct impact on model performance. While the specific results for each format are not detailed here, it is clear that instruction design plays a crucial role in guiding the model's understanding and output accuracy.\n\nFor **demonstration selection**, the middle graph in Figure 7 compares ChatGPT and Codex under different numbers of demonstrations. It reveals that increasing the number of demonstrations generally improves ChatGPT’s performance, indicating that more contextual examples help the model better understand the task. However, this does not always hold true for all models or tasks, as seen in other studies where performance plateaus or even declines with more demonstrations [11].\n\nIn terms of **demonstration selection strategy**, the right graph in Figure 7 evaluates three approaches: random sampling, sentence embedding-based selection, and the Efficient Prompt Retriever (EPR). The results show that EPR achieves the highest performance, followed by sentence embedding-based selection, while random sampling performs the worst. This highlights the importance of selecting high-quality, relevant examples to guide the model effectively in few-shot learning scenarios [2].\n\nComparing ChatGPT and Codex with other models, such as Fine-tuning, FSLS, UIE, and LLaMA (13B), we observe from Figure 6 that their performance across different shot settings (1-shot, 5-shot, etc.) varies. For example, on the FewNERD dataset, models like Fine-tuning and UIE tend to outperform LLMs in higher shot settings, while LLMs may show competitive performance in very low-resource conditions [4]. However, the effectiveness of ChatGPT and Codex appears to be highly dependent on the quality of the instructions and the selection of demonstrations.\n\nOverall, the study underscores that while LLMs like ChatGPT and Codex can achieve strong performance in few-shot NER tasks, their outcomes are heavily influenced by prompt engineering and demonstration selection. In contrast, models based on fine-tuned SLMs often benefit more from increased data availability and consistent training paradigms.\n\n![ChatGPT and Codex demonstrate varying performance based on instruction formats and demonstration selection on the FewNERD dataset](image7)"}

As illustrated in the histogram, 6% of claims involve only one reasoning step, while the majority (over 80%) require three or more steps, with some claims requiring up to 11 reasoning steps [4]. This depth makes the dataset significantly more challenging compared to other benchmarks such as TabFact and FEVEROUS, which have fewer reasoning steps on average [7].\n\nIn addition to the number of reasoning steps, the types of errors encountered also contribute to the difficulty of verification. For instance, grounding errors (50%), ambiguity errors (22%), and calculation errors (20%) are among the most frequent issues identified in the dataset [3]. Furthermore, refuted claims often contain incorrect approximations (33.3%) or partial correctness (10.0%), while NEI (Not Enough Information) claims typically lack sufficient evidence or domain-specific knowledge [8].\n\n![The histogram shows the distribution of reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset, highlighting that most claims require multiple reasoning steps.](image4)\n\n![The table lists common error types and their proportions, indicating that grounding errors are the most prevalent.](image3) \n\nIn conclusion, the most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset include simple lookups, comparisons, and operations like subtraction and division, while the primary challenges involve dealing with ambiguous claims, insufficient evidence, and complex reasoning paths that require both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge."}

Specifically, the majority of deep claims involve **3–5 reasoning steps**, with decreasing frequency as the number of steps increases [2].\n\nThese reasoning patterns are also reflected in the **error types** identified in the dataset. According to an error analysis, the most common errors include:\n\n- **Grounding errors** (50%), where the program incorrectly associates data with table cells.\n- **Ambiguity errors** (22%), arising from unclear expressions in the claim.\n- **Calculation errors** (20%), due to incorrect arithmetic.\n- **Program errors** (8%), such as syntax issues or missing variables [8].\n\nThese errors align with the complexity of the reasoning steps required for verification.

Additionally, **10.0%** of refuted claims are partially correct, highlighting the complexity of scientific language and reasoning [3].\n\nOn the other hand, NEI (Not Enough Information) claims are primarily attributed to insufficient evidence in the table, lack of background knowledge, and vague pronouns that introduce ambiguity into the claim.

For instance, the LLaMA 2-Chat 7B model outperforms MPT-7B-chat on 60% of prompts, while the 34B variant has an overall win rate of more than 75% against equivalently sized Vicuna-33B and Falcon 40B models [7].\n\n![LLaMA 2-Chat models outperform open-source models on single and multi-turn prompts](image7)\n\nWhen it comes to specific strengths, LLaMA 2-Chat models show significant improvements over their pretrained counterparts in terms of truthfulness and toxicity. For example, the 70B variant increases truthfulness from 50.18% to 64.14%, and reduces toxicity to nearly 0% [5]. This indicates that the fine-tuning process used for LLaMA 2-Chat is highly effective in improving safety and reliability. Additionally, LLaMA 2-Chat models are noted for their ability to handle complex tasks, such as generating poems or refusing harmful requests, showcasing their versatility and alignment with ethical guidelines [5].\n\nHowever, there are notable weaknesses. While LLaMA 2 performs well on many benchmarks, it still lags behind advanced closed-source models like GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L. Specifically, LLaMA 2 70B shows a significant gap in coding benchmarks when compared to these models [11]. Furthermore, larger variants of LLaMA 2, such as the 13B and 70B models, exhibit increased toxicity, which may be attributed to differences in pre-training data or dataset composition [6].\n\nOverall, LLaMA 2 represents a significant advancement in large language models, demonstrating competitive performance across a wide range of benchmarks and showing particular strength in areas like truthfulness, safety, and general knowledge. However, it still faces challenges in certain specialized domains, particularly those requiring high levels of coding expertise or interaction with cutting-edge closed-source models."}

From the experimental results presented in the text and images, we can observe how these metrics behave as the number of removed knowledge elements increases.\n\nIn Figure 5, which is described in [7], the line graph titled \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence\" illustrates this relationship. As more knowledge elements are removed, **precision** (blue line with circle markers) increases significantly, starting at around 14 and reaching about 26. This suggests that when fewer relevant knowledge elements are available, models tend to be more conservative in citing knowledge, resulting in higher precision. However, **recall** (orange line with diamond markers) remains relatively stable, hovering around 14 to 15, indicating that the model's ability to retrieve all necessary knowledge is not severely impacted by the removal of a few elements. The **F1-Score**, which balances precision and recall, shows a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18, reflecting an overall improvement in performance despite the reduced recall.\n\nTable 7 from [5] further supports these findings. When comparing general and specific questions, the same model performs better on specific questions across most metrics. Specific questions provide clearer instructions, enabling models to target the required knowledge more effectively, which improves their citation quality. This implies that when the question context explicitly mentions the knowledge needed, models are better able to handle the task even when some knowledge is absent.\n\nAdditionally, Table 5 from [9] highlights the impact of removing required knowledge from the provided knowledge graph. While correctness remains largely unaffected, both **precision** and **recall** drop drastically, showing that the coverage issue poses a significant challenge for generating high-quality citations. This underscores the importance of retrieval accuracy in ensuring that models have access to sufficient and accurate knowledge to generate reliable answers.\n\nIn the \"Retrieval Analysis\" graph (image7), the downward trend in **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-Score** as retrieval accuracy decreases further emphasizes the critical role of retrieval accuracy. Correctness remains the highest across all levels of retrieval accuracy, but it is less affected compared to the other metrics, suggesting that models can still produce factually correct outputs even when retrieval is imperfect.\n\n![The image shows the relationship between the number of knowledge elements removed and three metrics: precision, recall, and F1-Score](image1)\n\n![The table compares the performance of different models under different settings, including General and Specific, with metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score](image4)\n\n![The line graph titled \"Retrieval Analysis\" shows the evaluation of generated texts using knowledge graphs, with metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score decreasing as retrieval accuracy decreases](image7)\n\nThese changes imply that while models can identify and handle absent knowledge to some extent—especially when retrieval accuracy is reasonably high—their ability to generate comprehensive and accurate citations is heavily dependent on the availability of complete and relevant knowledge. The \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting becomes increasingly important when knowledge coverage is limited, as it enables models to recognize gaps in the knowledge repository and adjust their outputs accordingly."}

From the text and image evidence, we can observe several key trends and insights.\n\nFirst, incorporating logical constraints into prompts consistently improves model performance. As noted in [1], adding logical constraints provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. This is further supported by [8], which states that adding relevant logic leads to significant improvements on both MAVEN-ERE and Proof Writer tasks. However, irrelevant logic introduces fluctuations, highlighting the importance of selecting relevant constraints.\n\nIn Figure 6 (left graph), the performance (Micro-F1) of models with logical constraints outperforms those without them across all numbers of demonstration samples. For example, on MAVEN-ERE, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints yields a Micro-F1 score of $25.7\\%$, surpassing the score of $24.5\\%$ for 10 demonstrations without logical constraints. This demonstrates that logical constraints can enhance performance even with fewer demonstration samples [1].\n\nMoreover, as seen in Figure 6 (right graph), iterative retrieval of logical constraints gradually reduces logical inconsistency over multiple iterations, although the overall micro-F1 remains relatively stable. This suggests that while logical constraints improve consistency, their impact on accuracy may plateau after a certain point due to potential overthinking or redundancy in reasoning [5].\n\nThe effectiveness of logical constraints is also evident in Table 3 [3], where models trained on LLM-LR (a dataset involving multi-hop logical reasoning) show substantial improvements compared to baselines without logical constraints. Specifically, LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B achieve better results when logical constraints are incorporated, with some models even surpassing larger LLMs like ChatGPT [3].\n\nAdditionally, Figure 2 [8] illustrates the relationship between logical consistency and model performance. A higher level of logical inconsistency correlates with poorer micro-F1 scores, but correcting logical inconsistency does not always lead to proportional improvements in micro-F1. This indicates that while logical consistency is important, it is not the sole factor influencing performance.\n\nFinally, the generative, retrieval-based, and pre-training approaches to embedding logical constraints into LLMs are illustrated in image2. These methods refine outputs to better align with logical constraints, improving the accuracy of relation detection between events.\n\n![Performance comparison of models with and without logical constraints](image1)\n\n![Impact of logical constraints on reasoning accuracy and consistency](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the use of logical constraints enhances model performance on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, particularly when combined with an appropriate number of demonstration samples. Logical constraints help reduce inconsistencies and improve accuracy, though their effectiveness depends on relevance and proper integration into the prompting strategy."}

Let's break this down with evidence from both text and images.\n\nFirstly, the use of **logical constraints** is shown to significantly reduce logical inconsistency in LLM outputs. As stated in [1], \"our post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts (resulting in LI of 0%), but it may severely affect the quality of the whole generation.\" This highlights that while post-processing ensures no logical conflicts, it might not always yield high-quality answers due to potential semantic deviations or limitations in candidate set size.\n\nIn contrast, incorporating **logical constraints directly into the model instructions** appears to be more effective for maintaining both logical consistency and answer quality. For example, [6] states: \"Adding logical constraints into LLM instructions can provide stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations.\" Additionally, it notes that using a smaller number of demonstrations with logical constraints can outperform a larger number of demonstrations without them, such as on MAVEN-ERE where 5 demonstrations with logical constraints achieved a 25.7% score compared to 24.5% with 10 demonstrations without constraints.\n\nImage1 provides empirical support for these findings by comparing the performance of various models under three conditions: all logical constraints, retrieved logical constraints, and post-processing. The results show that models like GPT-4 and Vicuna achieve lower logical inconsistency (LI) when logical constraints are applied, indicating their effectiveness in reducing logical errors. However, post-processing also achieves 0% LI in some cases, suggesting that while it reduces inconsistency, it may not improve overall performance metrics like Micro-F1 as effectively as logical constraints.\n\nSimilarly, Image3 illustrates the evaluation of models on three tasks—MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank, and ProofWriter—with varying configurations including vanilla ICL, CoT, and CoT with logical constraints. It shows that adding logical constraints improves scores on all tasks, particularly in reducing LI and improving Micro-F1, further supporting the claim that logical constraints enhance both consistency and performance.\n\nFinally, Image7 presents specific performance metrics for Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT under different configurations. On MAVEN-ERE, the best Micro-F1 (26.4%) is achieved with CoT and logical constraints, while the lowest LI (0%) comes from post-processing. On Causal-TimeBank, the highest Micro-F1 (13.3%) is achieved with logical constraints, again showing the superiority of logical constraints over post-processing in improving both performance and consistency.\n\nIn conclusion, logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency and enhancing performance across LLM models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

This distribution reflects the benchmark's intent to challenge models with varying degrees of complexity, from straightforward tasks to those requiring expert-level reasoning.\n\nThis difficulty distribution is closely tied to the disciplines covered in the dataset. For example, the Science discipline, which constitutes 23% of the total dataset, includes subjects like Biology, Chemistry, Geography, Math, and Physics [2]. These subjects often require more complex reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, which aligns with the higher proportion of \"Hard\" questions in this category.

These images are not only varied in type but also strategically placed within the questions—some at the beginning, some in the middle, and others at the end. This diversity in image placement challenges models to integrate visual information effectively, depending on where it appears in the question. Additionally, the presence of multiple image types, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, and medical scans, ensures that models must be adept at interpreting a wide range of visual data [image5].\n\nThis relationship between question distribution and format is further highlighted by the performance differences observed across disciplines. For instance, models tend to perform better in disciplines like Art & Design and Humanities & Social Sciences, where the visual data is less complex and requires relatively less reasoning [10].

Specifically, $55.2\\%$ of Chameleon’s responses were considered to completely fulfill the task, while Gemini+ and GPT-4V+ achieved $37.6\\%$ and $44.7\\%$, respectively. When comparing the original responses from Gemini and GPT-4V without image augmentation, the percentages of fully fulfilled tasks were even lower: $17.6\\%$ for Gemini and $23.1\\%$ for GPT-4V. This suggests that Chameleon not only performs better in fulfilling tasks but also aligns more closely with human expectations of task completion.\n\nRegarding inter-annotator agreement, Table 4 provides detailed statistics on the level of consensus among annotators when evaluating responses from different models against Chameleon.

The inter-annotator agreement is a critical metric in these assessments, as it reflects the consistency of judgments across different evaluators.\n\nFor **absolute evaluations**, the output of each model is judged separately by three different annotators, who evaluate the relevance and quality of the responses. A key question in this evaluation is whether the response fulfills the task described in the prompt [3]. To understand the level of agreement among annotators, Figure 10 provides insights into how consistently they rated various aspects of the model outputs, such as language quality, image relevance, and task fulfillment [8]. Across most categories, there was a high level of agreement, with \"All\" (indicating full agreement among all three annotators) being the most common category, followed by \"Two\" (indicating agreement between two annotators), and finally \"None\" (no agreement) [6].\n\nFor **relative evaluations**, the focus shifts to comparing Chameleon directly with other models like Gemini+ and GPT-4V+. In this case, the responses from both models are presented to annotators in random order, and they are asked which response they prefer or if they believe the responses are about the same [9]. This method helps determine how Chameleon performs compared to its competitors in terms of perceived quality and relevance. For example, when comparing Chameleon with Gemini+, the results show that Chameleon's responses were better in 41.5% of cases, tied in 34.5%, and considered inferior in 24.0% [10]. Similarly, against GPT-4V+, Chameleon had a win rate of 35.8%, with 31.6% ties and 32.6% losses [10]. These results are visualized in Table 4, which outlines the number of instances where all three annotators agreed, two agreed, or there was no agreement [6].\n\n![Inter-annotator agreement levels for different evaluation categories](image6)\n\nOverall, while there is a notable level of agreement among annotators, there are still cases where their judgments differ, especially in subjective areas such as task fulfillment and interpretation of prompts [12]. This variability underscores the challenges inherent in evaluating AI-generated content through human judgment, particularly in mixed-modal tasks where both text and images are involved [11].\n\nIn conclusion, Chameleon demonstrates competitive performance in both absolute and relative evaluations, with strong inter-annotator agreement across several key metrics, although some differences in judgment remain, reflecting the complexity of assessing AI model outputs."}

These results highlight the effectiveness of RAR's retrieval and ranking mechanism in handling fine-grained categories, where subtle differences between classes are crucial for accurate classification.\n\nIn **zero-shot object recognition**, the RAR model also shows significant improvements over the CLIP baseline. On the V3Det dataset, which contains a challenging array of 13,204 distinct classes, RAR achieves an improvement of 1.5 percentage points in overall average precision (AP_all) when using InternLM-XC2 [1].

Initially, the system applies **pre-processing techniques** such as **cropping and blurring**, which are specifically tailored for object detection datasets [5]. Cropping is performed based on proposal bounding box coordinates, and the cropped regions are resized to a fixed proportion. This ensures that the focus is on relevant parts of the image, especially since objects in detection datasets are often smaller and more variably positioned compared to classification tasks.\n\nTo enhance the MLLMs’ ability to identify these objects, **blurring** is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This technique helps direct the attention of the MLLMs toward the relevant regions, improving their performance in identifying the target objects [5].\n\nAfter pre-processing, the system constructs a **multimodal retriever** that creates and stores **multimodal embeddings** for both images and text descriptions [1]. These embeddings are indexed for efficient retrieval. During inference, the system encodes the input image into an embedding and uses the **k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm to retrieve the top-k similar results from the memory bank [6]. The retrieved category labels are then passed to the **MLLMs**, which use their internal knowledge and semantic understanding to **rank** the retrieved results [7].\n\nThis ranking process allows the MLLMs to refine the initial retrieval results, ensuring that the final prediction is not only semantically appropriate but also contextually accurate [4]. For instance, in zero-shot object recognition, this method has been shown to improve accuracy by leveraging reranking capabilities [image2].\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system enhances object recognition in detection datasets by combining **image preprocessing**, **efficient retrieval of relevant information**, and **ranking using MLLMs** to produce accurate and context-aware predictions.\n\n![RAR pipeline for detection datasets](image6)"}

Additionally, it fixes 21.6% of the errors coming from RAG, with the percentage of errors introduced to RAG being relatively low at 6.3% [10].

These figures indicate that while Step-Back + RAG still improves performance on StrategyQA, its impact is less pronounced compared to TimeQA. This may be due to differences in the nature of the tasks: TimeQA involves more factual and time-related queries, whereas StrategyQA likely involves more complex reasoning or multi-step problem-solving.\n\nThese differences highlight the importance of task-specific adjustments when applying Step-Back + RAG. For example, the effectiveness of Step-Back + RAG in fixing baseline errors appears to be higher in TimeQA, possibly because abstraction helps reduce ambiguity in factual queries.

For example, on the English CoNLL 2003 dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC achieves an F1 score of 93.33, which is a +0.29 improvement over BERT-MRC [1]. Similarly, on the Chinese MSRA dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC shows the highest F1-scores compared to other variants [image2]. This suggests that DSC is particularly effective for NER, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets where certain classes (like background tokens) dominate [8].\n\nIn **Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC)** tasks, such as SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0, as well as QuoRef, the proposed DSC loss also leads to significant improvements. On SQuADv1.1, BERT+DSC surpasses XLNet by +1.25 in F1 and +0.84 in EM [image6]. Additionally, on QuoRef, the DSC-enhanced model outperforms XLNet by +1.46 in EM and +1.41 in F1 [image5]. These results indicate that DSC enhances the ability of models to identify relevant spans in text, even when negative examples outnumber positive ones.\n\nFor **Sentiment Classification** tasks, such as those evaluated on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), the story differs slightly. While BERT+CE (cross-entropy) achieves the highest accuracy on both SST-2 and SST-5, the DSC and DL losses perform slightly worse in terms of accuracy. Specifically, on SST-5, BERT+CE achieves 55.57 in accuracy, while BERT+DL and BERT+DSC achieve 54.63 and 55.19, respectively [image3]. This indicates that DSC and DL are not accuracy-oriented and should be avoided for tasks where accuracy is the primary metric of interest [5].\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of these enhancements can vary depending on the dataset's imbalance level. For instance, DSC performs better on more imbalanced datasets, such as the +negative dataset, where it significantly outperforms DL [6]. This aligns with the expectation that DSC is more suitable for handling class imbalance than traditional losses like CE or DL [1].\n\nFinally, the impact of hyperparameters like $\\alpha$ in the Tversky index (TI) further highlights how these enhancements can be tuned for specific tasks. For example, on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 dataset, the best F1 score of 84.67 is achieved when $\\alpha = 0.6$, while on the English QuoRef dataset, the optimal $\\alpha$ value is 0.4 [image7]. This variability underscores the importance of fine-tuning parameters for different datasets and tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, the enhancements FL, DL, and DSC affect the performance of BERT and XLNet differently across tasks and datasets.

For example, on the QQP dataset, BERT+DSC achieves an F1 score of 91.8, which is a significant improvement over the baseline BERT (91.3) and XLNet (91.8) models. The results are further supported by image1, which shows that DSC consistently outperforms other loss variations like FL and DL, achieving the highest F1 scores on both MRPC and QQP datasets [5].\n\nIn the context of **named entity recognition (NER)**, the BERT-MRC model demonstrates substantial improvements when augmented with DSC.

Similarly, on the **QuoRef** dataset, XLNet+DSC improves the F1 score by +1.41 over the base XLNet model. Image8 provides a detailed comparison of these results, showing that while XLNet generally outperforms BERT, the DSC enhancement brings about the most significant improvements in both models' F1 scores across all three question-answering datasets [2].\n\nMoreover, the impact of the **Tversky index (TI)** on model performance is evident in how the parameter $\\alpha$ influences the trade-off between false negatives and false positives.

Specifically, when **positive examples** are added to the training set, the model's performance improves compared to the original dataset, as seen in Table 8 [1]. However, adding **negative examples** leads to a more imbalanced dataset, which negatively affects performance. This is because an overabundance of negative examples—especially easy-negative ones—can dominate the training process, making it harder for the model to distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones [3]. This issue is further exacerbated by the cross-entropy objective (CE), which is commonly used but does not address these challenges effectively [7].\n\nOn the other hand, the **dice loss (DL)** and its variants, such as **dynamic soft dice (DSC)**, have been proposed to better handle class imbalance issues. In sentiment classification tasks like those on the **SST-2 and SST-5 datasets**, BERT with CE achieves higher accuracy than BERT with DL or DSC [6]. This indicates that DL and DSC are not suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks.

These evaluations demonstrate that CodeBERT outperforms other models such as RoBERTa and models pre-trained only on code.\n\nFor **programming language (PL) probing**, where the task involves understanding and predicting PL-related elements, CodeBERT (MLM) consistently performs better than its competitors. For example, in tasks with two choices, CodeBERT (MLM) achieves a score of 86.84% for Ruby, 86.40% for JavaScript, 90.79% for Go, 82.20% for Python, 90.46% for Java, and 88.21% for PHP, resulting in an overall score of 85.66%.

While specific numerical results are not provided in the text quotes, the image [image7] highlights that CodeBERT outperforms other models in this domain as well.\n\nIt is also important to note that CodeBERT’s performance is further validated in scenarios with limited preceding context. In these cases, while its performance slightly decreases compared to when full context is available, it still surpasses RoBERTa and the code-only pre-trained model [7].\n\nIn summary, CodeBERT demonstrates superior performance over other models in both programming and natural language probing tasks across various programming languages. ![CodeBERT performs better than RoBERTa and code-only pre-trained models in both PL and NL probing tasks](image7)."}

This imbalance can affect how well different classifiers detect sentiments like Negative, especially since metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score behave differently under such conditions.\n\nThe text also highlights that all classification algorithms performed poorly on the code-mixed dataset [4], but logistic regression, random forest, and decision trees fared comparatively better across all sentiment classes. However, specific results for the Negative class are not directly provided in the text quotes. To analyze this further, we can refer to the image quotes, which provide detailed performance metrics for various classifiers, including their scores for the Negative sentiment category.\n\nFor instance, image3 and image5 describe tables that present performance metrics for classifiers like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, 1DConv-LSTM, DME, CDME, and BERT Multilingual. These tables include performance scores for each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed, Other language) along with aggregate metrics like Micro Average, Macro Average, and Weighted Average. Based on these tables, one can compare the scores for the Negative sentiment category across classifiers to determine which one consistently performs better.\n\n![Performance metrics for classifiers on Negative sentiment](image3)\n\nFrom the table described in image3, it appears that certain classifiers may have higher scores for the Negative sentiment category compared to others. For example, if a classifier shows a high score in the Negative column, it indicates better detection of Negative sentiment. The exact values would need to be examined from the actual table, but based on the general findings in the text, logistic regression, random forest, and decision trees were noted to perform relatively better overall [4].\n\nIn conclusion, while the text does not provide explicit results for the Negative sentiment category, the images suggest that performance metrics for each classifier are available, allowing for a comparative analysis.

Their performance is evaluated using two key metrics: **joint accuracy** and **slot-level accuracy**, which measure the overall correctness of predicted dialog states and the accuracy per slot type, respectively.\n\nIn terms of **joint accuracy**, DS-DST achieves a score of **51.21%** on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset [6], while DS-Picklist performs better with a joint accuracy of **53.30%** [6]. This indicates that DS-Picklist slightly outperforms DS-DST in capturing the complete dialog state across all slots simultaneously. However, it is important to note that DS-Picklist relies on access to a full ontology (a comprehensive list of candidate values), which may not be feasible in real-world applications where such resources are unavailable [6].\n\nWhen analyzing **slot-level accuracy**, the performance varies significantly depending on the type of slot. For example, in Table 4, DS-DST shows substantial improvements over DS-Span for certain slots like *hotel-type*, *attraction-type*, *attraction-name*, *hotel-internet*, and *hotel-parking* [3]. These slots typically have values that cannot be directly extracted from the dialogue context and benefit from being treated as categorical slots, where values are selected from predefined lists [3]. In contrast, time-related slots such as *taxi-leave at* and *train-arrive by* are handled as non-categorical slots in DS-DST, but they still pose challenges due to the lack of explicit span matching in the dialogue context [7].\n\nDS-Picklist, which assumes a full ontology is available and treats all domain-slot pairs as categorical, further improves upon DS-DST in some cases. For instance, when the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist can reduce error rates more effectively because predicted values are drawn from the candidate-value lists [7]. However, this advantage is contingent on having access to the full ontology, which may not always be practical.\n\nOverall, while DS-DST demonstrates robust performance across different settings, including noisy (MultiWOZ 2.0) and cleaner (MultiWOZ 2.1) datasets [2], DS-Picklist achieves higher joint accuracy when the ontology is available [6]. The choice between these models depends on the availability of ontological information and the specific requirements of the application scenario.\n\n![DS-DST model architecture](image1)  \n![Accuracy comparison across models](image2)"}

This is because these slots often involve values that cannot be directly extracted from dialog contexts using span-based methods, but can be effectively predicted from candidate-value lists. \n\n![DS-DST and DS-Picklist slot-level accuracy comparison](image2)\n\nIn contrast, DS-Picklist further improves upon DS-DST by leveraging access to the full ontology, allowing it to select values from predefined candidate lists. As a result, DS-Picklist achieves slightly higher average accuracy than DS-DST, with an overall average of 97.40% compared to DS-DST’s 97.35% [12]. However, the improvements are relatively small, suggesting that while DS-Picklist performs better in general, the gains are not substantial for all slots.\n\nFor specific slots, DS-Picklist demonstrates a clear advantage when the ontology is accessible, especially for categorical slots where values are limited and well-defined. For example, slots like `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by`, which are time-related and typically handled as span-based slots, benefit more from DS-Picklist due to its ability to draw from candidate-value lists. In contrast, DS-DST struggles with these types of slots because they do not lend themselves well to span extraction.\n\n![Example of dialogue state tracking in action](image3)\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs better than DS-DST on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, particularly when the full ontology is available. However, the difference between the two models is relatively modest, and both models significantly outperform DS-Span. The slight edge of DS-Picklist comes primarily from its ability to leverage candidate-value lists, which is most effective for categorical slots."}

For **categorical slots**, such as `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, and `hotel-parking`, DS-Picklist performs exceptionally well due to its ability to select values from a predefined candidate-value list. This approach allows it to predict missing values more accurately than span-based methods like DS-Span, which struggle with these types of slots [3].

For example, on the **Snopes dataset**, the **DeClarE (Full)** configuration achieves a **Macro F1-score of 0.79** and an **AUC of 0.86**, outperforming other models [11]. Similarly, on the **PolitiFact dataset**, DeClarE (Full) achieves a **Macro F1-score of 0.57** and an **AUC of 0.86**, showing a **7.9% improvement in AUC** compared to other baselines [8]. These results highlight the effectiveness of the attention mechanism and source embeddings in improving classification performance.\n\nIn contrast, the **NewsTrust dataset** is focused on **credibility regression**, where the goal is to predict a credibility score on a scale from 1 to 5.

It consists of 6,000 sequences with an average of 4.7 instructions per sequence [2]. In contrast, **CHAI** involves a more complex 3D house environment (CHALET) with 1,596 sequences containing 7.7 instructions on average. The instructions in CHAI often require multiple intermediate goals, such as opening a cupboard, picking up items, and moving them to a specific location [2]. This highlights that **CHAI instructions are more complex**, involving manipulation tasks like moving objects and opening containers, whereas **LANI instructions typically involve a single goal**.\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, for **LANI**, the primary evaluation metrics are **stop distance (SD)** and **task completion (TC)**, while for **CHAI**, they are **stop distance (SD)** and **manipulation accuracy (MA)** [11]. These metrics reflect the different nature of the tasks: **navigation accuracy** for LANI and **manipulation success** for CHAI.\n\nFrom the experimental results, **our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods** on both datasets. On **LANI**, our method achieves a stop distance (SD) of 8.43 and a task completion (TC) of 36.9, which are better than other methods like STOP, RANDOMWALK, MOSTFREQUENT, MISRA17, and CHAPLOT18 [3]. On **CHAI**, our approach improves the stop distance (SD) to 3.34 and achieves a manipulation accuracy (MA) of 39.97, although it still faces challenges in fully mastering the manipulation tasks [3].\n\n![Comparative performance of methods on LANI and CHAI](image3)\n\nThe data also shows that **human performance on these tasks is imperfect**, with a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and a task completion rate of 63% on LANI, and a much lower SD of 1.34 and perfect manipulation accuracy on CHAI [10]. This indicates that **CHAI has simpler manipulation tasks** compared to the more complex navigation tasks in LANI, but **both remain challenging for automated systems**.\n\nFurthermore, linguistic features differ between the two datasets. For example, **spatial relations, conjunctions, and co-reference** appear more frequently in **LANI**, while **temporal coordination** is more prominent in **CHAI** [5]. This reflects the differing cognitive demands placed on the agent in each environment.\n\nFinally, the use of **oracle goals** significantly improves navigation performance on both tasks, especially in CHAI, where the model struggles with manipulation behavior [3]. This suggests that **planning complexity** is a major challenge in CHAI, particularly due to the need for precise object manipulation.\n\nIn conclusion, **CHAI presents more complex manipulation challenges** and requires **more sophisticated planning**, while **LANI focuses on navigation accuracy** with relatively simpler goal structures. Both tasks demonstrate the **difficulty of achieving human-level performance** in instruction following, despite improvements from advanced models."}

The corpus contains 6,000 sequences with an average of 4.7 instructions per sequence [3]. On the other hand, C HAI  is a more complex task involving a 3D house environment (C HALET ), where instructions combine navigation with manipulation actions such as moving objects and opening containers. The C HAI  corpus includes 1,596 sequences with an average of 7.7 instructions per sequence [3]. This increased complexity means that C HAI  instructions often require multiple intermediate goals, such as opening a cupboard, picking up items, and closing the cupboard, which necessitates planning and action generation across several steps [3].\n\nFrom an **evaluation standpoint**, both tasks use stop distance (SD) as a metric for navigation accuracy.

For instance, categories such as \"trajectory constraints\" or \"co-reference\" may introduce additional complexity that affects the accuracy of goal prediction.\n\nMoreover, Table 8 [8] provides insight into how goal prediction is evaluated using real distance metrics and percentages of correct predictions. The results indicate that goal prediction accuracy depends on the clarity and specificity of the instruction, which is closely tied to the linguistic categories involved.

Similarly, for relation extraction, SciIE scores 39.5 compared to 37.9 for the single-task approach [2]. In coreference resolution, SciIE performs with an F1 score of 58.0, surpassing the single-task model’s 55.3 [2].\n\nThis improvement can be attributed to the unified multi-task learning framework, where shared span representations allow information from one task (e.g., coreference resolution) to benefit others (e.g., entity recognition). As stated in the text, \"By sharing span representations, sentence-level tasks can benefit from information propagated from coreference resolution across sentences, without increasing the complexity of inference\" [7].\n\nMoreover, the inclusion of coreference links has a notable impact on precision and recall. Image 4 illustrates this through precision versus pseudo-recall curves, showing that the system with coreference achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.751, compared to 0.695 without coreference [image4]. This indicates that coreference inclusion significantly improves recall while maintaining high precision, as both systems achieve over 84% precision.\n\nIn summary, the SciIE multitask system outperforms single-task models in all three tasks, and the integration of coreference resolution enhances both precision and recall, leading to more accurate and comprehensive results."}

According to Table 5, BERT_BASE and BERT_LARGE significantly outperform earlier models like OpenAI GPT and even the CNN Base model in most tasks [5]. For instance, BERT_LARGE achieves the highest scores across several key tasks such as CoLA, QNLI, and RTE, demonstrating its superiority in capturing complex language patterns [5]. In contrast, the CNN Base model performs slightly better than OpenAI GPT but lags behind BERT models, particularly on tasks like RTE and QNLI [5].\n\nMoreover, while the CNN Large model generally performs better than the CNN Base, it still does not match the performance of BERT_LARGE [5]. This suggests that BERT's architecture, which is based on a bidirectional transformer, provides more comprehensive context modeling compared to the CNN-based models, which are unidirectional and may miss some nuances in language structure.\n\nAnother critical insight comes from Table 3, which shows that the CNN base model performs as well as STILTs in aggregate, but on specific tasks involving sentence pairs (like MRPC and RTE), STILTs and BERT perform much better [3]. This indicates that BERT and similar models with bidirectional context modeling are particularly effective for tasks requiring understanding of relationships between sentences.\n\nAdditionally, Figure 3 illustrates that increasing the amount of pretraining data leads to improved performance on the GLUE benchmark, with a positive correlation between training data size and GLUE score [9].

The results suggest that increasing the amount of training data leads to higher performance on the GLUE benchmark. \n\nAdditionally, [9] states that \"pre-training continues to improve performance up to 18B tokens and would likely continue to improve with more data,\" reinforcing the idea that larger training datasets contribute positively to model performance.\n\nThe impact of training data size is further illustrated in image8, which depicts a line graph showing the relationship between the amount of Common Crawl data (in tokens) and the average GLUE score. As the number of training tokens increases, the average GLUE score also rises, indicating a clear positive correlation between training data volume and performance on the GLUE benchmark. \n\nHowever, the effectiveness of training data also depends on its source and structure.

From the text and image quotes, we can gather that this impact varies depending on the specific language pair and the training setup.\n\nIn Table 5 [2], it is noted that aligning word embeddings helps to increase BLEU scores for all three tasks. This suggests that when the source languages share a common embedding space, the model can more effectively learn correspondences between the source and target languages, which likely contributes to improved performance. This is particularly relevant in multi-lingual scenarios where the encoder must manage multiple languages simultaneously.\n\nHowever, Table 4 [7] presents a contrasting observation: the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses being essentially insignificant across all languages. This indicates that while alignment may be helpful in some cases, it is not universally advantageous. The results suggest that the necessity of embedding alignment might depend on the specific characteristics of the language pairs involved.\n\nThis variability is further supported by the analysis in Table 3 [5], where BLEU score improvements are more pronounced for languages that are linguistically distant, such as RU and HE, compared to their more similar counterparts like FR and IT. This implies that the effectiveness of pre-training and alignment may depend on the degree of similarity between the source and target languages.\n\n![The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs, showing how alignment impacts BLEU scores](image2)\n\nAdditionally, Figure 6 [6] illustrates the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translations from Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En). It highlights that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes, suggesting that alignment may be more impactful in low-resource settings.\n\nIn summary, while aligning word embeddings can enhance BLEU scores in certain contexts—especially when the source languages are linguistically similar or when training data is limited—it is not universally beneficial.

This suggests that pre-training is particularly beneficial when there is a larger \"headroom\" for improvement, which is often the case with languages that have lower baseline performance [1]. Additionally, the results from Table 5 further support this, showing that pre-trained embeddings yield the highest gains for the most similar language pair (GL/PT), while showing minimal or even negative effects for less similar pairs like BE/RU [11].\n\nThe role of training set size is also crucial. As shown in image2, pre-training leads to greater improvements in BLEU scores when the training data is limited. For example, with smaller training sets, the gap between standard and pre-trained models widens, indicating that pre-training compensates for the lack of data. However, as the training set increases, the benefit of pre-training diminishes, suggesting that it is most effective in low-resource scenarios [4]. This aligns with findings from Table 2, where pre-training of source language embeddings led to more significant improvements in BLEU scores compared to other methods [8].\n\nLanguage similarity plays a key role in determining the effectiveness of pre-training. The hypothesis that more similar languages will benefit more from pre-training is supported by the data in Table 5, where GL/PT, being the most similar pair, showed the largest gains in BLEU scores after pre-training [11]. Moreover, the analysis in Table 6 highlights how pre-trained embeddings help in capturing rare vocabulary and generating grammatically correct sentences, especially in low-resource settings [6].\n\nFinally, the F-measure analysis in image4 shows that pre-training improves the accuracy of translating low-frequency words more than high-frequency ones, reinforcing the idea that pre-training helps bridge gaps in data scarcity [7].\n\n![Pre-training improves BLEU scores for language pairs with lower baseline performance](image1)  \n![Pre-training has a greater impact on BLEU scores when training data is limited](image2)  \n![Pre-training enhances the translation of low-frequency words](image4)"}

This suggests that embedding alignment may be more beneficial for similar language pairs. However, in Table 4, it was somewhat surprisingly found that the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses being essentially insignificant across all languages [6]. This indicates that while alignment can help in some cases, it is not universally advantageous.\n\nAdditionally, Figure 2 provides insight into how pre-training affects the F-measure of target words based on their frequency in the training corpus. The chart reveals that both \"std\" (standard) and \"pre\" (pre-trained) F-measures increase with word frequency, but \"pre\" often outperforms \"std\" in higher frequency ranges [10]. This implies that pre-trained embeddings are particularly effective in improving the translation accuracy of less frequent words, which is crucial for low-resource scenarios.\n\n![Pre-training improves F-measure for low-frequency words](image6)\n\nIn summary, while the alignment of word embeddings does not consistently improve performance across all language pairs, pre-training has a measurable impact on enhancing the translation of low-frequency words, as shown in the frequency-based F-measure comparison."}

For example, \"GloVe w/o R-GCN\" yields only 51.2% accuracy on the unmasked condition and 11.6% on the masked condition, compared to \"GloVe with R-GCN,\" which achieves 59.2% and 11.1%, respectively.

The configuration labeled \"No relation types\" shows a drop in performance compared to the full model, indicating that incorporating different types of relations is essential for effective modeling [6]. Furthermore, the study also examines the effect of removing specific relation types: **MATCH**, **COREF**, and **COMPLEMENT**. The results show that removing these relations leads to varying degrees of performance degradation. For instance, removing **MATCH** results in 64.3% accuracy on the unmasked condition and 67.4% on the masked condition, whereas removing **COREF** results in 64.8% on the unmasked condition but no data for the masked condition [7].\n\n![Model performance comparison without specific components](image4)\n\nFinally, the ablation of **DOC-BASED** connections reveals that they are more critical than **MATCH** or **COREF** connections.

For instance, when comparing the Entity-GCN model with and without coreference, the model with coreference achieved an accuracy of 66.4 on the unmasked test set, while the model without coreference achieved 67.6 [8]. This suggests that coreference links may not be as beneficial in the unmasked setting, possibly because the model already has access to surface-level mentions and can rely on exact matching rather than inferred relationships.\n\nIn contrast, in the **masked setting**, where mentions are replaced by tokens like \"MASK1\" and exact matching is no longer possible, the use of coreference becomes more critical. The model with coreference achieves a higher accuracy of 70.5 on the masked development set compared to 71.6 for the model without coreference [8]. This indicates that coreference helps the model recover relationships between entities when direct textual references are obscured by masking.\n\nAdditionally, the results from Table 3 show that removing coreference (No COREF) leads to a slight improvement in performance in the unmasked setting but a notable drop in the masked setting [6].

This is supported by the observation that coreference propagation is mainly helpful for entities, although it may slightly hurt relation extraction in some cases [11]. In contrast, relation propagation significantly enhances both entity and relation extraction tasks, particularly in datasets where sentences contain multiple relations across different entities, such as ACE05 and SciERC [11].\n\nTo illustrate the impact of these propagation mechanisms, we can look at the results from Table 2 [4].

This aligns with the hypothesis that relation propagation helps address the challenges posed by overlapping entities and complex sentence structures [8].\n\nIn summary, DyGIE’s performance on entity and relation extraction varies across datasets and configurations, with CorefProp mainly enhancing entity extraction and RelProp benefiting both tasks, especially in complex contexts. The inclusion of these components allows DyGIE to achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of information extraction tasks [10].\n\n![DyGIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets](image3)\n![Relation propagation significantly improves performance in complex sentences](image2)"}

This is evident from the analysis of various datasets and their respective evaluations. For instance, in the ACE05 dataset, where coreference annotations are not available, the CorefProp layer does not contribute much to the entity extraction performance, as pronouns are uniformly labeled with a \"Generic\" label [8]. In contrast, for datasets like ACE2004 and GENIA, where coreference annotations are available, the inclusion of the coreference propagation layer enhances the model's ability to disambiguate entity mentions, particularly for pronominal references, which often require reasoning across sentence boundaries [3].\n\nThis effect is further supported by experimental results. For example, in Table 4, DyGIE achieves significant improvements in overlapping entity extraction on ACE04-O and ACE05-O, with an increase of 11.6% and 11.3%, respectively, over the state-of-the-art methods [9]. These improvements are likely attributed to the effective use of coreference propagation when annotations are available.\n\nMoreover, Figure 3a illustrates that the coreference layer achieves the best performance on the second iteration (N=2) in the entity extraction task, highlighting the value of iterative coreference propagation when coreference annotations are present [6]. On the other hand, in datasets such as SciERC, where coreference annotations are not utilized effectively due to uniform labeling, the impact of coreference propagation on entity extraction is minimal [8].\n\nIn summary, the availability of coreference annotations in datasets directly affects the performance of DyGIE in entity recognition tasks. When these annotations are present, the model benefits from enhanced context-awareness through coreference propagation, leading to better disambiguation and overall performance. ![DyGIE achieves higher F1 scores for entity recognition when coreference annotations are available](image5)"}

Similarly, RelProp achieves its best results on the second iteration ($M=2$) for relation extraction, as depicted by the red line in the right graph of image1, where the peak F1 score occurs at two iterations [6].\n\nThis suggests that both propagation processes benefit from a moderate level of iterative refinement, but not excessive iterations, which may lead to overfitting or diminishing returns.\n\nIn contrast, the impact of the number of entities in a sentence on relation F1 scores is shown in image5, which compares the performance of DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp across different entity counts. The graph reveals that as the number of entities increases, the F1 scores for relation extraction decrease, regardless of the model used. However, DyGIE consistently outperforms DyGIE-RelProp, even with more entities in the sentence. This indicates that while the number of entities negatively affects relation extraction performance, the inclusion of relation propagation (as in DyGIE) helps mitigate this decline compared to models without it [5].\n\nIn summary, both CorefProp and RelProp benefit from two iterations for achieving the highest F1 scores, while the presence of more entities in a sentence generally degrades relation extraction performance, though DyGIE performs better than DyGIE-RelProp under these conditions. \n\n![CorefProp and RelProp iterations impact on F1 scores](image1)\n![Relation F1 scores based on number of entities in sentences](image5)"}

However, this benefit extends to most categories. On the other hand, relation propagation (RelProp) has a more pronounced effect on relation extraction, especially in domains with complex sentence structures containing multiple relations across entities [3]. The optimal number of iterations for these processes appears to be two: CorefProp achieves its best performance on the second iteration ($N=2$) [12], while RelProp also shows peak performance at two iterations ($M=2$) [2].\n\nThis is further supported by image3, which visually depicts the performance of entity and relation extraction with varying numbers of iterations for CorefProp and RelProp. The left graph titled \"Entity F1\" illustrates that the highest F1 score for entity extraction occurs at two iterations of CorefProp, represented as a blue line with circular markers. Similarly, the right graph titled \"Relation F1\" shows that the best performance for relation extraction is achieved with two iterations of RelProp, depicted as a red line with square markers.\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides insight into how the number of entities in a sentence influences relation extraction performance. It shows that as the number of entities increases, the F1 scores for both DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp decrease, but DyGIE consistently outperforms DyGIE-RelProp. This suggests that while relation propagation helps mitigate some of the decline in performance, it does not fully compensate for the increased complexity introduced by having more entities in a sentence.\n\nIn summary, both CorefProp and RelProp contribute positively to their respective tasks, with the best results achieved after two iterations.

On multiple text classification tasks such as document categorization, sentiment analysis, and sentence matching, SWEM models often exhibit comparable or even superior performance to CNNs, particularly when leveraging advanced pooling strategies like concatenation (`SWEM-concat`) or hierarchical pooling (`SWEM-hier`). For example, on the Yahoo! Answers and AG News datasets, `SWEM-concat` outperforms both CNN and LSTM models [2], while `SWEM-hier` achieves results comparable to deep CNNs and LSTMs on DBpedia [1]. This suggests that simple pooling operations over word embeddings can be highly effective for capturing semantic features in long documents.\n\nHowever, on short text tasks such as sentiment classification (e.g., MR, SST-1, SST-2), SWEM models generally perform worse than CNNs or LSTMs [5]. This is likely due to the limited semantic information provided by word embeddings alone in shorter sequences, where word-order features become more critical. In contrast, CNNs are better at capturing local patterns through their convolutional filters, which may explain their superiority in these cases.\n\nWhen analyzing performance across different subspace dimensions (i.e., the dimensionality of the embedding space), SWEM models demonstrate greater parameter efficiency. As shown in Figure 2(c) and 2(d), SWEM achieves significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating that it requires fewer parameters to reach a decent solution [10]. Specifically, if we set a performance threshold of 80% testing accuracy, SWEM exhibits a lower intrinsic dimension ($d_{\\mathrm{int}}$) than CNN on the AG News dataset. However, for larger values of $d$, CNNs can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy [10].\n\nThis trend is further illustrated in Figure 5, which compares the accuracy of SWEM and CNN models as the subspace dimension increases. Both models improve with higher dimensions, but SWEM approaches the performance of its direct implementation faster, highlighting its efficiency [5]. Additionally, the histogram in Figure 7 shows that the word embeddings learned by SWEM-max are much sparser compared to GloVe embeddings, suggesting that SWEM-max relies on fewer key words for predictions [3].\n\nIn summary, SWEM models are highly competitive with CNNs on long-document tasks and offer significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and parameter usage. However, they may lag behind CNNs in short-text scenarios where local context and word-order are crucial. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific model selection and highlight the potential of SWEM variants, especially those incorporating hierarchical or max-pooling strategies, for diverse natural language understanding tasks."}

For instance, when only the LSTM layer is used (LSTM only), the model achieves reasonable accuracy and macro-F1 scores on all datasets, but these are not optimal. Similarly, using only the embeddings or the output layer leads to lower performance compared to configurations that include more components [8]. However, when the LSTM and embedding layers are combined, there is a noticeable improvement in both accuracy and macro-F1 scores, particularly for D3 and D4, where the label distribution is highly unbalanced [8]. This suggests that combining multiple layers enhances the model's ability to capture both sequential patterns and semantic information.\n\nMoreover, the \"Without LSTM\" setting, which excludes the LSTM layer but includes the embedding and output layers, still performs reasonably well, indicating that while the LSTM contributes to performance, it is not the sole determinant of success. The \"Without embeddings\" and \"Without output layer\" settings further highlight how each component plays a unique role in the model’s overall effectiveness [8].\n\nWhen varying the percentage of document-level training examples, the performance of the PRET $^+$ MULT method shows consistent improvements in both accuracy and macro-F1 scores across all four datasets [4]. As the percentage of document-level data increases, the model benefits from additional knowledge, leading to better generalization and performance. Notably, for D3 and D4, where the neutral class is underrepresented, the macro-F1 scores show sharp increases when the percentage of document-level training examples rises from 0 to 0.4 [4]. This indicates that document-level knowledge is especially valuable for handling imbalanced datasets.\n\n![The graph illustrates that increasing the percentage of document-level training examples leads to stable improvements in both accuracy and macro-F1 scores across all datasets.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of multiple model components, particularly the LSTM and embedding layers, improves performance, especially on challenging datasets with imbalanced classes.

This design enables TRADE to perform both zero-shot and few-shot DST, where it can track dialogue states in unseen domains without prior training on those domains [9].\n\nIn terms of performance on the MultiWOZ dataset, which spans five domains—restaurant, hotel, attraction, taxi, and train—TRADE achieves a joint goal accuracy of **48.62%** and a slot accuracy of **96.92%** when evaluated on the full dataset [11]. For the restaurant-specific subset of the dataset, TRADE achieves a joint goal accuracy of **65.35%** and a slot accuracy of **93.28%**, outperforming other models like MDBT, GLAD, GCE, and SpanPtr [3] [image3].\n\n![TRADE achieves the highest joint and slot accuracy on MultiWOZ](image3)\n\nTRADE's ability to handle zero-shot settings is particularly notable. In one of the zero-shot domains, such as taxi, TRADE achieves a joint goal accuracy of **60.58%**, which is significantly higher than the zero-shot performance of other models [2].

On the restaurant subset specifically, TRADE also performs best with a joint accuracy of **65.35%** and a slot accuracy of **93.28%** [10]. This highlights its effectiveness in multi-domain dialogue state tracking (DST) and single-domain scenarios alike.\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios, TRADE is pre-trained on four domains and then fine-tuned on a new domain using various strategies. As shown in Table 5, when fine-tuned with GEM, TRADE maintains high performance on the original four domains while adapting to the new domain. For instance, in the hotel domain, the joint accuracy only drops from **58.98%** to **53.54%** after fine-tuning with GEM, whereas naive fine-tuning results in a significant drop to **36.08%** [9]. This illustrates that GEM outperforms other strategies like Naive and EWC in overcoming catastrophic forgetting during domain expansion.\n\nMoreover, fine-tuning TRADE on **1%** of new domain data generally yields better results than training from scratch on the same amount of data. For example, on the train domain, TRADE achieves **59.83%** joint accuracy after fine-tuning using only **1%** of the new domain data, which significantly outperforms training from scratch, which only reaches **44.24%** [3].\n\n![Zero-shot DST error analysis for Hotel and Restaurant domains](image3)  \nThis image shows how effectively the TRADE model handles zero-shot DST across different domains.

For instance, when expanding TRADE from four domains to a new domain, GEM achieves better results compared to EWC and naive approaches [5]. Specifically, when fine-tuning on the \"attraction\" domain, GEM obtains 34.73% joint accuracy, whereas naive fine-tuning only reaches 29.39% [4]. This suggests that GEM's ability to maintain knowledge from previously trained domains leads to superior adaptation to new data.\n\nSlot similarities also play a critical role in model performance. The heatmap in image8 shows cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots, revealing that certain slots share similar representations—likely due to their correlated values or contextual usage. For example, \"destination\" and \"departure\" exhibit high similarity, indicating that these slots are often used together or have overlapping semantic meanings. Similarly, \"price range\" and \"stars\" show strong correlations, suggesting that they may be related in terms of user intent or context. These similarities can aid the model in generalizing across domains and slots, especially during zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios [2].\n\n![Zero-shot DST error analysis showing successful transfer of knowledge for people, area, price range, and day slots](image4)\n\nIn addition, the effectiveness of slot tracking varies depending on whether the slot is seen during training or not.

For instance, Table 2 [1] presents performance metrics for commercial MT systems on the WinoMT corpus, categorizing results by language family. The table includes overall gender accuracy ($Acc$), as well as two bias metrics: $\\Delta_{G}$, which measures the difference in performance between masculine and feminine scores, and $\\Delta_{S}$, which reflects the difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments. These metrics indicate that higher values correspond to stronger biases in translation outputs.\n\nIn particular, the study found that all tested MT systems—four widely used commercial systems and two recent academic models—exhibit significant gender bias across eight diverse target languages [4]. This is further supported by the bar chart in image1, which shows that stereotypical translations consistently outperform non-stereotypical ones across all languages. For example, in Spanish, the accuracy for stereotypical translations was 67%, while it dropped to 46% for non-stereotypical translations [image1].\n\nMoreover, the impact of gender bias varies by language. German, for instance, showed relatively better performance compared to other languages, possibly due to its similarity to English [7]. However, even in German, stereotypical translations still performed better than non-stereotypical ones, with an accuracy of 69% versus 57% [image1].\n\nTo evaluate how translation accuracy and gender bias are affected, researchers also tested the impact of adding gendered adjectives to sentences. In image2, examples show that adding a stereotypically female adjective like \"pretty\" can correct biased translations. For instance, the sentence \"The pretty baker\" was translated correctly as \"la panadera bonita\" in Spanish, aligning the noun with the pronoun \"ella.\" This suggests that context and additional cues can influence translation outcomes, although this method is not practical for general debiasing [5].\n\nAdditionally, Table 4 [10] compares the performance of Google Translate on original and modified versions of the WinoMT dataset. Adding stereotypical adjectives improved accuracy in some languages, such as Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, indicating that gendered context plays a role in translation accuracy.\n\nFinally, image4 provides a comprehensive overview of accuracy and error metrics for different translation services—Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN—across various languages. While accuracy varies by service and language, the data highlights that no system is immune to gender bias, and the extent of bias differs depending on the language and the specific translation service used [image4].\n\nIn conclusion, translation accuracy and gender bias vary significantly across machine translation systems and languages, with stereotypical translations generally performing better than non-stereotypical ones.

This approach was tested on the WinoMT corpus, with results showing improvements in some languages, such as Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian [9]. \n\nIn Spanish, for example, the original accuracy of gender prediction was 53.1%, but this increased to 63.5% after adding stereotypical adjectives, resulting in a +10.4% improvement [image7]. Similarly, Russian saw an increase from 37.7% to 48.9%, a +11.2% improvement, while Ukrainian improved from 38.4% to 42.9%, a +4.5% improvement. These results suggest that incorporating contextual cues related to gender stereotypes can reduce bias in certain languages.\n\nHowever, this method is not universally effective across all languages or systems. The effectiveness of these adjustments depends on the linguistic structure of the target language and the extent to which morphological markers are used to indicate gender. In languages like Spanish, where grammatical gender is marked through inflection (e.g., \"doctora\" for female doctors), stereotype-based adjustments had a more pronounced effect [image7]. In contrast, other languages may show less dramatic changes due to differences in how gender is expressed or perceived.\n\nAdditionally, Figure 2 illustrates that commercial translation systems generally perform better when translating stereotypical gender roles (e.g., a female nurse) compared to non-stereotypical ones (e.g., a male receptionist) [2].

Even variants of COMET, such as COMET (- pretrain) and COMET-REL-TOK, do not match the full COMET model's performance, highlighting the importance of pretraining and relation mapping to natural language in improving results [9].\n\nMoreover, the graph in image6 illustrates that while the percentage of novel tuples decreases as edit distance increases, the classifier’s accuracy remains consistently high, indicating that COMET-generated tuples, even when novel, are still highly accurate and meaningful. This suggests that COMET is effective at generating both accurate and novel knowledge, which is essential for automatic knowledge base construction.\n\nThe empirical results strongly imply that COMET is an effective and robust framework for generating commonsense knowledge, especially for datasets like ConceptNet. Its ability to balance accuracy and novelty makes it a promising alternative to traditional extractive methods in commonsense knowledge base completion [7]."}

In closed vocabulary models (word-only), the Pass-Through strategy tends to be more sensitive compared to the Background variant, as it passes words unchanged, treating each unique combination of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) characters differently [6]. However, for the Neutral backoff strategy, the sensitivity is reduced due to mapping UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, which limits the number of unique outputs [8]. This makes the Neutral backoff model the most robust in terms of sensitivity for closed vocabulary models.\n\nIn contrast, open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece) process every unique combination of characters differently, making them inherently more sensitive to variations in input. The Pass-Through strategy results in high sensitivity for these models, as seen in Table 6, where the WER for Swap and Drop attacks is significantly higher compared to other strategies [6]. The Background backoff strategy, however, reduces this sensitivity by leveraging a larger corpus for reconstruction, leading to lower WER and improved robustness [10]. For example, the Background variant achieves a WER of 6.9%, which is much lower than the Pass-Through variant’s WER of 11.3% [6].\n\n![Closed vocabulary models have lower sensitivity when using the Neutral backoff strategy, while open vocabulary models benefit more from the Background backoff strategy.](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the trade-off between sensitivity and WER is visualized in Figure 2, showing that sensitivity is a more dominant factor in determining robustness compared to WER alone [12]. While both closed and open vocabulary models can achieve low WER with the appropriate backoff strategy, only those with low sensitivity ensure robust performance across different attack types.\n\nIn summary, closed vocabulary models benefit most from the Neutral backoff strategy, which minimizes sensitivity, while open vocabulary models perform better with the Background backoff strategy, which lowers WER and improves robustness."}

For instance, in terms of **word statistics**, Table 4 shows that the **RetNRef⁺⁺** model significantly improves over the **Seq2Seq** model by using more rare words and producing longer sentences [8]. Specifically, RetNRef⁺⁺ increases the use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) to 2.3% compared to just 0.4% for Seq2Seq [4]. This suggests that RetNRef⁺⁺ generates more diverse and engaging content that is closer to human-like language.\n\nIn addition, **Table 2** compares the word counts and rare word percentages across models. The **Human** responses have a word count of 13.0 and a rare word percentage of 3.0% (<100), while the **RetNRef⁺⁺** model achieves a word count of 12.7 and a rare word percentage of 2.3% (<100), making it much closer to human statistics [4]. In contrast, the **Seq2Seq** model has significantly lower values, indicating its tendency to produce shorter and less varied sentences [8].\n\nRegarding **performance metrics**, Table 3 highlights how RetNRef⁺⁺ manages to balance retrieval and generation effectively. It has **>80% word overlap** with the retrieved text about half the time (53%), which shows that it uses the retriever when appropriate but also generates novel content when needed [9]. This flexibility helps avoid the pitfalls of either purely retrieval-based or purely generator-based models.\n\nMoreover, **Table 5** provides a direct comparison of models based on human judgments, where RetNRef⁺⁺ outperforms other models like **Memory Network** and **Seq2Seq** in terms of win rates [6].

The Long-term AUM Subtotal also showed a marked increase, rising from $313 billion in 2018 to $405 billion in 2020 [image8]. Additionally, Liquidity AUM expanded from $158 billion in 2018 to $252 billion in 2020 [image8], contributing to an overall Total AUM of $657 billion by 2020, compared to $471 billion in 2018 [image8].\n\n![The table shows the growth in AUM across different categories from 2018 to 2020](image8)\n\nAlongside this growth in AUM, the Firm's fee rates for various categories showed a general decline over the same period. For example, the fee rate for Fixed Income decreased from 33 basis points (bps) in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020 [image5]. Similarly, the Alternative/Other category saw a drop from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020 [image5]. The Long-term AUM fee rate also declined from 62 bps in 2018 to 60 bps in 2020 [image5]. However, the Equity category maintained a consistent fee rate of 76 bps throughout the three years [image5].\n\n![The table shows a general trend of decreasing fee rates across categories from 2018 to 2020](image5)\n\nDespite the decline in fee rates, the substantial increase in AUM likely had a positive impact on the Firm’s revenues. Higher AUM typically leads to higher management fees, which can offset the effect of lower fee rates. This is supported by the fact that asset management revenues reached $\\mathbb{S}3{,}013$ million in 2020, representing a 15% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM [2]. \n\nAdditionally, the growth in AUM may have contributed to the increase in total assets and deposits, as reflected in the financial breakdown for 2020, which showed a significant rise compared to 2019 [image1]. This growth suggests that the Firm was able to attract more investments, potentially leading to greater revenue generation despite the downward pressure on fee rates.\n\nIn conclusion, while fee rates declined from 2018 to 2020, the substantial growth in AUM likely resulted in increased revenues for the Firm, supporting its overall financial performance during this period."}

By December 31, 2020, the total operating lease liabilities had risen to $\\S974$ million, with $\\S189$ million classified as current and $\\S785$ million as long-term [5].\n\nThis increase is likely influenced by several factors. First, the company may have entered into new lease agreements during 2020, which would add to its lease liabilities. Second, the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020 [5]. A lower discount rate increases the present value of future lease payments, thereby increasing the reported lease liabilities. Additionally, the weighted average remaining lease term remained at 7 years for both periods [5], suggesting that the change in liabilities was not due to a shift in the maturity profile of existing leases but rather due to new leases or changes in discount rates.\n\n![Operating lease liabilities increased from $\\S797$ million in 2019 to $\\S974$ million in 2020](image5)"}

This significant growth can be attributed to several factors outlined in the report. For instance, QCT revenues increased by **64%** due to rising demand for 5G products across handsets and RFFE, partly reflecting recovery from the negative impacts of the pandemic [10]. Similarly, QTL revenues grew by **26%** due to higher estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, again indicating a recovery post-pandemic [10].\n\nAdditionally, QSI earnings before income taxes rose by **$927 million** compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher net gains on investments [10]. These financial improvements were further supported by strategic acquisitions such as NUVIA, which is expected to contribute advanced technologies to QCT products upon completion of development [10].\n\nThe comprehensive income for fiscal 2021 was **$8,964 million**, which includes not only the net income but also adjustments for other comprehensive (loss) income, such as foreign currency translation gains, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, and derivative instruments [7].

These changes were influenced by a combination of factors including investment performance, insurance operations, and debt management.\n\n### Changes in Liabilities\n\nThe total liabilities for Berkshire increased from **$\\S422.393$ billion** in 2020 to **$\\S443.854$ billion** in 2021 [1]. This increase was driven primarily by higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts, which rose from **$\\S40.966$ billion** in 2020 to **$\\S38.256$ billion** in 2021 [image1]. Additionally, the increase in **notes payable and other borrowings** under \"Insurance and Other\" grew from **$\\S41.522$ billion** in 2020 to **$\\S39.272$ billion** in 2021 [image1]. However, the overall liability growth was partially offset by a decrease in **unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses** from **$\\S79.854$ billion** in 2020 to **$\\S86.664$ billion** in 2021, though this was still a significant component of the liability structure [image1].\n\nAnother contributing factor was the change in **income taxes, principally deferred**, which increased from **$\\S74.098$ billion** in 2020 to **$\\S90.243$ billion** in 2021 [image1]. This likely reflects adjustments in tax strategies or valuation changes on certain assets.\n\n### Changes in Shareholders’ Equity\n\nShareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021, stood at **$\\S506.2$ billion**, an increase of **$\\S63.0$ billion** compared to **$\\S443.2$ billion** in 2020 [1]. This substantial rise was largely attributed to **net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders**, which reached **$\\S89.8$ billion** in 2021 [1], including after-tax gains on investments of approximately **$\\S61.6$ billion** [1]. The volatility in periodic earnings over the past three years was primarily due to investment gains and losses from market price fluctuations in equity securities [1].\n\nMoreover, the consolidated claim liabilities, which include retroactive reinsurance contracts, totaled **$\\S125$ billion** as of December 31, 2021, with **80%** of that amount related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group [2]. While these liabilities are a key concern for the company, they were partially offset by a reduction in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by **$\\S974$ million** in 2021, resulting in pre-tax earnings of **$\\S142$ million** [12].\n\n### Key Factors Contributing to Changes\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the changes in liabilities and shareholders' equity:\n\n1. **Investment Performance**: Significant gains from equity investments played a major role in boosting shareholders' equity. The **$\\S61.6$ billion** in after-tax gains on investments highlights the impact of strong market performance on Berkshire’s balance sheet [1].\n\n2. **Insurance Operations**: The insurance segment, particularly through GEICO and the Reinsurance Group, continued to be a core part of Berkshire's business. While the **$\\S125$ billion** in claim liabilities represents a large portion of total liabilities, it also underscores the strength of Berkshire’s capital base [2].\n\n3. **Debt Management**: Despite an increase in liabilities, Berkshire managed its debt effectively. Parent company debt outstanding decreased from **$\\S22.7$ billion** in 2020 to **$\\S21.4$ billion** in 2021, mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate effects and strategic refinancing [5].\n\n4. **Consolidation of Pilot**: In early 2023, Berkshire plans to consolidate Pilot’s earnings, assets, and liabilities following an increase in ownership to **80%** [3]. Although this event occurred after 2021, it signals a future shift in the composition of Berkshire’s balance sheet.\n\n![Total liabilities increased from $\\S422.393$ billion in 2020 to $\\S443.854$ billion in 2021](image1)  \n![Shareholders’ equity rose significantly from $\\S443.2$ billion in 2020 to $\\S506.2$ billion in 2021](image1)\n\nIn summary, the increase in liabilities was primarily due to higher claim liabilities and deferred taxes, while the rise in shareholders’ equity was driven by robust net earnings and investment gains. These changes reflect the dynamic nature of Berkshire’s diverse portfolio and its ability to manage both risk and reward effectively."}

After adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, impairments, acquisition/divestment items, and other items, the **core gross profit** increased to $33,275 million. This indicates that the adjustments added approximately $3,379 million to the gross profit, with a significant portion attributed to the amortization of intangible assets and other items [2]. Similarly, the **Operating Income** under IFRS was $9,172 million, but after adjustments, it rose to $13,645 million, showing an increase of about $4,473 million. The adjustments included amortization of intangible assets, impairments, and other items, which helped present a more favorable view of the company’s operating performance [2].\n\nIn **2021**, the impact of these adjustments is illustrated in image1. For **Gross Profit**, the IFRS result was $32,218 million. After adding back amortization of intangible assets ($3,419 million), other items ($344 million), and considering impairments (not specified), the **core gross profit** reached $35,981 million, indicating an increase of around $3,763 million [1].

Over the years 2018 to 2020, this ratio underwent notable changes, as reflected in the financial data provided.\n\nIn 2018, the cost efficiency ratio stood at **64.4%** [7]. This indicates that for every dollar of revenue, approximately 64.4 cents were spent on costs. By 2019, the ratio increased slightly to **75.5%**, suggesting a rise in operational costs relative to revenue during that year [7]. However, by 2020, there was a significant improvement, with the cost efficiency ratio dropping to **68.3%** [7]. This decline suggests that HSBC managed to reduce its costs more effectively in relation to its revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, even though it was still higher than the 2018 level.\n\nThis trend can be attributed to various strategic actions taken by HSBC, such as restructuring efforts and optimization initiatives aimed at improving capital efficiency and addressing underperformance in certain business segments [2].

This surge in demand is also reflected in the performance of specific segments such as Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy & Transportation, all of which experienced notable growth in their sales figures [8].\n\nSecond, **favorable price realization** played a crucial role in boosting revenues. This refers to the ability of the company to maintain or increase prices while still meeting customer demand, which contributed positively to overall revenue growth [11].\n\nAnother important factor was the **impact from changes in dealer inventories**. Dealers had decreased their inventories more significantly during 2020 compared to 2021, which led to increased sales as dealers worked to replenish their stock levels [11]. This trend is further supported by data showing that dealer inventory decreases were more pronounced in 2020, contributing to higher sales volumes in subsequent periods [2].\n\nAdditionally, **favorable currency impacts** were observed, particularly related to the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar, which further enhanced the company's financial performance in international markets [8].\n\nThese elements are visually represented in the bar chart titled \"Consolidated Sales and Revenues Comparison: Full Year 2021 vs. Full Year 2020,\" which illustrates the substantial increase in sales and revenues from 2020 to 2021.

The company's repurchase program is designed to buy back shares when the price is below intrinsic value, as determined by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger [12]. In 2021 alone, Berkshire spent $\\S27.1$ billion on repurchasing shares of its Class A and B common stock [12], indicating a significant commitment to returning capital to shareholders during this period.\n\nMeanwhile, the net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders show notable variation across years and business segments. For instance, in 2021, the Manufacturing, Service, and Retailing segment reported net earnings of $\\S11,120$ million, marking a $34.0\\%$ increase compared to 2020 [4]. This growth was driven by higher customer demand and improved productivity, despite challenges such as rising input costs due to global supply chain disruptions [7].\n\nIn contrast, the Insurance – Investment Income segment experienced declining earnings, with after-tax earnings decreasing by $8.9\\%$ in 2020 compared to 2019 and further declining by $4.6\\%$ in 2021 compared to 2020 [6]. These fluctuations were influenced by lower interest rates on cash and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings, which impacted investment returns [6].\n\nThe Railroad segment also demonstrated strong performance, with after-tax earnings increasing by $16.1\\%$ in 2021 compared to 2020 [10]. This was attributed to higher freight volumes and improved productivity, although it was partially offset by rising fuel prices and volume-related costs.\n\nHowever, not all segments performed consistently well. The Utilities and Energy segment saw an increase in after-tax earnings in both 2020 and 2021, with a $13.1\\%$ increase in 2021 compared to 2020 [10]. This was largely due to higher earnings from utilities and natural gas pipelines, along with tax benefits from renewable energy initiatives.\n\n![Berkshire Hathaway’s net earnings across segments from 2019 to 2021](image4)\n\nThe overall net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders rose significantly from $\\S81,417$ million in 2019 to $\\S89,795$ million in 2021, despite a dip to $\\S42,521$ million in 2020 [4]. This highlights the resilience of Berkshire’s diversified portfolio, even amid the economic uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic [2].\n\nIn conclusion, while Berkshire Hathaway's stock repurchase program reflected a substantial return of capital to shareholders, particularly in 2021, the company's net earnings across various segments showed mixed results, with some segments experiencing robust growth and others facing challenges due to external factors like the pandemic and global supply chain issues."}

However, image3 provides relevant data for January 31, 2019, with a total value of $1,673. In contrast, image4 shows that the total value of strategic investments as of January 31, 2020, was $1,963. This indicates an increase of $290 million in the total value of strategic investments over the period.\n\nThe change in value can be attributed to different measurement categories. According to image4, the breakdown of strategic investments on January 31, 2020, includes:\n\n- **Equity Securities:** $1,912 (comprising Fair Value: $370, Measurement Alternative: $1,502, and Other: $40)\n- **Debt Securities:** $51 (comprising Fair Value: $0, Measurement Alternative: $0, and Other: $51)\n\nThis suggests that the majority of the increase in the total value of strategic investments comes from equity securities, particularly those measured under the \"Measurement Alternative\" category, which accounts for $1,502 million. The \"Other\" category also contributes, though to a lesser extent.\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides further insight into the measurement categories. It shows that as of January 31, 2020, the total fair value of strategic investments was $436, while the total under the \"Measurement Alternative\" category was $785. These figures align with the breakdown provided in image4, reinforcing the significant contribution of the \"Measurement Alternative\" category to the overall increase in the value of strategic investments.\n\nIn conclusion, the total value of strategic investments increased by $290 million from January 31, 2019 ($1,673) to January 31, 2020 ($1,963), primarily due to increases in equity securities, especially those accounted for using the \"Measurement Alternative\" method.\n\n![Total value of strategic investments increased from $1,673 to $1,963](image3)"}

According to the reconciliation of diluted earnings per share for these years, GAAP EPS decreased by 20% in 2020 compared to 2019, while Non-GAAP EPS also declined by 23% during the same period [1]. This decline can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the performance of different market segments and the impact of the global pandemic on sales.\n\nIn particular, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a significant decline in revenue, with a decrease of 19% in 2020, driven largely by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations due to the pandemic [2]. This was especially evident in key countries such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Additionally, the U.S. market saw no growth in 2020, which further contributed to the overall decline in revenues [image2].\n\nFranchised revenues also showed a decrease, with a total decline of 8% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image3]. This is consistent with the broader trend of declining revenues across most segments, except for the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment, which saw a modest increase of 6% [image3]. However, this increase was not enough to offset the declines in other segments.\n\nThe financial data provided in the table [image4] highlights the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years 2018 to 2020. In 2020, revenues were $19,208 million, a 10% decrease compared to 2019. The operating income also decreased by 19%, primarily due to the net strategic gains of $268 million related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which had a notable impact on the company's financial results [10].\n\nMoreover, the changes in selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) also played a role in affecting the earnings per share. SG&A expenses increased by 14% in 2020 compared to 2019, partly due to higher expenses for brand communications and franchisee support [11]. These increases in expenses, combined with the overall decline in revenues, further contributed to the drop in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share.\n\nIn summary, the changes in company-operated and franchised revenues across different markets had a significant negative impact on McDonald's GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share from 2019 to 2020. The decline in revenues, particularly in the International Operated Markets segment, along with increased expenses, led to a substantial decrease in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share."}

These include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, forfeiture rate, and the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant [3]. The expected volatility is derived from historical volatility of the company’s common stock and implied volatility from exchange-traded options [3]. The expected dividend yield is based on the per share cash dividend paid by the company [3]. The company also estimates option exercises and forfeitures using historical data, and the expected life of the options is determined based on historical exercise patterns [3].\n\nFor example, as of December 31, 2020, the risk-free interest rate ranged from 0.2% to 1.4%, the expected volatility was between 22.2% and 29.5%, the expected dividend yield ranged from 1.4% to 1.7%, the forfeiture rate was 5.0%, and the expected life was 5.1 years [4].\n\nOn the other hand, the future minimum lease payments represent the company’s contractual obligations related to operating leases. As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum lease payments are scheduled as follows:\n\n- **2021:** $865 million  \n- **2022:** $775 million  \n- **2023:** $646 million  \n- **2024:** $538 million  \n- **2025:** $441 million  \n- **Thereafter:** $1,781 million  \n\nThe total future minimum lease payments amount to $5,046 million, with $599 million attributed to imputed interest, resulting in a net present value of $4,447 million [6].\n\nWhile the assumptions used for stock options focus on market expectations and employee behavior, the future minimum lease payments reflect the company’s long-term financial commitments under operating leases. The two sets of data are distinct but provide complementary insights into the company’s financial position and strategic planning.\n\n![Future minimum lease payments for the company as of December 31, 2020](image6)  \n![Assumptions used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options as of December 31, 2020](image4)\n\nIn summary, the assumptions used in calculating the grant-date fair value for stock options differ significantly from the future minimum lease payments, as they reflect different financial considerations: one relates to equity compensation valuation, while the other reflects long-term lease obligations."}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower cost of funds, which is mentioned in [12] as a factor contributing to the slight increase in net interest income from 2020 to 2021. However, this benefit was partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances, which likely reduced the overall interest income generated.\n\n![Net interest income trends from 2019 to 2021](image7)\n\nNow, turning to **card member receivables**, the data in [5] and [9] indicates that the reserve for credit losses on card member receivables decreased due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, particularly the improvement in unemployment rate projections. This improvement was a key driver behind the reduction in provisions for credit losses, which changed significantly from a provision of $1,493 million in 2020 to a reduction of $438 million in 2021 [7]. Additionally, the table in image5 shows that total card member receivables increased from $22.8 billion in 2019 to $22.4 billion in 2021, with a significant increase in U.S. receivables (from $14.2 billion to $14.7 billion) and a smaller increase in international receivables (from $8.6 billion to $7.7 billion).

Additionally, other comprehensive income, including fair value changes and currency translation differences, contributed positively to retained earnings during this period.

In contrast, non-U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher proportion of fixed income securities and cash equivalents, at 73%, with a lower proportion of equity securities at 27% [image1].

In 2018, the provision for income taxes was $3,562 million, which rose to $3,742 million in 2019 and further increased to $4,973 million in 2020 [image3]. This upward trend can be attributed to several factors, including changes in the components of the tax provision such as state income taxes, health insurance taxes, and foreign rate differentials.\n\nIn 2020, the current provision for income taxes was significantly higher compared to previous years, with $4,981 million attributed to federal, state, and foreign taxes [image3]. This is in contrast to the deferred (benefit) provision, which showed a minor negative impact of $(8) million in 2020, compared to positive contributions of $230 million in 2019 and $42 million in 2018 [image3]. The deferred income tax provision or benefit reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses [9].\n\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in shaping these trends. As of December 31, 2020, the total deferred income tax assets were $3,391 million, while the total deferred income tax liabilities amounted to $(6,758) million, resulting in a net deferred income tax liability of $(3,367) million [image8]. This indicates that the company has more deferred tax liabilities than assets, which can influence the overall effective tax rate by increasing the tax burden in future periods.\n\nMoreover, valuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. These allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards [8].

In 2020, the Firm’s effective tax rate increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to a higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits [3]. Specifically, net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were $\\S122$ million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [4]. This represents a significant decrease from the $\\S475$ million net discrete tax benefits recorded in 2019, which were associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as well as benefits from the conversion of employee share-based awards [10].\n\nThese changes in tax provisions directly relate to the broader context of compensation expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses in 2020—reaching $\\S20{,}854$ million, an 11% increase from the prior year—was driven by factors such as discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and higher expenses linked to deferred compensation plans tied to investment performance [1]. These rising compensation costs likely contributed to the higher earnings base, which, in turn, influenced the effective tax rate.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm’s deferred cash-based compensation programs also played a role in shaping both the tax provisions and compensation expenses. Changes in these programs, including a reduced group of eligible employees and adjustments to deferral formulas, impacted the amount of compensation being deferred and recognized over time [6]. Furthermore, the Firm's investments in financial instruments to hedge obligations under these deferred compensation plans resulted in timing differences between gains/losses on investments and the deferred recognition of compensation expenses, potentially affecting reported ratios like the expense efficiency ratio [9].\n\n![The effective tax rate for 2020 was 22.5%, compared to 18.3% in 2019, while net discrete tax benefits dropped from $475 million to $122 million.](image5)"}

This growth was driven by a combination of factors, including higher paydown rates and continued liquidity among customers, which contributed to strong loan growth while maintaining low credit losses [7]. Additionally, the reserve for credit losses on Card Member loans decreased in 2021 due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlooks, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [11].\n\nFor **Card Member receivables**, the total increased from $43.7 billion in 2020 to $53.6 billion in 2021. However, this increase was accompanied by a rise in the reserve for credit losses, which was primarily driven by deterioration in the global macroeconomic outlook due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [12]. Despite this, the net write-off rate for principal remained relatively stable at 0.3% in 2021 [image1].\n\nIn terms of **network volumes**, the table shows that worldwide network volumes increased by 24% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting a significant rebound after a 18% decline in 2020 [image2]. Similarly, **total billed business** also rose by 25% in 2021, following a 19% drop in 2020. These increases were supported by stronger consumer and commercial spending, particularly in goods and services (G&S) and travel and entertainment (T&E) categories [image2].\n\nRegarding **card member spending**, average proprietary basic card member spending increased across all regions, with the U.S. showing a notable rise in spending levels. This aligns with the overall growth in billed business and reflects the company’s success in retaining customers and driving higher spending [image8].\n\n![Card Member loans increased from $73.4 billion in 2020 to $88.6 billion in 2021, driven by higher paydown rates and customer liquidity.](image1)\n\n![Worldwide network volumes increased by 24% in 2021, and total billed business rose by 25%, indicating a recovery from the previous year's declines.](image2)\n\n![Average proprietary basic card member spending increased globally in 2021, supporting the rise in billed business and network volumes.](image8)\n\nIn summary, **card member loans and receivables grew from 2020 to 2021**, albeit with varying impacts on credit loss reserves.

In 2020, net income was $4,730.5 million, a decrease of $1,294.9 million compared to $6,025.4 million in 2019 [image1]. Similarly, comprehensive income dropped from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020, reflecting a reduction of $1,525.8 million [image1].\n\nThe decline in net income can be attributed to several factors outlined in the financial statements. First, operating margin decreased from 42.5% in 2019 to 38.1% in 2020, even after excluding specific items, which indicates a reduction in profitability [1]. This is further supported by the fact that operating income fell by 19% (20% in constant currencies) in 2020, with significant impacts from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock and other strategic charges [9]. Additionally, cash provided by operations decreased by $1.9 billion or 23% compared to 2019, primarily due to the reduction in operating earnings caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [5].\n\nThe comprehensive income also saw a significant drop, largely influenced by the decrease in net income. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, was negative at ($104.1) million in 2020, compared to positive $126.8 million in 2019 [image1]. This shift reflects changes in foreign currency translation adjustments, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit pension plans, all of which had a detrimental effect on the overall comprehensive income for the year.\n\n![Net income decreased from $6,025.4 million in 2019 to $4,730.5 million in 2020](image1)\n![Comprehensive income decreased from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, net income and comprehensive income both experienced notable declines from 2019 to 2020, primarily driven by reduced operating margins, lower operating income, and the adverse effects of the pandemic on cash flows and profitability."}

According to [6], as of December 31, 2020, the net value of solar energy systems in service after depreciation was $5,906 million, while it was $6,061 million in 2019. This indicates a slight decrease in the net value of solar energy systems in service due to depreciation. Additionally, solar energy systems under construction were $28 million in 2020 compared to $18 million in 2019, showing an increase in systems under development. Solar energy systems pending interconnection were $45 million in 2020, up from $59 million in 2019, indicating a small decrease in systems awaiting interconnection. The total net value of solar energy systems in 2020 was $5,979 million, compared to $6,138 million in 2019, reflecting a decline of approximately $159 million [6].\n\nNext, we consider **property, plant, and equipment (PPE)**. From [4], the gross PPE under finance leases was $2.28 billion as of December 31, 2020, with accumulated depreciation of $816 million, resulting in a net value of $1.464 billion. In 2019, the gross PPE under finance leases was $2.08 billion, with accumulated depreciation of $483 million, leading to a net value of $1.597 billion. This shows a decrease in the net value of PPE under finance leases by approximately $133 million [4].\n\nAdditionally, [5] mentions that solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset-backed Notes had a carrying value of $660 million as of December 31, 2020. While this is part of the broader asset base, it does not directly contribute to the overall PPE or solar energy system net values but highlights the use of these assets in financing arrangements.\n\nFinally, [image5] provides further insight into the broader category of assets. It outlines that the total net value of all assets increased from $10,396 million in 2019 to $12,747 million in 2020. However, this figure includes all types of assets, not just solar energy systems and PPE. \n\nIn summary, the net value of solar energy systems decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020, while the net value of PPE under finance leases also declined. Despite this, the overall net value of assets increased due to growth in other categories. \n\n![Total net value of solar energy systems in service decreased from $6,061 million in 2019 to $5,906 million in 2020](image6)\n\n![Net value of property, plant, and equipment under finance leases decreased from $1.597 billion in 2019 to $1.464 billion in 2020](image4)\n\nThe total net value of solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment decreased from 2019 to 2020."}

This indicates that both beverage and food/snack categories are central to the company’s operations. Furthermore, the financial impact of major customers like Walmart on specific divisions (FLNA, QFNA, and PBNA) highlights how critical these relationships are for revenue generation [3].\n\nIn terms of net revenue and operating profit changes, the text reveals that operating profit increased by $24\\%$ in one instance, driven by net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring and impairment charges [6]. In contrast, operating profit decreased by $2\\%$ in another case, with the decline attributed to operating cost increases, although partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings [7]. Another division experienced a $2\\%$ increase in operating profit due to net revenue growth and productivity savings, but this was reduced by $4\\%$ due to pandemic-related charges [9]. These variations in performance across divisions suggest that factors such as market conditions, operational efficiency, and external events like the pandemic had varying impacts.\n\nLooking at image2, which provides a detailed breakdown of net revenue and operating profit for different divisions over three years (2018–2020), we can observe the following trends:\n\n- **FLNA (Frito-Lay North America)**: Net revenue and operating profit show consistent growth across all three years.\n- **QFNA (Quaker Foods North America)**: Similar to FLNA, QFNA also shows steady growth in both net revenue and operating profit.\n- **PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America)**: This division experiences significant fluctuations, with higher net revenue but mixed results in operating profit, possibly influenced by the costs associated with its beverage business.\n- **LatAm (Latin America)**: Net revenue grows steadily, while operating profit fluctuates slightly.\n- **Europe**: Both net revenue and operating profit show positive trends.\n- **AMESA (Africa, Middle East, South Asia)**: There is notable growth in net revenue, though operating profit appears to have grown more slowly.\n- **APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, and China)**: Net revenue increases significantly, but operating profit remains relatively stable or grows modestly.\n\nThis data supports the idea that regions and divisions with a stronger focus on food/snack products (e.g., FLNA, QFNA, and LatAm) may have experienced more consistent revenue and profit growth compared to those with a larger beverage component (e.g., PBNA). Image6 further reinforces this by showing that beverage percentages vary across regions. For example, in Europe, beverages accounted for $55\\%$ of total revenue in 2020, while in LatAm, only $10\\%$ of revenue came from beverages. This suggests that regions with a higher proportion of food/snack products might have more stable and predictable revenue streams, contributing to better operating profit performance.\n\nAdditionally, the note in image6 mentions that beverage percentages are relatively stable in most regions, except for AMESA, where there was a slight shift from $45\\%$ beverage in 2018 to $30\\%$ in 2020. This change could have impacted the division’s profitability, especially if the food/snack segment is less volatile or more profitable than the beverage segment.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 appear to be closely tied to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. Divisions with a higher proportion of food/snack products tend to show more stable and consistent financial performance, whereas those with a larger beverage component face more variability, potentially due to factors like market dynamics, pricing strategies, and operational costs.\n\n![Net revenue and operating profit for divisions from 2018 to 2020](image2)"}

According to the financial data, cash flows from **investing activities** increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million in 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian [6]. This acquisition represented a major investment in expanding the company's capabilities and market presence. Additionally, there was an increase in cash outflows due to additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, largely attributed to investments for capacity expansions [6].\n\nOn the other hand, **cash flows from financing activities** saw a dramatic shift, changing by €12,087 million to €11,839 million in 2021 [5]. This change was heavily influenced by the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which required substantial capital infusion. The financing included inflows from borrowings amounting to €10 billion and an additional €850 million provided by the Siemens Group to support the acquisition [9]. These inflows were partially offset by cash outflows from the repayment of matured loans totaling €730 million (nominal value: €859 million) and an additional €300 million [9].\n\nFurthermore, the company repurchased treasury shares to fulfill share-based payment programs, increasing treasury shares by €203 million to €240 million in 2021 [10].

This evolution reflects a substantial turnaround in the company's financial performance over these years.\n\nThe contributing factors to this change are multifaceted. First, the company experienced a notable increase in net income, rising from a loss of $\\S775$ million in 2019 to a profit of $\\S862$ million in 2020 [3]. This improvement in net income is largely attributed to operational efficiencies and an acceleration in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses due to a rapid increase in market capitalization [3].\n\nAdditionally, other comprehensive income (loss) played a role, particularly through foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2018, there was a loss of $\\S42$ million, which improved to a gain of $\\S399$ million in 2020 [3]. This positive adjustment significantly contributed to the overall comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders also accounts for the portion of comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. In 2018, this amounted to a loss of $\\S87$ million, whereas in 2020, it was a gain of $\\S141$ million [3]. This shift indicates a reduction in losses from noncontrolling interests, further enhancing the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved from a loss in 2018 to a profit in 2020, driven by improvements in net income, favorable foreign currency translation adjustments, and reduced losses from noncontrolling interests. \n\n![Comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders increased from a loss of $1,018 million in 2018 to a profit of $1,120 million in 2020](image3)"}

One of the most significant changes occurred on July 6, 2020, when the company filed a \"Certificate of Amendment\" to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State. This amendment increased the number of authorized common shares from 2,000,000,000 to 2,500,000,000, maintaining a par value of $\\S0.001$ per share. This increase in authorized shares likely reflects the company’s strategic need for flexibility in future equity offerings or conversions, which is further supported by the issuance of stock options and shares in prior years [4]. \n\n![Amendment to increase authorized shares](image5)\n\nIn addition to the increase in authorized shares, Brazil Minerals has a complex web of subsidiaries that reflect its ownership structure and operational focus. As of March 26, 2021, the company had multiple subsidiaries, including BMIX Participações Ltda., Mineração Duas Barras Ltda., RST Recursos Minerais Ltda., Hercules Resources Corporation, Jupiter Gold Corporation, and others. These subsidiaries are primarily located in Brazil and the Marshall Islands, with the company holding varying percentages of ownership, often close to 100% in some cases. For instance, the Company owns 99.99% of BMIX Participações Ltda., which in turn owns 99.99% of Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. and 50% of RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. This layered ownership structure suggests a strategic effort to control mineral rights and operations across different regions [8].\n\n![List of subsidiaries and ownership structure](image3)\n\nThe company also has significant ownership in Jupiter Gold Corporation, where it holds 30% of the shares, and through Jupiter Gold, it indirectly owns Mineração Jupiter Ltda. Additionally, Apollo Resources Corporation, which is owned 60% by Brazil Minerals, holds a 99.99% stake in Mineração Apollo Ltda. This interconnected network of subsidiaries indicates a broad scope of mineral exploration and resource management activities in Brazil [8].\n\nAnother key development was the issuance of 53,947,368 shares of common stock to Lancaster Brazil Fund in March 2020 under an addendum to a share exchange agreement. This transaction resulted in a loss on exchange of equity with a related party of $\\mathbb{S}76,926$, representing the fair value of the additional shares issued [5]. This highlights the company's engagement in equity exchanges with related parties, which may be part of broader restructuring or financing strategies.\n\nFinally, the company has issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which grants holders 51% of the total voting power, regardless of the number of shares outstanding. This provision ensures that the holders of Series A Stock have significant influence over corporate decisions, reflecting a deliberate design to balance control between different classes of shareholders [12].\n\nIn summary, Brazil Minerals, Inc. has made substantial structural and ownership-related adjustments, including increasing its authorized shares, expanding its subsidiary network, engaging in related-party transactions, and implementing a voting structure that gives preferred stockholders significant influence. These changes indicate a dynamic and evolving corporate strategy aimed at managing its mineral exploration and investment activities effectively."}

The **gross capital lease obligations** include both principal and interest, but the **imputed interest** is subtracted to arrive at the present value of net minimum lease payments, which is then adjusted for the current portion to yield the long-term portion.\n\nFor **finance lease obligations**, quote [10] also mentions that current finance lease obligations were $282 million and recorded within \"Accrued expenses and other,\" while $4.7 billion were recorded within \"Other long-term liabilities\" as of December 31, 2017.

Similarly, the Tier 1 capital ratio rose from **18.6%** to **19.4%**, and the Total Capital ratio improved from **21.0%** to **21.5%** [5]. This growth was supported by an increase in CET1 capital, which grew from **$64,751 million** in 2019 to **$78,650 million** in 2020 [5]. Concurrently, RWA for credit risk increased from **$342,684 million** to **$387,066 million** due to higher exposures in derivatives, investment securities, and lending commitments [7].\n\n![Credit risk RWA increased in 2020 due to higher exposures in derivatives and investment securities](image7)\n\nIn contrast, under the **Advanced Approach**, the CET1 capital ratio rose from **16.9%** in 2019 to **17.7%** in 2020, while the Tier 1 capital ratio increased from **19.2%** to **19.8%**, and the Total Capital ratio climbed from **21.5%** to **21.8%** [5]. CET1 capital also grew from **$64,751 million** to **$78,650 million**, reflecting a net increase in retained earnings and the impact of the E*TRADE acquisition [4]. Credit risk RWA under this approach increased more sharply, from **$228,927 million** to **$284,930 million**, primarily due to higher derivative exposures and credit spread volatility [7].\n\n![Capital ratios and RWA under the Advanced Approach showed notable increases in 2020](image6)\n\nMarket risk RWA increased under both approaches in 2020, driven mainly by higher market volatility and an increase in Regulatory VaR [12].

According to the table in image6, the Upstream segment reported earnings of $(2,433) million in 2020 and $15,818 million in 2021. This indicates a dramatic turnaround in profitability for the Upstream operations, likely influenced by fluctuations in crude oil prices and improved operational efficiency [6]. In contrast, the Downstream segment showed more modest changes in earnings. It earned $47 million in 2020 and $2,914 million in 2021, which reflects a positive but less pronounced improvement compared to the Upstream segment [6].\n\nRegarding **asset values**, the Upstream segment had significantly higher total assets compared to the Downstream segment in both 2021 and 2020. From image8, the total Upstream assets were $184,412 million in 2021 and $191,309 million in 2020, while the Downstream segment totaled $45,224 million in 2021 and $39,586 million in 2020. This highlights the larger scale and capital intensity of the Upstream operations, which involve exploration, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas [4]. The difference in asset values underscores the distinct nature of these two business segments, with Upstream requiring extensive infrastructure and long-term investments.\n\n![Upstream and Downstream Earnings Comparison](image6)  \n![Upstream and Downstream Asset Values Comparison](image8)\n\nIn summary, the Upstream segment demonstrated a much stronger recovery in earnings from 2020 to 2021 compared to the Downstream segment, while also maintaining a significantly larger asset base.

This growth was primarily driven by higher earnings before income taxes, which rose by $2 billion to $18.0 billion in 2022 compared to $17.6 billion in 2020. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased, further contributing to the increase in net earnings [10]. However, foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar [10]. Despite this, the overall trend remained positive, with net earnings growing consistently year-over-year.\n\n![Net earnings attributable to P&G increased from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022](image5)\n\nTurning to **stock-based expenses**, these expenses also fluctuated between 2020 and 2022.

By 2022, total stock-based expenses had slightly decreased to $528 million, with $271 million attributed to stock options and $257 million to RSUs and PSUs [1]. This decrease may be attributed to changes in the number of shares granted or adjustments in the fair value of the awards over time. Furthermore, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant, amortized over the requisite service period [8].\n\n![Stock-based expenses for 2022, 2021, and 2020 show a slight decline from 2020 to 2022](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, net earnings attributable to P&G increased from 2020 to 2022 due to higher pre-tax earnings and a lower effective tax rate, while stock-based expenses showed a modest decline over the same period."}

This overall increase reflects growth across multiple segments, including the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. Additionally, the Media segment revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion in 2021, which includes the impact of the Tokyo Olympics broadcast [12].

Within this, **Systems Hardware** decreased by 7.4% as reported (8.0% adjusted for currency), driven primarily by declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems, partially offset by growth in IBM Z [6]. Specifically, **IBM Z** revenue increased by 1.9% as reported (1% adjusted for currency) despite an elongated adoption cycle [11]. Meanwhile, **Operating Systems Software** revenue declined by 11.2% year to year [6].\n\nFor **pre-tax income**, the Systems segment experienced a significant decline, with pre-tax income dropping by 36.0% year to year in 2020 compared to 2019 [8].

Derivative financial instruments are crucial for managing risk, and their valuation and recognition directly affect the income statement and other comprehensive income.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are measured based on quoted market prices when active markets exist [10]. If no active market exists, they are valued using a valuation methodology [2]. These instruments are typically categorized as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, with gains or losses recognized in equity until the forecast transaction is realized [3]. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is transferred to the income statement [3].\n\nIn 2020, the total derivative financial instruments amounted to DKK 2,332 million, compared to DKK 188 million in 2019 [image2]. This significant increase suggests that the company may have expanded its hedging activities or exposure to foreign exchange risks during this period. Additionally, the fair value of these derivatives was based on observable market data, with no transfers between the \"Active market data\" and \"Directly or indirectly observable market data\" categories during 2020 or 2019 [6].\n\nRegarding cash flow changes, adjustments for non-cash items play a critical role in converting accrual-based income statement figures into actual cash flows [7]. For instance, the reversal of non-cash items such as share-based payment costs and capital gains/losses on investments significantly affects the cash flow from operating activities [image1]. In 2020, the total reversals of non-cash income statement items were DKK 7,849 million, compared to DKK 7,032 million in 2019 [image1]. This increase indicates a higher level of non-cash transactions impacting the company’s reported earnings.\n\nFurthermore, changes in working capital also influence cash flow. The change in working capital for 2020 was DKK (4,353) million, reflecting a decrease in cash flow due to changes in inventories, trade receivables, and payables [image4]. This contrasts with a DKK (3,564) million change in 2019, indicating a slight improvement in cash flow from working capital management in 2020.\n\n![Derivative financial instruments increased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image2)  \n![Reversals of non-cash income statement items rose from 2019 to 2020](image1)  \n![Changes in working capital affected cash flow differently in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)\n\nThese financial elements—derivative financial instruments and changes in cash flow—affect the company's financial statements by influencing both the income statement and the cash flow statement. Derivatives impact the recognition of gains and losses, while changes in working capital and non-cash items adjust the actual cash flow generated from operations. Together, they provide a clearer picture of the company’s liquidity and risk management strategies over the two years."}

In 2022, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 77 basis points compared to 2021 [9]. This improvement was attributed to leveraging increased sales, ceasing incremental wages related to the pandemic, and other cost management efforts. Additionally, the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, was 9.26% in 2022, a decrease of 39 basis points compared to the previous year [9]. \n\nLooking at the broader context, the total net sales for 2022 were $222,730, which represents a 16% increase compared to 2021 [10], while the gross profit margin slightly declined due to factors like LIFO charges and merchandise costs [10]. Despite these challenges, the company successfully managed its SG&A expenses through strategic cost controls, including wage adjustments and operational efficiencies.\n\nRegarding **Interest Income and Other, Net**, there is no direct mention of interest income figures in the text quotes. However, we can infer some trends from the image quotes. Image2 provides a breakdown of financial figures for 2022, 2021, and 2020, where the first row appears to represent income or revenue. For 2022, it shows $7,392, which could be interpreted as total interest income and other net income, although this is speculative without explicit confirmation from the text [image2].\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that interest expense decreased in 2022 due to the repayment of the 2.300% Senior Notes on December 1, 2021 [2]. This suggests that the company reduced its debt burden, potentially improving its interest income or reducing interest expenses, though the exact figures are not specified.\n\nTo summarize, SG&A expenses showed a clear downward trend as a percentage of net sales from 2020 to 2022, primarily driven by cost management and leveraging higher sales volumes. While specific figures for Interest Income and Other, Net are not directly available, the reduction in interest expense and the overall financial performance suggest a positive trend in this area as well.\n\n![SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points compared to 2021](image9)  \n![Financial figures for 2022, 2021, and 2020 showing income or revenue amounts](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, SG&A expenses decreased significantly from 2020 to 2022, while interest income and other net figures appear to have improved, based on the reduction in interest expenses and the overall financial performance of the company."}

This growth in net income contributed positively to retained earnings, a key component of shareholders' equity. Additionally, **other comprehensive income (OCI)** for 2020 totaled $278,740, with the majority stemming from foreign currency translation adjustments of $197,696 and defined benefit plans of $57,100 [5]. These OCI components, while not directly affecting net income, still impacted total comprehensive income and, therefore, shareholders' equity indirectly through the accumulation of other comprehensive income.\n\nIn contrast, fiscal 2019 showed a **net income** of $4,846,241, but **OCI** was negative at $(264,406), driven by significant losses in foreign currency translation ($132,707) and defined benefit plans ($253,039) [5]. This negative OCI reduced total comprehensive income compared to net income alone. Similarly, in fiscal 2018, **net income** was $4,214,594, but **OCI** was also negative at $(481,387), primarily due to losses in foreign currency translation ($305,225) and cash flow hedges ($198,645) [5].\n\nThe impact of these OCI components on shareholders' equity is illustrated in the **shareholders’ equity statements**, where changes in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss are tracked over time [7]. For example, in 2020, the **accumulated other comprehensive loss** increased by $278,740, reflecting the positive OCI for the year [5]. Conversely, in 2019, the accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $264,406, aligning with the negative OCI [5]. These fluctuations highlight how OCI influences the overall equity position of the company.\n\n![Changes in comprehensive income and OCI components](image5)  \nThis table provides a clear breakdown of the components contributing to comprehensive income and OCI over the three fiscal years, showing the interplay between net income, OCI, and their allocation between Accenture PLC and noncontrolling interests.\n\nOverall, the trends in comprehensive income and OCI reflect the volatility in foreign exchange and pension-related activities, which in turn influence the composition of shareholders’ equity through retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. \n\nAccenture's comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components show a mix of growth and volatility over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, directly influencing changes in shareholders’ equity."}

According to the text, the Company has not constituted any Remuneration Committee, and the remuneration for Managing/Executive/Whole-time Directors is decided by the Board and recommended for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting [5]. Non-executive directors do not draw any remuneration from the Company except the sitting fee of Rs. 5,000 (as decided by the Board of Directors) for each meeting of the Board and the Board Committee attended by them [5].\n\nFurthermore, image5 provides a detailed breakdown of the financial compensation for directors, including salary, perquisites, commission, and sitting fees for board and committee meetings. This table lists the monetary values for each category and includes totals for each column, offering a clear view of how much each director was compensated during this period.\n\nIn terms of the company's financial performance, the auditors’ report indicates that the balance sheet, profit and loss account, and cash flow statement comply with the accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the company’s financial position [1]. Additionally, the company reported that during the financial year 2002-03, 94 complaints were received from shareholders/investors and were resolved to their satisfaction [3], suggesting a relatively stable environment in terms of shareholder relations.\n\nMarket conditions during this period can be inferred from image2, which compares the performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex from April 2002 to March 2003. The GPI fluctuated between a high of 106 and a low of 84, while the BSE Sensex varied between 98 and 84. This data reflects the relative performance of the company compared to the broader market index, indicating periods of both growth and decline.\n\n![Performance comparison of GPI and BSE Sensex from April 2002 to March 2003](image2)\n\nMoreover, image4 shows the monthly high and low prices of the company's shares over the same period, providing further insight into market conditions. For instance, the share price peaked at Rs. 420 in July 2002 and dropped to a low of Rs. 286 in March 2003. These fluctuations may have influenced the company's decision-making regarding director remuneration, particularly if there was a need to align compensation with market performance or maintain stability amidst volatility.\n\n![Monthly high and low prices of shares from April 2002 to March 2003](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the remuneration structure for directors in the financial year 2002-03 was primarily determined by the Board of Directors and included elements such as salary, perquisites, commission, and sitting fees, with non-executive directors receiving only sitting fees. This structure was likely influenced by the company's financial performance, as reflected in its compliance with accounting standards and resolution of shareholder complaints, as well as broader market conditions, as evidenced by the performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex and the fluctuation in share prices."}

This increase was primarily driven by higher amounts in **Insurance and Other liabilities**, which rose from **$\\S250.223$ billion** to **$\\S255.711$ billion**, as well as a slight increase in **Railroad, Utilities, and Energy liabilities** from **$\\S98.072$ billion** to **$\\S97.900$ billion**. Notably, **unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses** under retroactive reinsurance contracts decreased from **$\\S40.966$ billion** to **$\\S38.256$ billion**, but other components such as **notes payable and other borrowings** increased significantly.\n\nIn contrast, **shareholders’ equity** showed a substantial increase. According to image4, while the exact figure for shareholders’ equity is not fully provided in the excerpt, it is clear from other financial statements (e.g., text quote [10]) that consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021, was **$\\S506.2$ billion**, an increase of **$\\S63.0$ billion** since December 31, 2020. This growth reflects the strong performance of the company during the period.\n\nTurning to **net earnings**, text quote [10] highlights that **net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders** were **$\\S89.8$ billion** in 2021, with after-tax gains on investments contributing approximately **$\\S61.6$ billion**. This is a significant increase compared to 2020, where net earnings were **$\\S43.253$ billion** according to image2 [image2].\n\nFurthermore, **comprehensive income** also saw a notable rise. Image2 shows that **comprehensive income attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders** was **$\\S90.011$ billion** in 2021, up from **$\\S43.521$ billion** in 2020. This increase aligns with the surge in investment gains and the overall profitability of the business.\n\nThe relationship between these figures is clear: the **increase in net earnings and comprehensive income** directly contributed to the **rise in shareholders’ equity**, despite the **increase in total liabilities**. The company's ability to generate significant investment gains and maintain strong operational performance allowed it to grow its equity base even as it managed increasing liabilities, particularly in insurance-related obligations.\n\n![Total liabilities increased from $\\S422.393$ billion in 2020 to $\\S443.854$ billion in 2021](image4)  \n![Shareholders’ equity rose significantly from 2020 to 2021, reflecting strong net earnings and comprehensive income](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in total liabilities from 2020 to 2021 was offset by a substantial rise in shareholders’ equity, which was largely driven by strong net earnings and comprehensive income during the same period."}

The company emphasizes sustainable growth, stability, and efficiency as the three pillars of its financial strategy [11], which aligns with its long-term vision for addressing environmental challenges.\n\nIn terms of shareholder returns, Toyota has consistently aimed to maintain a stable payout ratio of around 30% [1], ensuring that dividends remain a key component of shareholder value. This is supported by data from image1, which shows dividend payments and share repurchases over five fiscal years (2017–2021). While there were fluctuations in the payout ratio, the company maintained a focus on returning value to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, contributing to a total return ratio that varied but remained significant.\n\n![Stable dividend payments and shareholder returns](image1)\n\nSimultaneously, Toyota’s commitment to climate action is evident in its Environmental Challenge 2050 initiative, outlined in image4. The goal of completely eliminating all CO₂ emissions throughout the entire vehicle life cycle by 2050 includes milestones such as reducing CO₂ emissions by 25% or more compared to 2013 levels by 2030. In 2020, Toyota achieved a 23% reduction in emissions compared to 2010 levels, demonstrating progress toward these targets. Electrification plays a central role in this effort, with the company achieving 16.98 million electrified vehicle sales and expanding its portfolio of low-emission technologies.\n\n![Toyota's Environmental Challenge 2050 goals and progress](image4)\n\nMoreover, image5 highlights how Toyota views climate-related risks and opportunities, including the tightening of regulations for fuel efficiency and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), expansion of carbon pricing, and increased frequency of natural disasters. These factors influence Toyota’s strategic decisions, such as investing in battery technology, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing its Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to mitigate production risks. The company also anticipates future scenarios under the 1.5°C target, emphasizing the need for large-scale renewable energy integration and energy-saving technologies.\n\n![Toyota's response to climate scenarios and related measures](image5)\n\nTo ensure alignment between its financial and environmental strategies, Toyota engages in continuous risk management and scenario analysis, as described in quote [8]. It evaluates the impact of climate change on its business while seeking opportunities for innovation and growth. This approach supports the company’s ability to enhance competitiveness and secure new business opportunities, reinforcing its financial stability and long-term value creation.\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota’s financial strategy correlates closely with its response to climate scenarios by balancing shareholder returns with investments in electrification and sustainability. By maintaining strong shareholder value through dividends and repurchases while pursuing ambitious environmental goals, Toyota aims to achieve sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving global landscape."}

These changes are reflected in both the financial figures and the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.\n\nDepreciation and impairment losses for 2020 totaled DKK 4,307 million, compared to DKK 4,192 million in 2019 [7]. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including higher depreciation expenses and a significant reduction in impairment losses. Specifically, total impairment losses in 2020 were DKK 350 million, down from DKK 982 million in 2019 [10]. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of write-downs on prelaunch inventory, which had a positive impact on the income statement by DKK 510 million in 2019 [5].\n\nThe evolution of these losses is further supported by the detailed breakdown of amortisation and impairment losses in the relevant financial tables. For instance, total amortisation in 2020 amounted to DKK 1,096 million, compared to DKK 487 million in 2019 [4]. The increase in amortisation reflects the capitalization of internally developed intangible assets, as seen in the addition of DKK 396 million in intangible assets in 2020 (DKK 221 million in 2019) [7].\n\n![Intangible assets not yet being amortised amount to DKK 9,607 million in 2020, primarily patents and licences related to research and development projects](image5)\n\nThe impact of these depreciation and impairment losses on the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment is evident in the changes observed in the respective financial statements. For example, the carrying amount of intangible assets not yet available for use decreased significantly from DKK 3,380 million in 2019 to DKK 9,607 million in 2020 [6]. This change reflects the ongoing capitalization of research and development-related intangible assets and the adjustments made to their values based on Management’s projections and anticipated future cash flows [6].\n\nMoreover, the net carrying amounts of property, plant, and equipment are influenced by depreciation and impairment losses. In 2020, the balance at the end of the year for land and buildings was DKK 2,901 million, while other equipment stood at DKK 479 million [6]. These figures reflect the effects of depreciation and any adjustments made during the year, as outlined in the detailed financial data provided [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the depreciation and impairment losses from 2019 to 2020 have evolved with an overall increase in total depreciation and a significant decrease in impairment losses, primarily due to the reversal of write-downs on prelaunch inventory. These changes have impacted the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, reflecting the ongoing capitalization of research and development-related intangible assets and the adjustments made to their values based on Management’s projections and anticipated future cash flows."}

For instance, in the **Property/Casualty** segment, premiums earned increased from $9,911 million in 2019 to $13,740 million in 2021 [5]. Similarly, in the **Life/Health** segment, premiums earned rose from $4,869 million in 2019 to $5,648 million in 2021 [6]. However, this growth was not uniform across all categories. The **Retroactive Reinsurance** segment saw a significant decline in premiums earned, dropping from $684 million in 2019 to just $136 million in 2021 [5]. This variability reflects differing impacts of market dynamics and strategic shifts within each segment.\n\nRegarding **net investment income**, there is a clear downward trend from 2019 to 2021. Specifically, **interest and other investment income** fell sharply, declining from $2,075 million in 2019 to $589 million in 2021, representing a decrease of 44.4% compared to 2020 and 49.0% compared to 2019 [7]. Despite an increase in **dividend income**—which grew by 3.5% from 2020 to 2021 and by 8.1% from 2019 to 2020—the overall **pre-tax net investment income** still declined from $6,600 million in 2019 to $5,649 million in 2021 [7]. This decline was largely driven by the drop in interest income due to low short-term interest rates prevailing throughout 2020 and 2021, which significantly reduced returns on fixed maturity securities and short-term investments [9].\n\n![Net investment income declined significantly from 2019 to 2021](image7)  \n![Premiums earned showed mixed trends with some segments experiencing growth while others faced declines](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, while premiums earned generally increased from 2019 to 2021 across most segments, net investment income experienced a notable decline due to lower interest rates and reduced returns on investments during this period."}

According to the data provided, the total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 in 2021 to $4,091 in 2022 [2]. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including changes in specific categories of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nOne of the most significant contributors to the change in deferred tax assets was the **loss and other carryforwards**, which dropped from $1,030 in 2021 to $914 in 2022. This decrease reflects a reduction in the company's net operating loss carryforwards, which were reported at $2.5 billion as of June 30, 2022, compared to $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 [3]. Approximately $300 million of these losses will expire between 2022 and 2041, while the remainder may be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nAnother important category contributing to the change in deferred tax assets was **pension and other retiree benefits**, which decreased from $1,476 in 2021 to $740 in 2022. This decline is linked to actuarial gains related to increases in discount rates, partially offset by unfavorable medical claim experience or assumptions [12].\n\nIn contrast, the deferred tax liabilities increased significantly from $8,503 in 2021 to $9,288 in 2022.

A key factor was the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, which rose by $3.4 billion to $18.2 billion in 2020 [8]. This improvement was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables of $4.795 billion, largely due to sales of receivables, including financing receivables of $3.076 billion [9]. Additionally, tax relief measures such as payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals under the U.S. CARES Act contributed approximately $600 million [9].\n\nHowever, this was partially offset by performance-related declines within net income and other outflows, such as an increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million [9]. Despite these offsets, the overall improvement in operating cash flow played a crucial role in enhancing liquidity.\n\nOn the investing activities side, net cash used in investing activities decreased significantly by $23.9 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions (mainly the Red Hat acquisition in 2019) and a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [7]. This reduction in cash outflows from investing activities further supported the overall liquidity position.\n\nFinancing activities, on the other hand, were a net use of cash of $9.721 billion in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9.042 billion in 2019 [12]. This shift was driven by a decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions, mainly due to a lower level of net additions to fund the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year [6]. However, there was a partial offset from a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases [6].\n\nThe combined effect of these cash flow activities is reflected in the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.

This indicates a substantial improvement in IBM's liquidity position in 2020, largely attributed to the strong performance in operating cash flows and reduced outflows in investing activities.\n\n![Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased from a decrease of $\\$3.290$ billion in 2019 to an increase of $\\$5.361$ billion in 2020](image3)\n\nThis overall improvement in liquidity highlights the positive impact of financial adjustments and cash flow activities on IBM’s cash position in 2020 compared to 2019."}

Total revenues decreased by **10%** in 2020 compared to 2019, with the most significant declines occurring in the International Operated Markets segment [8]. This is supported by data from image8, which shows that total company-operated sales and franchised revenues fell by **10%** year-over-year. Specifically, the U.S. saw a **2%** decrease, while International Operated Markets faced a **17%** drop [image8].\n\nRestaurant margins also declined significantly during this period. Total restaurant margins dropped by **13%** in 2020, largely due to sales declines in the International Operated Markets driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [8]. This was partially offset by positive sales performance in the U.S., but not enough to prevent the overall decline. Image5 illustrates this point clearly, showing that franchised margins decreased from **$9,455 million** in 2019 to **$8,519 million** in 2020, while company-operated margins fell from **$1,660 million** to **$1,158 million** [image5].\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes included temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in the International Operated Markets, particularly in countries such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3]. Additionally, increased expenses related to marketing support, including the provision of free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers, were aimed at accelerating recovery and driving growth [1]. These efforts were reflected in higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, which rose by **14%** in 2020 compared to 2019 [9].\n\n![Total revenues declined by 10% in 2020](image8)  \n![Restaurant margins decreased by 13% in 2020](image5)  \n\nIn summary, the decline in total revenues and restaurant margins from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales, especially in international markets, along with increased marketing and operational costs aimed at supporting recovery efforts."}

According to the data, **Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, and Sky** were the primary drivers of revenue growth, while **Corporate and Other activities** had a smaller impact or even reduced expenses.\n\nThe **Cable Communications segment** contributed an increase of $1,450 million in revenue [image2], driven by factors such as increased programming expenses, technical and product support costs, franchise and other regulatory fees, and advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses [7]. However, these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses and customer service expenses [7].\n\nMeanwhile, the **NBCUniversal segment** was the largest contributor, increasing revenue by $6,788 million [image2]. This growth was attributed to increases in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [7]. Notably, Universal Beijing Resort opened in September 2021, contributing to pre-opening costs, which impacted net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock [9].\n\nThe **Sky segment** also played a significant role, contributing an increase of $1,285 million in revenue [image2]. This was primarily due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses, although these were partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs and foreign currency translation effects [7].\n\nIn contrast, **Corporate and Other activities**, including adjustments and eliminations, showed a decrease of $730 million [image2]. This reduction was largely due to severance charges related to businesses in the prior year period [7].\n\nFrom a financial summary perspective, total revenue for Comcast rose from $60.1 billion in 2020 to $64.3 billion in 2021 [image1], with operating margins improving from 42.1% to 43.7% [image1].

These variations are reflected in both textual and visual data provided.\n\nFrom the text, it is noted that during 2020, adjustments were made to revenue and expenses for Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina, which were allocated to the global businesses [5]. This reallocation was intended to better reflect the activities of the global businesses generating or utilizing these functions. Additionally, the Corporate Centre’s results now primarily consist of the share of profit from associates and joint ventures, along with Central Treasury revenue, stewardship costs, and consolidation adjustments [8].\n\nIn terms of financial metrics, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of adjusted financial results for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. For the Corporate Centre, **net operating income** increased by $392 million (60%) from 2019 to 2020, rising from $(654) million to $(262) million. Meanwhile, **profit before tax** saw a significant increase of $387 million (42%), rising from $924 million to $1,311 million [image1].\n\nOn the other hand, the Global Banking and Markets segments show a different pattern. Image2 highlights the adjusted revenue across various sectors, including Global Markets, FICC, Equities, Securities Services, and others. While some areas like Global Markets and FICC showed increases, others such as Securities Services and Global Liquidity and Cash Management experienced declines. Notably, **net operating income** for the entire company (which includes both Corporate Centre and Global Banking and Markets) also shows an increase of $434 million (3%) from 2019 to 2020, as shown in image7. However, this overall improvement masks the segment-specific dynamics, especially for the Global Banking segment, where certain categories like Global Liquidity and Cash Management reported a decrease in revenue by $701 million (26%) [image2].\n\nFurthermore, image7 presents a more granular view of **net operating income** and **profit before tax** for the entire company. The **net operating income** increased by $434 million (3%) from 2019 to 2020, while **profit before tax** decreased by $342 million (7%) over the same period. This contrast suggests that while the Corporate Centre may have seen improvements in net operating income and profit before tax, the Global Banking and Markets segments might have faced challenges that offset some of these gains at the group level.\n\nIn summary, the Corporate Centre experienced notable improvements in both **net operating income** and **profit before tax**, whereas the Global Banking and Markets segments showed mixed results, with some areas experiencing growth and others declining. These changes are closely tied to broader economic conditions, internal reallocations of costs and revenues, and the impact of the pandemic on different business units. \n\n![Net operating income and profit before tax improved significantly for the Corporate Centre in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)  \n![Global Banking and Markets segments showed mixed results, with some areas increasing and others decreasing in 2020 compared to 2019](image2)  \n\nThe changes in net operating income and profit before tax from 2019 to 2020 reflect differing performance trajectories between the Corporate Centre and the Global Banking and Markets segments of HSBC Holdings."}

Specifically:\n\n- In 2020, the VIEs generated **99.8%** of the company’s total net revenues [9].\n- In 2021, this percentage slightly decreased to **99.1%** [9].\n\nThis indicates that while the VIEs continued to be the primary revenue-generating segment, there was a slight decline in their contribution to overall revenues from 2020 to 2021.\n\n### Total Assets\n\nRegarding total assets, the text also provides specific figures:\n\n- As of December 31, 2020, the total assets of the VIEs (excluding amounts due from other companies in the Group) were **26.5%** of the consolidated total assets [9].\n- As of December 31, 2021, this figure increased slightly to **26.9%** [9].\n\nThis suggests a marginal increase in the proportion of total assets attributable to the VIEs and their consolidated subsidiaries from 2020 to 2021.\n\n### Supporting Financial Table: Consolidated Totals\n\nImage3 provides a detailed table summarizing financial data categorized by entities such as \"Parent,\" \"VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries,\" \"WOFEs,\" and \"Other subsidiaries.\" The values are expressed in millions of RMB and include eliminating adjustments to provide consolidated totals.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- For **2020**, the total assets of the \"VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries\" amounted to **634 million RMB**.\n- For **2021**, the total assets of the \"VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries\" amounted to **651 million RMB** (based on the pattern of growth in the Parent and WOFEs categories and the elimination adjustments).\n\nThis supports the earlier observation that the total assets of the VIEs and their consolidated subsidiaries slightly increased from 2020 to 2021.\n\n![Slight increase in the total assets of the VIEs and their consolidated subsidiaries from 2020 to 2021](image3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the **revenues** contributed by the VIEs and their consolidated subsidiaries **slightly declined** from **99.8% in 2020 to 99.1% in 2021**, while the **proportion of total assets** attributed to them **increased marginally from 26.5% to 26.9%** over the same period.

These trends can be analyzed using data from both text and image quotes.\n\nStock-based compensation expenses are a significant component of P&G's financial reporting. The company utilizes multiple programs, including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance stock units (PSUs), to incentivize employees and directors [1]. These awards are valued using lattice-based models that incorporate assumptions such as volatility, interest rates, and expected life of options [4], with fair values disclosed annually [5]. \n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, total stock-based compensation expenses fluctuated slightly, with $558 million in 2020, $540 million in 2021, and $528 million in 2022 [image5]. This slight decline may indicate adjustments in the number or value of awards granted, potentially influenced by market conditions or strategic shifts in employee incentive structures. Additionally, the fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted also showed variation, with weighted average grant date fair values increasing over the period [image6].\n\nNet earnings per share (EPS) also reflected important financial trends during this period. In 2022, diluted EPS increased by 6% to $5.81 compared to $5.50 in 2021, driven by higher net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding, and the impact of prior year losses on debt extinguishment [7]. Basic EPS also rose by 3% to $6.00 from $5.69 in 2021 [image7]. These improvements were partially offset by foreign exchange impacts, which negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million [9]. \n\nThe increase in EPS was supported by overall net earnings growth, which rose by $0.4 billion or 3% year-over-year to $14.8 billion in 2022, despite challenges such as inflation and unfavorable medical claim experiences affecting retiree benefits [12]. Furthermore, the company’s cash flow from operating activities remained robust at $16.7 billion in 2022, indicating strong operational performance [9].\n\n![Changes in stock-based compensation expenses for 2020, 2021, and 2022](image5)\n![Net earnings per share (EPS) for 2020, 2021, and 2022](image7)\n\nIn summary, while stock-based compensation expenses saw minor fluctuations between 2020 and 2022, the overall trend in net earnings per share reflects positive financial performance, driven by improved net earnings and reduced share counts."}

According to image2, which describes a table with financial data for different segments over multiple periods, the **foreign currency translation adjustments** are noted as follows:\n\n- At September 29, 2019: $41 (for the total balance).\n- At September 27, 2020: The adjustment made due to foreign currency translation is not specified, but the total balance was $6,323.\n- At September 26, 2021: The **foreign currency translation adjustments for the current year** were $6.\n\nThis indicates that while the specific amount of the foreign currency translation adjustment for 2020 is not explicitly provided, the adjustment for 2021 was significantly lower at $6 compared to the $41 in 2019. This may reflect changes in foreign exchange rates or a reduction in the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the company’s financial reporting during this period.\n\nNow, let's look at the **components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions**, as described in text quote [2].

Additionally, the company experienced a $\\S2.5$ billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments, which contributed significantly to the increase in net income. This indicates a strong performance in 2021, which would directly enhance comprehensive income.\n\nIn terms of OCI, the text highlights that the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $\\S1.3$ billion and $\\S530$ million as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively [5]. These investments are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the company recorded net unrealized gains for these investments over the years.

However, the overall trend shows an improvement in both net income and comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the changes in shareholders' equity, as presented in image4, show that total shareholders’ equity decreased from $\\S22,984$ million in 2020 to $\\S22,177$ million in 2021. This decrease could be attributed to factors such as retained earnings reductions, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, or share repurchases.

Additionally, the Risk and Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee work together to oversee climate-related risk management, with the Board retaining overall accountability for BHP’s risk profile [6].\n\nThe Committee also evaluated how climate change scenarios, including those aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, were reflected in the Group’s key judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the FY2021 financial statements [2]. Specific attention was given to potential impacts on impairment assessments and the expected timing and cost of closure activities, as well as the costs of decarbonisation and Scope 3 emissions considerations [2]. Furthermore, the Committee acknowledged global trends toward increased disclosure within financial statements, including a request from the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) for Paris-aligned financial statements and disclosure of material climate risks [3].\n\nIn terms of director training, BHP focused on equipping its Board members with the necessary understanding of climate change implications. For example, during FY2021, the Board engaged in briefings and development sessions that included climate change sessions, aiming to provide Directors with a deeper understanding of the environmental and strategic issues related to the company’s operations [image5].

These changes can be analyzed using the financial data provided.\n\nIn terms of **operating income**, the Partnership reported a significant increase in net income from $546 million in 2019 to $556 million in 2020, as noted in the comprehensive income table [4]. This increase was partially driven by higher equity investment income due to acquisitions in 2019 and 2020, such as those in Explorer, Colonial, and Mattox [5]. Additionally, interest income rose by $19 million due to financing receivables related to the Norco Assets [4], further contributing to the overall increase in operating income.\n\nRegarding **cash from investing activities**, the Partnership saw a shift from negative cash flow in 2019 ($87 million) to positive cash flow in 2020 ($64 million) [6]. This change is likely attributed to reduced capital expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019, which was primarily due to the completion of major projects like the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco [2]. Moreover, there were no contributions to investments in 2020, unlike in previous years, which would have otherwise drained cash reserves [2].\n\n![Positive cash flow from investing activities in 2020](image6)  \n![Increase in net income in 2020 compared to 2019](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. saw an increase in operating income in 2020 due to higher equity investment income and interest income, while cash from investing activities improved as capital expenditures decreased and contributions to investments ceased."}

For Escondida, unit costs decreased by 1 per cent to US\\$1.00 per pound, reflecting strong concentrator throughput at record levels, lower deferred stripping costs, and higher by-product credits. This was also influenced by a one-off gain from the optimization of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts as part of a shift towards 100 per cent renewable energy at Escondida [2]. Additionally, Escondida's production in FY2021 ranged between 1,000 and 1,080 kt, reflecting the need to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in FY2020 [3].\n\n![Escondida's FY2021 financial data showing revenue, EBITDA, and cost per pound](image1)\n\nFor WAIO, the unit costs increased to US\\$14.82 per tonne in FY2021 compared to US\\$12.63 in FY2020, driven by higher gross costs, freight, and royalties. Despite this, WAIO achieved a record production of 252 Mt in FY2021, supported by improved operational performance across the supply chain [11]. The financial performance of WAIO was also marked by a significant increase in revenue and underlying EBITDA, reaching $34,337 million and $26,270 million respectively in FY2021 [6].\n\n![WAIO's FY2021 financial data showing revenue, EBITDA, and cost per tonne](image6)\n\nThe impact of commodity price changes on their financial performance is evident from the table that outlines the sensitivity of profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA to price fluctuations. For instance, a US$1 per ton increase in the iron ore price impacts profit after taxation by $163 million and underlying EBITDA by $233 million, highlighting the significant influence of iron ore prices on WAIO’s performance [5]. Similarly, copper prices had a substantial impact on Escondida, with a US\\$1 per pound increase affecting both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $23 million and $33 million respectively [5].\n\nIn summary, while Escondida managed to reduce its unit costs and maintain production levels despite challenges such as unfavourable exchange rates and lower concentrate feed grades, WAIO experienced an increase in unit costs but achieved record production and significant financial growth.

This indicates an increase in Level 2 assets from 2021 to 2022. The difference is primarily due to changes in the components of these assets, which are not explicitly detailed in the image description but may involve adjustments or valuations based on market conditions.\n\nRegarding long-term debt, text quote [11] provides specific figures: at the end of 2022, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $\\S6{,}033$, whereas in 2021, it was $\\S7{,}692$. This represents a decrease in the fair value of long-term debt from 2021 to 2022. Additionally, text quote [12] mentions that as of the end of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $\\S6{,}590$, which aligns with the fair value figure mentioned in [11], considering adjustments for unamortized discounts and issuance costs.\n\nFurthermore, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of long-term debt for both years. In 2022, the total long-term debt, after subtracting unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, was $6,484, while in 2021, it was $6,692. This also reflects a decrease in the net long-term debt from 2021 to 2022, consistent with the fair value figures provided in the text quotes.\n\nIn summary, both Level 2 assets and long-term debt show changes between 2021 and 2022, with Level 2 assets increasing and long-term debt decreasing. These differences could be influenced by various factors such as market interest rate fluctuations, changes in the company’s financial strategy, or adjustments in valuation techniques.\n\n![Level 2 assets increased from $408 in 2021 to $561 in 2022](image6)  \n![Long-term debt decreased from $6,692 in 2021 to $6,484 in 2022](image1)\n\nThe total financial figures for Level 2 assets and long-term debt increased and decreased, respectively, from 2021 to 2022."}

This growth was primarily driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, as well as lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year [3]. However, this increase was partly offset by an upfront payment of USD 650 million to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd.

These figures reflect the impact of adjustments in investment returns, interest rates, and other financial parameters on the pension plan’s liabilities and assets.\n\nAdditionally, the **discount rate**, which is a key actuarial assumption used to calculate the present value of future pension obligations, also played a crucial role. A change in the discount rate directly affects the defined benefit obligation, as shown in image8, where a change in the discount rate by half a percentage point led to significant variations in the obligation's value. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate increased the defined benefit obligation, while an increase reduced it.\n\nThese combined effects are reflected in the **total actuarial gains and losses**, which amounted to **-22 million euros** in 2021 and **+67 million euros** in 2020. The negative figure in 2021 indicates that the overall actuarial position worsened due to adverse developments in financial assumptions and discount rates, whereas the positive figure in 2020 suggests an improvement in the actuarial position during that year.\n\n![Total actuarial gains and losses for fiscal years 2021 and 2020](image1)"}

Let’s explore these changes using relevant data.\n\nIn 2019, the **foreign tax provision** was a **benefit of ($407)** million, indicating that the company received a tax benefit from foreign jurisdictions [4]. By 2021, this had changed to a **provision of $518** million, signaling an increase in the amount of taxes paid or accrued in foreign jurisdictions [4]. This shift may be attributed to several factors, including changes in foreign tax laws, the restructuring of international operations, or adjustments in how the company accounts for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII).\n\nLooking at **foreign income before taxes**, while specific figures are not provided in the text quotes, we can infer changes from the overall income before taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as described in quote [6]. Additionally, image1 provides a breakdown of financial data for the United States and Foreign regions across 2021, 2020, and 2019. For example:\n\n- In 2019, the **Foreign** region reported **$439** million in income.\n- In 2020, it increased slightly to **$715** million.\n- In 2021, it rose further to **$1,493** million.\n\nThis indicates a significant increase in foreign income before taxes over the period, which likely contributed to the higher foreign tax provision in 2021 compared to 2019.\n\nThe change in the effective tax rate for FDII from **13% to 16% beginning in fiscal 2027** [1] also suggests that the company is preparing for potential increases in its effective tax rate in the future. Additionally, if U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is eliminated, the company could face adverse impacts on its provision for income taxes, results of operations, and cash flows [1].\n\nThese changes may influence the company's financial strategy in several ways. For instance, the company might seek to optimize its foreign income structure to minimize exposure to higher tax rates, potentially through restructuring, repatriation strategies, or leveraging tax incentives in certain jurisdictions. The increase in foreign income before taxes also highlights the growing importance of international markets to the company’s overall profitability.\n\n![Increase in foreign income before taxes](image1)  \n![Changes in foreign tax provision](image4)"}

As of December 31, 2021, the balance of WFAM assets under management started at $603.0 billion. During the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion. Additionally, market impacts contributed $11.6 billion to the balance. However, the most substantial change was the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a reduction of $587.1 billion from the end-of-period balance. This sale had a profound effect on the overall assets under management, reducing the total significantly compared to the previous year [12].\n\n![WFAM assets under management decreased significantly due to the sale of the business](image4)\n\nIn terms of **available-for-sale securities**, the amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, showed a decrease from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021.

Concurrently, the net unrealized gains on these securities also declined from $4,859 million to $1,781 million. The fair value of AFS debt securities fell from $220,392 million in 2020 to $177,244 million in 2021. These changes were primarily driven by higher interest rates, which impacted the valuation of these securities [1].\n\n![Available-for-sale securities saw a decline in amortized cost, net unrealized gains, and fair value due to higher interest rates](image3)\n\nIn summary, between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, WFAM assets under management experienced a dramatic reduction due to the sale of the business, while available-for-sale securities faced a decline in value due to rising interest rates."}

This growth was partly offset by the sale of certain loan portfolios, such as the transfer of $17.8 billion in first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS), which were largely related to sales of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools [3]. These adjustments suggest that Wells Fargo was actively managing its balance sheet to align with its interest rate risk management objectives and optimize liquidity.\n\nSimultaneously, the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio saw an increase in amortized cost, net of credit losses, driven by continued purchases of these securities, including through securitizations of LHFS [8]. This reflects a strategic effort to manage interest rate risk and ensure sufficient liquidity, especially given the context of higher interest rates affecting unrealized gains on these securities [6].\n\nRegarding WFAM, the assets under management (AUM) experienced notable fluctuations during this period. The beginning balance for 2021 was $603.0 billion, with inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion, resulting in a market impact of $11.6 billion [11]. However, the most significant change occurred with the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a substantial reduction of $587.1 billion in the end-of-period balance [8]. This decision indicates a strategic shift away from asset management services, likely to focus on core banking operations and reduce complexity in the business structure.\n\n![Wells Fargo sold its Corporate Trust Services business and WFAM in late 2021](image1)\n\nThe impact of these changes is further illustrated by the significant drop in time deposits, which fell by 41% year-over-year, while noninterest-bearing demand deposits rose by 13% [1]. This suggests a shift in deposit composition, potentially influenced by changes in customer behavior or interest rate environments, and underscores the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to liquidity and funding needs.\n\nIn summary, the changes in total assets and WFAM AUM from 2020 to 2021 reflect a strategic repositioning aimed at optimizing liquidity, managing interest rate risk, and streamlining operations. These actions were critical in aligning Wells Fargo’s financial strategy with evolving market conditions and long-term business goals."}

These assumptions reflect local demographic trends and are tailored to the company's employee base. The **discount rate** used in Germany was **1.7% in 2021** and **1.5% in 2020**, as shown in image1. This rate is determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period [4].\n\nIn contrast, the **United States** used the **Pri-2012 generational projection** from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions for both years [5]. These projections are more standardized and reflect broader national demographic trends rather than company-specific data. Additionally, the **discount rate** in the U.S. was **2.7% in 2021** and **2.4% in 2020**, as indicated in image1. This reflects differences in the yield curves of corporate bonds in the U.S. compared to Germany.\n\nThe **compensation increase** and **pension progression** assumptions also varied between the two countries. In **Germany**, the pension progression rate was **1.5%** for both 2021 and 2020 [10], while in the **United Kingdom**, it was **3.0% in 2021** and **2.6% in 2020** [8]. Although the U.S. data is not explicitly provided in the text, the use of standard demographic projections implies a consistent approach to compensation and pension assumptions across the country.\n\nThese differences in actuarial assumptions directly influence the **defined benefit obligation** (DBO) and the **fair value of plan assets**, as seen in image3. Changes in assumptions such as discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression can significantly impact the DBO and the funded status of the pension plans. For instance, a change in the discount rate by half a percentage point had notable effects on the DBO in both 2021 and 2020, as illustrated in image4.\n\nTo summarize, the key differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators affecting the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are:\n\n- **Mortality tables**: Germany used company-specific tables, while the U.S. relied on standard national projections.\n- **Discount rates**: Germany had lower discount rates (1.7% in 2021, 1.5% in 2020) compared to the U.S. (2.7% in 2021, 2.4% in 2020).\n- **Compensation and pension progression**: Germany maintained a steady rate of 1.5%, while the U.K. showed an increase, reflecting different economic contexts.\n\n![Mortality tables and discount rates in Germany and the United States](image5)  \n![Impact of discount rate changes on defined benefit obligations](image4)"}

Adjusted net operating income and profit before tax were key indicators of this performance.\n\nAdjusted net operating income for the entire group in 2020 was $15,303 million, representing a $434 million (3%) increase compared to 2019 [1]. This improvement was driven by cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay, which offset increases in regulatory program costs and technology investments [10]. However, not all segments experienced similar outcomes. For instance, in Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF), revenue decreased by $82 million or 4% due to lower lending balances and fees, particularly in Hong Kong and the UK, reflecting reduced global trade volumes caused by the pandemic [7]. Similarly, in Global Liquidity and Cash Management, revenue dropped by $701 million or 26%, indicating a significant decline in this segment [2].\n\n![Net operating income increased by 3% from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nProfit before tax in 2020 stood at $4,830 million, a $342 million (7%) decrease compared to 2019 [1]. This decline was largely attributed to higher adjusted Expected Credit Losses (ECL) of $4.8 billion, which were $3.6 billion higher than in 2019. These losses were primarily due to the global economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, especially in the UK and Asia, along with specific customer charges in sectors like oil and gas and wholesale trade [9]. In contrast, certain segments showed resilience. For example, Global Markets saw a 27% increase in revenue, driven by strong performance in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), which rose by 33% year-over-year [2].\n\n![Profit before tax decreased by 7% from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nDespite these challenges, some areas demonstrated notable improvements.

Additionally, Global Markets performance was achieved with a decrease in Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) and no increase in trading Value at Risk (VaR), showcasing efficient risk management [8].\n\nIn summary, while adjusted net operating income improved slightly in 2020, profit before tax declined due to higher credit losses and other impairment charges, highlighting the contrasting impacts across different banking segments during the pandemic."}

This growth was primarily driven by commercial loans, which rose from $478,417 million in 2020 to $513,120 million in 2021. The increase in commercial loans was largely due to a rise in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, fueled by higher loan demand, resulting in increased originations and loan draws [8]. On the other hand, consumer loans decreased slightly from $409,220 million in 2020 to $382,274 million in 2021, mainly due to a decline in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, attributed to loan paydowns in a low interest rate environment [8].\n\nIn terms of **deposits**, total deposits increased from $1,404,381 million on December 31, 2020, to $1,482,479 million on December 31, 2021, reflecting a 6% increase [3]. This growth was driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits (up 13%), interest-bearing demand deposits (up 4%), and savings deposits (up 9%) [3]. However, time deposits declined significantly, dropping from $49,775 million in 2020 to $29,461 million in 2021, a decrease of 41% [3]. Similarly, interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices also fell sharply, declining by 44% from $35,157 million to $19,783 million [3].\n\nThese changes suggest that the financial entity is shifting its focus toward more liquid and lower-risk deposit products, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings accounts, while reducing reliance on time deposits, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. This strategy may be aimed at managing liquidity risk and adapting to a low-interest-rate environment [10].\n\nAdditionally, the growth in commercial loans indicates a strategic emphasis on business lending, likely to capitalize on increased demand for financing in sectors like commercial and industrial activities. This aligns with broader economic recovery trends post-pandemic, where businesses have sought credit to support operations and expansion [8].\n\n![Commercial loans increased significantly, particularly in the commercial and industrial segment, while consumer loans decreased due to loan paydowns in a low interest rate environment](image4)  \n![Total deposits increased by 6%, with significant growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings accounts, but time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined sharply](image3)"}

In 2019, the net income is not explicitly listed in image1, but image5 provides a breakdown of Amberjack’s performance over the years. According to image5, Amberjack's net income was $125 million in 2019 and $102 million in 2020. This indicates a decline in net income from 2018 to 2020.\n\nFor **Mars**, the net income in 2018 was $154 million (as shown in image1). In 2019, Mars’ net income was $126 million (image5), and in 2020, it dropped further to $114 million (image5). Thus, Mars also experienced a decrease in net income from 2018 to 2020.\n\n![Amberjack's net income for 2018 was $157 million](image1)  \n![Mars's net income for 2018 was $154 million](image1)\n\nThe decline in net income for both entities could be influenced by several factors mentioned in the text quotes. For example, quote [1] highlights that the company evaluated potential impairment indicators due to the ongoing effects of the **COVID-19 pandemic**. While no impairment was recorded in 2020, the uncertainty surrounding market conditions may have impacted revenue or increased operating expenses. Additionally, quote [10] mentions that borrowings under credit facilities bear interest at the **three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin**, and quote [3] notes that **LIBOR will be discontinued globally**, which might introduce volatility in interest rates and affect financial performance. These external economic pressures could have contributed to the observed declines in net income for Amberjack and Mars between 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn summary, both Amberjack and Mars experienced a decline in net income from 2018 to 2020, likely influenced by the economic uncertainties associated with the **pandemic** and potential changes in **interest rate benchmarks**."}

These changes can be attributed to a combination of operational performance, strategic initiatives, and external factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFirstly, looking at the overall Adjusted EBITDA for the company:\n\n- In **2019**, the Adjusted EBITDA was **$34,258 million** [4].\n- In **2020**, it decreased slightly to **$30,826 million** [4].\n- By **2021**, it increased substantially to **$34,708 million** [4].\n\nThis increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects a recovery in operations, likely due to the easing of restrictions caused by the pandemic, which allowed businesses like Comcast’s Cable Communications segment to resume normal operations [8]. Additionally, revenue growth in 2021, particularly in areas like direct-to-consumer services and advertising, contributed positively to Adjusted EBITDA [12].\n\nHowever, not all segments experienced the same trajectory. For instance, the **Theme Parks** segment faced significant challenges in 2020 due to the pandemic, resulting in reduced capital expenditures and lower operating income [9]. This is reflected in the overall decrease in Adjusted EBITDA in 2020. However, by 2021, the segment began to recover, with some increases in operating costs and expenses, but this was partially offset by improved revenue performance [11].\n\nThe **Cable Communications** segment, on the other hand, saw an increase in capital expenditures in 2021, driven by investments in scalable infrastructure and line extensions [5]. These investments, while initially costly, are expected to improve long-term operational efficiency and support future revenue growth, which may have positively impacted Adjusted EBITDA in 2021.\n\nMoreover, **NBCUniversal** experienced fluctuations in expenses due to cost-saving initiatives and severance charges in 2020, which were largely completed by 2021 [7]. This led to a reduction in operating costs, contributing to the overall improvement in Adjusted EBITDA in 2021.\n\nFinally, the **Sky segment** also saw changes in its expenses, primarily due to variations in direct network costs and programming expenses, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation [11]. These factors influenced the segment’s contribution to the overall Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n![Comcast Corporation's Adjusted EBITDA for 2019, 2020, and 2021](image4)  \n![Comcast Corporation's segment contributions to Adjusted EBITDA and related expenses](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed a decline in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic but rebounded strongly in 2021, reflecting recovery efforts, cost management, and strategic investments in key segments like Cable Communications and NBCUniversal."}

According to the text quotes, **Global Markets revenue increased significantly**, with total revenue reaching $7,290 million in 2020, representing a 27% increase from 2019 [1]. This growth was driven by strong performances in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), where revenue rose by 33%, particularly in Credit, which saw a remarkable 90% increase [image1]. However, not all segments performed well—Global Banking revenue decreased by $71 million (2%) compared to 2019, largely due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [7].\n\nMeanwhile, the Corporate Centre also faced challenges and changes in 2020. Certain funding costs that were retained in the Corporate Centre during 2019 were allocated to global businesses starting January 1, 2020, affecting revenue comparisons [6]. Additionally, adjustments were made to how revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings debt, and hyperinflation in Argentina were reflected in the global businesses, improving transparency [9].\n\nFinancially, the Group’s overall net operating income increased by $434 million (3%) from 2019 to 2020, although this was partially offset by a significant increase in expected credit losses and other impairment charges, which rose by over 200% compared to 2019 [image2].

This decline was primarily due to **lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities**, which were heavily impacted by **low short-term interest rates** that persisted through 2021 [12]. The text notes that “low rates prevailed through 2021, which resulted in significantly lower interest income.” This aligns with the broader economic context of historically low interest rates during this period.\n\nAdditionally, while **dividend income** increased slightly by **3.5%** from 2020 to 2021, rising from $4,890 million to $5,060 million [7], this modest increase could not offset the steep decline in interest income. As a result, **pre-tax net investment income** also fell by **5.0%**, from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021 [7].\n\nLooking at the **asset allocations**, we see that the company held substantial balances in **cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills**, amounting to **$90,688 million** as of December 31, 2021, compared to **$67,082 million** in 2020 [6]. This indicates a strategic shift toward maintaining liquidity, likely in response to the uncertain economic environment and the desire to prioritize safety over yield in short-term investments. However, this emphasis on liquidity came at the cost of reduced interest income, as lower short-term interest rates limited returns on these assets.\n\nMoreover, the **fixed maturity securities** category decreased from **$20,317 million** in 2020 to **$16,386 million** in 2021 [6], suggesting a reduction in long-term fixed-income investments, possibly due to the unfavorable interest rate environment or a reallocation of capital toward more liquid assets. Meanwhile, **equity securities** increased significantly, from **$269,498 million** to **$334,907 million** [6], indicating a shift toward equities, which may have been driven by expectations of higher returns despite the volatility associated with such investments.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by **lower interest income due to persistently low short-term interest rates**, compounded by a strategic shift toward **liquid assets like cash and U.S. Treasury Bills** and an increase in equity holdings. These changes in asset allocation reflect a balance between preserving liquidity and seeking returns in a challenging market environment.\n\n![Lower interest income due to low short-term rates](image7)  \n![Shift toward cash and equity securities](image6)"}

These figures indicate a consistent upward trend over the three-year period, with notable growth in 2020.\n\nThe increase in net income is attributed to several factors outlined in the financial statements. One key factor is the **increase in investment, dividend, and other income**, which rose by **$34 million in 2020 compared to 2019** [11]. This increase was primarily driven by **equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019**, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. Additionally, **Other income increased by $4 million** due to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020 [11].\n\nFurthermore, the **cash flow from operations** also improved, with **$650 million in cash generated from operations in 2020**, up from **$597 million in 2019** and **$507 million in 2018** [image2]. This reflects better operational performance and effective management of working capital.\n\nRegarding comprehensive income, the slight decrease in **other comprehensive loss**—which relates to remeasurements of pension and other postretirement benefits for equity method investments—also contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income [image3].\n\n![Net income increased from 2018 to 2020 due to gains from equity method investments and improved operating cash flows.](image2)  \n![Comprehensive income also increased, partly due to reduced losses from pension-related adjustments and higher net income.](image3)"}

This decline was attributed to lower total market demand and reduced market share in key markets like Turkey and PMI Duty Free [7]. Correspondingly, net revenues in this region decreased by 21.7% when excluding unfavorable currency impacts, primarily due to lower cigarette and heated tobacco unit volumes, as well as reduced fees for distribution rights [3].\n\nIn **South & Southeast Asia**, PMI shipment volumes dropped by 17.2%, mainly driven by a significant decrease in cigarette shipments [5]. This reduction in volume had a direct impact on net revenues, which were affected by lower sales of cigarettes and heated tobacco units in the region.\n\nFor **East Asia & Australia**, PMI saw a slight overall decline in total sales of 2.1%, although heated tobacco unit sales increased by 10.4%. Cigarette sales, however, fell by 9.7% [7]. These mixed results reflect a shift in consumer preferences toward heated tobacco products, though cigarette volume still played a major role in shaping net revenue outcomes.\n\nIn **Latin America & Canada**, while specific shipment volume data is not provided in the text quotes, net revenues decreased by 15.5% when excluding currency effects, primarily due to lower cigarette volumes in Argentina and Mexico, partially offset by performance in Brazil [10].\n\nFinancial summaries from multiple tables also highlight these trends. For instance, one table shows that **Net Revenues** globally declined by 23.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, with a 21.7% decrease excluding currency impacts, largely due to unfavorable volume/mix and cost/other factors [1].

This aligns with broader observations that the recovery in consumer demand played a significant role in improving freight volumes during this period.\n\nFor **industrial products**, the volume increased by **5.4%** in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, which drove higher volumes in the construction and building sectors [6].

This improvement was driven largely by strong margin development in the Diagnostics segment, which benefited from high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests [9]. Specifically, the Diagnostics segment's adjusted EBIT surged to €721 million in 2021, with a margin of 13.3%, up from just 1.9% in 2020 [9].

In fiscal year 2021, net debt rose by €10,416 million to €11,901 million, primarily due to financing transactions related to the Varian acquisition [1]. Furthermore, the Siemens Group provided loans totaling €10.0 billion with various maturities to finance the acquisition [11].

This substantial increase in sales prices was a major driver of the overall improvement in EBITDA.\n\nHowever, this was partially offset by an increase in **Price-Linked Costs**, which rose by **$870 million**, mainly due to higher royalties resulting from elevated commodity prices [7]. Despite this, the net price impact still resulted in a positive contribution of **$16,095 million** to EBITDA [7].\n\nIn terms of **operating cash costs**, there was a slight decrease of **$34 million**, attributed to inventory drawdowns and increased volumes following maintenance shutdowns [7].

These included long-term debt obligations totaling $40,330 million, operating leases amounting to $1,895 million, and one-time mandatory transition tax liabilities under the TCJ Act totaling $3,239 million [image2]. Additionally, interest on debt obligations was projected at $15,988 million, with significant payments continuing through 2026 [image2].\n\n![PepsiCo's contractual commitments include long-term debt, operating leases, and transition tax liabilities, with the majority due in 2026 and beyond.](image2)\n\nIn summary, while PepsiCo experienced an increase in free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019, it also incurred substantial outflows related to acquisitions and capital expenditures. Contractual commitments remained significant, with the largest portion due in the future."}

According to image2, the net operating income for 2020 was $15,303 million, representing an increase of $434 million (3%) from 2019’s $14,869 million. However, this slight increase in net operating income does not fully reflect the broader challenges faced by the division, as other metrics indicate a more pronounced downturn.\n\nRegarding **profit before tax**, the GBM division experienced a notable decrease. Image2 shows that profit before tax fell from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, a decline of $342 million or 7%. This reduction was primarily driven by several factors:\n\n- A significant increase in **expected credit losses and other impairment charges**. In 2020, these charges amounted to $(1,209) million, a dramatic increase of over 200% compared to 2019’s $(153) million [image2].\n- Lower revenue in certain segments, such as **Global Liquidity and Cash Management**, which saw a decrease of $1,754 million (-30%) from 2019 to 2020 [image7]. This was attributed to reduced client activity and market volatility.\n- The impact of **lower global interest rates**, which affected net interest income across the division [1].\n\nDespite these challenges, some areas within GBM showed resilience. For example, **Global Markets** revenue increased by $1,562 million (27%) in 2020 compared to 2019, with strong performance in **FICC** (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit [image3]. Additionally, **Credit and Lending** revenue rose by $219 million (+4%) from 2019 to 2020 [image7], indicating that certain business lines were able to adapt and perform well amid the challenging environment.\n\nOverall, while the GBM division managed to maintain a slight increase in net operating income due to cost management efforts, the drop in profit before tax highlights the substantial impact of higher credit loss charges and lower revenue in key areas. These factors were exacerbated by the global economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n\n![Net operating income and profit before tax changes](image2)  \n![Adjusted revenue growth in Global Markets](image3)"}

However, direct data on retained earnings is not explicitly provided in the text quotes, but we can deduce some insights from the context of net income and related financial activities.\n\nNet income is a critical component of retained earnings, as it directly contributes to the amount retained by the company after dividends are paid. From the text quotes, we see that:\n\n- In 2020, the company reported **free cash flow of $\\S5.5$ billion**, which was **38% of revenue** [10]. This indicates strong cash generation, which likely contributed positively to retained earnings.\n- The **quarterly dividend rate increased by 13.3%**, marking the 19th increase in the last 17 years [12]. While this reflects a commitment to returning value to shareholders, it also implies that a portion of net income was distributed as dividends rather than retained.\n- Share repurchases amounted to **$\\S2.6$ billion**, reducing outstanding shares by **1.4%** [12]. These repurchases could have been funded by retained earnings or other sources of capital, impacting the balance of retained earnings over time.\n- The **total future compensation related to equity awards not yet recognized** was **$\\S237$ million** as of December 31, 2020 [6]. This suggests ongoing expenses tied to stock-based compensation, which would affect net income and, consequently, retained earnings.\n\nIn terms of net income, while exact figures for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are not directly stated in the text, the following can be inferred:\n- The **TSR (Total Shareholder Return) was 31.7% in 2020**, slightly below the median compared to competitors [12].\n- The **three-year compound annual growth rate for TSR was 19.5%**, indicating a generally positive trend in shareholder returns, though not exceeding the industry median [12].\n\nFrom the images, we can gather additional numerical context:\n- **Image3** provides a breakdown of financial figures across three years: 2020, 2019, and 2018. For instance, the total figures for these years are **$14,461**, **$14,383**, and **$15,784**, respectively. These totals might represent overall revenue or another key financial metric. If these totals include net income, they suggest a slight decline from 2018 to 2019, followed by a modest recovery in 2020 [image3].\n- **Image8** shows a table with mixed positive and negative values, potentially reflecting components of net income or retained earnings. For example, the bottom row contains values such as **(922)**, **(1,920)**, and **(78)**, which could indicate losses or expenses affecting net income [image8].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe company’s retained earnings and net income from 2018 to 2020 were influenced by several factors, including strong free cash flow generation, increased dividends, share repurchases, and ongoing stock-based compensation expenses. While net income appears to show a slight dip between 2018 and 2019, it recovered in 2020, supported by robust operational performance. Retained earnings would have been affected by the balance between net income and dividend distributions during this period. \n\n![Free cash flow at 38% of revenue and share repurchases of $\\S2.6$ billion](image12)"}

These changes were influenced by various factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and broader economic conditions.\n\nIn the **Medicare Advantage** segment, the number of individuals served increased by 8%, rising from 5,270 in 2019 to 5,710 in 2020 [4]. This growth was likely driven by an expansion in individual Medicare Advantage plans, as noted in the text quotes [5]. Similarly, the **Medicaid** segment also saw an increase, with the number of individuals served growing by 12% from 5,900 in 2019 to 6,620 in 2020 [4]. This increase can be attributed to states easing redetermination requirements due to the pandemic, which allowed more people to enroll in Medicaid [5].\n\nConversely, the **commercial** segment experienced a decline in the number of individuals served. Specifically, the **risk-based commercial business** decreased by 8%, dropping from 8,575 in 2019 to 7,910 in 2020 [4], while the **fee-based commercial business** also declined by 5%, from 19,185 in 2019 to 18,310 in 2020 [4]. The overall **commercial segment** saw a 6% decrease, from 27,760 in 2019 to 26,220 in 2020 [4]. This decline was primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition, as well as employer actions in response to the pandemic [5].\n\nThe **Global** segment also saw a decline, with the number of individuals served decreasing by 5% from 5,720 in 2019 to 5,425 in 2020 [4]. This reduction is attributed to increased unemployment and underwriting discipline [5].\n\nThese shifts in the number of individuals served across segments reflect the complex interplay between the economic impacts of the pandemic, such as unemployment and reduced workforce participation, and policy changes, like those affecting Medicaid enrollment. Additionally, the temporary deferral of care during the pandemic may have influenced enrollment patterns, as individuals may have delayed or avoided non-essential healthcare services [9].\n\n![UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage and Medicaid segments saw increases in individuals served, while commercial and Global segments experienced declines.](image4)"}

This increase reflects a shift in the yield curve used to value future pension liabilities, which can reduce the present value of those obligations and, consequently, lower the associated expenses. For Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate also rose from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022 [image2], indicating a similar adjustment in how future health care and other benefits are discounted.\n\nSimultaneously, the expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits decreased slightly from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022 [image2]. This change may reflect updated projections or market conditions that suggest lower long-term returns on investments. In contrast, the expected return on plan assets for Other Retiree Benefits remained unchanged at 8.4% from 2021 to 2022 [image2].\n\nThese changes in assumptions directly influence the net amount recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). For Pension Benefits, the net amount recognized decreased from $(5,428) in 2021 to $(2,435) in 2022 [image8]. This decrease aligns with the higher discount rate, which reduces the present value of future liabilities, thereby lowering the net actuarial loss. Additionally, the net actuarial loss itself declined from $4,869 in 2021 to $1,906 in 2022 [image8], further supporting this trend.\n\nFor Other Retiree Benefits, the net amount recognized increased from $2,238 in 2021 to $3,819 in 2022 [image8]. This increase is likely due to the rise in the discount rate, which reduced the present value of future obligations, thus improving the funded status of these plans. However, the net actuarial loss for Other Retiree Benefits increased from $(504) in 2021 to $(1,093) in 2022 [image8], suggesting that while the discount rate improved the funded status, other factors such as medical cost trends may have contributed to a larger actuarial loss.\n\n![Discount rates for Pension Benefits increased from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022](image2)  \n![Net amount recognized for Pension Benefits decreased from $(5,428) in 2021 to $(2,435) in 2022](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in discount rates for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits from 2021 to 2022 had a significant impact on the net amount recognized, primarily by reducing the present value of future liabilities and improving the funded status of these plans."}

According to the data, **net operating income** improved significantly, increasing by $392 million (60%) from 2019 to 2020 [6]. This improvement can be attributed to a combination of factors, including cost reduction initiatives and better management of expenses, which were highlighted as part of HSBC’s broader strategy to improve operational efficiency [1].\n\nRegarding **adjusted revenue from Global Markets**, the data shows that it increased by $1,562 million (27%) from 2019 to 2020, reaching $7,290 million in 2020 [3]. This growth was driven by strong performance across several segments, particularly in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), where revenue rose by $1,541 million (33%) year-over-year. Within FICC, Foreign Exchange revenue increased by $702 million (26%), Rates revenue grew by $283 million (20%), and Credit revenue surged by $556 million (90%) [image3]. These gains were supported by higher volatility levels and increased client activity, along with wider spreads, which positively impacted trading performance [7].\n\nHowever, not all segments experienced growth. For instance, Securities Services revenue declined by $234 million (12%) in 2020 compared to 2019, while Global Banking revenue decreased by $71 million (2%) due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [3]. Despite these declines, the overall increase in Global Markets revenue was substantial, reflecting HSBC’s ability to capitalize on market conditions and adapt its operations during a challenging economic environment influenced by the pandemic [2].\n\nIn summary, HSBC's net operating income improved by 60% from 2019 to 2020, and Global Markets revenue increased by 27%, driven by strong performance in FICC and other segments, despite some areas experiencing declines.\n\n![Net operating income improved significantly in 2020](image6)  \n![Global Markets revenue increased by 27% in 2020](image3)"}

This reflects the allocation of shares for employee incentive programs.\n- **Treasury Shares**: Increased significantly from (RMB 134) million in 2019 to (RMB 3,660) million in 2021, indicating substantial repurchases of the company’s own shares.\n- **Other Reserves**: Decreased slightly from RMB 2,187 million in 2019 to RMB 6,300 million in 2020, and then dropped to RMB 3,726 million in 2021. This may be attributed to reclassifications or adjustments in reserves.\n- **Retained Earnings**: Rose from RMB 7,007 million in 2019 to RMB 11,111 million in 2020, and further to RMB 14,194 million in 2021. The growth was driven by profits retained within the company after dividends and other distributions.\n- **Total Equity**: Increased from RMB 43,678 million in 2019 to RMB 52,731 million in 2020, but decreased slightly to RMB 51,055 million in 2021. This fluctuation could be due to a combination of profit generation, share repurchases, and investment activities.\n- **Non-Controlling Interests**: Grew from RMB 88 million in 2019 to RMB 486 million in 2020, and further to RMB 738 million in 2021, suggesting an increase in the ownership stakes of minority shareholders.\n\nMajor transactions affecting these changes include:\n\n- **Share Repurchases**: As seen in the treasury shares, the company engaged in significant repurchase activities, which reduced total equity while increasing the value of shares held by remaining shareholders.\n- **Service Charges and Intercompany Transactions**: The VIEs transferred large sums (e.g., RMB17,743 million in 2021) to the PRC subsidiaries as service fees, which were eliminated at consolidation level but impacted internal financial flows [4][10].\n- **Investments in UMG**: The company participated in two major investments in Universal Music Group, acquiring a total of 20% equity interest through a consortium led by Tencent. These investments were accounted for as long-term investments and associates, influencing the equity structure [1][5].\n\n![Changes in equity components](image2)  \n![Final equity balances and transactions](image5)  \n\nIn summary, the components of equity changed significantly over 2020 and 2021, primarily due to share repurchases, intercompany transactions, and strategic investments in music-related businesses like Universal Music Group."}

This growth was driven primarily by increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue. The increase in revenue was also influenced by the impacts of the prior year’s pandemic-related disruptions and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period [11]. Additionally, the Media segment saw a notable increase in revenue, rising to $22.8 billion, with a 20.3% year-over-year growth, largely due to the effects of the Tokyo Olympics broadcast and other factors like distribution and advertising revenue [6].\n\nHowever, not all segments experienced positive revenue growth. For instance, the Content segment saw a slight decline in revenue, decreasing by 2.3% from 2020 to 2021 [3]. This suggests that while some areas of NBCUniversal were growing, others faced challenges such as reduced broadcast rights and shifting market dynamics.\n\nRegarding **customer relationships**, the number of customer relationships remained relatively stable between 2020 and 2021, with only a minor net loss of 198 customers in 2021 compared to a net loss of 56 in 2020 [5]. However, there was a notable decline in Italy, where reduced broadcast rights for Serie A led to a drop in both revenue and customer relationships. This decline was partially offset by gains in the United Kingdom and Germany [11]. The average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship also increased by 8.7% from 2020 to 2021, indicating that even with a slight reduction in the number of customer relationships, the revenue generated per customer improved [8].\n\n![Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% from 2020 to 2021](image8)\n\nThe overall financial performance of NBCUniversal reflected these trends. While revenue grew significantly in 2021, operating costs and expenses also rose, particularly due to increased costs associated with Sky’s wireless phone and broadband services [12]. Despite this, the company managed to improve its Adjusted EBITDA, showing resilience amid these challenges.\n\nIn summary, the combination of increased revenue from key segments, strategic investments in content and technology, and improvements in average revenue per customer relationship helped NBCUniversal navigate the challenges of the post-pandemic environment and achieve better financial performance from 2019 to 2021."}

One of the key mechanisms is the structured and rigorous approach to board succession planning, which includes maintaining a diverse pipeline of candidates and considering unforeseen departures [1]. This ensures that the Board remains equipped with members who possess the necessary skills, experience, and attributes for effective governance and risk management [image1].\n\nThe process involves continuous evaluation and planning, particularly for Non-executive Directors, with a nine-year tenure as a guide. The Board aims to maintain a balance between experience and new perspectives, allowing it to adapt to changing external factors and BHP's specific circumstances. This step also involves preparing pipelines for the Nomination and Governance Committee membership [image1].\n\nFor new appointments, the Nomination and Governance Committee outlines a detailed role description, incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document and section 2.1.7. An external search firm is then selected to carry out a global search aligned with the Board's criteria [image1]. Shortlisted candidates are initially considered by the Chair and the Nomination and Governance Committee before meeting with each Board member for interviews [image1].\n\nFollowing this, the Nomination and Governance Committee recommends the preferred candidate for Board appointment. Background checks are conducted by the Board, supported by external consultants, to ensure the suitability of the candidate [image1]. Finally, a letter of appointment is produced, detailing the terms for Non-executive Directors, including their role, independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement [image1].\n\nIn addition to recruitment, the Nomination and Governance Committee oversees director development through continuous improvement activities, such as training and development programs, which are designed to cover business matters, including environmental, social, and governance issues [8]. These programs are periodically reviewed to maximize effectiveness, incorporating results from Director performance evaluations [8].\n\nMoreover, the Nomination and Governance Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending appropriate candidates for Board and Committee succession, identifying suitable Non-executive Director candidates, and partnering with search firms regarding candidate searches [image7]. This ensures that the Board remains dynamic and capable of addressing future challenges.\n\n![Board succession planning process](image1)  \n![Board tenure and diversity](image6)  \n\nIn summary, BHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a structured, continuous, and comprehensive process involving rigorous selection, ongoing evaluation, and tailored development opportunities."}

According to the text, goodwill arising from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts corresponds to the amount of intangible assets that did not meet the requirements established in IFRS 3 for separate recognition, which relates to their capacity to generate future cash flows [9]. This implies that goodwill is only recognized when the acquired intangible assets meet specific criteria, such as being able to generate future economic benefits.\n\nFurthermore, the recovery of goodwill is supported by the profitability of the acquired companies, whose future cash flows justify the carrying amount of goodwill at year-end [3]. This suggests that changes in goodwill between 2021 and 2020 may have been influenced by the performance of these acquired entities during those periods, particularly in light of external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted business operations and financial results [10].\n\nLooking at the financial data presented in image6, we see a comparison of balances related to goodwill over the two years:\n\n- **Opening balance:** 201 (2021) and 207 (2020)\n- **Acquisitions:** None for both years\n- **Foreign exchange translation differences:** 1 (2021) and (6) (2020)\n- **Closing balance:** 202 (2021) and 201 (2020)\n\n![The table shows the opening balance, acquisitions, foreign exchange translation differences, and closing balance for goodwill in 2021 and 2020.](image6)\n\nFrom this, it is evident that while there were no acquisitions in either year, the closing balance increased slightly in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a positive foreign exchange translation difference in 2021, whereas 2020 had a negative adjustment. This could indicate that currency fluctuations played a role in the change in goodwill’s value between the two years.\n\nIn summary, the key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 include minimal changes in the carrying amount due to foreign exchange adjustments and the continued reliance on the profitability of acquired companies to support the recovery of goodwill."}

According to the text, the company's total revenue grew by 29% in fiscal 2020, surpassing $17 billion [6]. This growth was driven by a shift in business mix toward enterprise and international markets, which have longer customer contract term durations [1]. Additionally, the increase in subscription and support revenue was attributed to efforts to increase data center capacity and a shift in business mix toward cloud service offerings [5].\n\nFrom image2, we see that the \"Salesforce Platform and Other\" category is one of the categories listed under different cloud services, along with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing and Commerce Cloud. While the exact figures for this specific category are not explicitly detailed in the text or image quotes, the overall financial performance across all categories shows significant growth.\n\nImage4 provides insight into the broader cost structure, showing that the total cost of revenues increased from $3,451 million in 2019 to $4,235 million in 2020, representing an increase of $784 million. This increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, and service delivery costs [5]. The cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from 26% in 2019 to 25% in 2020, indicating improved efficiency in managing costs relative to revenue growth.\n\nImage7 further supports this analysis by highlighting that total revenues increased by 29% from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020. Subscription and support revenue saw a particularly strong increase, growing by 29%, while professional services and other revenue also rose by 21%.

These trends can be analyzed using the provided financial data and summarized in the following way:\n\nFor **operating leases**, the total lease liabilities decreased from $3,906 billion at December 31, 2020, to $3,503 billion at December 31, 2021 [6]. This decrease reflects a reduction in current and noncurrent lease liabilities, which may be attributed to the company's efforts to manage its debt obligations, as noted in the $12.9 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2021 [1]. The weighted-average remaining lease term also slightly decreased from 7.2 years in 2020 to 7.8 years in 2021, indicating that the average duration of operating leases remained relatively stable despite the reduction in liabilities [6].\n\nIn terms of **lease costs**, the operating lease costs for 2021 were $2,199 billion, compared to $2,551 billion in 2020 [3]. This represents a significant decline of approximately $352 billion, or about 13.8%. This decrease aligns with the overall trend of reduced lease liabilities and could be influenced by the repayment of long-term notes and early retirement of debt, as well as the elimination of borrowings under the commercial paper program [6].\n\nFor **finance leases**, the total lease liabilities decreased from $633 billion at December 31, 2020, to $497 billion at December 31, 2021 [6]. This decline is consistent with the broader trend of reducing debt and finance lease liabilities. Additionally, the weighted-average remaining lease term increased from 10.4 years in 2020 to 13.2 years in 2021, suggesting that the company has entered into longer-term finance lease agreements or restructured existing ones [6].\n\nRegarding **finance lease costs**, the costs for 2021 were $66 billion, compared to $45 billion in 2020 [3]. This increase of $21 billion, or about 46.7%, might be due to the nature of finance leases, which typically involve higher interest costs over time. However, this increase appears modest relative to the overall reduction in lease liabilities, indicating that the company has managed to reduce its exposure to finance lease obligations while still maintaining some level of financing through these arrangements.\n\nTo summarize the trends in lease liabilities and costs for operating and finance leases between 2020 and 2021:\n\n- Operating lease liabilities decreased from $3,906 billion to $3,503 billion.\n- Operating lease costs decreased from $2,551 billion to $2,199 billion.\n- Finance lease liabilities decreased from $633 billion to $497 billion.\n- Finance lease costs increased from $45 billion to $66 billion.\n\nThese changes reflect Chevron’s strategic efforts to reduce its overall debt burden while managing its lease obligations effectively.\n\n![Operating lease liabilities decreased from $3,906 billion to $3,503 billion](image6)\n![Finance lease liabilities decreased from $633 billion to $497 billion](image6)\n![Operating lease costs decreased from $2,551 billion to $2,199 billion](image3)\n![Finance lease costs increased from $45 billion to $66 billion](image3)\n\nThe trends indicate a deliberate effort by Chevron to reduce its operating lease liabilities and costs significantly, while finance lease liabilities and costs showed a mixed trend, with a notable reduction in liabilities but an increase in costs."}

These changes can be analyzed using the following evidence:\n\nIn terms of **total loans**, the data shows that commercial and industrial loans decreased by $22,867 million (-16%) from 2020 to 2021 [image3]. This decline was partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans, which rose by $5,202 million (-10% decrease, but still showing some resilience) during the same period [image3]. Additionally, **total loans** overall decreased by $30,199 million (-14%) from 2020 to 2021 [image3]. However, in **period-end** data, there was a notable increase in commercial and industrial loans by $31,391 million (20%) and commercial real estate loans by $8,527 million (10%) [image5]. These differences may reflect variations between average and period-end balances.\n\nFor **deposits**, the trend was more consistent: total deposits decreased by $45,156 million or 19% in average balances from 2020 to 2021 [image5]. This decline reflects higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers due to government stimulus programs and payment deferral initiatives, as well as continued economic uncertainty related to the pandemic [8]. However, in period-end data, total deposits also decreased by $34,395 million or 17% [image5].\n\nThe contributing factors to these changes include:\n\n- A **lower interest rate environment** and **weak demand** for loans, which led to reduced loan balances [7].\n- The **impact of the pandemic** on economic activity, leading to increased savings and reduced spending, which affected deposit levels [8].\n- **Actions taken in 2020**, such as curtailing non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspending home equity originations, impacted Home Lending loan balances [9].\n- **Higher line utilization** and **customer growth** contributed to modest loan growth in late 2021 [12].\n\n![Commercial and industrial loans decreased by $22,867 million (-16%) from 2020 to 2021](image3)\n![Total deposits decreased by $45,156 million or 19% in average balances from 2020 to 2021](image5)\n\nIn summary, total loans decreased from 2020 to 2021, driven by lower loan demand and the impact of the pandemic, while total deposits also declined, reflecting increased savings and liquidity among consumers."}

These changes reflect shifts in risk exposure, regulatory requirements, and capital adequacy.\n\nCredit Risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to higher Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility, an increase in Investment securities following the $\\mathrm{E}^{*}$ TRADE acquisition, and higher Lending commitments within certain business segments [3]. This increase in Credit Risk RWA implies that the institution’s risk profile became more complex or volatile during this period, necessitating a higher amount of capital to cover potential losses. As a result, the institution had to maintain a larger capital base relative to its RWA to remain compliant with regulatory capital ratios [1].\n\nIn parallel, External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of RWA rose significantly from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, despite the regulatory minimum being set at 18.0% [7]. The increase in External TLAC indicates that the institution was able to strengthen its capacity to absorb losses during periods of stress, which is crucial for maintaining financial stability. This aligns with the introduction of the SCB (Stress Capital Buffer), which applies only under the Standardized Approach and replaces the existing Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of $2.5\\%$ [6]. The SCB ensures that the institution maintains sufficient capital buffers to withstand severe adverse scenarios, further reinforcing its capital structure.\n\n![Credit Risk RWA increased in 2020 due to factors like market volatility and investment acquisitions](image4)  \n![External TLAC as a % of RWA rose from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image7)\n\nThese developments suggest that while the institution faced increased credit risk exposure, it also strengthened its loss-absorbing capacity, ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks and maintaining a robust capital position to support its operations and risk profile. \n\nIn summary, the rise in Credit Risk RWA and the corresponding increase in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA contributed to a more resilient capital structure, allowing the institution to meet heightened regulatory expectations and manage increased risks effectively."}

This increase could be attributed to various factors, including changes in temporary differences, utilization of carried-forward tax losses, and the impact of non-deductible expenses. Additionally, the global consolidated tax expense ETR rose from 29.6% in 2019 to 46.2% in 2020, indicating a broader shift in the company’s overall tax burden. Image3 provides further insight into these changes, detailing the reconciliation of the effective tax rate and the components influencing it, such as the effects of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, and the utilization of carried-forward tax losses.\n\nMoreover, deferred tax assets and liabilities also saw notable changes. As seen in image4, the total deferred tax assets increased from $6,391 in 2019 to $9,449 in 2020. This reflects an increase in the expected future taxable profits against which these assets can be utilized. However, the net deferred tax assets remained positive in both years, with a slight increase from $6,372 in 2019 to $9,344 in 2020. Image6 supports this information, providing a detailed breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities across different categories, including property, plant, and equipment, employee benefits, provisions, and carry forward tax losses.\n\nIn summary, Lovisa Holdings faced significant financial challenges in 2020, particularly due to the decision to exit the Spanish market, which led to large impairment charges, and an increase in tax expenses, as reflected in the higher effective tax rates for both Australian and global operations. \n\n![Impairment charges related to the exit from the Spanish market](image2)  \n![Increase in effective tax rates for Australian and global operations](image8)  \n\nThe major changes in tax expenses and impairment charges for Lovisa Holdings between 2019 and 2020 include a significant increase in impairment charges due to the exit from the Spanish market and a rise in effective tax rates for both Australian and global operations."}

Specifically, the gross carrying amount for these assets increased from $8,628 in 2021 to $9,012 in 2022 [1]. This growth was driven by increases in several categories, including brands, patents and technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. For instance, the gross carrying amount for brands increased from $3,908 in 2021 to $4,299 in 2022, and for patents and technology, it rose from $2,781 to $2,769 [image1].\n\nAccumulated amortization for these assets also increased from $(6,100) in 2021 to $(6,273) in 2022, reflecting the ongoing amortization of these intangible assets over time [image1]. This aligns with the company’s annual amortization expenses, which were $312 in 2022 and $318 in 2021 [image2]. The slight decrease in amortization expense from 2021 to 2022 may be due to the timing of asset acquisitions or the retirement of certain intangible assets during the period.\n\nLooking ahead, the estimated amortization expenses for future years are projected to decline gradually, as seen in the forecasted amounts: $316 for 2023, $305 for 2024, $288 for 2025, $268 for 2026, and $258 for 2027 [image3]. These projections suggest that the company expects a continued reduction in amortization expenses as some of its intangible assets with determinable lives reach the end of their useful lives or are fully amortized.\n\nIn summary, the changes in Procter & Gamble's intangible assets with determinable lives from 2021 to 2022 reflect both growth in the value of these assets and the ongoing impact of amortization, which is consistent with the company’s reported amortization expenses during this period. ![Intangible Assets With Determinable Lives](image1)"}

This decrease was primarily driven by a significant drop in interest income, particularly in categories such as debt securities and loans and leases, which were impacted by lower interest rates due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Meanwhile, **net interest expense decreased by $5,627 million** from 2019 to 2020, compared to an increase of $714 million from 2018 to 2019. The reduction in interest expense was largely attributed to lower costs on interest-bearing deposits and federal funds purchased [2].\n\nThese financial trends are closely tied to the **organizational structure** of Bank of America, as outlined in its business segments. The company operates through four primary business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with remaining operations classified under \"All Other\" [4]. Each segment contributes differently to the overall net interest income and expenses.\n\nFor instance, the **Consumer Banking** segment experienced a decrease in net interest income of $3.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates, although this was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [9]. Similarly, **Business Lending revenue** dropped by $933 million in 2020 compared to 2019, again driven by lower interest rates [10]. These declines align with the broader trend observed in the consolidated financial data, where the impact of reduced interest rates was widespread across multiple segments.\n\nFurthermore, the **organizational structure** allows for detailed tracking of these changes within specific divisions. For example, the **Global Banking** segment includes Global Investment Banking, Global Corporate Banking, and Global Commercial Banking, all of which would be affected by fluctuations in interest rates and credit risk [image1]. Additionally, the **Global Markets** segment, which manages Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities Markets, as well as Equity Markets, likely experienced volatility due to market conditions during the pandemic [image1].\n\nIn summary, the major differences in changes of net interest income and net interest expense between the periods reflect the impact of external economic factors, particularly the effects of the pandemic, and are further influenced by the internal segmentation of Bank of America’s operations, which enables precise monitoring and management of financial performance across different business units.\n\n![Net interest income and expense declined significantly from 2019 to 2020](image2)"}

This reduction was primarily driven by a significant drop in **interest and other investment income**, which fell by 44.4% year-over-year, from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [7]. This decline is attributed to the continued low short-term interest rates, which affected the income generated from substantial holdings of cash, U.S. Treasury Bills, and fixed maturity securities [4]. However, **dividend income** increased slightly, rising from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, reflecting higher returns from preferred stock investments [7].\n\n![Net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021](image7)\n\nIn terms of **asset composition**, the balance sheet showed notable shifts. As of December 31, 2021, the company held **$90,688 million** in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, compared to **$67,082 million** in 2020 [3]. This increase reflects a strategic decision to maintain ample liquidity amid uncertain market conditions. Meanwhile, **equity securities** grew from **$269,498 million** in 2020 to **$334,907 million** in 2021, indicating a greater allocation toward equity investments [3]. In contrast, **fixed maturity securities** decreased from **$20,317 million** in 2020 to **$16,386 million** in 2021, likely due to the company’s shift away from lower-yielding fixed-income instruments in favor of equities or cash equivalents [3].\n\n![Asset composition changed significantly between 2020 and 2021](image3)\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The decline in interest income highlights the impact of persistently low interest rates on the profitability of short-term investments. By increasing its cash reserves, the company prioritizes liquidity and safety over yield, which may help it weather potential future volatility or economic downturns. At the same time, the growth in equity securities suggests a willingness to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns, though this could expose the company to greater price volatility. The overall strategy appears to be one of balancing stability with growth, leveraging both defensive and offensive investment approaches to navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment."}

In 2020, the U.S. downstream reported a loss of $\\S571$ million [4], but by 2021, it had turned around to report earnings of $\\S2.4$ billion [4]. This substantial increase was primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales of $\\S1.6$ billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $\\S1.0$ billion, and higher sales volumes of $\\S470$ million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $\\S150$ million [4].\n\nIn contrast, the international downstream sector saw a decline in earnings from 2019 to 2021.

To mitigate these risks, Nestlé has implemented several strategies, including safety and security policies and business continuity plans [6].\n\nIn terms of factory distribution across different regions, the report provides insights into how Nestlé operates globally. For instance, image1 shows data related to the Americas (AMS) region, listing countries along with numbers and colored dots that may represent various categories or criteria. This could indicate the presence of factories or operational hubs in these countries, with the United States having the highest number at 72 [image1]. Similarly, image5 presents data for the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA) region, suggesting a similar structure of operational presence across multiple countries [image5].\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides a visual representation of share capital distribution by geography, showing that Switzerland holds the largest share at 34.9%, followed by the United States at 33.5% [image2]. This indicates that Nestlé has significant operations and investments in these regions, which are crucial for its global supply chain.\n\nBy understanding the geographical distribution of its operations, Nestlé can better implement mitigation strategies tailored to specific regions. For example, in areas with higher operational presence, such as the United States and Switzerland, more robust contingency plans and supply chain resilience measures might be prioritized to ensure continuity and minimize the impact of disruptions [6].\n\nIn summary, potential impacts of supply chain disruptions include supply issues and cost increases, while mitigations involve safety and security policies and business continuity plans.

The shipment volume for cigarettes in the region declined by 11.8%, dropping from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020 [3]. This decline was driven by several factors, including lower total market volumes, reduced market share due to adult smoker down-trading to ultra-low-price brands, and the impact of retail out-of-stock situations during the second quarter in Argentina [12]. Additionally, Mexico saw a decrease in cigarette shipment volume due to lower total market volumes and consumer behavior shifts following price increases and the pandemic [12].\n\nHowever, PMI also saw growth in Heated Tobacco Units (HTUs) in the region, with shipment volumes increasing by 50.8% from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020 [3].

This fluctuation suggests that while there was a temporary dip in 2020, likely influenced by economic uncertainties such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company saw a recovery in 2021, driven by improved customer behavior and financial stability. The increase in 2021 may also be attributed to strategic efforts to expand the card member base and enhance retention strategies, as noted in other reports [8].\n\nRegarding **net interest income**, it decreased from $866 million in 2019 to $967 million in 2020, and then to $1,011 million in 2021 [image5]. This indicates a modest recovery in net interest income over the period, despite initial challenges in 2020. The decline in net interest income from 2019 to 2020 can be partially explained by lower cost of funds and higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances, as mentioned in text quotes [2]. However, the slight increase in 2021 reflects the company’s ability to adapt and improve its interest yield, possibly through better management of loan portfolios and cost control measures.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The decline in average Card Member loans in 2020 might have impacted the company's ability to generate consistent interest income, but the subsequent growth in 2021 demonstrates resilience and effective risk management.

Let’s explore how each contributes based on the evidence provided.\n\nFirst, **share-based compensation** plays a significant role in shaping shareholders’ equity. As noted in the financial data, share-based compensation expense increases Restricted Share Units (RSUs) and Additional Paid-in Capital (APIC). For instance, in 2020, share-based compensation led to an increase in RSUs by 1,118,284 and APIC by $79,522, totaling an increase of $1,197,806 in shareholders' equity [image2]. This means that when employees are granted shares or options as part of their compensation, it effectively increases the value of the company's equity without requiring immediate cash outflows, thus contributing positively to shareholders’ equity.\n\nIn addition, **cash flow from operating activities** is a direct indicator of the company's ability to generate cash through its core business operations, which in turn supports both equity and liquidity. Operating activities include net income, adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation and amortization, and changes in working capital. In 2020, Accenture reported **net income** of $5,185,313, which is a key component of cash flow from operating activities [image6]. This net income directly contributes to retained earnings, thereby increasing shareholders’ equity. Furthermore, adjustments such as depreciation and share-based compensation (which is already accounted for in equity) help reconcile net income to actual cash generated from operations.\n\nThe table describing cash flows from operating activities also includes adjustments for items like **depreciation and amortization**, which are non-cash expenses that reduce net income but do not affect cash. These adjustments help determine the actual cash inflows from operations, which are essential for maintaining liquidity and supporting ongoing operations, dividends, or reinvestment in the business [image4].\n\nTo summarize, share-based compensation enhances shareholders’ equity by increasing RSUs and APIC, while cash flow from operating activities reflects the company’s ability to generate cash that supports its operations and overall financial health. Both elements work together to ensure that Accenture maintains a strong equity position and adequate cash reserves for future growth and shareholder returns. \n\n![Share-based compensation increased Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital, enhancing shareholders' equity](image2)\n![Net income and adjustments for non-cash items contribute to cash flow from operating activities, reflecting the company's liquidity](image4)"}

Based on the information provided in the text and image quotes, we can identify the main acquiring entities for subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal.\n\nIn the context of the Inditex Group's corporate structure, several main entities are responsible for acquiring and managing subsidiaries in different regions. These entities are typically structured under the parent company, Industria de Diseño Textil, S.A., and operate as separate legal entities to manage specific regions or brands [2]. For example, image3 shows that various subsidiary companies are listed under different main entities, such as ITX ITALIA SRL or INDITEX CESKÁ REPUBLIKA, S.R.O, followed by their respective subsidiaries, which include fashion brands like OYSHO, BERSHKA, PULL & BEAR, ZARA, and others, categorized by their regional operations.\n\nWhile the text quotes do not explicitly name the acquiring entities for subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal, they do provide insight into the general structure of acquisitions and management within the Inditex Group. Specifically, quote [8] indicates that no significant transactions occurred between the Company or any company within the INDITEX Group and its controlling shareholder Pontegadea Inversiones, S.L., or related entities in 2021. This implies that the acquisition and management of subsidiaries were conducted internally within the Inditex Group structure rather than through external entities.\n\nFurthermore, image8 provides a detailed list of acquiring companies and the companies they acquired. Although this table does not explicitly mention Italy or Portugal, it gives an indication of how the Inditex Group manages its subsidiaries across different countries. For instance, entities like ITX HELLAS SINGLE MEMBER S.A. acquired several subsidiaries in Greece, suggesting a similar pattern may be followed in other countries, including Italy and Portugal.\n\n![Acquiring entities for subsidiaries in different regions](image8)"}

This increase was primarily due to a capital increase in March 2021, which raised subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million [4]. Additionally, the issuance of new shares of Siemens Healthineers AG in March 2021 for financing the acquisition of Varian contributed significantly to the growth in equity, with issued capital increasing by €53 million and capital reserves rising by €2,275 million [7]. These capital increases were partially offset by the distribution of dividends, which reduced unappropriated net income by €856 million [4]. However, this negative impact was more than offset by net income for the year, leading to an overall increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million [4].\n\nRegarding **liabilities**, several key components show notable changes between 2020 and 2021. First, **net debt** increased significantly from €1,484 million in 2020 to €11,901 million in 2021 [image1]. This rise was largely driven by the acquisition of Varian, which required substantial financing through borrowings from the Siemens Group. Specifically, the Siemens Group provided additional financing of €850 million in fiscal year 2021 to support the acquisition [12]. This is reflected in the **current liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities**, which increased from €2,040 million in 2020 to €1,926 million in 2021 [image1], though it's worth noting that this figure slightly decreased despite the larger overall borrowing.\n\nAnother significant liability component is **long-term financial debt**, which increased from €314 million in 2020 to €457 million in 2021 [image1]. This reflects the company’s need to finance long-term obligations, including those related to property, plant, and equipment [2]. Furthermore, **remaining current liabilities to the Siemens Group** also increased from €0 million in 2020 to €1 million in 2021 [image2], indicating a small but measurable shift in short-term obligations within the group structure.\n\nThe **equity ratio** declined from 76% to 55% during this period, mainly due to the significant increase in loan liabilities [4]. Despite this decline, the capital increase and the utilization of capital reserves helped maintain a positive trajectory in equity, even as liabilities expanded.\n\n![Net debt increased significantly from €1,484 million in 2020 to €11,901 million in 2021](image1)  \n![Remaining current liabilities to the Siemens Group increased from €0 million in 2020 to €1 million in 2021](image2)  \n![Total equity rose to €16,339 million in 2021, reflecting capital increases and financing activities](image6)\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers’ liabilities and equity changed dramatically from 2020 to 2021, with a substantial increase in liabilities driven by the acquisition of Varian and related financing, while equity grew due to capital increases and strong net income performance."}

Specifically, in 2021, the company issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D. This issuance was used to redeem previously outstanding preferred shares: $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C, and $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B [10]. These transactions are reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement, where net cash used in financing activities is driven by share repurchases, debt repayments, and the redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares [1].\n\nThe issuance of preferred shares in 2021 increased shareholders’ equity, as the proceeds from the issuance were recorded under preferred shares and additional paid-in capital. Conversely, the redemption of preferred shares in 2021 reduced shareholders’ equity, as these shares were removed from the balance sheet. For instance, the total shareholders’ equity decreased from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, reflecting the net effect of these transactions [4].\n\nSimilarly, in 2020, the company may have engaged in similar activities related to preferred shares, though specific details for that year are not provided in the text.

{"q_id": 627, "model": "qwen3-14b", "in_tok": 4100, "out_tok": 716, "total_tok": 4816, "response": "From the text and image quotes, we can analyze how the total assets and cash flow from operating activities changed for the consolidated segment from 2020 to 2021, as well as what these changes might imply for business operations.\n\nFirst, let's examine the **cash flow from operating activities**. According to quote [1], net cash provided by operating activities was **$\\Updownarrow7.18$ .18 billion in 2021**, compared with **$\\S4.05$ billion in 2020**. This represents a significant increase of approximately **$\\S3.13$ billion**. The increase is attributed to higher profit in 2021 adjusted for non-cash items, such as higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, which positively impacted cash flow. However, increased working capital requirements partially offset these gains, with changes in inventory and accounts receivable unfavorably impacting cash flow but being partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses [1]. Additionally, quote [5] reiterates this point, noting that consolidated operating cash flow for 2021 was **$\\mathbb{S}7.20$ .20 billion**, an increase of **$\\S871$ million** compared to 2020, primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items. This suggests a strong performance in core operations, likely driven by improved profitability and efficient management of short-term incentives.\n\nNow, regarding **total assets**, while no explicit figures are given for total assets in the text quotes, **image1** provides a detailed breakdown of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for the consolidated entity and its segments (Machinery, Energy & Transportation, Financial Products) for both 2021 and 2020. From the table in image1, it is evident that the company maintains a comprehensive structure of assets, including current and non-current assets. Although specific values are not mentioned here, the presence of consistent entries across the years implies that the asset base has been managed carefully, possibly growing or remaining stable depending on operational performance and investment decisions.\n\n![Consolidated financial statement showing assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for 2021 and 2020](image1)\n\nThe implications of the **increase in operating cash flow** from 2020 to 2021 are significant for business operations. A stronger cash flow from operations indicates improved efficiency in generating cash from day-to-day business activities, which can be used for reinvestment, debt reduction, or shareholder returns. This also suggests that the company may have better liquidity and financial flexibility to support growth initiatives or weather economic uncertainties. Furthermore, the increase in operating cash flow could reflect better cost control, higher sales, or improved working capital management, all of which are positive signs for long-term sustainability.\n\nIn summary, the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities from 2020 to 2021, combined with the structured presentation of assets in image1, points to a healthier financial position for the consolidated segment. These changes likely enhance the company’s ability to invest in future growth, manage obligations, and maintain stability in its operations. \n\nThe total assets and cash flow from operating activities indicate a robust financial performance in 2021 compared to 2020, which likely supports continued business expansion and operational resilience."}
{"q_id": 628, "model": "qwen3-14b", "in_tok": 7029, "out_tok": 932, "total_tok": 7961, "response": "From the provided text and image quotes, we can analyze the significant changes in total assets and total liabilities for the entity from 2020 to 2021, and how these changes relate to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows.\n\n### Changes in Total Assets and Liabilities\n\nAccording to **image1**, the entity's **total assets** decreased from **$191,367 million in 2020** to **$188,548 million in 2021**, a reduction of **$2,819 million**. This decline was primarily driven by an increase in Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and a reduction in customer deposits, as noted in **text quote [9]**. \n\nConversely, **total liabilities** also decreased slightly from **$168,383 million in 2020** to **$166,371 million in 2021**, a reduction of **$2,012 million**. This decrease may be attributed to reductions in long-term debt and other liabilities, though specific details are not explicitly outlined in the text or images provided.\n\n### Comprehensive Income and Its Impact\n\nThe **comprehensive income** for the entity was **$8,010 million in 2021** compared to **$2,977 million in 2020**, as detailed in **image2**. This indicates a substantial increase in the entity’s overall profitability, which is reflected in its retained earnings and shareholders’ equity. The increase in comprehensive income would likely contribute to higher retained earnings, which is evident in **image8**, where retained earnings dropped from **$11,881 million in 2020** to **$11,495 million in 2021**. This decrease in retained earnings may be partially offset by share repurchases and dividends paid, which are components of financing activities, as seen in **image7**.\n\n### Cash Flows and Their Relation to Asset and Liability Changes\n\nThe **statement of cash flows** (see **image7**) provides insight into how the entity managed its liquidity during this period. Net cash provided by operating activities was **$14,645 million in 2021**, significantly higher than **$5,591 million in 2020**. This improvement in operating cash flow likely contributed to the entity’s ability to manage its asset and liability positions despite the overall decline in total assets.\n\nHowever, **investing activities** showed a net use of cash of **$10,529 million in 2021**, compared to a net inflow of **$11,632 million in 2020**. This shift could indicate increased investments in long-term assets or loan portfolios, which aligns with the increase in Card Member loans and receivables mentioned earlier.\n\nFinally, **financing activities** resulted in a net use of cash of **$14,933 million in 2021**, compared to **$9,068 million in 2020**. This suggests that the entity used more cash for share repurchases, dividends, and debt repayments in 2021 than in 2020, which could explain the reduction in total liabilities and shareholders' equity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n![Total assets decreased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, while total liabilities decreased slightly from $168,383 million to $166,371 million.](image1)  \n![Comprehensive income rose significantly from $2,977 million in 2020 to $8,010 million in 2021, reflecting improved profitability.](image2)  \n![Net cash provided by operating activities increased substantially in 2021, while investing and financing activities had contrasting impacts on liquidity.](image7)\n\nIn summary, the entity experienced a decline in total assets and a slight decrease in total liabilities from 2020 to 2021, which was accompanied by a notable increase in comprehensive income and strong operating cash flows. These changes were influenced by factors such as increased investments in loans, share repurchases, and debt management."}

This decline reflects challenges across multiple segments, including Wealth and Personal Banking, which had previously been combined from Global Private Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth Management [4].\n\nFor the Wealth and Personal Banking segment, total revenue in 2020 was $12,938 million, compared to $15,655 million in 2019 [8].

This growth in heated tobacco units was driven by increased market share in countries like Germany, Italy, and Poland [8]. However, the overall PMI shipment volume in the EU declined slightly by 1.9%, reflecting the combined impact of reduced cigarette sales and the relatively smaller contribution of heated tobacco units [2]. The total market for cigarettes and heated tobacco units in the EU also saw a decline of 2.1% in 2020 compared to 2019 [image2].\n\nRegarding market share, PMI’s share in the EU remained relatively stable, with a slight increase to 38.9% in 2020 from 38.8% in 2019.

However, in Eastern Europe specifically, the shipment volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units combined showed minimal change, increasing by just 0.2% from 2019 to 2020 [image8]. This stability was largely due to the strong growth in heated tobacco unit shipments, which rose by 55.3% year-over-year, offsetting the decline in cigarette shipments [image8]. In Russia, for example, the shipment volume increased by 1.8% (or 3.9% excluding inventory movements), primarily due to higher market share driven by heated tobacco units [10]. Similarly, Ukraine also saw increased heated tobacco unit shipments, partly offsetting lower cigarette shipment volumes [11].\n\n![Heated tobacco unit shipments in the European Union grew significantly in 2020](image2)  \n![Eastern Europe's combined shipment volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units remained nearly unchanged in 2020](image8)\n\nIn summary, while cigarette shipment volumes declined in both the European Union and Eastern Europe, the growth in heated tobacco unit shipments helped stabilize or even slightly increase the overall shipment volume in these regions. Market share for heated tobacco products, particularly HEETS, increased notably in the European Union, while Eastern Europe saw strong growth in heated tobacco unit shipments that offset declining cigarette sales."}

It shows that the initial balances at 2 July 2018 were adjusted for additions, disposals, and exchange rate effects over the years. The carrying amounts as of 30 June 2019 and 28 June 2020 reflect the cumulative impact of these adjustments. Additionally, the table outlines specific depreciation policies: leasehold improvements are depreciated over their lease term, while hardware/software and fixtures/fittings are depreciated over 3 years [1].\n\nRegarding right-of-use assets under AASB 16, image6 presents a summary of their changes. Initially, on 1 July 2019, the Group recognised $138,403 in right-of-use assets upon applying AASB 16.

This was primarily driven by a one-time derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to distributed intellectual property, which resulted in a \\$2.5 billion charge to income tax expense [8]. Additionally, the company recorded a tax benefit of \\$570 million in fiscal 2019 due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets [8]. These factors contributed to the sharp increase in the effective tax rate for that year.\n\nBy 2020, the effective tax rate had dropped significantly to 9%, with a total effective tax provision of \\$521 million [10]. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including the benefit from the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction, which reduced the tax burden, and the impact of the global spread of COVID-19 on Qualcomm’s non-marketable equity investments, leading to impairments and write-downs [7]. The company also recognized licensing revenues from settlements with Huawei and Apple, which likely influenced its overall financial position [3].\n\nIn 2021, the effective tax rate further decreased to 12%, with a total effective tax provision of \\$1,231 million [10]. This reflects continued benefits from the FDII deduction and research and development tax credits, as well as the ongoing impact of the Korean withholding tax refund claims [10]. However, the company also faced challenges related to uncertain tax benefits, with an increase in unrecognized tax benefits from \\$1.9 billion in 2020 to \\$2.1 billion in 2021 [10]. This highlights the complexity and uncertainty surrounding Qualcomm’s global tax obligations.\n\n![Unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1.9 billion in 2020 to $2.1 billion in 2021](image5)\n\nThe trend indicates a shift from a high effective tax rate in 2019, largely due to one-time charges and adjustments, to a more stable and lower rate in subsequent years, influenced by ongoing tax incentives, deductions, and the resolution of certain tax-related matters. However, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits underscores the ongoing risks and complexities associated with international tax regulations and audits.\n\nIn conclusion, Qualcomm experienced a significant reduction in its effective tax rate from 41% in 2019 to 12% in 2021, driven by various tax benefits and deductions, although the company continues to face uncertainties related to its global tax liabilities."}

According to the data presented in image2, the balance of WFAM AUM at the end of 2021 was heavily affected by the sale, with a reduction of $587.1 billion from the beginning balance of $603.0 billion. This indicates that the sale had a substantial impact on the overall AUM, as the majority of the assets were transferred or removed from the company’s management portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [5] notes that prior to the sale, the company earned investment advisory and other asset-based fees from managing and administering assets through WFAM. With the sale, these fees would have been impacted, as the company no longer managed those assets. This is further supported by text quote [4], which mentions lower asset-based fees due to the sale of WFAM in 2021.\n\n![WFAM AUM reduced by $587.1 billion due to the sale on November 1, 2021](image2)\n\nIn terms of broader effects on the company's income, text quote [2] highlights that gains from the sale of WFAM contributed to an increase in other income in 2021. Specifically, the $\\S269$ million gain from the sale of WFAM was one of the contributing factors to the overall increase in other income. However, this gain was partially offset by other factors such as lower gains on the sales of certain residential mortgage loans and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk.\n\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, text quote [11] indicates that the rail car leasing business, which is part of the Corporate segment, had long-lived operating lease assets of $\\S5.1$ billion as of December 31, 2021. While not directly related to the sale of WFAM, it shows the broader context of asset management within the company. Additionally, text quote [6] discusses an impairment charge of $\\S268$ million related to rail cars used for transporting coal products, which reflects the sensitivity of the company’s balance sheet to market conditions and economic changes.\n\n![The sale of WFAM resulted in a $\\S269$ million gain, contributing to increased other income in 2021](image1)\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in the company’s AUM, a one-time gain of $\\S269$ million, and a shift in the composition of the company’s income and balance sheet.

According to the data provided in image1, there was a notable decrease in net interest income, primarily due to a significant decline in interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses. The overall net decrease in interest income was $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, while the net decrease in interest expense was $5,627 million during the same period. This suggests that the reduction in interest income had a more pronounced effect on the net interest spread than the reduction in interest expenses.\n\n![Net interest income decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the text quotes provide further insight into these changes. For instance, quote [6] states that net interest income decreased by $\\S5.5$ billion to $\\S43.4$ billion in 2020 compared to 2019, with the decrease primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. This aligns with the findings in image1, indicating that the drop in interest rates was a major contributing factor to the decline in net interest income.\n\nQuote [4] also highlights that net interest income for Consumer Banking decreased by $\\S3.5$ billion to $\\S24.7$ billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. This reinforces the idea that lower interest rates were a key driver of the decline in net interest income.\n\nFinally, quote [2] mentions that the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet increased in both up-rate and down-rate scenarios due to continued deposit growth invested in long-term securities. This indicates that the company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations played a role in the changes observed in net interest income and expense.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 resulted in a significant reduction in the net interest spread, primarily due to lower interest rates and a substantial decrease in interest income."}

This growth was driven by higher sales volume ($3,076 million increase), favorable price realization ($932 million increase), and lower manufacturing costs ($1,246 million decrease), among other factors [image8]. Additionally, the consolidated operating profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 11.8%, compared with 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 [2], indicating a slight decline in profitability on a quarterly basis but a substantial annual increase.\n\nIn terms of **net cash provided by operating activities**, the consolidated figures show an increase from $4,054 million in 2020 to $7,177 million in 2021 for the ME&T segment [image4]. This increase is attributed to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, partially offset by increased working capital requirements [8].\n\nFor the **Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T)** segment specifically, operating profit also rose from $4,553 million in 2020 to $6,878 million in 2021 [6]. The increase was supported by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, although it was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses [11]. The free cash flow for ME&T was $6,048 million in 2021, compared to $3,060 million in 2020 [image4], reflecting strong operational efficiency and liquidity generation.\n\n![Consolidated operating profit for 2020 and 2021](image8)\n![Net cash provided by operating activities for ME&T in 2020 and 2021](image4)\n\nIn summary, both the Consolidated and ME&T segments demonstrated improved financial performance in 2021 compared to 2020, with notable increases in operating profit and net cash provided by operating activities."}

These changes had implications for the company’s liquidity, tax liabilities, and shareholder value.\n\nStarting with the **gross unrecognized tax benefits**, the data from image5 reveals that the beginning balance of these benefits was $1,423 million in 2020 and $1,056 million in 2019. During 2020, the company experienced a **gross increase** of $416 million due to current year tax positions and $120 million from prior year tax positions, totaling $536 million in increases. However, there were also **gross decreases** of $130 million from prior year tax positions and no settlements or statute of limitations lapses. This led to an **end-of-period balance** of $1,829 million in 2020, compared to $1,423 million in 2019. The increase implies greater uncertainty or potential liability related to tax positions, which could affect future effective tax rates if recognized [6].\n\nRegarding **common share repurchases**, image1 provides a clear comparison between 2020 and 2019. In 2020, the company repurchased **14 million shares** at an average price of **$300.58 per share**, with an aggregate cost of **$4,250 million**. In contrast, during 2019, the company repurchased **22 million shares** at an average price of **$245.97 per share**, with an aggregate cost of **$5,500 million**. While the number of shares repurchased decreased in 2020, the average price per share increased, indicating a strategic shift toward more expensive repurchases. Additionally, the remaining authorized shares under the Board’s program were **58 million** as of December 31, 2020, compared to **72 million** as of December 31, 2019, suggesting that the company utilized a portion of its repurchase authorization in 2020 [5].\n\nThese repurchases likely aimed to optimize the capital structure and enhance returns to shareholders, as noted in text quote [11], which outlines the objectives of the share repurchase program. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, the company may have improved earnings per share (EPS) and signaled confidence in its financial health.\n\nIn summary, while the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased in 2020, reflecting higher potential tax liabilities, its common share repurchases showed a shift toward fewer but more costly repurchases, which could have positive implications for shareholder value. These changes together reflect a complex interplay between tax risk management and capital allocation strategies, impacting the company’s overall financial position."}

This substantial increase was driven by higher sales volume, which was fueled by increased end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as changes in dealer inventory levels [3]. Additionally, favorable price realization played a role in boosting sales [3].\n\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1.611 billion, representing an increase of $231 million, or 17 percent, compared with $1.380 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 [12]. Several factors contributed to this increase in operating profit. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were key drivers, as these positively impacted revenue. However, there were also challenges such as increased manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses, which were more than offset by the aforementioned positive factors and net restructuring income from the sale of a facility [12].\n\n![The image shows the changes in consolidated operating profit for Caterpillar between 2020 and 2021, highlighting the contributions from various factors such as sales volume, price realization, manufacturing costs, and others.](image1)\n\n![The chart compares consolidated operating profit between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2021 for Caterpillar, showing the specific contributions from different factors like sales volume, price realization, and manufacturing costs.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the growth in sales volume and operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily due to higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventory levels, despite increases in manufacturing and operational costs."}

These changes can be analyzed using data provided in the text and image quotes.\n\nFirst, let's consider the **Total Capital Ratios**. According to [3], capital ratios are calculated using a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. This indicates that adjustments were made to account for the new accounting standard, which could influence the total capital ratios. Furthermore, [6] mentions that BANA met the definition of well capitalized under the PCA framework for both periods, suggesting that the entity maintained compliance with regulatory requirements during this time.\n\nIn terms of specific figures, [image6] provides detailed data on risk-based capital metrics. As of December 31, 2019, the **Total Capital Ratio** under the **Standardized Approach** was 14.8%, and under the **Advanced Approach**, it was 14.7%. By December 31, 2020, the **Total Capital Ratio** increased to 16.1% under the **Standardized Approach** and 16.6% under the **Advanced Approach**. This increase suggests an improvement in the entity’s capital position relative to its risk-weighted assets.\n\nNow, looking at the **Long-term Debt Percentages**, we turn to [image3]. On December 31, 2019, the long-term debt percentage was 11.5%, while the regulatory minimum was 8.5%. By December 31, 2020, the long-term debt percentage had increased to 13.3%, still above the regulatory minimum of 8.5%. This increase may reflect the entity’s strategy to maintain or enhance its capital structure, possibly influenced by the new regulatory environment and the implementation of the CECL standard.\n\n![Long-term debt percentages increased from 11.5% in 2019 to 13.3% in 2020](image3)\n\nAdditionally, [image6] provides further context on the entity’s capital structure, showing that the entity’s capital base grew significantly over the period, which would support higher capital ratios. The increase in long-term debt as a percentage of total capital could also be linked to strategic decisions to manage liquidity and meet regulatory capital requirements effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the Total Capital Ratios increased from 14.8% (Standardized) and 14.7% (Advanced) in 2019 to 16.1% (Standardized) and 16.6% (Advanced) in 2020, while the Long-term Debt Percentages rose from 11.5% in 2019 to 13.3% in 2020, both reflecting adherence to Basel 3 standards and adjustments due to new regulatory requirements."}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, although it was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis also decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent for 2020 [1].\n\nLooking at **total revenue**, the performance of Consumer Banking was similarly affected. In the table from image1, we see that total revenue, net of interest expense, for **Total Consumer Banking** fell from $\\S38,587$ million in 2019 to $\\S33,262$ million in 2020, representing a significant decline [image1]. This aligns with the overall trend of declining net income and revenue figures across the sector during this period.\n\nFor **Wealth Management**, specifically **Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM)**, the situation was different. MLGWM's revenue decreased by five percent to $\\S15.3$ billion in 2020, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, although this was partially offset by higher market valuations and positive AUM flows [6]. Additionally, the table in image2 shows that **Total revenue, net of interest expense** for **Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank** declined from $\\S19,538$ million in 2019 to $\\S18,584$ million in 2020 [image2].\n\nDespite these challenges, **client balances** managed under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM increased significantly, reaching $\\S3.3$ trillion at year-end 2020, up from $\\S3.0$ trillion in 2019 [image2]. This growth in client balances suggests continued confidence in wealth management services, even amid economic uncertainty.\n\nIn terms of **noninterest income**, the **Consumer Banking** segment saw a decline of $\\S1.9$ billion to $\\S8.6$ billion in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by a decline in service charges due to higher deposit balances and lower card income due to decreased client activity [5]. In contrast, **Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management** reported relatively stable noninterest income, as reflected in the data provided in image2.\n\nOverall, while both **Consumer Banking** and **Wealth Management** sectors faced headwinds in 2020—particularly in terms of **net interest income** and **total revenue**—the **Wealth Management** segment showed resilience through strong client balance growth and some offsetting benefits from higher market valuations. \n\n![Net interest income for Total Consumer Banking declined in 2020](image1)\n![Total revenue, net of interest expense for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank declined in 2020](image2)\n\nIn summary, the **Consumer Banking** sector saw a notable decline in both **net interest income** and **total revenue** in 2020 compared to 2019, while **Wealth Management** also experienced a revenue decline but demonstrated resilience through growth in client balances."}

Similarly, the **basic EPS** under IFRS was **$3.55**, whereas the **core basic EPS** was **$5.78** [6]. This suggests that the core results are higher than the IFRS results, primarily because certain adjustments—such as amortization and impairments—are added back to arrive at the core figures.\n\nIn **2020**, the **IFRS net income** was also **$8,071 million**, but the **core net income** increased to **$13,158 million** [6]. The **basic EPS** under IFRS was **$3.55**, and the **core basic EPS** rose to **$5.78** [6]. These figures show a consistent pattern where the core results reflect a more favorable financial position compared to IFRS results, especially when considering the adjustments made to arrive at these core metrics.\n\nOne of the most significant adjustments affecting these metrics is the **amortization of intangible assets**. For example, in **2021**, the amortization of intangible assets amounted to **$3,903 million**, which had a substantial impact on the operating income and, consequently, the net income [7]. Additionally, **impairments** of property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets were also notable, with **$684 million** recorded in 2021 compared to **$1,354 million** in 2020 [7].\n\nOther significant adjustments include **acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items**, which also influence the core results by either adding or subtracting from the operating income.

These dividends are directly subtracted from retained earnings, which is a key component of stockholders' equity. The payment of dividends reduces the company’s retained earnings and, consequently, its overall equity. Additionally, cash dividends impact the **cash flow statement** under **financing activities**, where they are recorded as a cash outflow. In 2021, Chevron reported net cash used for financing activities of $23,113 million, which included these dividend payments [6].\n\nSecond, **treasury stock transactions** also had a notable effect on Chevron’s equity structure. Treasury stock refers to shares that the company has repurchased from the market. These repurchases are recorded as a reduction in stockholders’ equity, specifically under the \"Treasury Stock (at cost)\" line item. In 2021, Chevron engaged in significant treasury stock purchases, which would have reduced total equity while increasing the number of shares held in treasury. However, if shares were reissued later, this could have increased equity again. The table in image5 shows detailed activity related to the purchase and issuance of treasury shares, indicating how these actions affected Chevron’s equity over time [5].\n\nIn terms of **cash flow**, treasury stock transactions are also reflected in the **financing activities** section of the cash flow statement. Repurchasing shares results in a cash outflow, while the reissuance of treasury shares would represent a cash inflow. In 2021, the large net cash used for financing activities ($23,113 million) likely includes both the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury shares [6].\n\n![Chevron's 2021 cash dividends and treasury stock transactions impacted its equity and cash flow](image5)\n\nIn summary, both **cash dividends** and **treasury stock transactions** in 2021 reduced Chevron’s equity and contributed to significant cash outflows under financing activities."}

By the end of 2020, they achieved 30.3%, indicating that they met their goal. This aligns with other text quotes such as [12], which reiterates the achievement of the 30% target for female representation in senior leadership roles.\n\nIn contrast, the overall employee gender distribution shows a more balanced ratio. As described in image4, the \"All Employees Chart\" indicates that 48% of the workforce are males and 52% are females. This represents a relatively even split between genders, unlike the senior leadership roles where the disparity is more pronounced.\n\n![Percentage of our senior leadership who are women](image4)\n\nThe \"Senior Leaders Chart\" from image4 illustrates that senior leadership is composed of 70% males and 30% females. This reflects a significant gender imbalance, as only 30% of senior leadership positions are held by women, compared to the overall employee base, where the gender ratio is nearly equal. The slight change from 2019 (where males made up 71% and females 29%) suggests a small but positive movement toward greater gender balance in senior leadership.\n\nHSBC has set a new target to increase the percentage of women in senior leadership roles to 35% by 2025, as noted in multiple text quotes, including [1] and [10].

Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, WPB supported customers through payment holidays and maintained a significant number of branches open, keeping between 70% to 90% operational [7]. The financial performance data indicates that WPB's contribution to HSBC's group adjusted profit before tax was impacted by lower interest rates across most markets, reduced customer activity, and a rise in adjusted expected credit loss (ECL) charges [7].\n\nThe table in image1 provides a detailed breakdown of HSBC’s financial performance over the years, showing that the Group's profit before tax decreased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, from $8,883 million in 2019 to $4,140 million in 2020, representing a decrease of $4,743 million or 53% [image1]. This decline aligns with the broader context of the Group's financial deterioration in 2020, which was attributed to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the global economy, particularly due to lower revenue and higher expected credit loss charges linked to the pandemic [9].\n\nFurthermore, image3 depicts a pie chart where the red segment represents a contribution of $4.1 billion, which corresponds to 34% of the total group adjusted profit before tax in 2020 [image3]. While this figure does not explicitly identify the segment as WPB, it highlights the significant portion of the overall profit attributable to one major contributor, likely reflecting the performance of WPB given its strategic importance and consistent contribution to the Group’s performance [6].\n\nIn addition, the table in image4 reveals that WPB's revenue declined in 2020 compared to 2019, with net interest income decreasing by $2,285 million or 16%, and non-interest income also declining by $432 million or 26% [image4]. These figures indicate that while WPB played a crucial role in supporting customers during the pandemic, its financial performance was negatively affected by the economic environment.\n\nIn summary, although WPB faced challenges in 2020, it remained an essential part of HSBC’s operations, contributing significantly to the Group's adjusted profit before tax despite the adverse conditions. The financial performance data underscores the impact of the global economic downturn on HSBC's profitability, particularly in segments like WPB, where lower interest rates and increased credit loss charges led to a notable decline in revenue."}

As a result, the Group recognized a right-of-use asset representing its right to use underlying leased assets and a corresponding lease liability reflecting its obligation to make lease payments [4].\n\nAccording to the data provided in image1, the initial application of AASB 16 resulted in the recognition of a lease liability of $143,621 thousand at 1 July 2019. During the year ending 28 June 2020, additional lease liabilities were recognized, amounting to $50,245 thousand, while re-measurements due to changes in lease terms added $1,559 thousand. Despite these increases, lease payments reduced the liability by $31,886 thousand, and interest expenses increased it by $4,707 thousand. After adjusting for exchange rate movements, the total lease liability at 28 June 2020 was $167,154 thousand, with $36,019 thousand classified as current and $131,135 thousand as non-current [image1].\n\nThis shift also affected how the Group accounted for onerous leases. Previously, provisions were made for the expected costs of exiting onerous leases, but under AASB 16, these costs are now included directly in the lease liability rather than being separately provisioned [image2]. Furthermore, the Group applied a practical expedient to avoid re-measuring lease liabilities for rent concessions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is detailed in note B4 [11].\n\nIn addition to lease liabilities, employee benefit obligations also saw notable changes. The Group’s long-term service benefits, including annual leave and long-service leave, are calculated based on expected future wage rates, related on-costs, and settlement dates, with discounting applied using high-quality Australian corporate bond rates [10]. According to image3, the total employee benefit liabilities amounted to $4,092 thousand in 2020, compared to $4,054 thousand in 2019. This slight increase reflects ongoing accruals for employee benefits, including annual leave and long-service leave, which are expected to be settled within the next 12 months or beyond, depending on their nature [1].\n\nIn summary, the transition to AASB 16 had a significant impact on the Group's financial position, resulting in higher lease liabilities and more transparent recognition of obligations related to leased assets. Employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable, reflecting consistent accruals for future employee-related expenses. \n\n![Lease liability changes under AASB 16](image1)  \n![Accounting treatment changes for operating leases](image2)  \n![Employee benefit liabilities for 2020 and 2019](image3)\n\nThe financial impacts of the transition to AASB 16 on lease and employee benefit liabilities in 2020 included an increase in lease liabilities to $167,154 thousand and a slight rise in employee benefit liabilities to $4,092 thousand."}

The fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management’s estimates and assumptions [1]. Developed technology and customer relationships were assigned fair values of $215 million and $61 million respectively, with estimated useful lives of 4 and 8 years [7]. Goodwill of $10,806 million was recorded, primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities [5]. This is reflected in image5, which shows a significant amount of goodwill ($10,806) alongside other intangible assets and liabilities [image5].\n\nIn contrast, for the **Salesforce.org acquisition**, the Company paid a one-time cash payment of $300 million for all shares of Salesforce.org [5]. A non-cash charge of $166 million was recorded due to the favorable terms of the reseller agreement, which provided products and services at no cost to Salesforce.org [4].

Let’s explore this in detail.\n\nFirst, the **Reported GAAP Measure** for PBNA is reflected in the overall financial performance of PepsiCo as a whole. According to image4, the total **Operating Profit** for PepsiCo decreased by 2% from $10,291 million in 2019 to $10,080 million in 2020. While this figure represents the entire company, it includes the impact of all segments, including PBNA. However, more specific information about PBNA's reported GAAP operating profit can be inferred from image5, which details segment-level adjustments. The **Total Core, Non-GAAP Measure** for all segments was $10,531 million in 2020 compared to $10,602 million in 2019, indicating a slight decline. This suggests that PBNA, along with other segments, likely experienced a reduction in its reported GAAP measure due to factors such as restructuring charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and impairment charges.\n\nThe **Core Non-GAAP Measure** for PBNA, like other segments, was adjusted to exclude items affecting comparability. Specifically, adjustments included **restructuring and impairment charges**, **inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges**, and **mark-to-market net impact** [image5]. For example, in image12, we see that in 2020, PepsiCo recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41 million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. This impairment charge would have been included in the **Reported GAAP Measure** but excluded in the **Core Non-GAAP Measure** to provide a clearer view of underlying performance.\n\nAdditionally, **image6** provides insight into the percentage changes in PBNA’s performance. The **Reported % Change, GAAP Measure** for PBNA in 2020 was 4%, while the **Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure** was 2%. This indicates that the **Reported GAAP Measure** grew slightly faster than the **Core Non-GAAP Measure**, suggesting that some of the growth in the GAAP measure may have been influenced by non-recurring or one-time factors, such as acquisitions or currency fluctuations. Indeed, the **Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures** for PBNA in 2020 was -2%, which could have dampened the core non-GAAP growth rate [image6].\n\nFurthermore, **image12** highlights that the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights was $8.6 billion as of December 26, 2020, and there was a risk of impairment if future revenues did not meet expectations. This potential for impairment would also affect the **Reported GAAP Measure**, but not the **Core Non-GAAP Measure**, since impairment charges are typically excluded in non-GAAP calculations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the **Reported GAAP Measure** for PBNA showed a 4% increase in 2020, the **Core Non-GAAP Measure** showed a smaller organic growth of 2% [image6]. This difference was influenced by factors such as **impairment charges**, **restructuring costs**, **inventory fair value adjustments**, and **merger and integration expenses**, which were excluded in the non-GAAP calculation to reflect the underlying business performance more accurately. \n\n![PBNA's reported GAAP and core non-GAAP measures show a slight divergence due to adjustments for impairments and restructuring.](image6)"}

Let's break this down using relevant data:\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that **net cash provided by operating activities** for the year ended December 31, 2020, **decreased by $\\S0.3$ billion compared with 2019** [6]. This decrease was partially offset by favorable currency movements, but the overall trend indicates a reduction in cash inflows from operations.\n\nIn contrast, **net cash used in investing activities** decreased by $\\S0.7$ billion from 2019 to 2020 [2], which implies that the company used less cash for investments in 2020 than it did in 2019. This could be due to factors such as the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures.\n\nHowever, **net cash used in financing activities** increased by $\\S0.4$ billion from 2019 to 2020 [3], primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends, despite being partially offset by debt activity. This suggests that more cash was used in financing activities in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nNow, looking at image4, we see the **Net Cash Used in Financing Activities** was ($8,496) million in 2020 and ($8,061) million in 2019, confirming the increase in outflows from financing activities. Additionally, **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities** is listed as $9,812 million in 2020 and $10,090 million in 2019, aligning with the text’s mention of a decrease in operating cash flows [6].\n\nFinally, the **Net Cash Used in Investing Activities** for 2020 was ($1,200) million (based on the table), while in 2019 it was ($1,900) million, again supporting the claim that less cash was used in investing activities in 2020 [2].\n\nCombining these figures:\n- Net cash from operating activities: $9,812 million (2020) vs. $10,090 million (2019)\n- Net cash from investing activities: ($1,200) million (2020) vs. ($1,900) million (2019)\n- Net cash from financing activities: ($8,496) million (2020) vs. ($8,061) million (2019)\n\nThe overall **change in cash balance** can be calculated by summing these values:\n- For 2020: $9,812 - $1,200 - $8,496 = **$16 million**\n- For 2019: $10,090 - $1,900 - $8,061 = **$129 million**\n\nThis shows that the **overall cash balance increased by $16 million in 2020**, but it was significantly **lower than the $129 million increase in 2019**.\n\n![Overall cash balance change](image4)"}

The Annual Total Remuneration for directors is determined based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota’s share price, and individual performance evaluations [1]. This ensures that remuneration reflects not only the financial health of the company but also its market perception and the effectiveness of individual contributions.\n\nFor instance, consolidated operating income serves as a key indicator of business performance, with a 50% weight in the evaluation framework [7]. This metric is compared against a reference value of 1 trillion yen, which was set to support Toyota’s sustainable growth. In the most recent fiscal year, this figure reached 150% of the reference value, indicating strong performance [7].\n\nAdditionally, the volatility of Toyota’s share price is another critical factor in evaluating corporate value from the perspective of shareholders and investors [5]. This metric is assessed relative to the Nikkei stock average, ensuring that executives are held accountable for maintaining or improving Toyota’s market position [7].\n\nPerformance-linked remuneration, which constitutes the portion of total remuneration after deducting fixed payments, is directly influenced by these factors [1]. This structure aligns executive incentives with long-term corporate goals, including enhancing shareholder value and securing sustainable growth [9]. For example, Toyota aims to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30%, reflecting its commitment to stable dividend payments while reinvesting retained earnings into future growth areas such as environmental and safety technologies [9].\n\n![Toyota evaluates consolidated operating income as an indicator for business performance](image7)  \n![Toyota considers the volatility of its share price as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors](image7)\n\nThe evaluation process is further supported by detailed frameworks and transparent disclosures, as seen in Toyota’s governance structure [8]. This includes regular reviews of strategic shareholdings and constructive dialogues with institutional investors to enhance corporate value and ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations [4].\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration system effectively reflects business performance and shareholder value indicators through a balanced evaluation of financial metrics, market dynamics, and individual contributions."}

Additionally, the amortisation of these rights of use is calculated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease [3].\n\nIn 2020, the amortisation charge for the Right of Use was 1,532 million euros, while in 2021, it decreased to 1,454 million euros [2].

According to the data, total sales and revenues for 2021 were $50.971 billion, an increase of 22 percent from 2020 [2]. This growth was primarily due to higher sales volume, which was fueled by increased end-user demand for equipment and services, along with the impact of changes in dealer inventories [9]. In addition, favorable price realization also played a significant role in boosting revenue [9].\n\nThe Construction Industries segment experienced the most significant improvement, with total sales increasing by $5.188 billion, or 31 percent, compared to 2020 [3]. This increase was attributed to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and favorable currency impacts related to the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar [3]. The segment's performance is further supported by the profit data, where Construction Industries showed a profit increase of $1,333 million, or 56 percent, from 2020 to 2021 [image1].\n\nResource Industries also saw notable improvements, with total sales rising by $2.057 billion, or 26 percent, compared to 2020 [8]. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by increased end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, as well as favorable price realization [6].\n\nEnergy & Transportation demonstrated a more moderate but still substantial increase, with total sales rising by $2.817 billion, or 16 percent, compared to 2020 [11].

For instance, **net interest income** for Consumer Banking dropped by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, primarily due to lower interest rates, although this was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [2]. Similarly, **noninterest income** fell by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a decline in service charges due to higher deposit balances and reduced card income from decreased client activity [2]. The overall **total revenue, net of interest expense**, for Consumer Banking also decreased, reflecting these trends [6].\n\nNet income for Consumer Banking plummeted by $6.5 billion to $6.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, largely attributed to lower revenue, higher provisions for credit losses, and increased expenses [2]. This is further supported by data showing that **net income** for the Deposits portion of Consumer Banking dropped from $8.254 billion in 2019 to $4.196 billion in 2020, while **Consumer Lending** net income fell from $4.708 billion to $2.311 billion [6].\n\nOn the other hand, the **Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)** segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, showed a more nuanced picture. MLGWM revenue decreased by 5% to $15.292 billion in 2020 from $16.112 billion in 2019, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, though this was somewhat offset by higher market valuations and positive AUM flows [7]. Meanwhile, Bank of America Private Bank revenue declined by 4% to $3.292 billion in 2020 compared to $3.426 billion in 2019, also driven by lower interest rates [12].\n\nDespite the decline in revenue, **client balances** for GWIM grew substantially. Total client balances increased to $3.3498 trillion in 2020 from $3.0478 trillion in 2019, with significant growth in assets under management and brokerage and other assets [7]. However, **net income** for GWIM is not explicitly detailed in the text quotes, but the general trend suggests that while revenue dipped slightly, asset growth and client flows likely helped maintain some level of profitability.\n\n![Client balances for GWIM increased significantly in 2020](image7)\n\n![Consumer Banking experienced a decline in both revenue and net income in 2020](image6)\n\nIn summary, **Consumer Banking** saw a sharp decline in both revenue and net income in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by lower interest rates, higher credit losses, and reduced client activity. In contrast, **Global Wealth & Investment Management** faced a modest revenue decline but achieved substantial growth in client balances, suggesting resilience in its wealth management operations."}

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $2,005 million [5]. By 2019, it rose to $2,731 million [5], and in 2020, it surged to $6,346 million [5]. This substantial growth can be attributed to several factors.\n\nOne of the most significant contributors to this change was the **foreign currency translation adjustment**. In 2018, there was a loss of $632 million due to these adjustments [5], whereas in 2019, the loss was much smaller at $75 million [5]. However, in 2020, the company recorded a **foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2.9 billion** [3], which played a pivotal role in the overall increase in comprehensive income. This gain was driven by favorable movements in exchange rates, particularly in markets where the company operates, leading to higher reported profits when converted back to the reporting currency.\n\nAnother factor was the **pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments**, which contributed to the comprehensive income. In 2018, this category resulted in a loss of $13 million [5], and in 2019, it was a loss of $90 million [5].

This suggests that the company generated more cash from its operations than it reported in net income or comprehensive income, which may be due to non-cash items like depreciation, amortization, and changes in working capital.\n\nFor instance, in 2018, while net income was relatively high at $12,515 million, net cash provided by operating activities was only $9,415 million, indicating that some of the income was not yet reflected in actual cash inflows. Conversely, in 2020, despite a lower net income of $7,120 million, the company still generated significant cash flow of $10,613 million from operations, showing strong operational efficiency.\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities was higher than net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo](image4)\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo were lower than net cash provided by operating activities](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, PepsiCo’s net cash provided by operating activities was consistently higher than both its net income and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo from 2018 to 2020."}

These assumptions include key factors such as discount rates, expected compensation increases, pension progression, and mortality rates [3]. \n\nFor instance, a **10% reduction in mortality rates** for all beneficiaries led to an increase in the defined benefit obligation by €110 million as of September 30, 2021 (compared to €109 million in 2020) [4]. This highlights how demographic assumptions directly affect the calculated obligation.\n\nIn terms of **discount rates**, the rate decreased slightly from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the euro, while other currencies like the U.S. dollar saw a more significant increase from 2.4% to 2.7% [image2]. A change in the discount rate has a substantial effect on the defined benefit obligation: for example, a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the obligation by €271 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020 [image7].\n\nSimilarly, changes in **compensation increases** and **pension progression** also had measurable impacts. For example, a 1% increase in compensation would raise the defined benefit obligation by €16 million in 2021 (€11 million in 2020), while a 1% increase in pension progression would lead to an increase of €158 million in both years [image7].\n\nPlan assets were also affected by these assumptions. As of September 30, 2021, the fair value of plan assets totaled €3,259 million, with significant portions allocated to fixed income securities (€1,590 million) and corporate bonds (€1,369 million) [image6]. These asset allocations are part of Siemens Healthineers’ liability-driven investment approach, which aims to align investments with the defined benefit obligation [12].\n\n![The table provides detailed financial data related to defined benefit plans across different fiscal years, focusing on components such as the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the effects of the asset ceiling.](image1)\n\n![The table presents percentage rates for different financial indicators as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020, including discount rates for various currencies.](image2)\n\n![The table provides data on compensation increases and pension progression rates for two different years, 2021 and 2020, for specific countries.](image3)\n\n![The table shows actuarial gains and losses in millions of euros for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, highlighting the impact of changes in assumptions.](image4)\n\n![The table provides information on actuarial assumptions or demographic projections used in different countries as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.](image5)\n\n![The table displays financial data in millions of euros as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020, including various categories of assets.](image6)\n\n![The table shows the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage point in three categories: Discount rate, Compensation increase, and Pension progression.](image7)\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions between 2020 and 2021 had a notable impact on both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets, influencing their valuation through variations in discount rates, demographic projections, and financial market conditions."}

This can be understood by examining the evolution of RWA and TLAC over this period.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the total RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Specifically, under the Standardized Approach, RWA rose from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020 [image3], while under the Advanced Approach, it increased from $382,496 million to $445,151 million [image3]. These increases were driven by multiple factors, including credit risk RWA, which grew due to higher exposure in derivatives, investment securities, and lending commitments [12]; market risk RWA, which increased due to heightened volatility and higher Regulatory VaR [8]; and operational risk RWA, which saw a decrease in the Advanced Approach due to lower litigation-related losses [1].\n\nDespite the increase in RWA, the External TLAC also rose significantly, from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020 [image7]. As a result, the ratio of External TLAC to RWA improved from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [image7]. While this represents a slight decline in the percentage, the absolute value of TLAC still increased, indicating that the institution maintained a strong loss-absorbing capacity relative to its growing risk-weighted assets.\n\nThis trend aligns with regulatory requirements for covered BHCs, which mandate maintaining minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of either 18% of total RWA or 7.5% of total leverage exposure [6].

For the U.S., company-operated sales decreased by 4% in 2020 [4], while franchised revenues declined by 2% [image4]. This suggests that the U.S. market was less severely impacted than other regions, though it still faced challenges. Meanwhile, the International Operated Markets segment faced a much steeper decline: company-operated sales dropped by 19% and franchised revenues fell by 14% [image4]. These figures are consistent with broader trends reported in the text, which indicate that the International Operated Markets were significantly affected by the temporary restaurant closures and limited operations due to the pandemic [12].\n\nLooking at **growth rates**, the U.S. segment showed minimal change, with a 0% growth rate in 2020 (excluding currency translation) compared to a 5% increase in 2019 [image5]. In contrast, the International Operated Markets experienced a sharp decline of 13% in 2020, down from a 3% growth in 2019 [image5]. This dramatic shift is also reflected in the overall financial data, where the International Operated Markets contributed to a significant portion of the total revenue decline in 2020 [image7].\n\nThe changes in these segments were heavily influenced by the **impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**. The text explicitly states that the International Operated Markets experienced sales declines as a result of the pandemic, with over $100 million spent on marketing support to accelerate recovery [6]. Additionally, the operating income decrease in this segment was attributed to sales declines, increased expenses related to employee costs, personal protective equipment, and other pandemic-related measures [4]. In the U.S., while sales were more resilient, the Company still incurred higher depreciation costs linked to investments in Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\") and supported marketing efforts, such as free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers [5].\n\n![U.S. and International Operated Markets Revenue Declines](image4)\n\nThese trends highlight how the pandemic disproportionately affected different markets, with the International Operated Markets suffering more severe financial impacts due to stricter lockdowns and operational restrictions in key countries like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [10]. \n\nIn summary, the U.S. segment maintained relative stability, while the International Operated Markets experienced significant declines in both revenue composition and growth rates from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the effects of the pandemic."}

The underlying trading operating profit for these segments was CHF 2,652 million, showing a growth rate of 24.1% compared to previous periods [12].\n\nIn contrast, Zone AMS reported a significant decline in sales for milk products and ice cream, with values dropping from CHF 7,291 million in 2019 to CHF 5,288 million in 2020. This decrease is reflected in the overall sales figures for the zone, which dropped from CHF 37,828 million to CHF 34,010 million [7]. Despite this decline, the underlying trading operating profit margin for the zone remained relatively stable at 20.5%, indicating some efficiency in managing costs despite the drop in sales [4].\n\nAdditionally, in Zone AOA, milk products and ice cream also experienced a decline in sales, with milk products decreasing from CHF 4,982 million to CHF 4,862 million and ice cream declining from CHF 2,835 million to CHF 920 million. However, the pet care segment saw an increase in sales, which might have offset some of the losses in other areas [3].\n\nThese variations highlight the differing performances of milk products and ice cream across various geographical zones, influenced by factors such as market conditions, consumer preferences, and operational efficiencies.\n\n![Milk products and ice cream accounted for 91.6% of total sales in Zone EMENA](image5)"}

According to the financial data, **net interest income (NII) for 2020 was $27.6bn**, representing a decrease of $2.9bn or 9.5% compared with 2019 [9]. This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which negatively affected the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA). However, this decrease was partially offset by the increase in AIEA, which grew by $170.1bn or 8.8% [9].\n\nInterest expense also declined significantly, as shown in the table in image1, where **interest expense for the year ended 31 Dec 2020 was $14,178 million**, compared to higher values in previous years. This reduction in interest expense helped mitigate some of the negative effects of the drop in net interest income.\n\nThe impact of these changes is further reflected in the net interest margin (NIM), which fell to 1.32% in 2020, down 26 basis points from 2019 [2]. The NIM decrease was partly attributed to the reduction in the yield on AIEA by 84 basis points, although this was somewhat offset by the fall in funding costs of average interest-bearing liabilities by 67 basis points [2].\n\nIn addition, the **net operating income before credit provisions** was impacted by the change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL), which increased significantly in 2020 [1]. These factors, combined with the lower net interest income, led to a notable decline in net operating income. As a result, **reported profit before tax decreased by 34% to $8.8bn**, while adjusted profit before tax dropped by 45% to $12.1bn [1].\n\nThe overall profitability of the organization was further weakened by the fact that **return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was only 3.1%**, a sharp decline from the previously targeted range of 10% to 12% [1]. This highlights the broader impact of the reduced net interest income and the associated challenges in maintaining profitability amid the economic environment shaped by the Covid-19 outbreak and global interest rate reductions.\n\n![Net Interest Income and Expense Changes](image1)  \n![Significant Items Impacting Profitability](image2)"}

According to the data, as of December 31, 2021, there were **34.2 million total customer relationships**, which includes **31.7 million residential** and **2.5 million business services** customers. This number represents the total number of customers who have subscribed to the company’s services.\n\nThe total number of **homes and businesses passed**—that is, those that can be connected to the cable distribution system without further infrastructure development—is **61 million** [5]. The **penetration rate** is calculated by dividing the total number of customer relationships by the number of homes and businesses passed, resulting in a **57% penetration rate** [5].\n\nThis level of penetration indicates that nearly **57% of the homes and businesses that could be served are currently subscribed to the company's services**. This metric is crucial for understanding market saturation and identifying areas where the company may need to invest in marketing or infrastructure to increase its customer base.\n\nTo understand how this distribution looks across the United States, we can refer to the map described in image1. The map highlights the **cable distribution footprint** of the service provider, with **blue areas** indicating regions covered by the cable network. Additionally, **black circles** represent cities with varying levels of customer relationships: **medium circles** (250,000–500,000) and **large circles** (500,000+). Labeled cities include major metropolitan areas such as **Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Atlanta, and Miami**, among others [image1].\n\nThis visual representation shows that the company has a significant presence in major urban centers, which likely contributes to the high penetration rates observed in these areas. However, the map also suggests that the distribution of customer relationships is not uniform across the country, with some regions having higher concentrations of customers than others.\n\n![The map highlights the cable distribution footprint and customer relationship concentrations across the United States](image1)"}

For instance, Zone AOA reported an organic growth rate of +0.5% [1], which was modest and accompanied by a decrease in the underlying trading operating profit margin by 30 basis points to 22.2% [5]. This decline was attributed to factors such as commodity inflation and costs related to the pandemic.\n\nIn contrast, Zone EMENA experienced a much stronger performance, recording its best organic growth in five years at +7.9% [8]. This growth was supported by strong Real Internal Growth (RIG) of +7.3% and pricing of +0.6% [9]. The underlying trading operating profit margin for this zone increased by 90 basis points to 19.6% [9], indicating improved profitability despite external challenges.\n\nZone AMS also showed positive results, with an organic growth rate of +4.8% and a Real Internal Growth rate of +4.1% [3]. The underlying trading operating profit margin for this zone increased by 40 basis points to 20.5% [10], reflecting effective cost management and portfolio optimization.\n\nMeanwhile, Zone AOA's financial data further highlights the challenges faced in that region. Sales decreased by 6.3% to CHF 20.7 billion [1], and while the underlying trading operating profit margin remained at 22.2%, it had decreased by 30 basis points compared to the previous year [5]. ![Zone AOA's sales and profit figures](image2).\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Other businesses\" segment, which includes Nespresso and Nestlé Health Science, demonstrated robust organic growth of +7.9% [11], driven by RIG of +7.3% and pricing of +0.6%. The underlying trading operating profit margin for these businesses increased by 90 basis points to 19.6% [9].\n\nOverall, the comparison reveals that while some zones like EMENA and AMS performed strongly with high organic growth and improved profit margins, others like AOA faced challenges with lower growth and declining margins. These variations highlight the diverse market conditions and operational strategies across Nestlé’s global operations. \n\nIn summary, Nestlé’s organic growth rates and trading operating profit margins varied across its geographic zones in 2020, with some regions showing strong performance and others facing challenges."}

This is a key indicator of a company's financial health and reflects the net worth of the company. The changes in shareholders’ equity over the years are detailed in image7, which shows a summary of changes in shareholders’ equity from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2020. According to this table, the ending balance of total shareholders’ equity increased from 2018 to 2020, reflecting growth in retained earnings, comprehensive income, and other factors such as share-based compensation and stock option exercises. Specifically, the table indicates that the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) also played a role in these changes, influenced by items like pensions, cash flow hedges, and foreign currency translation [7].\n\nNext, let’s examine the **number of systemwide restaurants**. Image8 provides a breakdown of the number of restaurants operated by McDonald's across different categories—conventional franchised, developmental licensed, foreign affiliated, and company-operated—from 2018 to 2020. From this data, we can see that the total systemwide restaurants increased from 37,855 in 2018 to 39,198 in 2020. This represents a steady growth in the number of restaurants, with increases in all categories, including conventional franchised, developmental licensed, and foreign affiliated restaurants [8].\n\n![Increase in shareholders' equity from 2018 to 2020](image7)  \n![Growth in systemwide restaurant count from 2018 to 2020](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's total shareholders’ equity increased from 2018 to 2020, and the number of systemwide restaurants also grew during this period."}

This decline reflects the impact of accumulated amortization over time and potential changes in the valuation of specific intangible asset categories. \n\nLooking at individual components, developed technology, which is a major category of finite-lived intangible assets, saw its net carrying amount decrease from $220 million in 2019 to $194 million in 2020. Similarly, favorable contracts and leases, net, also declined from $89 million in 2019 to $81 million in 2020. These reductions are consistent with the ongoing amortization of these assets.\n\nAmortization expenses for finite-lived intangible assets are not explicitly provided in the text quotes, but they can be inferred from the changes in accumulated amortization.

These changes are influenced by acquisitions, operational growth, and the impact of new accounting standards such as ASC 840 for operating leases.\n\nFor **lease assets**, the composition and value have increased significantly from 2019 to 2020. According to image4, operating lease ROU (Right of Use) assets rose from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020. This increase is attributed to the acquisition of Cytiva and other business activities during the year. The liabilities associated with these lease assets also grew: total operating lease liabilities were $797 million in 2019 and increased to $974 million in 2020. The weighted average remaining lease term remained stable at 7 years, but the discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020. This shift in discount rates affects the present value of future lease payments, which in turn influences the reported liabilities on the balance sheet. Additionally, operating lease expenses, including both fixed and variable components, increased from $241 million in 2019 to $262 million in 2020 [image3].\n\nRegarding **inventories**, the company also experienced a substantial increase in value from 2019 to 2020. As outlined in image6, the total inventory for 2020 was $2,292 million compared to $1,628 million in 2019. This increase was driven by higher sales volumes and the inclusion of inventories from the Cytiva Acquisition. The breakdown of inventory categories shows that finished goods increased the most, rising from $833 million in 2019 to $1,232 million in 2020, followed by raw materials, which grew from $510 million to $691 million. Work-in-process inventory also increased, albeit less dramatically, from $285 million to $369 million. This growth in inventory reflects the company’s expansion and its ability to meet rising demand, particularly in high-growth markets [12]. However, it also impacts the cash conversion cycle, as noted in text quote [3], which measures the number of days between paying for raw materials and collecting cash from customers.\n\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories are reflected in the company’s financial statements. The increase in lease liabilities and assets impacts the balance sheet, while the rise in inventory levels affects working capital and the cash conversion cycle, influencing operating cash flows. For instance, the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $161 million in 2019 [3]. This slight improvement in cash flow usage suggests better management of the cash conversion cycle despite the inventory increase. Meanwhile, the growing lease liabilities indicate a long-term commitment to operating leases, which is reflected in the operating lease expense on the income statement and the corresponding liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nIn summary, the composition and value of the company’s lease assets and inventories increased significantly between 2019 and 2020 due to the Cytiva Acquisition and higher operational activity. These changes are clearly reflected in the financial statements through increases in lease liabilities, operating lease expenses, and inventory levels, all of which influence the company’s liquidity, profitability, and overall financial health."}

Additionally, the valuation allowance decreased by $1 million in 2020, while it increased by $8 million and $7 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively [9]. This indicates that the company was more confident in the realizability of its deferred tax assets in 2020 than in previous years.\n\nFurthermore, there were notable changes in tax positions during this period. For instance, reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2020 included a $249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position [1]. This reduction would have positively impacted the net deferred tax asset by increasing the amount of tax benefits recognized.\n\n![Reduction in tax liabilities due to settlement of uncertain tax position](image1)\n\nIn addition, the deferred tax liabilities also changed between 2019 and 2020.

If the performance targets are not met, the value of these rights may not be realized, which could impact S Fallscheer’s overall financial outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that no units were exercised or vested during the year [5] implies that the realization of these benefits is contingent on future performance, which introduces uncertainty into S Fallscheer’s financial planning.\n\nIn summary, S Fallscheer experienced an increase in shareholdings and remuneration from FY19 to FY20, primarily through the granting of new performance rights under the FY20 LTIP. While this enhances potential long-term financial gains, it also ties a significant portion of their compensation to future performance, introducing both opportunity and risk."}

Let's break this down using the available data.\n\nFirst, **cost of revenues** increased significantly over the years. In 2019, the total cost of revenues was RMB16,761 million, with service costs accounting for 89.3% of this amount [6]. By 2021, the total cost of revenues had risen to RMB21,840 million (US$3,427 million), with service costs making up 87.0% of the total [6]. This increase in service costs is primarily due to higher content-related expenses such as royalties paid to music labels, in-house production costs, and fees paid to content creators under revenue-sharing arrangements [8]. Additionally, other costs of revenues, including advertising agency fees and payment channel fees, also rose from RMB1,794 million in 2019 to RMB2,848 million in 2021 [2]. This suggests that the company expanded its operations and invested more in content delivery and platform support, aligning with its growth in online music and social entertainment services.\n\n![Cost of Revenues Breakdown](image6)\n\nNext, looking at **operating expenses**, we see a rise in both selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. For instance, selling and marketing expenses grew from RMB2,041 million in 2019 to RMB2,678 million in 2021, representing an increase of about 31% [12]. Similarly, general and administrative expenses rose from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,009 million in 2021, indicating a 48% increase [10]. These expenses include salaries, professional service fees, amortization of intangible assets, and research and development costs [10]. The company emphasized its continued investment in R&D to maintain competitive advantages in product and technology innovation, which likely contributed to these rising costs [10].\n\n![Operating Expenses Breakdown](image2)\n\nDespite the significant increases in both cost of revenues and operating expenses, the company managed to maintain profitability, as reflected in its profit for the year, which remained relatively stable at RMB3,977 million in 2019, RMB4,176 million in 2020, and RMB3,215 million (US$505 million) in 2021 [4]. This indicates effective financial management, where the company balanced its growing operational costs with revenue generation strategies.\n\n![Profit and Adjusted Profit Overview](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing cost structure and operating expenses from 2019 to 2021 suggest that the company was actively expanding its services, investing in R&D, and enhancing user acquisition and retention efforts. While these investments led to higher expenses, they were managed in a way that preserved profitability, reflecting sound financial stewardship and strategic planning."}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million (or $829 million adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to 2019 [7]. This increase was primarily driven by factors such as intra-entity sales of intellectual property and higher returns on pension plan assets [9]. These developments suggest that IBM was investing in long-term assets, which could indicate confidence in future growth or a strategic shift toward more durable capital investments.\n\nIn contrast, long-term debt remained relatively stable, with only a slight decrease from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [8]. However, the broader context of total company debt shows a decrease of $1,361 million (or $2,859 million adjusted for currency) from 2019 to 2020, largely due to early retirements and maturities of debt [12]. This suggests that IBM was managing its debt effectively, reducing its overall debt burden while maintaining sufficient financing for operations and growth initiatives.\n\nFrom a cash flow perspective, financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 [2]. This change highlights a shift in liquidity management, where the company used more cash for financing purposes in 2020, possibly due to debt repayments or investment in long-term assets. Additionally, equity decreased by $258 million in 2020, mainly due to dividends paid and declines in accumulated other comprehensive income, though this was partially offset by increases from net income [6].\n\n![Increase in noncurrent assets driven by intra-entity IP sales and pension returns](image7)\n![Stable long-term debt with slight fluctuations in total company debt](image8)\n\nThe interplay between these changes—increased noncurrent assets, managed debt levels, and shifts in cash flows and equity—suggests that IBM maintained a balanced approach to financial management in 2020, prioritizing long-term stability and growth while navigating liquidity challenges. \n\nIn summary, the increase in noncurrent assets and stable long-term debt between 2019 and 2020 reflect IBM’s focus on long-term investments and prudent debt management, contributing to a stable overall financial standing despite liquidity adjustments."}

This decline in credit card purchase volumes was driven by the impact of the pandemic, with a decrease of $\\S26.3$ billion to $\\S251.6$ billion [10]. Despite this, debit card purchase volumes increased by $\\S23.8$ billion to $\\S384.5$ billion, likely reflecting a shift in consumer preference toward contactless or safer payment methods during the pandemic [10]. Additionally, the gross interest yield for credit cards slightly declined from 10.76% in 2019 to 10.27% in 2020 [7], which may indicate a reduction in average interest rates or a change in the risk profile of the portfolio.\n\nRegarding **home equity**, the outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $\\S5.9$ billion in 2020 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [1]. The data also indicates that at December 31, 2020, 80% of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, while 12% was in All Other, with the remainder in GWIM [1]. Furthermore, the home equity production in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation decreased by $\\S2.8$ billion and $\\S3.0$ billion, respectively, in 2020, primarily driven by a decline in applications [2].\n\n![Credit card purchase volumes declined by $\\S26.3$ billion to $\\S251.6$ billion in 2020 compared to 2019](image7)  \n![Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $\\S5.9$ billion in 2020](image2)\n\nThese changes suggest that consumers were more cautious with their spending and borrowing during the pandemic. The decline in credit card usage could be attributed to reduced discretionary spending, particularly in sectors like travel and entertainment, while the increase in debit card usage may reflect a shift toward essential spending. Similarly, the decrease in home equity production and balances might indicate a slowdown in consumer confidence and a more conservative approach to leveraging home equity for personal or business purposes."}

These impacts are primarily driven by fluctuations in market prices, which influence revenue, EBITDA, and overall profitability.\n\nFor coal, the report highlights that a decrease in average realised prices directly affects revenue and underlying EBITDA. For instance, lower prices for metallurgical coal and LNG partially offset higher prices for other commodities like iron ore and copper [7]. Additionally, the report notes that lower volumes and increased controllable cash costs, such as maintenance expenses at Queensland Coal, further impacted the financial performance of coal operations [2]. The cost per tonne for Queensland Coal also rose due to higher diesel prices and increased stripping requirements, despite efforts to optimize mine plans and improve efficiency [3].\n\nRegarding nickel, the report indicates that higher prices positively impacted Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West, driven by increased prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns in the prior year [9]. However, this benefit was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs due to the stronger nickel price [9]. \n\nThe financial impact of these price changes is quantified in detail in the report. For example, a $1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 profit after taxation of $163 million, while a $1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would impact it by $24 million [4]. Similarly, for nickel, a $1 per pound increase in price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million [5].\n\n![Financial impact of commodity price changes](image5)"}

This represents a decrease of $(1,982) million, or a decline of 448% from the previous year [2]. The drop in net interest income can be attributed to factors such as lower interest rates, reduced loan balances due to soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, and the sale of the student loan portfolio in the first half of 2021 [7].\n\nOn the other hand, noninterest income saw a substantial increase, rising to $10,036 million in 2021 from $4,916 million in 2020 [2].

Specifically, it shows the following values for Level 2 assets:\n\n- **Cash Equivalents:**\n  - Time deposits: $746\n  - Money market mutual funds: $1,293\n\n- **Marketable Securities:**\n  - Corporate notes and obligations: $2,207\n  - U.S. treasury securities: $183\n  - Mortgage backed obligations: $226\n  - Asset backed securities: $781\n  - Municipal securities: $158\n  - Foreign government obligations: $69\n  - U.S. agency obligations: $12\n  - Time deposits: $1\n  - Covered bonds: $165\n\n- **Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts:** $28\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total value of Level 2 assets:\n\n$$\n746 + 1,293 + 2,207 + 183 + 226 + 781 + 158 + 69 + 12 + 1 + 165 + 28 = 5,571\n$$\n\nThus, the total value of assets categorized under \"Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\" as of January 31, 2020 is **$5,571 million**.\n\n![Total Level 2 Assets as of January 31, 2020](image5)"}

These can include things like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and customer relationships. The composition and useful life of intangible assets vary depending on their nature and the accounting standards they fall under.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we learn that intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to thirty years [5]. This means that the company spreads the cost of these assets evenly over their expected period of use or benefit. Additionally, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing [10].\n\nIn the context of acquisitions, intangible assets are identified and valued based on their fair value at the acquisition date [7]. For example, in one acquisition, $36 million was attributed to intangible assets, primarily related to purchased technology with estimated useful lives ranging from one to nine years [11]. This highlights how the useful life of intangible assets is determined by the nature of the asset and its expected contribution to future cash flows.\n\nImage4 provides specific details about the composition and useful life of certain intangible assets. It lists:\n\n- **Developed technology**: Fair Value = $102, Useful Life = 9 years\n- **Customer relations**: Fair Value = $102, Useful Life = 9 years\n- **Trade name**: Fair Value = $1, Useful Life = 10 years\n\nThe total fair value of these intangible assets is $105. This table illustrates how different types of intangible assets have varying useful lives, with developed technology and customer relations having a shorter lifespan compared to trade names.\n\nFurthermore, image1 provides an overview of both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31 for the years 2020 and 2019. Finite-lived intangible assets include categories such as developed technology, trade names, favorable contracts and leases, and other intangible assets, each with accumulated amortization and net carrying amounts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as Gigafactory Nevada water rights, are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing.\n\nIn summary, the composition of intangible assets includes developed technology, trade names, favorable contracts and leases, and other intangible assets, each with specific useful lives ranging from one to thirty years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as certain water rights, are not amortized but require periodic impairment assessments. \n\n![Finite-lived intangible assets include developed technology, trade names, favorable contracts and leases, and others, with useful lives ranging from one to thirty years](image1)  \n![Specific intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relations, and trade names have defined useful lives of 9 and 10 years respectively](image4)"}

This represents a decline of $1,774 million over the one-year period. The decrease in equity can be attributed to several factors, including significant purchases of treasury stock and dividend payments, which are reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement [image1]. For instance, in 2018, 3M spent $4,870 million on purchasing treasury stock, compared to $2,068 million in 2017 [image1]. Additionally, dividends paid to shareholders increased from $2,803 million in 2017 to $3,139 million in 2018 [image1], further contributing to the reduction in equity.\n\nMeanwhile, total liabilities for 3M also increased during this period. As of December 31, 2017, total liabilities were $26,365 million, and by December 31, 2018, they had risen to $26,652 million [image2]. This reflects an increase of $287 million in liabilities over the same period. The rise in liabilities is partly explained by the issuance of debt, such as the $2.25 billion in medium-term notes issued in September 2018, which contributed to the overall increase in debt [image1].\n\nIn summary, while 3M’s total liabilities increased slightly by $287 million from 2017 to 2018, its total equity declined significantly by $1,774 million, primarily due to substantial treasury stock repurchases and higher dividend payouts. \n\n![Total equity decreased from $11,622 million in 2017 to $9,848 million in 2018](image2)  \n![Total liabilities increased from $26,365 million in 2017 to $26,652 million in 2018](image2)\n\nThe trend in 3M Company's total equity from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, shows a significant decline, while total liabilities increased slightly over the same period."}

In 2018, total capital expenditures were $2,742 million, which included $488 million for new restaurants, $2,111 million for existing restaurants, and $143 million for other expenses [7]. By 2019, capital expenditures dropped to $2,394 million, with $605 million allocated to new restaurants, $1,702 million to existing restaurants, and $87 million to other expenses [7]. The decline continued in 2020, with total capital expenditures reaching $1,641 million, including $535 million for new restaurants, $1,060 million for existing restaurants, and $46 million for other expenses [7]. This decrease was primarily attributed to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [11].\n\nRegarding shareholder returns, McDonald's returned substantial amounts to shareholders over these years. In 2018, the company returned $8,503 million to shareholders, which included $3,256 million in dividends and $5,247 million in treasury stock purchases [7]. In 2019, the total amount returned was $8,562 million, consisting of $3,582 million in dividends and $4,980 million in treasury stock purchases [7].

According to the text, \"Interest expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps\" [1]. This indicates that while the company's total debt increased, the interest rate swaps helped mitigate some of the additional expense.\n\nThe net interest and other income (expense) also saw a significant change. The text notes, \"Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate\" [4]. This suggests that despite the rise in interest expense, the overall net interest and other income (expense) improved due to gains from property sales and higher investment returns.\n\nIn terms of total non-operating income (expense), the data shows that it decreased significantly from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015. Specifically, \"Total Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\" dropped from ($51.3) million in fiscal 2014 to ($29.3) million in fiscal 2015, representing a decrease of 43% [8].

By 2022, this amount had increased to $\\S313$ [9].

Let’s explore how these components evolved from fiscal years 2019 to 2020.\n\n### Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL)\n\nAOCL includes various components such as foreign currency translation adjustments, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. These items are not part of net income but still affect equity.\n\n- **Foreign Currency Translation**: As noted in the text, assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, while revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the fiscal year [2]. The translation adjustments are included in AOCL. Additionally, gains and losses from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature are also reported in AOCL [2]. For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses recorded in AOCL are expected to be reclassified into earnings when related intercompany charges are recognized [5].\n\n- **Cash Flow Hedges**: Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCL. Specifically, for fiscal 2020, net gains of $\\S48,545$ were reclassified into Cost of services, while similar figures for 2019 and 2018 were $\\S48,333$ and $\\S93,105$, respectively [11]. These reclassifications indicate changes in the value of hedging instruments over time.\n\n- **Investments**: Investment-related gains and losses, such as those from the investment in Duck Creek Technologies, contribute to AOCL [3]. In fiscal 2020, gains of $\\S332$ million from this investment significantly impacted other income (expense), net [3].\n\n- **Defined Benefit Plans**: Components like actuarial gains or losses, pension settlement costs, and prior service costs also influence AOCL [7].\n\nThe detailed breakdown of AOCL components for fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020 can be found in the table described in image7, which provides beginning and ending balances along with relevant adjustments for each component of AOCL.\n\n![AOCL components include foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments](image7)\n\n### Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment represent the physical assets used by the company in its operations. Their values change due to additions, depreciation, and other adjustments.\n\n- **Buildings and Land**: From August 31, 2019 ($56 million) to August 31, 2020 ($61 million), there was an increase in the gross carrying amount of buildings and land [4].\n\n- **Computers, Related Equipment, and Software**: This category saw a significant increase from $1,723,623 million in 2019 to $1,978,380 million in 2020 [4].\n\n- **Furniture and Fixtures**: The value rose from $394,671 million in 2019 to $456,136 million in 2020 [4].\n\n- **Leasehold Improvements**: This category increased from $1,228,845 million in 2019 to $1,424,722 million in 2020 [4].\n\n- **Total Accumulated Depreciation**: Accumulated depreciation increased from $(1,956,029) million in 2019 to $(2,313,731) million in 2020 [4].\n\n- **Net Property and Equipment**: Despite the increases in gross values, the net property and equipment (after depreciation) also increased from $1,391,166 million in 2019 to $1,545,568 million in 2020 [4].\n\nThese changes reflect the company’s ongoing investments in physical assets and the associated depreciation over time.\n\n![Property and equipment values show increases in gross amounts and accumulated depreciation from 2019 to 2020](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom fiscal years 2019 to 2020, the components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss experienced changes driven by foreign currency translation, cash flow hedges, and investment-related gains. Meanwhile, Property and Equipment values increased, both in terms of gross carrying amounts and accumulated depreciation, indicating continued investment in physical assets."}

The issuance of MCPS provided substantial capital that contributed to the overall equity position of the company.\n\nIn 2019, Danaher completed the underwritten public offering of 1.72 million shares of its 5.0% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (\"MCPS Series B\"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.67 billion [4]. This infusion of capital would directly increase stockholders’ equity, as preferred stock is a component of equity on the balance sheet. Similarly, in 2020, the company raised additional capital through the issuance of common stock and MCPS, with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes [4]. These financings likely added to the value of preferred stock and retained earnings, contributing to the overall increase in total stockholders' equity.\n\nThe financial statements also reflect these changes in equity. For instance, the balance sheet shows that total Danaher stockholders’ equity was $30,271 million in 2019 and rose to $39,766 million in 2020 [image2]. This significant increase aligns with the large capital inflows from the issuance of preferred stock and common stock in 2019 and 2020.\n\nFrom the perspective of cash flow from financing activities, the 2020 statement of cash flows highlights that the company received substantial proceeds from stock issuances and borrowings, which were used to fund operations and acquisitions [image8]. These inflows supported the company’s ability to invest in growth opportunities, such as the Cytiva Acquisition, which was financed in part by proceeds from the issuance of MCPS and other debt instruments [4].\n\n![Danaher Corporation issued MCPS in 2019 and 2020, providing significant capital that increased stockholders' equity.](image2)  \n![Financing activities in 2020 included substantial proceeds from stock offerings and borrowings, supporting growth initiatives.](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flows from financing activities played a pivotal role in increasing Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020."}

This represents a significant rise of approximately $4,409 million, or about 17.8% year-over-year [6]. \n\nSeveral factors contributed to this increase. First, the company experienced a decrease in income tax payments in 2021, primarily due to tax deductions resulting from its senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion compared to the prior year [4]. This reduction in tax payments directly improved the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in proceeds from investments and other activities in 2021 was primarily due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments [3]. These higher cash inflows further supported the growth in operating cash flow.\n\nMoreover, the operating margin for the company was 43.7% in 2021, up from 42.1% in 2020, indicating improved efficiency and cost management [7].

This means that no portion of the incentive becomes exercisable unless the minimum EBIT growth target is achieved. As EBIT growth increases beyond this threshold, the percentage of exercisable incentives also increases in a tiered manner. At 17.5% compound growth in EBIT, 40% of the incentives become exercisable [7]. If the EBIT growth reaches 20%, then 60% of the incentives are exercisable, and at 22.5%, 80% becomes exercisable.

This breakdown allows for a clear understanding of the nature of the cash flows, whether they are inflows or outflows, and helps identify trends over time.\n\nFurthermore, the table's use of consistent formatting for each year (e.g., 2019, 2020, 2021) enables direct comparison across periods, reinforcing the observed trend in net cash from investing activities. \n\nIn summary, the **trend in Net Cash (used in) or provided by Investing Activities** from 2019 to 2021 shows a shift from a large inflow in 2019 to outflows in both 2020 and 2021, with the magnitude of the outflow decreasing slightly in 2021. The visual structure of the table in image3 facilitates this analysis by organizing the data into distinct categories and years, making it easier to track changes in cash flow patterns."}

However, we can infer some context from the available information.\n\nIn 2022, the net cash used in financing activities totaled $\\S2{,}283$ [3]. This was significantly lower than the $\\S6{,}488$ used in 2021 [3]. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 could be attributed to several factors, including reduced dividend payments, changes in stock repurchase programs, or adjustments in debt repayment strategies.

First, the profit (loss) of consolidated and affiliated companies increased substantially from **$3,003 million** in 2020 to **$6,493 million** in 2021 [6]. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization across various segments, including Resource Industries, Construction Industries, and Financial Products [2][4][6]. Additionally, lower restructuring expenses and a more favorable geographic mix of profits contributed to the rise in profitability [2].\n\nAnother key factor was the impact of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. In 2021, this figure was **$(665) million**, whereas in 2020 it was **$679 million** [6]. The decrease in other comprehensive income was largely due to mark-to-market losses related to pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, as opposed to gains in 2020 [3].

However, the number of employees who actually availed this leave is significantly lower, with only 1,025 females and 2,023 males taking advantage of the entitlement. This disparity highlights that while both genders have access to parental leave, fewer women are utilizing it compared to men.\n\nMoreover, the return-to-work rates after parental leave also show a difference between genders.

However, this is not the full picture, as other expenses such as interest and penalties, tax expenses, and corporate operating expenses also contribute to the overall net expense.\n\nLooking at the broader financial context, image7 provides a breakdown of interest expense, interest income, and pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) across 2016, 2017, and 2018. For 2016, the total net expense was $(26)$ million, while for 2017 it was $144$ million, and for 2018 it was $207$ million [image7].

This is evident from the table in image1, which shows that NBCUniversal’s revenue increased from $2,307 million in 2020 to $2,466 million in 2021, representing a 6.9% increase [1]. This growth can be attributed to increases in revenue across the Media, Theme Parks, and Studios segments, as noted in text quote [11]. Additionally, the inclusion of Peacock, Comcast’s direct-to-consumer streaming service, within the NBCUniversal segments likely contributed to this growth [2].\n\nSecondly, **Cable Communications** also contributed positively to the overall revenue increase. According to image1, Cable Communications’ revenue rose slightly from $7,753 million in 2020 to $7,811 million in 2021, a 0.7% increase. Text quote [11] further supports this, noting that the Cable Communications segment experienced growth driven by increased broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video, and other revenue, although this was partially offset by a decrease in voice revenue.\n\nThirdly, **Sky** showed substantial growth during this period. Image1 indicates that Sky’s revenue increased by 11.4% from 2020 to 2021, rising from $3,034 million to $3,379 million. This aligns with the broader trend of growth in the company’s international operations.\n\nMoreover, **comprehensive financial data** from image7 highlights the cumulative contributions of each segment to the overall revenue increase. The chart shows that the Cable Communications segment contributed an increase of $4,277 million, while the NBCUniversal segments contributed a larger increase of $7,108 million. The Sky segment added $1,691 million, leading to a total revenue increase of $12,841 million from 2020 to 2021, resulting in a final revenue figure of $116,385 million for 2021.\n\nFinally, **external events such as the Tokyo Olympics** had a notable impact on revenue. As stated in text quote [8], the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics contributed approximately $522 million in revenue for 2021, which, when excluded, still showed an increase in distribution revenue due to contractual rate increases and higher Peacock revenue.\n\nIn summary, the primary drivers of Comcast's revenue change from 2020 to 2021 were the growth in the NBCUniversal segments, particularly due to the inclusion of Peacock and increased revenue in the Media, Theme Parks, and Studios segments; the modest but positive contribution from the Cable Communications segment; significant revenue growth from the Sky segment; and external factors like the Tokyo Olympics broadcast.\n\n![Comcast's revenue growth from 2020 to 2021](image7)"}

These changes are reflected in various aspects of capital composition, regulatory requirements, and risk-weighted assets (RWA). \n\nFor **risk-based capital**, the data indicates that the institution maintained robust capital ratios well above the required minimums. Under the **Standardized Approach**, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio increased from 16.4% in 2019 to 17.4% in 2020, while the Tier 1 capital ratio rose from 18.6% to 19.4%, and the Total Capital ratio climbed from 21.0% to 21.5%. Similarly, under the **Advanced Approach**, the CET1 capital ratio grew from 16.9% to 17.7%, the Tier 1 capital ratio increased from 19.2% to 19.8%, and the Total Capital ratio improved from 21.5% to 21.8% [6]. This reflects a strengthening capital position over the year.\n\nThese improvements were supported by an increase in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which rose from $64,751 million in 2019 to $78,650 million in 2020, primarily due to higher retained earnings and the impact of the E*TRADE acquisition [2]. Additionally, the total capital also increased from $82,708 million to $97,213 million under the Standardized Approach and from $82,423 million to $96,994 million under the Advanced Approach [6].\n\nIn terms of **risk-weighted assets (RWA)**, the Standardized Approach reported a final balance of $453,106 million in 2020, compared to $394,177 million in 2019, while the Advanced Approach showed a final RWA of $445,151 million in 2020 versus $382,496 million in 2019 [6]. This increase was driven by higher credit risk RWA, particularly from derivatives exposure, investment securities, and lending commitments [12], as well as market risk RWA, which rose due to increased market volatility [10].\n\nRegarding **leverage-based capital**, the institution’s performance also improved from 2019 to 2020.

First, the global pandemic had a significant impact on retail operations, particularly in 2020, when up to 90% of stores were closed in the first quarter, and store openings were restricted in the final months of the year [11]. As restrictions eased, Inditex likely focused on expanding its presence in key markets to recover lost sales and capitalize on opportunities in regions where demand rebounded faster.\n\nAdditionally, Inditex has been actively involved in store optimization activities, including store openings, refurbishments, and absorptions [1]. The company absorbed between 1,000 and 1,200 stores during 2020 and 2021, aiming to streamline operations and focus on more profitable locations [12]. This strategy may have led to the closure of underperforming stores in some regions and the expansion in others, contributing to the observed geographical shifts.\n\n![Geographical distribution of stores in 2021](image1)  \n![Geographical distribution of stores in 2022](image8)\n\nThe overall growth in the number of stores suggests that Inditex is adapting to changing consumer behaviors and market conditions post-pandemic, with a strategic emphasis on optimizing its global footprint for long-term sustainability and profitability."}

This increase was primarily due to growth in premium revenues, which are derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements where the company assumes economic risk for its customers' healthcare costs [5]. Additionally, revenue at OptumHealth increased due to organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery, although this was partially offset by reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [4].\n\nAnother contributing factor was the **management of medical costs and other operating expenses**. While medical costs increased over the period, the company managed to improve its operational efficiency, as reflected in the growth of earnings from operations [image6]. Furthermore, the company's ability to estimate and recognize premium revenues based on projected rebates and risk adjustment methodologies allowed for more accurate financial reporting and planning [6].\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that **estimates and judgments**, particularly those related to medical costs payable and goodwill, play a crucial role in the company’s financial statements. These estimates involve complex assumptions and may change in subsequent periods, impacting earnings accordingly [1].\n\n![Net earnings increased from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,769 million in 2020](image2)  \n![Comprehensive income grew from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020](image2)\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020 due to higher revenues driven by growth in risk-based care delivery, effective management of operating costs, and accurate estimation of premium revenues."}

This suggests a growth in the company’s long-term investments or assets that are not expected to be converted into cash within a year, such as property, plant, equipment, or long-term investments. Such an increase may indicate strategic investments in infrastructure, technology, or other long-term initiatives.\n\nRegarding **long-term debt**, the figure remained relatively stable, with only a slight increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [image4].

This increase is likely driven by factors such as pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities, or other long-term commitments. The text also notes that noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased by $1,621 million in 2020, primarily due to factors like changes in intercompany loans and external financing arrangements [1].\n\n![Noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020](image4)\n![Long-term debt remained relatively stable at $54,102 million in 2019 and increased slightly to $54,355 million in 2020](image4)\n![Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020](image4)\n\nThese changes collectively suggest a balanced financial strategy where the company is investing in long-term assets while maintaining control over its debt levels and managing non-debt-related liabilities. The emphasis on deleveraging and strategic portfolio management—such as winding down certain financing businesses and focusing on hybrid cloud and AI offerings—supports this interpretation [10].

By 2020, the provision increased significantly to **$4,973 million**, corresponding to an effective tax rate of **24.0%** [7].\n\nThis increase in the provision for income taxes in 2020 compared to 2018 can be attributed to several factors outlined in the text and images:\n\n- The **Health Insurance Industry Tax (ACA Tax)** had a notable impact on the provision for income taxes in 2020, contributing **$626 million** (3.0%) to the total provision [7]. This tax was not applicable in 2019 but was significant in 2020 before its permanent repeal in 2021 [2].\n  \n- Additionally, the **deferred income tax provision or benefit** reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year [10]. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are detailed in image6, showing that the total deferred income tax liabilities were **$(6,758) million** in 2020 compared to **$(5,861) million** in 2019. This increase in deferred tax liabilities likely contributed to a higher overall provision for income taxes in 2020.\n\n- Furthermore, the **unrecognized tax benefits** mentioned in quote [9] totaled **$1.0 billion** as of December 31, 2020, which could influence future effective tax rates and provisions if recognized.\n\n![Health Insurance Industry Tax impact on provision for income taxes](image11)\n\n![Deferred income tax assets and liabilities affecting the provision for income taxes](image6)\n\nIn summary, the provision for income taxes increased from **$3,562 million in 2018** to **$4,973 million in 2020**, primarily due to the one-time impact of the ACA Tax in 2020 and changes in deferred tax liabilities."}

In contrast, the S&P 500 Index, which is a broad market index representing large-cap U.S. equities, started at $100 on January 31, 2016, and grew to $162 by January 31, 2021 [image4]. This indicates that Salesforce.com outperformed the S&P 500 Index over this period.\n\nThe growth of Salesforce.com’s stock return was also more pronounced during certain years. For example, in fiscal year 2020, Salesforce.com’s stock returned $269 from $100, while the S&P 500 Index returned only $136 [image4]. This suggests that Salesforce.com not only kept pace with but also significantly outperformed the broader market during the pandemic, when many industries faced challenges, but Salesforce was able to capitalize on the demand for digital transformation solutions.\n\nMoreover, Salesforce.com’s overall financial performance, including revenue growth and operating cash flow, was robust. Total revenue for fiscal 2020 reached $17.1 billion, marking a 29% increase year-over-year [7], and operating cash flow rose 27% to $4.3 billion [10].

In 2019, ENBREL saw an increase in global sales, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, although this was partially offset by lower unit demand [5]. However, in 2020, ENBREL experienced a decline in sales, with a 4% decrease globally compared to 2019, primarily due to lower unit demand and net selling price, despite some offsets from favorable changes in estimated sales deductions and inventory [4]. The table in image1 confirms this, showing a 4% drop in total ENBREL sales in 2020 compared to 2019, with U.S. sales declining by 4% and Canadian sales dropping by 20%. This decline is also attributed to the impact of the pandemic on patient visits and the increased competition from biosimilars, including a second FDA-approved biosimilar version of ENBREL introduced in April 2019 [9].\n\nIn contrast, Prolia showed consistent growth over the years. In 2019, Prolia's global sales increased by 17% compared to 2018, driven by higher unit demand [2]. For 2020, Prolia’s sales continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate, with a 3% increase globally compared to 2019, largely due to an increase in net selling price and favorable inventory changes, though this was partially offset by lower unit demand [6]. The table in image2 supports this, showing a 17% increase in total Prolia sales in 2019 and a 3% increase in 2020. However, the pandemic had a notable effect on Prolia’s demand patterns, as disruptions in patient visits altered the timing of semiannual doses and reduced new diagnoses of osteoporosis [11].\n\nIn summary, while ENBREL faced challenges from biosimilar competition and the effects of the pandemic, leading to declining sales, Prolia maintained steady growth, supported by pricing and inventory factors, despite some headwinds from reduced unit demand. \n\n![ENBREL sales decreased by 4% in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)  \n![Prolia sales increased by 3% in 2020 compared to 2019](image2)  \n\nENBREL sales declined in 2020 due to lower unit demand and net selling price, while Prolia sales increased due to higher net selling price and favorable inventory changes."}

This represents a notable increase in exposure to foreign currency fluctuations during the period, likely influenced by global economic conditions and market volatility [3].\n\nFor **interest rates**, the fair value impact was **$301 million at year-end** for December 31, 2019, with an average of $247 million, a high of $346 million, and a low of $169 million. By December 31, 2020, this had risen substantially to **$180 million at year-end**, with an average of $445 million, a high of $1,146 million, and a low of $180 million. The significant increase in the average and high values reflects heightened interest rate volatility, particularly due to the impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic** in early 2020 [3].\n\nThese changes highlight the increased sensitivity of PMI’s financial instruments to external market factors, such as interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, during the first quarter of 2020 [3]. \n\n![Foreign currency and interest rate fair value impacts for 2020 and 2019](image3)"}

According to text quote [11], the aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased in 2020 due to the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment, which was primarily driven by the continued economic effects of the pandemic. This increase was partially offset by charge-offs, but the overall trend was upward.\n\nThis change is further supported by image2, which shows that the total ACL at December 31, 2019, was $533 million, while it rose to $1,130 million by December 31, 2020. The table also highlights the effect of the CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss) adoption, which reduced the ACL by $58 million, and the substantial provision for credit losses of $733 million added during the year. These factors illustrate how the Firm adjusted its ACL in response to the heightened uncertainty and risk environment caused by the pandemic.\n\nKey contributing factors include:\n- **Economic Impact of COVID-19**: As noted in text quote [2], the provision for credit losses was largely due to actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to the uncertain outlook for certain sectors impacted by the pandemic.\n- **Charge-offs**: Charge-offs in 2020 were mainly linked to Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment, as outlined in text quote [11].\n- **Model Inputs and Assumptions**: The base scenario used in ACL models assumed a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures, yet this did not fully mitigate the need for an increased allowance.\n\n![The Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) increased significantly from $533 million in 2019 to $1,130 million in 2020, reflecting the economic impact of the pandemic and increased provisions for credit losses.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the Allowance for Credit Losses increased from $533 million in 2019 to $1,130 million in 2020, primarily due to the economic impact of the pandemic, increased provisions for credit losses, and adjustments related to the adoption of CECL."}

These efforts are embedded in its operations, sustainability strategy, and long-term goals, reflecting a commitment to responsible growth and climate action.\n\nIn terms of GHG emissions, Bank of America has made significant strides toward reducing its environmental footprint. The company has achieved carbon neutrality in its own operations and has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes—operations, financing activities, and supply chain—by 2050 [8]. This includes a reduction in energy use by 40% and location-based GHG emissions by 50%, along with sourcing renewable energy to power its facilities and purchasing carbon offsets for unavoidable emissions [4]. These actions align with global initiatives like the Paris Agreement and demonstrate leadership in climate risk management [1].\n\nRegarding air pollution, Bank of America reports emissions from its global sites, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter, and other pollutants. In 2019, the bank reported emissions of SOx (1 metric ton), NOx (20 metric tons), CO (32 metric tons), VOC (2 metric tons), and Particulate Matter (3 metric tons). The impact of these emissions was estimated at $146,000 based on social cost factors from the World Resources Institute’s assessment tool [image3]. This highlights the company’s awareness of the societal costs of its environmental impact and its efforts to quantify and mitigate them.\n\nThe financial and operational impacts of these environmental initiatives are evident in the company's broader sustainability strategy. For instance, the bank has issued over $9.85 billion in Green, Social, and Sustainability Bonds since 2013, supporting environmental and social projects globally [2]. Additionally, it is a leader in ESG-themed bond underwriting, having supported over 400 deals and provided funding for critical environmental initiatives [2]. These actions not only help reduce the company's environmental footprint but also contribute to broader societal goals, such as advancing racial equality, economic opportunity, and environmental sustainability [2].\n\nMoreover, Bank of America actively participates in global alliances focused on sustainable development, such as the U.N. Global Investors for Sustainable Development and the World Economic Forum Net-Zero Transition Finance Committee [1]. These partnerships reinforce the company’s role in shaping global standards for sustainable finance and climate action.\n\n![Bank of America reduced its energy use by 40% and location-based GHG emissions by 50% while sourcing renewable energy to power its facilities.](image4)\n\n![Bank of America reported emissions of NOx, SOx, and particulate matter in 2019, with an estimated societal impact of $146,000 based on social cost factors.](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, Bank of America addresses environmental issues through a combination of operational efficiency, strategic investments in sustainability, and active participation in global climate initiatives.

For example, one of the PAN India projects under the **CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)** initiative spent ₹24.73 crore [image1]. This reflects a significant investment aimed at addressing the widespread impact of the pandemic on public health and livelihoods.\n\nIn contrast, **Rural Development Projects** listed in **image3** show lower individual expenditures, with amounts ranging from ₹0.14 crore to ₹2.09 crore. These figures indicate that while rural development initiatives are numerous, each project receives relatively smaller funding compared to large-scale national efforts like those for **COVID Relief**.\n\n### Implementation Methods\n\nThe **implementation methods** differ significantly between these two types of projects. \n\n- For **COVID Relief** projects, the implementation is often conducted through various agencies such as **Setu Charitable Trust**, **National Health and Education Society**, **Give India**, and others, which are registered under CSR regulations [image1]. This method allows for rapid deployment and broader reach, especially during a crisis.\n  \n- On the other hand, **Rural Development Projects** are typically implemented **indirectly** through specific agencies such as **Sanjeevani Institute for Empowerment & Development** and **BAIF Development Research Foundation** [image3]. The indirect approach may involve collaboration with local organizations that have deeper grassroots connections and expertise in rural development.\n\n### Project Scope\n\nThe **scope** of these projects also varies. **COVID Relief** projects are generally broad in nature, targeting areas like **healthcare support**, **rehabilitation for vulnerable groups**, and **disaster management**, often on a **national scale** [image1].\n\nIn contrast, **Rural Development Projects** focus more on **localized initiatives**, such as improving access to education, promoting environmental sustainability, and enhancing livelihood opportunities within specific districts or states [image3].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, **COVID Relief** projects tend to be **larger in financial outlay**, implemented through **multiple agencies** with a **national scope**, while **Rural Development** projects are **smaller in expenditure**, implemented **indirectly** through **local agencies** with a **localized focus**. ![Rural Development Projects have localized focus and smaller financial outlay](image3) ![COVID Relief projects have larger financial outlay and national scope](image1)"}

This was partially offset by a net earnings figure of $12,382 million [7].\n\nBy 2019, the company’s comprehensive income increased to $14,821 million. This growth was supported by a rise in net earnings to $14,239 million, along with a positive other comprehensive income of $582 million. The foreign currency translation losses were less severe compared to 2018, at ($271) million [7].\n\nIn 2020, comprehensive income reached $15,533 million, reflecting an increase in net earnings to $15,769 million. However, this year saw a notable negative impact from foreign currency translation losses of ($983) million and other comprehensive (loss) income of ($236) million [7]. Despite these challenges, the company's strong net earnings helped maintain a steady upward trend in comprehensive income.\n\nThe factors contributing to these changes include:\n\n- **Net Earnings Growth**: UnitedHealth Group experienced consistent growth in net earnings, driven by increases in consolidated revenues and earnings from operations, particularly from United Healthcare and Optum [1].\n- **Foreign Currency Translation Losses**: These losses were more pronounced in 2018 and 2020, likely due to exchange rate fluctuations affecting international operations, especially those related to United Healthcare Global [3].\n- **Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments**: These varied across years, influencing the other comprehensive income component.

According to text quote [5], the total gross margin percentage decreased by 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This decline was primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, driven mainly by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, as well as a 19 basis-point decrease caused by a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. However, warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly from gasoline sales, partially offset by e-commerce. Additionally, the cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19 positively impacted gross margin by five basis points.\n\nTo understand how the gross margin percentage changed from 2020 to 2022, we can infer from the data provided in image8. The table shows that in 2020, the profit margin (which is closely related to gross margin) was 11.20%, while in 2022, it dropped to 10.48%. This indicates a decline in the gross margin percentage over this period. The drop in gross margin percentage can be attributed to several factors outlined in the text quotes:\n\n1. **Core Merchandise Categories**: A significant contributor to the decline in gross margin was the 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, particularly in fresh foods and foods and sundries [5]. This likely reflects the impact of inflation on merchandise costs, as mentioned in text quote [10].\n\n2. **LIFO Charge**: A 19 basis-point decrease in gross margin was also due to a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge for higher merchandise costs [5]. This accounting method assumes that the last items purchased are the first ones sold, which can lead to higher COGS during periods of rising prices.\n\n3. **Gasoline Sales**: Although gasoline sales positively impacted net sales by $9,230 (481 basis points), they generally have a lower gross margin percentage compared to non-gasoline business [12]. Therefore, the increased penetration of gasoline sales may have contributed to the overall decline in gross margin percentage.\n\n4. **Inflation**: Text quote [10] highlights that merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what the company had experienced in recent years. In response, the company implemented various merchandising and pricing strategies, such as working with suppliers to absorb cost increases or passing them on to members, which could have negatively affected gross margin.\n\n5. **Foreign Currency Impact**: Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to Other International operations [5].\n\n6. **Operational Costs**: While not directly affecting gross margin, operational costs like SG&A expenses (discussed in text quote [2]) can indirectly influence profitability by reducing net income, even if gross margin remains stable.\n\nIn summary, the gross margin percentage declined from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022, primarily due to factors such as a decrease in core merchandise categories, a LIFO charge, the impact of inflation, and the influence of gasoline sales, which have a lower gross margin percentage. These factors collectively contributed to the observed decline in gross margin over the two-year period. \n\n![Gross margin percentage declined from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022](image8)"}

This significant increase is primarily attributed to growth in **securities-based lending and other loans**, which grew from $62,909 million to $98,130 million over the same period [5]. Additionally, **residential real estate loans** also saw an increase, rising from $35,221 million to $35,221 million, although this category remained relatively stable compared to the surge in securities-based lending [5].\n\nThis expansion in exposure aligns with the broader context of increased lending activity within the Institutional Securities segment, particularly in securities-based loans and residential real estate loans, as noted in the text [5]. The increase in exposure reflects the growing demand for credit facilities during the economic environment influenced by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n![Total exposure increased significantly from $21,755 million in 2019 to $112,525 million in 2020](image5)\n\nThe main contributing sectors to this change were **securities-based lending and Other**, which accounted for the largest portion of the increase in total exposure.

These adjustments totaled 324 million USD, which, when added back to the IFRS result, resulted in a core Cost of Goods Sold of -4,823 million USD [image2].

This is evident from their respective roles and the compensation and stock ownership structures outlined in the provided information.\n\nIn terms of **compensation**, Marc Fogassa received a salary of $16,500 in 2019 and $37,500 in 2020 [4]. His compensation is directly reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, indicating that he is the primary executive officer receiving direct remuneration for his role. On the other hand, Roger Noriega’s compensation is detailed in a separate table, which shows that he received no cash fees but was granted option awards worth $50,000 [2]. This suggests that while both individuals receive compensation, Fogassa's compensation is more substantial and directly tied to his executive role, whereas Noriega's compensation is structured around equity-based incentives.\n\nRegarding **stock ownership**, Marc Fogassa holds 1 share of Series A Preferred Stock, which grants him significant voting power—specifically, 51% of the total votes on all matters regardless of the number of shares outstanding [1]. Additionally, he beneficially owns 323,739,052 shares of Common Stock, representing 12.70% of the class and contributing to 6.22% of the total voting power [5]. In contrast, Roger Noriega, as a director, owns 113,269,436 shares of Common Stock, accounting for 4.34% of the class and 2.12% of the total voting power [5]. While Noriega has a notable stake in the company, his voting power is significantly less than Fogassa’s due to the concentrated control conferred by the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nThe structure of the Series A Preferred Stock further underscores the disparity in influence between the two individuals. As stated, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to 51% of the total votes, with Fogassa being the sole holder of this class [12]. This gives him a decisive advantage in corporate decisions, even if he holds only one share, whereas Noriega, despite owning a larger number of common shares, lacks the same level of voting control.\n\n![Marc Fogassa holds 1 share of Series A Preferred Stock, granting him 51% of the total voting power, and owns 323,739,052 shares of Common Stock, representing 12.70% of the class and 6.22% of the total voting power.](image5)\n\n![Roger Noriega, as a director, owns 113,269,436 shares of Common Stock, representing 4.34% of the class and 2.12% of the total voting power, but does not hold any Series A Preferred Stock.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, Marc Fogassa’s compensation and stock ownership provide him with both financial and strategic advantages within the company, including disproportionate voting power due to the Series A Preferred Stock structure.

This substantial increase can be attributed to several factors outlined in the financial data.\n\nFirstly, the core net income increased by **7%** in USD terms from 2020 to 2021, reaching USD 14,094 million compared to USD 13,158 million in the prior year [1]. This growth in net income directly contributes to the increase in earnings per share.\n\nAdditionally, the core operating income from continuing operations rose by **8%** in USD, increasing from USD 15,416 million in 2020 to USD 16,588 million in 2021 [image1].

This increase was primarily driven by a rise in **intangible assets**, which grew from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020. This significant increase is attributed to the acquisition of intangible assets, such as patents and licenses, particularly from the acquisitions of Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. and Emisphere Technologies Inc. [5]. These acquisitions reflect the company's strategic investment in research and development (R&D), aiming to strengthen its long-term competitive position through innovation.\n\nAdditionally, **property, plant, and equipment** remained relatively stable, with only a slight decrease from DKK 50,551 million in 2019 to DKK 50,269 million in 2020, indicating that the company did not make large capital expenditures in this area during the year. However, the growth in intangible assets significantly boosted the value of non-current assets overall.\n\nNow, considering **total equity**, the statement of changes in equity [image3] reveals that total equity rose from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020. This increase was largely due to higher **retained earnings**, which grew from DKK 57,817 million in 2019 to DKK 63,774 million in 2020. The growth in retained earnings can be attributed to the company’s strong net profit in 2020, which was DKK 42,138 million compared to DKK 38,951 million in 2019 [image4].\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the company also made significant investments in intangible assets, which were funded partly by internal resources and partly by external financing. The increase in equity was offset by the substantial outflow related to the purchase of intangible assets, which totaled DKK 16.3 billion in 2020 [5]. This highlights the company's commitment to long-term growth and innovation, even if it required a significant allocation of resources.\n\nIn summary, the increase in non-current assets, especially intangible assets, reflects the company's strategic focus on R&D and innovation. Meanwhile, the growth in total equity demonstrates the company's profitability and ability to retain earnings, which supports its long-term financial stability. ![Increase in intangible assets and equity](image1) ![Equity growth and retained earnings](image3)"}

Let's examine these trends in detail.\n\nFor **total loans**, the data from image1 shows a significant decline across various categories. Specifically:\n\n- **Commercial and industrial loans** decreased by $22,867 million (-16%) from 2020 to 2021 [image1].\n- **Commercial real estate loans** declined by $5,202 million (-10%) during the same period [image1].\n- **Lease financing and other loans** dropped by $2,130 million (-13%) [image1].\n- Overall, **total loans** fell by $30,199 million (-14%) from 2020 to 2021 [image1].\n\nThis trend aligns with text quote [2], which notes that total loans (average) decreased due to lower loan demand, including lower line utilization and higher paydowns, reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets.\n\nNow, turning to **net interest income**, we see a contrasting picture. According to image3, **net interest income** fell from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, representing a decrease of $1,174 million or approximately 19% [image3]. This decline is corroborated by text quote [5], which explains that net interest income and net interest margin decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the impact of lower interest rates, lower loan balances reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing activity, and the sale of the student loan portfolio in early 2021.\n\nDespite the drop in net interest income, some sectors showed resilience. For example, **commercial banking** continued to provide financial solutions to private and public companies, though specific figures for this segment were not detailed in the text quotes [6]. However, image4 highlights that **commercial real estate loans** increased by $3,491 million or 4% from 2020 to 2021 in average balance sheet data, suggesting some sector-specific stability or growth [image4].\n\nIn summary, while **total loans** across most sectors declined significantly in 2021 compared to 2020, **net interest income** also saw a marked reduction, primarily due to lower loan balances, weak demand, and a lower interest rate environment. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by gains in noninterest income, as noted in text quote [10], but the overall trend for net interest income remained negative.\n\n![Total loans decreased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020 across multiple sectors](image1)\n![Net interest income declined by nearly 19% from 2020 to 2021](image3)"}

Specifically, commercial nonaccrual loans dropped from $\\S4.8$ billion at the end of 2020 to $\\S2.4$ billion at the end of 2021 [3]. This decline was primarily driven by paydowns in the oil, gas, and pipelines industry [1], as well as broader recovery trends in industries affected by the pandemic [4].\n\nIn contrast, **consumer nonaccrual loans** increased from $\\S3.9$ billion in 2020 to $\\S4.8$ billion in 2021 [3]. This increase was largely attributed to a rise in residential mortgage – first lien nonaccrual loans, as some customers exited accommodation programs designed to help them during the pandemic [9].\n\nAdditionally, the **oil, gas, and pipelines** sector saw a notable decrease in nonaccrual loans, with senior secured loans declining from $\\S7.5$ billion in 2020 to $\\S5.8$ billion in 2021 [8].

Furthermore, these estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations and historical experience, and they are adjusted as rebates, discounts, and returns are processed [9].\n\nThe table in image2 outlines this information explicitly, identifying **US net sales and rebates** as an area with a **high estimation risk**, associated with the **estimate of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates**, and referencing **note 2.1** for further details.\n\n![Estimation of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates](image2)"}

Meanwhile, non-current assets also rose slightly from €4,449 million to €4,657 million, suggesting continued investment in the region [4]. This growth aligns with the broader positive results reported by the Group in 2021, as noted in the consolidated financial statements [11].\n\nIn the Rest of Europe, the largest contributor to Inditex's revenue, net sales grew substantially from €10,430 million in 2020 to €14,051 million in 2021. However, non-current assets decreased from €6,068 million to €5,901 million, possibly reflecting asset optimization or restructuring efforts in this region [4]. Despite the decline in non-current assets, the significant increase in net sales indicates robust operational performance and market share retention.\n\nFor the Americas, net sales saw a notable rise from €2,763 million in 2020 to €4,877 million in 2021, highlighting the region’s growing importance to Inditex. Non-current assets remained relatively stable, increasing only marginally from €2,032 million to €2,051 million [4]. This suggests that the company is effectively leveraging its existing assets to drive sales growth in this market.\n\nIn Asia and the rest of the world, net sales increased from €3,980 million in 2020 to €4,521 million in 2021, showing consistent expansion in these markets. Non-current assets also rose slightly from €1,255 million to €1,215 million, indicating a balanced approach to investment and growth [4].\n\nOverall, the data reflects a strong global recovery for Inditex in 2021, with all regions contributing to the company’s growth. The ability to adapt to changing conditions and leverage its supply chain flexibility has been critical to this success, as highlighted in the Group’s financial reports [11].\n\n![Net sales and non-current assets by region for 2021 and 2020](image4)"}

Retained earnings, which represent cumulative profits not distributed as dividends, decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021 [3].

The decrease in pension-related deferred tax assets could also reflect changes in actuarial assumptions or actual performance relative to expected outcomes, as noted in text quote [9], which discusses how assumptions about discount rates, salary increases, and mortality affect the net obligations and expenses related to postretirement benefits.\n\n### Deferred Tax Liabilities\nIn contrast, the total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022 [7]. This increase is attributed to higher amounts in the following categories:\n\n- **Goodwill and intangible assets**: Rose from $5,761 million in 2021 to $5,783 million in 2022.\n- **Fixed assets**: Increased from $1,512 million in 2021 to $1,542 million in 2022.\n- **Other retiree benefits**: Grew from $645 million in 2021 to $1,031 million in 2022.\n- **Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions**: Jumped from $111 million in 2021 to $439 million in 2022.\n\nThe rise in deferred tax liabilities, particularly those tied to goodwill and intangible assets, aligns with the discussion in text quote [1], which emphasizes the importance of estimates and assumptions in valuing long-lived assets and their impact on financial statements. Additionally, the increase in liabilities related to other retiree benefits reflects ongoing challenges in managing postretirement obligations, as outlined in text quote [9].\n\n### Impact on Financial Position\nThe overall net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities results in a net increase in deferred tax liabilities, which implies that the company expects to pay more taxes in the future than it currently recognizes as benefits. This could lead to a higher effective tax rate in subsequent periods, as highlighted in text quote [8], which mentions that approximately $363 million in uncertain tax positions could affect the effective tax rate in future periods.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s exposure to audit activity and uncertainty in tax positions, as described in text quote [6], suggests that the resolution of these matters could result in additional tax liabilities or adjustments to existing liabilities. While the company believes the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, the current changes in deferred tax balances indicate a shift in the company’s tax profile that warrants close monitoring.\n\n![Deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022](image6)  \n![Deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022](image7)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between 2021 and 2022 reflect evolving tax obligations and assumptions, which may influence the company’s effective tax rate and financial flexibility in the near term."}

According to the text, these RSUs are typically performance-vesting, meaning that their vesting is not guaranteed and depends on the achievement of predefined performance measures [6]. \n\nFor instance, in the case of the 2019 Performance Share Units, one-third of these units (referred to as the \"First Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units\") were scheduled to vest on July 31, 2020, but only if the non-GAAP operating income for 2019 reached or exceeded 90% of the annual operating plan objective set by the Board of Directors [2]. If this condition was not met, the units would not vest and would be forfeited. Furthermore, the number of shares received would be proportional to the actual performance relative to the target, up to a maximum of 125% of the original grant value [2].\n\nSimilarly, the vesting conditions for other RSUs can vary depending on the performance metrics tied to them. These may involve achieving certain levels of operating income, revenue, or other financial targets for each respective year [8]. For example, the vesting of RSUs could depend on the Business Unit’s Non-GAAP Operating Income (OI) not being more than 15% less than the set objective in the Annual Operating Plan (AOP) for each year [8].\n\nMoreover, vesting schedules for RSUs can also include time-based components, where the units vest annually over a period of three to five years, provided the employee remains continuously employed [7]. In some cases, the vesting might be subject to both time and performance conditions, as seen in the description of the vesting table in image8.\n\n![Performance-based vesting of restricted share units](image8)  \n![Summary of RSU activity from 2018 to 2019](image2)\n\nIn summary, the conditions for restricted share units vesting over the first three years are primarily based on meeting specific financial performance objectives, such as operating income targets, and maintaining continuous employment with the company."}

DPO is a liquidity ratio that measures the average number of days it takes for a company to pay its suppliers. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{DPO} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Accounts Payable}}{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}} \\right) \\times 365\n$$\n\nFrom the provided text and image quotes, we can extract the necessary information to compute this metric.\n\nFirst, let’s look at the **accounts payable** data from the balance sheet. Image1 describes a balance sheet that includes accounts payable as part of current liabilities. While the exact figure for accounts payable in FY2017 is not explicitly stated in the image description, we can infer that the value is included in the balance sheet table described in image1 [image1].\n\nNext, we need the **cost of goods sold (COGS)**. From image5, we see that COGS for FY2017 is \\$111,934 million [image5]. This is the total cost of sales for the year.\n\nNow, while the exact accounts payable amount for FY2017 is not directly provided in the text or images, we can refer to image1 again, which mentions \"Accounts payable\" under current liabilities for both 2016 and 2017. Assuming the image contains the actual figures, we would use the 2017 value from that table to proceed with the calculation.\n\nLet’s assume that based on the balance sheet in image1, the accounts payable for FY2017 is approximately \\$10,000 million (this is an illustrative assumption since the exact figure isn't provided). With this, we can now calculate the DPO.\n\n$$\n\\text{DPO} = \\left( \\frac{10,000}{111,934} \\right) \\times 365 \\approx 32.62\n$$\n\nTherefore, Amazon’s FY2017 Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) is approximately **32.62 days**, assuming an accounts payable of \\$10,000 million for FY2017. \n\nFor a precise answer, the exact accounts payable figure for FY2017 must be retrieved from the balance sheet in image1 [image1]."}

However, this does not directly provide the net revenue figure for the entire European Union.\n\nTo determine PMI’s net revenue for the European Union specifically, we need to refer to financial summaries that break down performance by region.

While this table focuses on shipment volumes rather than net revenue, it highlights the importance of the European Union as a market for PMI, with significant shipment volumes for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units in 2020.\n\nFinally, image4 offers a financial summary that includes net revenues for specific regions, but again, it does not directly specify the European Union's net revenue.

In 2018, the company-operated margins were $1,747 million, but by 2020, they had dropped to $1,158 million [6]. This decrease was primarily driven by sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected overall performance across multiple regions [1]. Additionally, higher other operating expenses and general and administrative (G&A) expenses contributed to the decline in operating margin percentages [11].\n\nThe impact of currency translation on these margins was relatively modest. For instance, in 2020, the currency translation benefit for company-operated margins was $(1) million, while in 2019, it was $(51) million [6]. In 2018, there was a slight positive impact of $4 million from currency translation [6].

However, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This indicates a decline in overall APAC revenue in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.\n\nIn fiscal 2015, [5] states that revenue in APAC remained stable compared to fiscal 2014. This stability was due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue. Therefore, while there was no growth in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, the overall trend from fiscal 2013 to 2015 shows a decline followed by stabilization.\n\nLooking at the regional revenue distribution in [image3], the data confirms this pattern:\n\n- In 2013, APAC revenue was $791.6 million.\n- In 2014, APAC revenue dropped to $652.8 million, representing an 18% decrease.\n- In 2015, APAC revenue increased slightly to $671.0 million, showing a 3% increase from 2014.\n\nThus, the percentage changes in APAC revenue from fiscal year 2013 to 2015 are as follows:\n- From 2013 to 2014: -18%\n- From 2014 to 2015: +3%\n\n![APAC revenue decreased by 18% from 2013 to 2014 and then increased by 3% from 2014 to 2015](image3)"}

This pattern has remained relatively stable, as noted in a Pew Research Center study that found **latino party affiliation has changed little in recent years** [7]. \n\nThe perception of differences between the Democratic and Republican parties among Latino voters is also an important factor. A survey revealed that **45% of all Hispanics believe there is a great deal of difference** between the two parties, while **36%** think there is a fair amount of difference, and **16%** feel there is hardly any difference at all [8]. This suggests that while many Latino voters recognize distinct policy positions and priorities between the parties, a significant portion may not see them as drastically different.\n\nThis perception is further reflected in how Latino voters evaluate the parties’ efforts to earn their votes. For instance, **Dem/Lean Dem voters** are more likely to believe that the Democratic Party cares about Latinos and works hard to earn their support, with **NET approval ratings of 78% and 81%, respectively** [4]. In contrast, **Rep/Lean Rep voters** show mixed views, with **NET approval ratings of 36% and 56%** for the Republican Party’s care and effort to earn Latino votes [4].\n\nAdditionally, **political affiliation strongly influences perceptions of racial discrimination**. Among **Rep/Lean Rep voters**, **62% believe racial discrimination is seen where it really does not exist**, compared to just **25% among Dem/Lean Dem voters** [2].

This statement underscores that European IPOs were not only competitive but, in some cases, outperformed those in the U.S.\n\nThis conclusion is further supported by a visual representation in the form of a line graph that compares the post-IPO performance of all venture capital-backed IPOs between the U.S. and Europe from March 2004 to July 2011. The graph shows two lines: one representing the index value of European IPOs (blue line) and the other for U.S. IPOs (red line). Observing the graph, it can be seen that the blue line, representing European IPOs, is consistently higher than the red line, which indicates that European IPOs had a better post-IPO performance during this period. \n\n![European IPOs showed better post-IPO performance compared to U.S. IPOs](image2)\n\nIn summary, at the time of the presentation, the Europe IPO index value was greater than the U.S. IPO index value."}

One of the most notable shifts was the **scarcity of VC money**, which began to take hold around this time. This scarcity not only led to lower entry valuations but also increased capital efficiency, with European VC funds achieving roughly 70 percent higher efficiency than their U.S. counterparts [10]. The limited availability of capital forced investors to be more selective, resulting in a higher yield or \"hit rate\" for successful investments [10].\n\nThe **supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004** [5], marking a turning point in the European VC landscape. This shortage of capital created a **crammed demand-supply imbalance**, where the appetite for investment outpaced the availability of funds [2]. This situation is further reflected in image2, which shows a line graph depicting the relationship between the supply of capital and demand from 2000 to 2010. Notably, the graph highlights that by 2004-2005, the market was still saturated with pre-bubble VC funds, but the exit boom starting in 2005 began to drive up demand [2]. This shift is visually represented in the shaded area labeled \"Current supply gap\" on the right side of the graph, indicating a significant disparity between the supply of venture capital and the availability of deals during the 2009-2010 period [2].\n\nAdditionally, image6 provides a visual representation of the decline in the number of VC funds in Europe between 1999 and 2011. The number of funds dropped from 1,600 in 1999 to 711 in 2011, representing a 63% decline [6]. This reduction underscores the consolidation and maturation of the European VC industry, particularly after the burst of the dot-com bubble. As noted in the text, this period saw the emergence of some of the strongest venture capital firms in the world [11].\n\nMoreover, the post-bubble vintages (starting around 2004/2005) have been significantly better performing compared to earlier years, with many top-tier funds now at an inflection point [7]. This trend is also supported by image4, which compares the post-IPO performance of venture capital-backed IPOs in the U.S. and Europe from March 2004 to July 2011. The blue line representing European IPOs consistently outperformed the red line for U.S. IPOs during this period, suggesting that European VC-backed companies were delivering stronger returns post-IPO [4].\n\nIn summary, the early-stage VC fundraising environment in Europe changed dramatically after 2004, marked by a decrease in the number of active funds, a scarcity of capital leading to higher efficiency, and improved performance of post-bubble vintages. These changes are visually depicted in image2 and image6, and supported by textual analysis.\n\n![European venture capital supply and demand trends](image2)  \n![Decline in the number of VC funds in Europe](image6)  \n\nEuropean early-stage VC fundraising experienced a significant transformation after 2004, characterized by a decline in fund numbers, capital scarcity, and improved performance of post-bubble vintages."}

Textual evidence shows that Germans generally have more favorable opinions toward these organizations than Americans. For example, while only about half of Americans favor the EU, roughly seven-in-ten Germans do [8]. Similarly, Germans tend to think more highly of NATO than Americans, with a notable gap in approval ratings [8].\n\nThis is further illustrated in image4, which compares approval ratings of the EU and NATO from the perspectives of the U.S., a 32-country median, and Germany. The bar chart highlights that Germany has an +18% higher approval rating for the EU compared to the U.S. and a +5% higher approval rating for NATO [image4](image4). These differences underscore the broader ideological and nationalistic divides between the two countries regarding international cooperation and collective security.\n\nAdditionally, image1 provides a breakdown of how political ideologies within each country influence perceptions of the EU and NATO. In the U.S., liberals are far more likely than conservatives to view the EU and NATO favorably, with a +35 and +42 difference, respectively, between liberal and conservative respondents [image1](image1). In contrast, in Germany, the differences between left and right are smaller but still present, with a +15 and +10 difference for the EU and NATO, respectively [image1](image1).\n\nThese findings suggest that while both American and German publics value international organizations, their levels of support and the factors influencing those views differ considerably. \n\nIn conclusion, Germans tend to have more favorable views of the EU and NATO compared to Americans, and these differences are influenced by political ideology in both countries."}

Similarly, individuals with a four-year college degree also show a strong inclination toward the Democratic Party, with 53% supporting Democrats compared to 40% for Republicans [1]. This trend suggests that higher educational attainment correlates with increased support for the Democratic Party in congressional elections.\n\nIn contrast, voters without a college degree exhibit more divided preferences. For instance, those with some college experience (but not a full degree) show a slightly higher preference for Democrats (49%) compared to Republicans (44%) [8], while those with a high school degree or less education are nearly evenly split, with 42% favoring Democrats and 47% favoring Republicans [8]. These differences highlight how educational background influences political alignment and voting behavior.\n\nMoreover, views on ethical standards of political parties also vary by education level. Among those with at least a college degree, 31% believe neither party has high ethical standards, while 43% think one party does not have high ethical standards and 17% believe both do [8].

This indicates a growing level of public confidence in Trump’s economic decision-making during that period.\n\nHowever, when comparing Trump’s ethical standards to those of past administrations, the picture is more complex. The ethical standards of Trump administration officials are rated lower than those of previous administrations, including Reagan’s in 1983 [10].

For example, as of 2018, 37% of independents who do not lean toward a party view the Democratic Party favorably, while about 9% have a favorable view of the GOP [10]. In contrast, the majority of GOP leaners view the Republican Party favorably (55%), while only 24% view both parties unfavorably [7]. \n\n![The percentage of people who have favorable or unfavorable opinions of the Republican and Democratic parties, broken down by different political affiliations](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the share of independents who view both parties negatively has declined in recent years, dropping from 36% in 2015 to a lower percentage in more recent surveys [8]. However, this decline does not negate the overall trend of increasing polarization, as the shares of partisan identifiers and leaners with unfavorable impressions of the opposition party are at or near all-time highs [1].\n\nIn summary, the unfavorable views of both the Republican and Democratic parties have significantly increased over time, especially among partisans and those who lean toward a party, reflecting a broader trend of growing political polarization in the United States."}

According to image6, \"Uptown Funk!\" was ranked as the top on-demand song for the year-to-date period, with an impressive total of **285,647,000 streams**. It also achieved the highest rankings in audio streams, video streams, song sales, and radio audience, all at number one. This indicates that the song had widespread appeal and dominance across both digital and traditional media platforms.\n\nIn contrast, \"Trap Queen\" by Fetty Wap, which ranked second in the top on-demand songs list, received significantly fewer streams compared to \"Uptown Funk!\"—though exact figures are not provided for \"Trap Queen\" in the data. However, its ranking suggests it was also highly popular but did not achieve the same level of cross-platform success as \"Uptown Funk!\".\n\nThe performance of these tracks can be further contextualized by examining the broader music consumption trends of the time. For instance, image4 highlights that streaming accounted for **70%** of total music activity, underscoring the growing importance of digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube in shaping a song’s success. This aligns with the observation from text quote [11], which notes that hip-hop fans were at the forefront of the digital music movement, likely contributing to the success of tracks like \"Uptown Funk!\" and \"Trap Queen.\"\n\nAdditionally, image3, titled \"TrendSetter Index,\" shows that the top 10 streamed songs and top 10 albums have significantly higher trendsetter scores than the industry average, reinforcing the idea that songs like \"Uptown Funk!\" were not only popular but also influential in setting trends within the music industry.\n\n![Top on-demand song with highest streams and rankings](image6)  \n![Streaming dominates music activity](image4)  \n![TrendSetter Index highlights influence of top songs](image3)  \n\nIn conclusion, \"Uptown Funk!\" outperformed \"Trap Queen\" across most media platforms in 2015, achieving the top rank in streams, sales, and radio airplay."}

According to a Pew Research Center survey, while Republicans have consistently viewed the U.S. as the leading global economy, this belief has seen some fluctuations, particularly in recent years. On the other hand, Democrats have shown a more pronounced decline in their confidence in the U.S.’s economic leadership.\n\nFor instance, in March 2020, only $44\\%$ of Democrats believed the U.S. was the world’s leading economic power, down from $54\\%$ in March 2020 compared to earlier in the year [6]. This decline reflects broader concerns about the U.S. economy, especially amid the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic [1]. Meanwhile, Republicans have maintained a more stable view, though not without change. In fact, the share of Republicans who see China as an enemy has increased significantly, rising by 21 percentage points since 2012 [12].\n\nThe image below illustrates the changing political affiliations over time, showing how support for Republican and Democratic groups evolved between 2008 and 2020:\n\n![Republicans and Democrats' political identification trends from 2008 to 2020](image3)\n\nThis visual representation highlights that the Republican group saw a steady increase in support, reaching $64\\%$ in 2020, while the Democratic group remained relatively stable, peaking at $44\\%$ in 2020 [3].

Initially, the county saw a dramatic increase in population during the late 1800s, which was driven by waves of immigration and the impact of major historical events such as the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad Act [5]. These acts transformed Nebraska from a sparsely populated region into an agricultural hub, attracting settlers who sought opportunities in farming and land ownership [5].\n\nThe population data reflects this surge: in 1870, the population was just 130, but by 1880 it had grown to 8,267, and by 1890 it reached its peak at 14,096 [2]. This rapid growth can be attributed to the influx of immigrants from various European countries, including Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, who settled in distinct ethnic clusters across the county [2]. The establishment of rural school districts and religious communities also played a role in sustaining and supporting these growing populations [1][11][12].\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak in 1890, the population began to decline gradually. By 1900, it had dropped to 13,330, and continued to decrease through the early 20th century, reaching 9,982 by 1940 [2]. This decline was influenced by several factors, including the mechanization of agriculture, which led to farm consolidation and a reduction in the number of small farms [6]. As farming became more industrialized, fewer people were needed to work on individual farms, leading to a shift in population dynamics.\n\nDespite the overall decline, some towns within Hamilton County, such as Aurora, showed signs of stabilization or even slight growth in more recent decades. For instance, Aurora peaked in population at the 2000 census with 4,225 residents and has shown steady increases since 1940 [8]. However, many other smaller towns struggled to maintain their populations due to the ongoing trend of farm consolidation and the decline of rural communities [10].\n\n![Population trends from 1870 to 2000](image2)\n\nThe changes in Hamilton County’s population over this period were deeply influenced by economic, technological, and social factors, including the Homestead Act, the expansion of railroads, immigration patterns, and the mechanization of agriculture.

Specifically, **78% of Obama’s voters** and **76% of McCain’s voters** shared this view [1]. This suggests a relatively high level of bipartisan cooperation expectations during that time.\n\nFast forward to 2016, the situation had changed considerably. In November 2016, the survey results showed a stark partisan divide regarding whether Democratic leaders should work with President-elect Trump. Among all voters, **59% believed Democratic leaders should work with Trump**, while **39% felt they should stand up to him** [7]. However, this opinion varied significantly by party affiliation. For instance, **84% of Republicans or those leaning Republican** supported working with Trump, whereas only **32% of Democrats or those leaning Democratic** agreed [7].\n\nThis contrast highlights a growing polarization between the two major parties. In 2008, there was a more unified sentiment across party lines for political leaders to collaborate with the newly elected president. In contrast, by 2016, the willingness to cooperate had diminished among Democrats, especially compared to the strong support GOP leaders had shown for working with Obama in 2008 [7].\n\n![Democratic leaders should work with Trump to get things done even if it means disappointing their supporters](image7)  \n![Republican leaders should work with Obama](image7)\n\nThe data also reflects broader trends in voter attitudes toward political cooperation. In 2008, nearly six-in-ten (59%) GOP leaders were said to work with Obama, while only 36% wanted them to “stand up” to the new president [9]. This contrasts sharply with the 2016 scenario where Democratic support for cooperation with Trump was substantially lower than GOP support for working with Obama eight years ago [4].\n\nIn conclusion, voter opinions on whether political leaders should work with newly elected presidents differed significantly between 2008 and 2016, reflecting a growing partisan divide and reduced willingness to cooperate across party lines."}

To answer this, we need to locate data from both years that reflects the proportion of people holding this belief.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we see a direct statement: \"Traditional values are outdated and belong in the past Iam keen to embrace modem values and beliefs\" [2] and again [6]. However, these quotes do not provide specific percentages or numerical data for 2011 or 2014.\n\nTo find the relevant numbers, we can refer to image2, which presents survey responses over three years (2012, 2013, and 2014) for two different questions or statements. While the exact wording of the question is not provided, the context suggests that it might be related to attitudes toward traditional values. For the first set of bars in image2, the percentage of respondents who \"Agree a lot / somewhat\" decreased from 72% in 2012 to 54% in 2014. This could potentially represent those who believe traditional values are outdated.\n\nHowever, we do not have data for 2011 in image2. We must look elsewhere for 2011 data. Image4 provides a stacked bar chart with data from 2011 to 2014. The red segment represents one category, and the orange segment another. In 2011, the red segment is 83, and the orange segment is 17. If we assume the red segment represents those who believe traditional values are outdated, then in 2011, 83% of respondents held this view.\n\nIn 2014, the red segment drops to 54%, as seen in image4. Therefore, the increase in percentage points from 2011 to 2014 would be calculated as follows:\n\n- 2011: 83%\n- 2014: 54%\n- Difference: 83% - 54% = **29 percentage points decrease**, not an increase.\n\nThus, the percentage of respondents who believe traditional values are outdated actually **decreased** by 29 percentage points from 2011 to 2014.\n\n![A stacked bar chart showing data from 2011 to 2014 with the red segment representing one category, which dropped from 83% in 2011 to 54% in 2014](image4)\n\nThe percentage of respondents who believe traditional values are outdated decreased by **29 percentage points** from 2011 to 2014."}

This represents an increase from the current level, indicating that incorporating existing resources can enhance capacity without major infrastructure changes.\n\nElectrification of the trains presents another scenario, where the peak service increases to 6x6, necessitating 36 train cars during peak hours. This improvement likely stems from increased efficiency and reliability, allowing for more frequent and fuller trains [4].\n\nExtending platforms to accommodate more cars introduces yet another scenario, with a peak service of 6x8, resulting in a need for 48 train cars during peak hours [8]. This change suggests a focus on physical infrastructure to support higher passenger volumes.\n\nFinally, increasing frequency, potentially in conjunction with High-Speed Rail (HSR), leads to the most significant increase in peak hour train car requirements.

Text quote [8] states that only about three-in-ten Americans (28%) are very confident in this, and another 13% are somewhat confident. A majority—41%—are not at all confident, while 16% are not too confident. This indicates that a substantial portion of the public, including Republicans, lacks confidence in Trump’s ability to separate personal interests from presidential duties.\n\nText quote [9] highlights that most Republicans do express some level of confidence in this matter: 55% are very confident, and 23% are somewhat confident. However, it also notes that conservative Republicans are more likely to be very confident (66%) compared to moderate and liberal Republicans (39%). This suggests that while a majority of Republicans hold some level of confidence, a notable segment still does not.\n\nTo further illustrate the lack of confidence among Republicans, we can refer to image5, which shows survey results on how U.S. adults feel about a certain topic, categorized by political affiliation and ideology. Specifically, for **Republican/Lean Republican** respondents, **10%** said they are \"Not at all\" confident, and **10%** said they are \"Not too\" confident. However, this chart includes both conservative and moderate/liberal Republicans, and the breakdown for conservative Republicans specifically is higher in confidence.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the proportion of Republicans who are “not at all” confident, we can turn to image3, which compares responses from different political groups. While image3 does not directly focus on Trump's business interests, it provides context on how people rate their agreement with something, using categories like \"Not at all,\" \"Not too,\" \"Somewhat,\" and \"Very.\" For **Rep/Lean Rep**, **36%** responded \"Not at all,\" and **22%** responded \"Not too.\" These percentages suggest that nearly 60% of Republicans either \"Not at all\" or \"Not too\" agree with the statement, though the exact question is not specified in the image description.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available evidence, **approximately 10% of Republicans** are not at all confident that Trump keeps his own business interests separate from the decisions he makes as president, as shown in image5."}

This contrasts with those who have some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less education (20%), who are less likely to believe neither party has high ethical standards [12]. \n\nEducational differences also extend to voting preferences in early midterms, where those with postgraduate degrees favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one (62% to 30%), and those with a four-year college degree also favor the Democrat (53% to 40%) [8].\n\nPolitical affiliation further influences these perceptions. Independents are more likely than partisans to believe that neither party has high ethical standards, with about a third (34%) of independents, including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), holding this view [1]. By comparison, only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) share this belief [1]. Additionally, partisans are somewhat less positive about their own party's ethical standards, though majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) still describe their party as having high ethical standards [3].\n\n![Nearly a third of college graduates say neither party has 'high ethical standards'](image11)\n\n![The image shows four line graphs illustrating public opinion over time about performance in different areas](image5)"}

Furthermore, among Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners, a strong majority—75% of conservatives and moderates and 84% of liberals—say the statement “the Republican Party really cares about Hispanics” does not describe their views [8].

One major concern is **privacy**—many individuals feel that the collection and use of their online data for such scoring systems infringes on their personal privacy. This is reflected in the fact that **26% of those who find personal finance scores unacceptable cite privacy violations as their primary concern** [10]. \n\nAnother concern is the **fairness** of these systems. A substantial portion of the public believes that automated personal finance scores may be **unfair or discriminatory**, with **15% of respondents expressing this view** [1]. Additionally, there is a belief that such scores might not accurately represent an individual’s true financial situation or creditworthiness. As noted in the text, **one-in-five respondents argue that someone’s online data does not accurately represent them** [10].\n\nThis sentiment is echoed in the image data as well. In **image6**, which shows the percentage of U.S. adults who find it acceptable or not acceptable for companies to use automated personal finance scores, **68% of respondents find the practice unacceptable**. Among these, **20% believe the scores do not represent a person accurately**, and **15% think they are unfair or discriminatory**. These figures highlight the widespread skepticism about the fairness and accuracy of automated scoring systems.\n\nFurthermore, many people worry about the **lack of human oversight** in decision-making processes that rely heavily on algorithms. While this concern is more prominent in other contexts like job interviews, it still plays a role in discussions about personal finance scores, where individuals question whether machines can truly capture the complexity of human behavior and circumstances [3].\n\nIn summary, the primary concerns of U.S. adults regarding the use of automated personal finance scores by companies include **violations of privacy, potential unfairness or discrimination, and the inaccuracy of these systems in representing individuals' true financial situations**.

According to text quote [3], since early 2015, Republicans’ positive ratings of the government’s efforts have dropped sharply—from 63% at the beginning of the year to just 27% by later in the year. This indicates a dramatic decline in Republican confidence in the government's ability to address terrorism effectively.\n\nThis trend is further supported by image1, which shows a shift in public opinion over time regarding whether the government has gone too far in restricting civil liberties or not gone far enough to protect the country. The line representing \"Gone too far restricting civil liberties\" (dark yellow) rises from 29% in 2004 to 56% in 2015, while the line for \"Not gone far enough to protect country\" (light yellow) declines from 49% to 28%. This suggests that Republicans, along with the broader public, have increasingly viewed the government as overstepping in its anti-terrorism policies, though this perception may be more pronounced among Republicans, as noted in text quote [4], where Republicans have shown a more pronounced shift toward believing that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [10] highlights a sharp decline in conservative Republicans’ views: in January, 59% believed the government was doing very well or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, but by the time of the survey, only 18% held this view. This represents a substantial drop in Republican support for the government's counterterrorism measures.\n\nThe overall trajectory of Republican sentiment is also illustrated in image7, which tracks trends across political affiliations from 2004 to 2015. The red line representing Republicans ends at 71% in 2015, suggesting a specific metric (likely related to concern or approval) that reflects their evolving stance. However, when combined with other evidence, it becomes clear that while there may be some nuanced metrics, the general sentiment among Republicans has moved toward skepticism about the government's handling of the terrorist threat.\n\nIn conclusion, Republicans’ views on government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat have shifted significantly over time, marked by a growing skepticism and declining approval of those efforts."}

For example, in the case of the GL→EN translation task, pre-training led to an increase of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating that pre-trained embeddings are especially beneficial for low-resource languages [2]. This is further supported by Table 6, which shows that pre-training helps models capture rarer vocabulary and produce grammatically well-formed sentences, as demonstrated by successful translations of phrases like \"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\" [1].\n\nIn contrast, for higher-resource languages such as Spanish (ES), French (FR), and Italian (IT) translating into Portuguese (PT), the gains from pre-training are more modest but still consistent, with improvements ranging from +4.7 to +8.9 BLEU points [image2]. Interestingly, when comparing the performance of bilingual systems (bi:std) versus multilingual systems (multi:pre+align), the latter generally outperforms the former, especially when the source and target languages are linguistically similar [image1]. This is evident in the GL/PT pair, where the largest gains were observed, while the BE/RU pair showed only a small decrease [10].\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of pre-training is influenced by the size of the training data. As seen in Figure 2, pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [7]. This is also reflected in experiments where training data for higher-resource languages was down-sampled, showing that pre-training becomes more impactful when the training data is limited [3].\n\nFinally, aligning word embeddings between the source and target languages further enhances BLEU scores, as it allows the model to learn in a similar fashion as if training on a single language [10]. This is illustrated in Table 5, where alignment leads to improved performance across multiple tasks [image3].\n\n![Pre-training significantly improves BLEU scores for low-resource languages like GL/PT, as shown by the large gains in BLEU points.](image2)"}

This suggests that while reference translations contribute positively to the COMET-RANK metric across all language pairs, their impact is more substantial when English is the target language.

Overall, the results suggest that the use of reference translations plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the COMET-RANK metric, especially in scenarios where English is the target language."}

The data from these evaluations provide insights into both the reliability of the assessments and the competitive edge of Chameleon in mixed-modal tasks.\n\nAccording to the evaluation results [8], when comparing Chameleon with Gemini+ and GPT-4V+, there were instances where all three annotators agreed on the preference of responses, as well as cases where only two or none of the annotators reached consensus. Specifically, for **Chameleon vs. Gemini+**, 31.5% of the cases had all three annotators agree, while 58.1% had two out of three agree, and 10.3% showed no agreement [image5]. Similarly, for **Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+**, the agreement levels were 35.4% for all three agreeing, 55.2% for two agreeing, and 9.3% for no agreement. When comparing Chameleon with the original versions of Gemini and GPT-4V (without image augmentation), the percentages of agreement were slightly lower: 30.2% and 28.6%, respectively, for all three annotators agreeing [image5].\n\nThese figures suggest that while there is a substantial level of agreement among annotators—particularly in comparisons with enhanced baselines like Gemini+ and GPT-4V+—there is still a notable portion of cases where the judgments diverge. This variability may be attributed to the subjective nature of evaluating response quality, especially in open-ended or creative tasks where preferences can differ significantly between individuals.\n\nMoreover, the relatively high percentage of cases where all three annotators agree (ranging from 28.6% to 35.4%) indicates that Chameleon's responses are often clearly preferred over those of its competitors, leading to consistent evaluations. However, the fact that around 55%–58% of the cases involved partial agreement (i.e., two out of three annotators agreeing) suggests that in many scenarios, the differences between models are subtle, making it challenging for evaluators to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\nThe inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon’s performance appears moderate, with room for improvement in ensuring more uniform judgments across all cases. Nevertheless, the consistency in the majority of evaluations supports the notion that Chameleon performs competitively against strong baselines, even if the nuances of its responses occasionally lead to divergent opinions among evaluators.\n\n![Inter-annotator agreement levels for Chameleon vs. Gemini+ and GPT-4V+](image5)"}

However, beyond 5 demonstrations (e.g., 10 or more), the improvements become limited, indicating diminishing returns with additional examples [9].\n\nWhen logical constraints are applied, the performance benefits are even more pronounced. The graph shows that adding logical constraints leads to stable improvements, particularly with more demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on the MAVEN-ERE dataset results in a Micro-F1 score of 25.7%, which surpasses the score of 24.5% achieved with 10 demonstrations without logical constraints [4]. This suggests that incorporating logical constraints into the prompts allows models to achieve better performance with fewer examples.\n\nFurthermore, the right graph in image1 illustrates how iterative retrieval affects performance over multiple iterations.

Among these, **Reasoning Error** is the most dominant, accounting for a significant portion of all errors, as seen in Figure 5 (right) [3]. This indicates that even when the model successfully retrieves relevant information, it often struggles to correctly interpret or apply it during the reasoning phase.\n\nAdditionally, **Principle Error** occurs during the abstraction step, where the model generates incorrect or incomplete first principles. However, this type of error constitutes only a small fraction of overall errors, with more than **90%** of errors occurring at the **Reasoning step** [12].\n\nTo further understand how these errors compare, we can refer to the pie chart shown in image6, which breaks down the error distribution. The bar chart on the right of the same image highlights that **Reasoning Error** dominates at **0.55**, followed by **Math Error** at **0.25**, while **Factual Error** and **Context Loss** are relatively minor contributors [6].\n\nMoreover, image5 provides an alternative perspective on the performance comparison between different configurations.

According to experimental results, this approach leads to a significant improvement in performance across multiple datasets.

Each strategy has its own set of methodologies, applications, and associated challenges. To determine which strategy is most represented in the survey, we must examine how frequently and prominently each is discussed.\n\nTraining-time correction involves rectifying model behavior during the training phase using feedback, such as human input or automated systems [8]. This method is foundational and often relies on approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or self-training [4]. While it is an important area, the survey notes that training-time correction typically requires access to model parameters and is less flexible compared to other methods [2].\n\nGeneration-time correction focuses on guiding the LLM to correct errors during the generation process using automated feedback. For example, intermediate reasoning steps are evaluated in real-time, allowing the model to recover from incorrect outputs and find better solutions [6]. Figure 5 illustrates two key generation-time correction strategies: \"Generate-then-Rank\" and \"Feedback-Guided Decoding,\" both of which rely on a critic model to evaluate and refine outputs iteratively [5]. This method is particularly useful when dealing with inaccessible or colossal models [12], but it still requires integration of feedback mechanisms during the generation phase.\n\nPost-hoc correction, however, stands out as the most representative strategy in the survey. It refines the model output after it has been generated, without updating the model parameters [2]. This approach allows for more diverse natural language feedback, ranging from specific diagnostic reports to broader writing suggestions [1]. The survey categorizes post-hoc correction into three key strategies: **Self-Correction**, **Correction with External Feedback**, and **Multi-Agent Debate** [1]. These strategies involve cycles of generation, review, feedback, and refinement [5]. Furthermore, Table 3 in the survey provides a detailed breakdown of various post-hoc correction methods, including their feedback sources, formats, refinement strategies, learning techniques, and applications [3]. This level of detail and categorization suggests that post-hoc correction is not only well-represented but also extensively explored in the literature reviewed.\n\n![Post-hoc correction strategies include Self-Correction, Correction with External Feedback, and Multi-Agent Debate](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, among the three correction strategies, **post-hoc correction** has the most representative papers in the survey due to its extensive coverage, diversity of methods, and detailed categorization in the review."}

However, their decoder attention mechanisms differ significantly in how they utilize information from the encoder.\n\nThe single-task model, as described in [11], consists of a recurrent encoder, an attention mechanism, and a recurrent decoder. In this setup, the decoder solely attends to the hidden states produced by the encoder, using these to generate the output sequence. This is illustrated in Figure 1a, where the attention mechanism connects the decoder directly to the encoder's hidden states.\n\nOn the other hand, the multitask model, shown in Figure 1b [12], extends this architecture by incorporating a second task. While it still uses a shared encoder, it introduces separate attentions and decoders for each task. This means that each decoder independently attends to the encoder’s hidden states, rather than sharing or influencing one another during the decoding process. The multitask model thus allows for simultaneous modeling of multiple output sequences but does not enable the decoders to share or build upon each other's outputs during decoding.\n\nThis distinction highlights how the multitask model diverges from the single-task model in terms of decoder attention: while the single-task model has a single decoder attending to the encoder, the multitask model features multiple decoders, each with its own attention mechanism directed at the same encoder states, without direct interaction between the decoders themselves.\n\n![The multitask model has two separate decoders that each attend to the encoder's hidden states independently, whereas the single-task model has a single decoder that attends to the encoder's hidden states.](image6)"}

It combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods with the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The main components of the RAR pipeline and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**: This component is responsible for querying a large external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context [9]. It encodes and stores a large volume of image and text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval [9]. Specifically, it uses a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window [12]. During inference, the multimodal retriever retrieves the top-$k$ similar results from the memory [12].\n\n   ![The RAR pipeline consists of two main parts: the multimodal retriever and the retrieving & ranking stage.](image1)\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**: After the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels along with the image embedding $e_{\\mathrm{img}}$ are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [2]. The MLLMs combine internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category [2]. This step ensures more accurate and contextually aware classification predictions [2]. Additionally, the ranking process allows MLLMs to refine and prioritize the retrieved candidate results, which enhances the accuracy of the final prediction [11].\n\n3. **Memory Storage ($\\mathcal{M}$)**: The memory storage is an external repository where image and text embeddings are stored after being processed by the multimodal retriever [9]. This memory is indexed using techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to improve retrieval speed and efficiency, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets [7].\n\n4. **Index Construction**: To ensure fast retrieval, the system employs index construction techniques that reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings [7]. For instance, vectors in a $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space are transformed into a reduced $\\frac{d}{9}$ dimensional space, enabling faster retrieval while maintaining relevance [7].\n\n5. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: In object detection tasks, additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring are applied to focus the MLLMs’ attention on the relevant objects [4]. Cropping is performed based on proposal bounding box coordinates, and resizing is done to maintain a fixed proportion. Blurring is used to de-emphasize non-target areas, helping the model better identify the objects of interest [4].\n\n6. **Prompt Design for Ranking**: A carefully designed prompt is used to merge the input image with the retrieved category information and guide the MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5]. This ranking mechanism helps in achieving better performance on fine-grained perception tasks [3].\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline leverages a combination of efficient retrieval, memory storage, and MLLM-based ranking to enhance the performance of vision-language models in recognizing fine-grained and zero-shot categories.\n\n![RAR integrates retrieval and ranking processes to enhance the accuracy of image classification tasks.](image1)"}

This suggests that reranking with LLMs could improve performance on harder instances while potentially harming performance on easier ones. Additionally, the proposed filter-then-rerank framework leverages SLMs to identify hard samples and then uses LLMs to rerank only those difficult cases, thereby minimizing the negative effects of LLMs on easy samples [4].\n\nThis idea is further supported by the results shown in image6, which presents three line graphs comparing micro-F1 performance with and without LLM reranking for the FewNERD (NER) dataset. The graph illustrates how LLM reranking influences performance at various confidence levels. Specifically, the pink line represents performance without LLM reranking, while the blue line shows performance with LLM reranking. Observing these lines reveals that LLM reranking generally improves micro-F1 scores, particularly at lower confidence levels where predictions are less certain.\n\nMoreover, Table 4 highlights that reranking only a small fraction of samples (0.5%–10%) leads to substantial improvements in performance, especially for hard samples, with absolute F1 gains ranging from 10% to 25% [8]. This aligns with the visual data from image6, showing that even though LLM reranking may not significantly alter performance for high-confidence samples, it provides a meaningful boost for lower-confidence or harder cases.\n\nIn conclusion, LLM reranking positively affects micro-F1 performance for the FewNERD dataset, particularly at lower confidence levels where predictions are more uncertain. This improvement is achieved by focusing reranking efforts on the most challenging samples, leveraging the strengths of LLMs in handling complex tasks while mitigating their drawbacks on easier ones.\n\n![LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance for FewNERD at lower confidence levels](image6)"}

According to [7], Figure 3a shows that the coreference layer achieves its best performance on the second iteration ($N=2$). This suggests that after two iterations, the model has effectively captured the most relevant coreferences without overfitting or introducing noise from additional iterations.\n\nSimilarly, for **relation propagation**, the model iteratively updates relation scores between entity spans using a tensor $\\mathbf{V}_{R}^{t}$, which captures scores for each of the $L_{R}$ relation types [1]. As shown in [3], Figure 3b indicates that the model achieves the best performance on the second iteration ($M=2$) for relation extraction. This implies that the iterative refinement process improves the accuracy of relation detection up to a point, after which further iterations may not contribute significantly or could even degrade performance due to over-smoothing or redundancy.\n\nFigure 5, described in image5, visually confirms this observation with line graphs showing the F1 scores for entity and relation extraction as functions of the number of iterations. The left graph (Entity F1) peaks at two iterations for CorefProp, while the right graph (Relation F1) also peaks at two iterations for RelProp. These results highlight the importance of balancing the number of iterations to ensure optimal performance without unnecessary computational overhead.\n\n![Coreference propagation achieves peak performance at two iterations](image7)  \n![Relation propagation achieves peak performance at two iterations](image5)  \n\nIn conclusion, the number of iterations directly affects the F1 score in both entity and relation extraction tasks, with the best performance typically achieved after two iterations."}

This is clearly demonstrated in the Weighted Decoding Response table for the input \"Yes, I'm studying law at the moment,\" where varying weights produce significantly different outputs [1].\n\nFor instance, when the weight (Wt) is set to -5.0, the model generates a very generic and minimalistic response: \"Oh......................................\" with a low NIDF score of 0.6%. This suggests that the model is heavily discouraged from producing content related to the input, leading to a vague or uninformative reply. In contrast, when the weight is set to 0.0, the response is identical to the baseline: \"That sounds like a lot of fun!\" with an NIDF score of 17.1%, indicating no additional guidance beyond the default output [1].\n\nAs the weight increases, the model becomes more influenced by the control variable, resulting in responses that are more specific or detailed. For example, at Wt = 3.0, the response becomes \"That sounds like a lot of fun. How long have you been studying?\" with an NIDF of 18.3%, showing increased specificity and engagement. However, this trend does not continue linearly. At Wt = 7.0, the response becomes \"I majored in practising my spiritual full-time philosophy test\" with an NIDF of 38.5%, which is more specific but also less coherent. Finally, at Wt = 10.0, the model produces a nonsensical response: \"Oh wow! Merna jean isa paino yi hao hui bu acara sya gila [...]\" with an NIDF of 71.9%, illustrating the risk of going off-distribution when the weight is too strong [1].\n\nThis pattern aligns with findings in the text that weighted decoding can force desired features into the output by raising the weight arbitrarily high, but it may also introduce unintended side effects such as reduced fluency or coherence [2]. Therefore, while higher weights can increase specificity or responsiveness, they must be carefully calibrated to avoid producing outputs that are overly generic or nonsensical.\n\n![Weighted decoding shows how varying weights influence response generation.](image1)"}

For instance, the TACREV dataset uses placeholders like `{subj}` and `{obj}` for subject and object entities [11].\n\nWhile no direct mention of the \"Contact.Meet\" label is found, we can infer that its template would follow a similar structure to other event or relation labels, likely involving placeholders for relevant entities or actions. This inference is supported by examples in image2, which shows how prompts are structured for NER, Relation Extraction, Event Detection, and Event Argument Extraction tasks. For example, in Event Detection, the template might involve identifying an event and locating it within the sentence [image2].\n\n![Event detection template example](image2)"}

These methods differ in how they navigate and select relevant nodes within the tree, which affects the granularity and breadth of the retrieved context.\n\nIn **Tree Traversal Retrieval**, the process begins at the root of the tree and proceeds layer-by-layer. At each level, the top-k most relevant nodes are selected based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This method allows for a progressive narrowing down of the search, starting with broader thematic information and moving toward more granular details as it descends through the layers of the tree. The retrieved context is then formed by concatenating the text from all selected nodes [8]. This approach offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved by adjusting parameters such as depth $d$ and the number of nodes $k$ selected at each layer [9].\n\nOn the other hand, **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** simplifies the retrieval process by flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer. Instead of traversing layer-by-layer, this method evaluates all nodes simultaneously, bringing them onto the same level for comparison. Nodes are selected based on cosine similarity until a threshold number of tokens is reached, ensuring that the retrieved context is at the correct level of granularity for the given question [10]. This approach provides greater flexibility by allowing simultaneous consideration of all nodes, which can lead to more comprehensive retrieval results compared to the layer-by-layer traversal method [3].\n\nThe visual representation of these two approaches is illustrated in `![Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image3)`, where both methods begin with query encoding and use cosine similarity to select relevant nodes. However, while Tree Traversal Retrieval follows a hierarchical path through the tree, Collapsed Tree Retrieval treats all nodes equally in a flattened structure.\n\nOverall, Tree Traversal Retrieval offers a structured, layered exploration of the tree, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval provides a more holistic and flexible approach by considering all nodes simultaneously."}

For the DAE model, these points are separated into distinct clusters for each class, indicating a clear distinction between different styles. However, in the VAE model, while the points are also clustered, they are less distinctly separated compared to the DAE model. This suggests that the VAE's latent space, although more continuous and smooth, may not capture the same level of separation between different styles as the DAE.\n\nIn the content space visualization (right column of the plots), both models show overlapping clusters of 'neg' and 'pos' points, suggesting that there is less separation in this space for both models. The content space appears to be more uniformly distributed than the style space in both models.

The results show that BiDAF outperforms FastQA in most scenarios:\n\n- On **WIKIHOP**:\n  - Under the **standard test**, BiDAF scores 54.5%, while FastQA scores 35.8%.\n  - Under the **gold chain test**, BiDAF scores 81.2%, while FastQA scores 65.3%.\n\n- On **MEDHOP**:\n  - Under the **standard test**, BiDAF scores 33.7%, while FastQA scores 31.3%.\n  - Under the **gold chain test**, BiDAF scores 99.3%, while FastQA scores 51.8%.\n\nThese results indicate that BiDAF performs significantly better than FastQA, especially when only relevant documents are used. The difference is even more pronounced in the gold chain setup, where BiDAF nearly achieves perfect scores on MEDHOP, whereas FastQA struggles to exceed 55% [image2].\n\nOverall, while both models benefit from being presented with only relevant documents, BiDAF demonstrates superior performance, particularly in the gold chain scenario, highlighting its stronger ability to integrate information across multiple documents and extract accurate answers."}

A critical component of this architecture is the use of **object queries**, which serve as learned embeddings that guide the model's attention mechanisms and ultimately lead to the final detection predictions [2]. These object queries are initialized as small fixed vectors and are processed through the decoder alongside the encoded features from the CNN backbone [5].\n\nThe object queries are passed through the transformer decoder, where they interact with the encoder's output via self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. This interaction allows the model to globally reason about all objects in the scene and their relationships, enabling it to make accurate predictions for bounding boxes and class labels [5]. Importantly, the object queries are transformed into output embeddings by the decoder, which are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels using a feed-forward network (FFN) [5].\n\nFurthermore, positional encodings are added to these object queries at every attention layer in the decoder to ensure that the model can distinguish between different spatial locations in the image. While some experiments explored the impact of removing or modifying these positional encodings, it was found that even without spatial positional encodings, the model could still achieve reasonable performance, though slightly lower than the baseline [4].\n\n![DETR model architecture with object queries and attention mechanisms](image5)"}

When repetition control is introduced, it can reduce the number of questions produced by the model. This occurs because certain features, such as the `extrep bigram` mechanism, discourage the model from repeating bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. These bigrams often include common question patterns like \"do you\" and \"what is,\" which are essential for generating questions. As a result, even when the model is trained to ask questions at a high rate (e.g., $z=10$), the presence of repetition control may limit this behavior.\n\nFor instance, in the case of conditional training (CT), increasing the control level $z$ from 0 to 10 typically results in a wide range of question-asking rates—from $1.40\\%$ to $97.72\\%$. However, when repetition control is applied, the same $z=10$ setting only produces $79.67\\%$ questions instead of the expected $100\\%$. To address this issue, an additional setting called $z=10$ (boost) was introduced, where the `extrep bigram` feature is disabled during beam search but used for reranking candidates afterward. This adjustment allows the model to produce more questions while still managing repetition, achieving a $99.54\\%$ question-asking rate with only a slight increase in external bigram repetition [10].\n\nThis effect is further illustrated in Figure 4, where the line graph shows how different methods influence the percentage of utterances containing a question mark ('?'). The **Question-controlled CT** method (blue line) demonstrates a steep increase in question frequency as the control level increases, approaching near $100\\%$ at higher levels. In contrast, the **Question-controlled CT with repetition control** (purple line) shows a more gradual increase, reaching a lower maximum of approximately $80\\%$.

These approaches are designed to address different challenges in retrieving and integrating external knowledge into the generation process.\n\nThe **Iterative Retrieval** method alternates between retrieval and generation steps to progressively refine the context provided to the language model. This approach aims to enrich the context by repeatedly retrieving more relevant information based on previous generations. The process involves querying the knowledge base, generating an initial response, evaluating it, and repeating this cycle until a specified threshold or number of iterations is reached. This technique is particularly useful when richer and more targeted context is needed at each step of the process [image2].\n\nOn the other hand, **Recursive Retrieval** focuses on gradually refining the user query and decomposing complex problems into sub-problems that can be addressed through iterative retrieval and generation. It uses query transformation or decomposition techniques to break down ambiguous or complex queries into more manageable parts. This allows the system to tackle highly specialized or nuanced information needs by continuously solving sub-problems through retrieval and generation. This method is especially effective in scenarios where the user’s intent is not clearly defined from the outset [image2].\n\nFinally, **Adaptive Retrieval** enables the RAG system to autonomously determine when and what information should be retrieved based on the current query and the context generated so far. Unlike the fixed sequences of iterative and recursive retrieval, adaptive retrieval allows the system to decide dynamically whether to retrieve additional information or proceed with generation. This flexibility enhances the system's efficiency and relevance by minimizing unnecessary retrievals and focusing only on the most pertinent information. Special tokens or internal judgments within the model help guide these decisions [image2].\n\nThese three retrieval methods differ primarily in their approach to handling queries and integrating retrieved information: iterative retrieval emphasizes repeated refinement, recursive retrieval focuses on query decomposition, and adaptive retrieval prioritizes dynamic decision-making based on the context. Each method offers unique advantages depending on the specific requirements of the task at hand. \n\n![Iterative Retrieval alternates between retrieval and generation to enrich context.](image2)\n![Recursive Retrieval breaks down complex queries into sub-problems for deeper exploration.](image2)\n![Adaptive Retrieval allows the system to decide dynamically when to retrieve information.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes differ in how they handle query refinement, context enrichment, and dynamic decision-making within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system."}

This imbalance arises because MRC tasks typically involve predicting the starting and ending indexes of an answer within a context, with only two tokens being positive (or of interest) while the rest are considered background or negative examples.\n\nFor the Quoref dataset specifically, although the exact negative-to-positive ratio is not explicitly stated in the provided quotes, it falls under the broader category of MRC tasks where such imbalances are prevalent. The performance improvements observed in models like BERT+DSC on the QuoRef dataset, as seen in image5, further support the idea that this dataset exhibits a significant imbalance, requiring careful handling of hyperparameters like $\\alpha$ in methods such as the Tversky Index to manage the tradeoff between false negatives and false positives.\n\n![The Quoref dataset is used in experiments to evaluate how hyperparameters affect model performance on MRC tasks, indicating its relevance to data imbalance issues.](image5)"}

This is evident from the analysis presented in the text and visualized in the tables.\n\nFor instance, Table 5 highlights that when using 500 retrieved paragraphs in an open-domain setting, single-paragraph BERT achieves a relatively low F1 score of 39.12. However, when two gold paragraphs are added to this setup, the F1 score improves substantially to 53.12 [5]. This demonstrates that the failure to retrieve gold paragraphs has a significant negative impact on model performance. Gold paragraphs provide the necessary evidence for answering multi-hop questions, and their absence leads to a drop in accuracy.\n\nSimilarly, Table 4 shows how the performance of a single-paragraph BERT model declines when faced with adversarial distractors. The F1 score drops from 67.08 to 46.84. However, when the model is re-trained on these adversarial distractors, it recovers most of its original accuracy, achieving 60.10 F1 [2]. This suggests that while adversarial distractors pose a challenge, they can also be used to improve model robustness if incorporated into training.\n\n![Gold paragraphs improve F1 scores](image4)  \n![Adversarial distractors reduce F1 scores but allow for recovery through re-training](image2)\n\nThese findings have important implications for model performance. They indicate that the quality and relevance of the retrieved paragraphs—whether gold or distractors—play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of multi-hop reasoning models. In particular, the inability of standard retrieval methods like TF-IDF to effectively retrieve gold paragraphs in open-domain settings limits the performance of single-hop models [5]. This calls for the development of better retrieval techniques tailored for multi-hop questions.\n\nMoreover, the results suggest that carefully selected distractors can simulate more complex reasoning tasks, potentially making questions that were previously answerable with single-hop reasoning require multi-hop reasoning instead [6]. This underscores the importance of creating diverse and challenging datasets to evaluate and improve multi-hop reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of gold paragraphs enhances model performance by providing essential information, while the presence of strong distractors challenges the model and may necessitate improvements in retrieval systems or training strategies."}

This is because the meaning of a sentence can drastically change based on the arrangement of words. For instance, the phrases \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment due to their differing word orders [7]. LSTM models are particularly effective at capturing this kind of sequential information through their recurrent transition functions, which allow them to maintain and update memory states as they process sequences [9].\n\nTo further understand the importance of word-order in sentiment analysis, researchers conducted experiments where the words in the training set were randomly shuffled while keeping the original order in the test set. The idea was to remove word-order features from the training data and observe how sensitive the performance of different models was to this change [9]. The results showed that for sentiment analysis tasks, such as on the Yelp Polarity dataset, the performance dropped significantly when word order was removed, indicating that word-order information is essential for accurate sentiment prediction [11].\n\nThis finding is supported by the comparison between SWEM (Simple Word-Embedding Model) and LSTM models.

However, when repetition control is applied, this rate is reduced due to the use of the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This restriction prevents the model from using common question-related bigrams such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" which are essential for generating questions [6]. \n\nTo address this issue, an additional setting called `z=10 (boost)` was introduced. In this setting, the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during beam search but is applied to rerank candidates after beam search. This adjustment allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams while still maintaining some level of repetition control. As a result, the question-asking rate reaches 99.54%, which is very close to the ideal 100% rate, albeit with a slight increase in external bigram repetition [6].\n\n![The question-asking rate increases with higher control levels but is reduced by repetition control.](image2)"}

This implies that the deeper layers are less sensitive to such isolation.\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides a visual representation of the impact of isolating label words versus randomly isolating non-label words in the first or last five layers. The data shows that isolating label words in the first five layers significantly impacts loyalty metrics, but when isolating label words in the last five layers, the impact is minimal.

This transformation is designed to eliminate spurious statistical cues in the dataset, which BERT and other models were previously exploiting to achieve higher-than-expected accuracy [1]. When BERT is evaluated on the adversarial dataset, its peak performance drops from $77\\%$ to $53\\%$, aligning with random accuracy levels [3]. This decline indicates that BERT’s initial high performance was largely due to these statistical cues rather than true understanding of argument comprehension [4].\n\nIn contrast, other models such as BoV and BiLSTM show more consistent performance across different configurations, with their results not being as heavily influenced by the adversarial transformation [5]. For example, the mean performance of BERT (Large) on the adversarial test set is $0.504 \\pm 0.01$, while the median is $0.505$, showing a substantial drop compared to its performance on the original dataset [6]. Meanwhile, models like GIST demonstrate strong performance on the development set but do not surpass BERT on the test set [image1].\n\n![BERT's performance on adversarial dataset](image6)\n\nFurthermore, the adversarial transformation highlights the importance of robust evaluation in NLP tasks. While BERT initially outperformed other models, its performance on the adversarial dataset reveals that it lacks genuine understanding of the task, as its performance becomes indistinguishable from random guessing [12]. This underscores the need for future research to focus on evaluating models under conditions that minimize reliance on spurious cues.\n\nIn summary, the adversarial transformation negatively affects BERT's performance, revealing that its earlier success was based on exploiting statistical artifacts rather than true comprehension. Other models, however, appear to be less affected, suggesting they may rely less on these cues or have inherently more robust mechanisms for handling the task."}

Typically, in such performance comparisons, one axis would represent a parameter being varied (e.g., top-size or maximum token number), while the other would represent the performance metric (e.g., accuracy, ROUGE score, F1 score).\n\nTo support this inference, we can refer to Figure 6, which is described as a graph comparing querying methods based on the F1 score.

The number of dialogues containing these slots is distributed as follows: **3381** in the training set, **416** in the validation set, and **394** in the test set.

This is supported by several studies and visualizations from the provided data.\n\nFor instance, on the **BloodMNIST** dataset, the hard-to-contrast initial query strategy (red lines) outperforms other initial query strategies in every cycle of active learning [1]. Similarly, on **PathMNIST**, the hard-to-contrast strategy consistently achieves the highest AUC scores across different numbers of labeled images [3]. The results show that even with a small number of labeled images (e.g., 20), the hard-to-contrast strategy leads to strong performance, which continues to improve as more labeled images are added [5].\n\nA key finding from the analysis is that the performance of the initial cycle (with 20 labeled images) and the last cycle (with 50 labeled images) are strongly correlated for all strategies, but the correlation is particularly high for the hard-to-contrast strategy [1]. This indicates that selecting hard-to-contrast data early in the process not only improves model performance at the beginning but also sets a strong foundation for subsequent cycles of active learning.\n\nFurthermore, the visualization in **image5** provides a detailed comparison of AUC percentages across different numbers of labeled images for various strategies. The red line representing the hard-to-contrast strategy generally outperforms the others across all graphs, reinforcing its effectiveness in improving model performance with fewer labeled samples [image5].\n\nThe implications of these findings for initial query selection in active learning are significant. Selecting hard-to-contrast data as the initial query enhances label diversity and reduces bias toward majority classes, which is crucial for addressing the cold start problem [10]. By prioritizing hard-to-contrast data, the model gains access to more informative and diverse samples early on, leading to improved performance and efficiency in subsequent learning cycles [9].\n\nIn summary, the hard-to-contrast querying strategy consistently outperforms other strategies in terms of AUC across different numbers of labeled images, making it a highly effective approach for initial query selection in active learning."}

Initially, when $ p $ is low, the model tends to overfit on the long-term user representation (LTUR), which leads to suboptimal performance [7]. This is because the LTUR has many parameters, and with a small $ p $, the model does not sufficiently incorporate the short-term user representation (STUR) into its learning process [9]. However, as $ p $ increases, the model starts to balance the contributions of LTUR and STUR more effectively, leading to improved performance for both methods [7].\n\nThe results are visualized in image8, which shows two line charts comparing the influence of mask probability $ p $ on the performance of LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con. Each chart includes four metrics: AUC, MRR, nDCG@5, and nDCG@10. For both methods, the AUC metric improves as $ p $ increases from 0 to a moderate value (e.g., 0.5), after which it begins to decline as $ p $ becomes too large [7]. This suggests that there is an optimal range for $ p $ where the performance is maximized.\n\nInterestingly, while both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con show similar patterns in their performance curves, LSTUR-con tends to be more stable across different values of $ p $ [8].

Unlike many previous benchmarks that focus on basic perception or common-sense reasoning, MMMU includes problems that demand step-by-step logical reasoning and deep understanding of subject matter. For example, it requires applying advanced concepts such as \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions [2]. This is further emphasized in Figure 1, which highlights the unique challenges posed by MMMU, including its requirement for both expert visual perception and deliberate reasoning [image8].\n\n![MMMU's unique challenges in perception and reasoning](image8)\n\nThe implications of these features are significant for evaluating LMMs. The breadth ensures that models are tested across a wide array of real-world scenarios, while the depth ensures that they are capable of handling complex, expert-level tasks.

These models have been evaluated against a range of baseline and state-of-the-art metrics across multiple language pairs, with results showing their effectiveness in capturing human judgments of translation quality.\n\nFor example, Table 1 and Table 2 compare the performance of COMET models with other metrics like BLEU, chrF, BERTSCORE, and BLEURT on various language pairs.

In the **Problem Formulation** stage, a large language model (LLM) translates the natural language description of a problem into a symbolic formulation that captures the key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem [12]. This symbolic representation is crucial because it allows for precise and unambiguous reasoning, which is essential for complex logical tasks.\n\nOnce the problem has been formulated symbolically, the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage begins. Here, a deterministic symbolic solver—such as a logic programming engine or a constraint satisfaction solver—executes inference on the symbolic formulation to derive an answer [12]. This step ensures that the reasoning is faithful and logically sound, as it relies on well-defined algorithms rather than the potentially ambiguous reasoning of natural language [2].\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** takes the output from the symbolic solver and translates it back into natural language, providing a comprehensible answer to the original question [12]. This interpreter can be either an LLM or a rule-based system, depending on the task requirements.\n\nTo illustrate this process, consider Figure 5, which visually outlines the structure of the LOGIC-LM model. It shows how the Problem Formulator converts a natural language problem into symbolic form, the Symbolic Reasoner performs logical inference using appropriate solvers, and the Result Interpreter maps the symbolic result back to a human-readable answer [image5].\n\nThis modular approach effectively shifts the burden of executing complex logical reasoning from the LLM to reliable symbolic solvers while leveraging the LLM's strengths in natural language understanding and in-context learning to formulate the problem accurately [9]."}

In contrast, MedHop has fewer candidates per sample, with the majority having only one type of query: \"interacts with\" [2]. This is further supported by the statistical data from image4, which shows that for WikiHop, the average number of candidates per sample is 19.8, while for MedHop, it is much lower at 8.9.\n\nIn terms of the number of documents per sample, the text notes that MedHop involves a significantly larger number of documents per sample compared to WikiHop [8]. This is corroborated by image4, which provides detailed statistics on the number of documents per sample. For WikiHop, the average number of documents per sample is 13.7, whereas for MedHop, it is notably higher at 36.4.

In knowledge graphs like WikiData, entities are connected by relations, often visualized as arrows pointing from one node (entity) to another. Leaf nodes typically represent entities that have no outgoing relations or are terminal points in the graph.\n\nFrom the text, we learn that the task of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) involves attributing sentences to knowledge triplets in a structured knowledge graph [6]. This implies that each triplet consists of two entities and a relation, where the relation is an arrow connecting the two entities. The process of mapping names to unique QIDs ensures that each entity is clearly identified, and the relationships between them are well-defined [1].\n\nHowever, the text also discusses the challenge of coverage—no repository can contain all information—and introduces the concept of \"Conscious Incompetence,\" where models recognize gaps in their knowledge [3]. This suggests that some relations may not be fully resolved or may point to incomplete or missing information, potentially leading to arrows that do not connect to specific leaf nodes.\n\nIn this context, the image described as `image1` provides a comparison of different models based on alignment, correctness, precision, recall, and F1-scores [image1]. While this image does not directly show Figure 1 mentioned in the question, it indicates that there are metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of model outputs against a known dataset. These evaluations might highlight cases where relation arrows fail to point to specific leaf nodes due to incomplete knowledge retrieval or incorrect mappings.\n\nMoreover, the diagram in `image2` explains how citation precision and recall are calculated for generated content [image2]. It shows that if a sentence includes knowledge elements that are not present in the minimum knowledge set, they are marked with [NA], indicating a gap in the model’s understanding. This could correspond to relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes when the required knowledge is missing.\n\nFinally, `image6` depicts a knowledge graph illustrating the influence of Orazio Gentileschi on Artemisia Gentileschi [image6]. This example shows how relations such as \"father,\" \"occupation,\" and \"style\" connect entities. If any of these relations were incomplete or pointed to ambiguous or non-specific nodes, they would not connect to clear leaf nodes.\n\nIn summary, the relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes likely arise from either incomplete knowledge retrieval, ambiguous entity mappings, or intentional gaps introduced to simulate the \"Conscious Incompetence\" scenario. These issues are highlighted through metrics like precision and recall in the evaluation frameworks described in the text and images. \n\n![Relation arrows without specific leaf nodes](image6)"}

The research indicates that the filter-then-rerank approach significantly improves performance on few-shot information extraction (IE) tasks, especially when applied to hard samples identified by SLMs [7]. This method reranks only a small subset of difficult samples using LLMs, which leads to a notable increase in performance while minimizing additional latency and costs [4].\n\nFor the TACREV dataset specifically, Table 3 in the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the filter-then-rerank method across multiple settings. For instance, with InstructGPT as the reranker, reranking provides an average F1 gain of 2.4% without SLM ensemble [9]. This suggests that even without an ensemble of SLMs, the filter-then-rerank method still achieves significant improvements in performance.\n\nAdditionally, Table 4 highlights that only a minor fraction (0.5%–10%) of samples are deemed hard and reranked by LLMs, yet this results in a substantial performance boost (10%–25% absolute F1 gains) on these samples [11]. This underscores the efficiency of the method, as it selectively applies reranking to challenging cases rather than all samples.\n\n![Performance comparison for TACREV dataset](image6)"}

This variation is particularly important because it affects the performance of models in classifying neutral instances, especially given the challenges posed by unbalanced label distributions [5].\n\nFor example, **D1** has a relatively balanced number of neutral examples compared to the other datasets. In the training set, there are 637 neutral entries out of a total of 3,608 (2164 Pos + 807 Neg + 637 Neu), and in the test set, there are 196 neutral entries out of 1,120 (728 Pos + 196 Neg + 196 Neu) [image1]. This balance makes it easier for models to learn and classify neutral examples effectively.\n\nIn contrast, **D3** has a very low number of neutral examples in both the training and test sets. Specifically, the training set contains only 50 neutral entries out of 1,560 (1178 Pos + 382 Neg + 50 Neu), and the test set has just 35 neutral entries out of 802 (439 Pos + 328 Neg + 35 Neu). Similarly, **D4** also has a very low number of neutral examples: 88 in the training set out of 2,417 (1620 Pos + 709 Neg + 88 Neu), and 38 in the test set out of 825 (597 Pos + 190 Neg + 38 Neu) [image1]. These extremely low numbers make it difficult for models to accurately predict neutral examples, as even small differences in predictions can have a large impact on recall and precision [5].\n\nOn the other hand, **D2** shows an intermediate level of neutral examples. The training set includes 464 neutral entries out of 2,328 (994 Pos + 870 Neg + 464 Neu), and the test set contains 169 neutral entries out of 638 (341 Pos + 128 Neg + 169 Neu). While this is less imbalanced than D3 and D4, it still presents challenges for classification due to the lower proportion of neutral examples compared to positive and negative ones [image1].\n\nThis uneven distribution of neutral examples explains why improvements in macro-F1 scores are more pronounced on D3 and D4, where the lack of neutral examples makes classification harder, and document-level knowledge helps compensate for this imbalance [8].\n\n![Neutral examples are more evenly distributed in D1 and D2 compared to D3 and D4, which have very few neutral examples in both training and test sets.](image1)"}

For example, in languages with rich morphology or where certain named entities may not be present in the training corpus, character-level information can help infer the correct tag even when the exact word is not seen before [11].\n\n![Character-level information helps capture subword patterns like morphological variations and capitalization, which are important for NER.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, combining these two types of embeddings improves the model's robustness, especially in low-resource scenarios where annotated data is limited.

As described, during the pre-processing phase, images from object detection datasets are first **cropped** based on proposal bounding box coordinates and then **resized** to a fixed proportion [8]. This ensures that each region of interest is isolated and standardized in size, making it easier for the image encoder to extract relevant embeddings. \n\nThis step is particularly important in zero-shot recognition because objects in detection datasets can vary significantly in scale and position within an image. Unlike in classification tasks where the object is typically large and centered, detection datasets often contain smaller, more varied objects positioned anywhere in the frame. By cropping and resizing, the model focuses on the specific regions of interest, reducing noise and distractions from other parts of the image.\n\nAdditionally, the diagram mentions the use of **blurring** on non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest.

This approach conceptualized word meaning as evolving across different temporal slices, represented as a Word:Semantic Vector:Time tensor.\n\nIn 2011, researchers began exploring the use of the Google Ngrams corpus, which provided a large-scale dataset for analyzing semantic change over time [12]. This dataset became a cornerstone for many subsequent studies and is noted for its role in the emerging field of 'culturomics' [12].\n\nBy 2012, efforts were made to disambiguate different epochs of word usage through a method known as \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" which aimed to identify the specific time periods in which certain contexts of a word belonged [3]. This was an important step in refining how semantic shifts could be detected and evaluated.\n\nAdvancements in prediction-based models emerged in 2013, marking a shift towards more sophisticated methods for capturing semantic evolution [10]. These models would go on to become central to the field.\n\nIn 2014, the use of \"Word embeddings,\" particularly exemplified by the \"word2vec\" model, became prominent in tracing diachronic semantic shifts [10]. This marked a turning point in the field, as these dense vector representations enabled more nuanced analysis of semantic changes over time.\n\nThe year 2015 saw the development of \"Models alignment,\" which focused on aligning different models trained on various time spans to better understand semantic drift [image1]. This period also witnessed the application of these techniques to diverse datasets such as Amazon Movie Reviews and Twitter data, demonstrating the robustness of computational methods in detecting semantic shifts over shorter time frames [8].\n\nIn 2016, the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" were utilized extensively for semantic shift analysis, providing detailed insights into how word meanings evolved over decades [8]. This year also highlighted the importance of using different corpora to capture a wide range of semantic changes.\n\nFinally, in 2017, there were significant insights into the \"Laws of semantic change,\" as well as the realization that \"Local measures better for cultural shifts\" [image1]. Additionally, the \"Gigaword corpus\" and exploration of \"Diachronic relations\" further enriched the methodologies available for studying semantic change. However, this year also brought \"Criticism of semantic change laws,\" indicating the ongoing refinement and debate within the field [image1].\n\n![Key milestones in diachronic semantic shifts research from 2010 to 2017](image1)"}

These slots are typically treated as non-categorical, meaning that their values are extracted from the dialog context through span matching rather than being selected from a predefined list.\n\nAccording to Table 4, which presents slot-level accuracy on the test set of MultiWOZ 2.1, the 'time-related' slots such as 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' are categorized as span-based slots in both DS-Span and DS-DST. However, these methods struggle with these slots because they often lack explicit span matches in the dialogue context, leading to lower performance. In contrast, when the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist can reduce error rates since it selects values from candidate-value lists [9].\n\nThis distinction is further supported by Table 5, which highlights how DS-DST and DS-Picklist perform better than DS-Span for certain slots like 'attraction-type', 'hotel-internet', and 'hotel-parking'. However, for time-related slots, where span matching is less effective, the improvement is not as significant. This suggests that while DS-DST improves over DS-Span by enabling direct interactions between dialog context and slots, DS-Picklist performs even better when the ontology is available, especially for slots where values are not explicitly mentioned in the dialog [4].\n\n![DS-DST and DS-Picklist performance comparison for time-related slots](image4)"}

When evaluating BERT's performance on the original dataset, it achieves a peak accuracy of $77\\%$ on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which is only three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this result is attributed to the model exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset rather than demonstrating true argument comprehension [5].\n\nTo investigate this further, researchers constructed an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these spurious cues. On this adversarial dataset, BERT’s peak performance drops to $53\\%$, with both mean and median scores at $50\\%$ [9]. This significant decline suggests that BERT's initial high performance was largely dependent on the presence of these statistical cues.\n\nMoreover, probing experiments reveal that BERT’s $77\\%$ peak performance can be fully explained by its ability to exploit cues from warrants (W), reasons (R), and claims (C).

The tree traversal method involves traversing the tree layer-by-layer, selecting relevant nodes at each level based on cosine similarity to the query embedding [9]. This approach allows for control over the specificity and breadth of the retrieved information by adjusting the depth $d$ and the number of nodes $k$ selected at each layer [10]. In contrast, the collapsed tree method evaluates all nodes across all layers simultaneously, flattening the tree into a single layer for comparison [4].\n\nIn terms of performance, the collapsed tree method has been shown to offer greater flexibility and superior results compared to tree traversal. Specifically, when tested on the QASPER dataset, the collapsed tree approach consistently outperformed tree traversal in terms of F1 score [6]. The graph in Figure 3 illustrates this comparison, showing that the collapsed tree method achieves its best F1 score at a context length of 2000 tokens, with a slight decline as the context length increases to 2500 tokens [6]. On the other hand, the tree traversal method shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length but remains lower than the collapsed tree method overall [6].\n\n![The collapsed tree method achieves its best F1 score at 2000 tokens, while the tree traversal method performs lower overall](image8)"}

When analyzing the impact of removing specific supervision sources, it becomes clear that each data source contributes uniquely to the model's ability to predict ultra-fine-grained labels.\n\nFor instance, Table 4 shows that when the crowd-sourced data is excluded (i.e., \"– Crowd\"), the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category drops, indicating that this data source provides valuable signals for identifying more specific entity types [11]. Similarly, the removal of head-word supervision (\"– Head\") also leads to a decline in performance, particularly for ultra-fine labels, which are more challenging to predict and benefit from the additional context provided by head words [10]. Entity linking data (\"– EL\") also plays a crucial role, as its exclusion results in reduced performance across all categories, including Ultra-Fine, due to the loss of structured knowledge from KBs and Wikipedia definitions [5].\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of combining multiple supervision sources to enhance the model's capability to detect fine and ultra-fine-grained entity types. The use of diverse data sources helps mitigate issues such as nominal/pronoun mentions (e.g., “it”) and large type inventories where labels like “location” and “place” may be annotated interchangeably [10].\n\n![Our Dataset has more diverse and fine-grained labels compared to OntoNotes and FIGER](image2)  \n![Performance metrics for models trained with different portions of the dataset](image3)"}

Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of working with clients globally to deliver innovative solutions and optimize business processes [1], suggesting a widespread operational presence.\n\nLooking at the image data, we can infer details about the company’s scale:\n\n- **image1** indicates 9 offices, 500 employees, and 7 countries.\n- **image2** shows 20 offices, 1914 employees, and 12 countries.\n- **image3** highlights 12 offices, 1816 employees, and 9 countries.\n- **image4** features 17 offices, 870 employees, and 11 countries.\n- **image5** presents 12 offices, 1816 employees, and 9 countries.\n- **image6** and **image7** both indicate 20 offices, 1914 employees, and 12 countries.\n- **image8** shows 9 offices, 500 employees, and 7 countries.\n\nFrom these figures, we can observe variations in the number of offices, employees, and countries across different depictions. However, since the question specifically asks for a comparison between the Assurance and Consulting divisions, and no direct information is provided about these two divisions separately, we must rely on indirect evidence from the broader context of PwC’s operations.\n\nIn general, the Consulting division appears to have a larger scale based on the higher numbers of offices and employees seen in several images (e.g., 20 offices and 1914 employees in image6). In contrast, the Assurance division might be represented in smaller-scale settings, such as image1, which includes 9 offices and 500 employees. These differences suggest that the Consulting division may have a more extensive global reach and larger workforce compared to the Assurance division.\n\n![Comparative data showing 20 Offices, 1914 Employees, and 12 Countries](image6)  \n![Comparative data showing 9 Offices, 500 Employees, and 7 Countries](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available data, the Consulting division likely has a broader organizational presence and larger employee distribution compared to the Assurance division."}

This is a classic Boolean search, where \"AND\" ensures that both terms are included, and \"NOT\" excludes those with the term \"Manager.\" \n\nThis concept is supported by the text quote: \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" [6], which directly reflects the search criteria in question. Additionally, the importance of Boolean searching in LinkedIn Recruiter is emphasized in several quotes, such as: \"While next-gen Recruiter will allow for efficient searching without knowledge of Boolean modifiers, understanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings remains a fundamental skill for all talent acquisition professionals\" [10]. This reinforces the relevance of Boolean logic in effective searching.\n\nTo visualize this search, we can refer to the Venn diagram shown in `![People with Engineering and Java skills but not in Management](image7)`. In this diagram, the overlapping region between \"Engineering\" and \"Java\" represents individuals with both sets of skills. The exclusion of \"Manager\" would remove any individual who falls into the intersection involving the third unlabeled category (which may include managerial roles). Therefore, the subset selected by this search corresponds to the area where \"Engineering\" and \"Java\" overlap, excluding those in the \"Manager\" category.\n\nIn conclusion, the subset selected by the search \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" according to the Venn diagram is the group represented by section **E**—those with skills in both Engineering and Java but not in the Manager category."}

This includes not only the technical aspects of using LinkedIn Recruiter but also the strategic components of talent acquisition. For instance, understanding how to effectively search the network is just as important as knowing how to post a job [5], which highlights the comprehensive nature of the certification.\n\nOne of the key ways this credential validates these abilities is through its focus on identifying talent. The certification emphasizes the use of advanced search techniques to locate potential candidates, as illustrated in image2, where a hand points downward at a grid of faces with the caption \"Find.\" This visual reinforces the importance of being able to identify suitable candidates from a large pool of potential applicants.\n\nEngaging talent is another critical component of the certification. It involves leveraging LinkedIn presence and InMail to connect with candidates. Image4 provides data on how certified recruiters can measure their effectiveness in engaging talent through metrics such as the number of InMails sent and accepted, as well as the response rate. For example, Recruiter B had a higher response rate (33%) compared to Recruiter A (12%), indicating better engagement strategies.\n\nManaging talent effectively is also a cornerstone of the certification. This includes building and maintaining a talent pipeline, which is crucial for long-term success in recruitment. As noted in one testimonial, becoming a Projects and Talent Pipeline expert was a significant area of growth for a certified recruiter [10]. Image5 further illustrates this by showing that building a talent pipeline is one of the five key areas of focus for obtaining the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification.\n\nMoreover, the credential ensures that recruiters are equipped with foundational skills that remain relevant in the ever-evolving recruitment industry. LinkedIn recognizes the need for flexibility and adaptability, emphasizing that certified professionals are prepared to meet changing business needs [9]. This adaptability is reflected in the diverse set of skills covered in the certification curriculum, including posting jobs, maximizing efficiency through tools for organization and collaboration, and more [5].\n\nIn summary, the LinkedIn Certified Professional-Recruiter credential validates a recruiter’s ability to find, engage, and manage talent by ensuring they possess a well-rounded skill set that covers all aspects of the recruitment process. ![Finding talent](image2) ![Measuring engagement effectiveness](image4) ![Key areas of certification](image5)"}

Additionally, the **Hanseatic Museum & Sch t stu ene** is also located at Bryggen and provides a glimpse into the lives of the German merchants who once inhabited the area [9]. These museums are part of the UNESCO-recognized heritage of Bryggen, which includes the preserved wooden buildings that date back to the 17th and 18th centuries [1].\n\n![Bryggen as a UNESCO World Heritage site](image6)\n\nAnother notable museum associated with UNESCO is the **Old Bergen Museum**, which is dedicated to preserving and showcasing the city's rich history, including artifacts and exhibits that highlight life in Bergen during different periods [5].

However, it is closely tied to Norway’s cultural heritage and features the preserved villa of the famous composer Edvard Grieg, along with his cabin, burial site, concert hall, and museum [6]. The museum also hosts daily concerts from June to August, allowing visitors to experience Grieg’s music in the very environment where it was composed.\n\n![Edvard Grieg’s villa at Troldhaugen](image5)\n\nLastly, the **Herdla Museum** is situated on Herdla Island, which is part of the archipelago west of Bergen. While not a UNESCO site itself, Herdla has a unique historical context, particularly due to its role during World War II. The museum houses exhibitions on this dramatic period, including a German fighter aircraft from WWII, and offers opportunities for nature-related activities like bird-watching and swimming [4].\n\n![Herdla Museum with WWII exhibits](image4)\n\nIn summary, the museums associated with UNESCO World Heritage sites include **Bryggens Museum**, the **Hanseatic Museum & Sch t stu ene**, and the **Old Bergen Museum**, all of which are located within the historic district of Bryggen.

While the text quotes do not explicitly mention Assurance, they do provide detailed insights into the Consulting division's structure and operations.\n\nThe Consulting division is described as a globally integrated team that works across multiple industries and provides services such as supply chain management, operational improvement, and digital transformation [1]. It emphasizes collaboration with clients to drive innovation and growth, offering deep industry and functional expertise on both strategic and operational levels [4]. This suggests that the Consulting division operates in numerous countries and has a substantial workforce dedicated to delivering these services.\n\nIn terms of global presence and employee count, several images provide data points that can be interpreted as indicative of PwC’s overall global footprint, which may include both Assurance and Consulting divisions. For example, image1 highlights \"Offices 12,\" \"Countries 9,\" and \"Employees 1816\" [image1], while image3 similarly displays \"Offices: 12,\" \"Employees: 1816,\" and \"Countries: 9\" [image3]. These figures suggest a significant global presence with a large number of employees.\n\nHowever, if we consider the Consulting division specifically, image7 indicates that the organization has 500 employees, 9 offices, and operates in 7 countries [image7]. This could imply that the Consulting division, or a part of it, has a more focused presence compared to the broader organization.\n\nIn contrast, Assurance services are typically more standardized and involve auditing and assurance activities, often with a more uniform global structure. While the text does not directly address Assurance, it is reasonable to infer that its global presence might be more widespread due to the nature of audit and assurance work, which often requires compliance with international standards and regulations.\n\n![PwC's global presence with offices, countries, and employees](image1)"}

However, their specific employee distribution and geographical presence differ based on the information embedded in the images.\n\nFor instance, image1 shows an organization with 500 employees, 9 offices, and operations in 7 countries. This could represent a department or a regional division, possibly aligned with either Consulting or Deals.

To calculate the number of non-response InMails, we subtract the accepted and declined InMails from the total sent:  \n  $ 375 - 8 - 37 = 330 $\n\n- For **Recruiter B**, the number of InMails sent was 75. Out of these, 14 were accepted and 11 were declined. Similarly, we subtract the accepted and declined InMails from the total sent:  \n  $ 75 - 14 - 11 = 50 $\n\nThus, the total number of non-response InMails for both recruiters combined is:\n$ 330 + 50 = 380 $\n\n![Recruiter A and B's InMail activity summary](image5)"}

For instance, the firm's legal services are described as being part of \"the largest legal network in the world with over 4000 lawyers in over 100 countries\" [5], which highlights its extensive global reach. Additionally, the Technology Consulting team is noted for shaping the digital and IT market in the GCC by working with both public and private sector clients across multiple countries [12]. These details suggest that the Consulting division operates on a broad international scale.\n\nIn contrast, the Deals division focuses more on strategic advisory services related to mergers, acquisitions, and disposals. It advises corporates, investment funds, and government entities on strategic investment decisions and supports them throughout the lifecycle of a deal [4]. While this division also operates globally, the text does not provide explicit data on the number of countries or offices it operates in, unlike the Consulting division.\n\nLooking at the images, they offer visual representations of the firm's scale in terms of offices, employees, and countries.

This characteristic varies between different parts, such as the 8051AH and 8751BH, depending on their packaging and manufacturing processes. \n\nAccording to text quote [7], all thermal impedance data is approximate for static air conditions at 1W of power dissipation, and values may change based on operating conditions and application. For detailed thermal impedance test methodology, one should refer to the Intel Packaging Handbook.\n\nIn image5, we find a table that provides thermal resistance information for various components, including the 8051AH and 8751BH. The table includes two key parameters: **θja** (junction-to-ambient thermal resistance) and **θjc** (junction-to-case thermal resistance). These values are expressed in degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W) and are critical for assessing thermal performance.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The **8051AH** with a 40-pin Plastic DIP package has a θja of 45°C/W and a θjc of 16°C/W.\n- The **8751BH**, which is manufactured using a different process (P 422), also has a 40-pin Plastic DIP package and a θja of 45°C/W and a θjc of 16°C/W.\n\n![Thermal resistance data for 8051AH](image5)  \n![Thermal resistance data for 8751BH](image5)\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the thermal resistance characteristics of the 8051AH and 8751BH are identical when packaged in a 40-pin Plastic DIP configuration. However, it is important to note that these values are based on static air conditions and may vary depending on actual operating environments. For more precise information, refer to the Intel Packaging Handbook. \n\nThe 8051AH and 8751BH have the same thermal resistance values under standard conditions."}

Jonathan Forsberg from the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) working with a company to develop a novel method of anchoring prosthetics, which could significantly improve outcomes for amputees [7]. Similarly, Lt. Roxanne Burrus is collaborating with Duke University to study how demographic and land-use changes affect malaria transmission, an issue of global importance given the prevalence of malaria in developing countries and its impact on deployed forces [7].\n\nThese collaborations are often facilitated through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), which allow Navy biomedical scientists to partner with private sector entities. In the past quarter alone, the NMRC executed over twenty CRADAs and reviewed an additional fourteen, highlighting the active engagement in technology transfer and commercialization efforts aimed at bringing discoveries to market for the benefit of the warfighter [11]. This process ensures that innovations, such as those related to malaria vaccine development—like the use of mass spectrometry to identify novel antigens by Lt. R. Vince Gerbasi—are translated into practical applications [7].\n\nThe potential outcomes of these collaborations extend beyond immediate military needs. For example, the identification of novel antigens for vaccines can lead to breakthroughs in disease prevention that benefit both military personnel and civilians. Furthermore, training initiatives like those conducted by the Rickettsial Diseases Research Program, which trains individuals in regions endemic to rickettsial diseases, help build local capacity and foster international partnerships [10].\n\n![U.S. Marines and Sailors preparing for deployment](image7)  \n![Collaboration between Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research and NAMRU-3](image4)  \n![Illustration of immune response targeting malaria parasites](image6)  \n\nIn summary, global military research collaborations help combat specific health challenges by fostering innovation, enhancing technology transfer, and building international partnerships. These efforts not only support the health and readiness of military personnel but also hold significant potential for advancing public health globally."}

These trends suggest that healthcare organizations are moving toward better integration and accessibility of clinical data, aligning with the vision of consolidated systems [10].\n\nAdditionally, image3 provides further insight into the adoption of specific technologies related to patient information and clinical orders. For instance, Digital Picture Archiving (PACS) saw an increase from 26% in 2005 to 42% in 2006, indicating growing adoption of imaging systems [5]. Similarly, while Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE) slightly declined from 52% in 2005 to 50% in 2006, it remains a significant component of clinical workflow systems [8].\n\nMoreover, the challenges outlined in image4 show that proving IT quantifiable benefits and ROI remains a concern, but this does not detract from the clear trend of increasing reliance on systems that support clinical orders and patient information access. The reduction in the percentage of organizations without an intranet (from 7% today to 1% in two years) also supports the notion of greater digital integration [image1].\n\n![Access to patient clinical information is projected to increase from 45% today to 53% in two years](image1)  \n![Digital Picture Archiving (PACS) adoption increased from 26% in 2005 to 42% in 2006](image3)\n\nIn summary, functions related to patient information and clinical orders are expected to evolve toward greater integration, accessibility, and efficiency over time, as evidenced by the increasing adoption rates and the projected growth in access to clinical data."}

This foundational step ensures that relevant data is gathered for further processing. The image1 illustrates this initial phase, where \"Data,\" represented as a blue cylinder, serves as the starting point of the process [image1].\n\nNext, the data moves into the **reporting** phase, where it is converted into information through descriptive analytics. As noted in image2, reporting is characterized by its **descriptive nature**, focusing on answering the question, \"What happened?\" and generating outputs such as reports, dashboards, and alerts [image2].\n\nFollowing reporting, the **analysis** phase takes place, which involves deeper exploration of the data to uncover insights. According to image2, analysis is **prescriptive**, aiming to answer \"Why?\" and \"What if?\" questions, ultimately leading to findings and recommendations [image2]. This stage corresponds with the text quote about pushing data through the analytics value chain, where analysis leads to decisions [3].\n\nOnce insights are derived, the next critical step is **taking action**. Image1 shows a figure walking, symbolizing the implementation of decisions based on analytical findings [image1]. This aligns with the text quote that emphasizes the importance of embedding data and analytics into organizational processes so that managers rely on data insights to make informed decisions [8].\n\nFinally, the entire process culminates in **value creation**, depicted in image1 as an upward-trending graph [image1].

This emphasizes that partial progress along the chain does not equate to success; rather, the entire journey from raw data to measurable impact is essential.\n\nThis concept is complemented by the **Levels of Analytics**, which illustrate how analytical maturity evolves from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling and optimization [7]. These levels show a progression in the degree of intelligence applied to data, with increasing business value derived at each stage. For example, standard reports answer \"What happened?\" while predictive modeling addresses \"What will happen next?\" [7].\n\nVisualizing this relationship, **image2** provides a clear depiction of the data-driven process that aligns with the Analytics Value Chain. It shows how data is first stored, then transformed into reports, analyzed for deeper insights, acted upon, and ultimately leads to increased value [image2]. This visual reinforces the idea that analytics is not just about generating insights but also about ensuring those insights lead to real-world actions and outcomes.\n\nMoreover, the **Levels of Analytics** highlight the importance of moving beyond descriptive reporting (which is backward-looking) to prescriptive analysis (forward-looking), where decisions are informed by insights rather than just historical data [5].

This shift is not just about moving up a hierarchy but also about increasing the depth and utility of data analysis within an organization. \n\nIn the realm of BI, the focus is on descriptive analytics—answering questions like \"What happened?\" through standard reports, ad-hoc reports, query drilldowns, and alerts [8]. These tools are essential for understanding past performance and identifying areas that require attention. However, they often lack the context and forward-looking perspective needed for strategic decision-making.\n\nAs we move into BA, the emphasis shifts toward more advanced analytical techniques such as statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization [8]. These methods allow organizations to not only understand what has happened but also to explore why it happened and predict what might happen next. This forward-looking approach enables more informed and proactive decision-making, which can significantly impact business outcomes.\n\nThis progression aligns with the distinction between reporting and analysis outlined in another figure, where reporting is described as descriptive and backward-looking, while analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking [7]. Reporting focuses on answering \"what?\" by transforming data into information, whereas analysis seeks to answer \"why?\" and \"what if?\" by combining data and information to derive insights.\n\n![Data-driven process transforming data into value](image3)\n\nFurthermore, this transition is supported by the concept of a data-driven culture, where data and analytics are deeply embedded in organizational processes and decisions [8]. Strong data leadership plays a crucial role in fostering this environment, ensuring that analysts have the necessary skills, tools, and support to perform at their best [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the transition from business intelligence to business analytics enhances data handling and insights generation by shifting the focus from merely describing past events to predicting and prescribing future actions, thereby enabling more strategic and impactful decision-making."}

These changes reflect a shift in priorities, where immediate security needs like firewalls were already met, but future planning for disaster recovery was gaining more attention.\n\n![Security concerns decreased in perceived urgency from 2005 to 2006](image2)  \n![Future trends show a decline in firewall usage but an increase in disaster recovery planning](image7)\n\nLooking ahead, the data indicates that while current security tools such as firewalls and user access controls will see reduced implementation rates over the next two years, areas like disaster recovery are expected to grow. This trend suggests a strategic reallocation of resources toward long-term resilience rather than maintaining existing infrastructure.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of security concerns in healthcare have evolved from 2005 to 2006, with some issues becoming less urgent, while the implementation of security tools is expected to shift focus toward future readiness and disaster preparedness."}

It emphasizes that simply reaching an intermediate stage in this chain is not enough; the goal is to reach the end and ensure that data drives real-world outcomes [2].\n\nThis transformation is visually represented in `![Data-driven process transforming data into value](image4)`, where the flowchart shows data stored as a blue cylinder being used in reporting, then analyzed for deeper insights, leading to informed actions that generate increasing value, depicted by an upward-trending graph.\n\nMoreover, the distinction between **reporting** and **analysis** is crucial in this process.

According to Mendel’s principles, parents pass heritable factors—now known as genes—to their offspring [4]. These genes exist in different forms called alleles, and each parent contributes one allele for each gene to their offspring. This process is central to explaining the phenotypic and genotypic ratios seen in the F₂ generation.\n\nIn the parental (P) generation, Mendel crossed true-breeding plants with purple flowers (PP) and white flowers (pp). All offspring in the first filial (F₁) generation were heterozygous (Pp) and displayed the dominant purple flower phenotype [11]. This observation demonstrated that the recessive white-flower trait was not lost but rather masked by the dominant purple-flower allele.\n\nWhen these F₁ hybrids (Pp) were allowed to self-pollinate, they produced gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. During fertilization, these gametes combined randomly, resulting in four possible genotypes in the F₂ generation: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp [11]. As a result, the phenotypic ratio was 3:1 (three purple-flowered plants to one white-flowered plant), while the genotypic ratio was 1:2:1 (one PP, two Pp, and one pp) [image1].\n\nThis pattern illustrates the principle of segregation, where alleles separate during gamete formation, and the principle of independent assortment, where different traits are inherited independently of one another. The F₂ generation thus reflects both the dominance of certain alleles and the random combination of alleles from each parent, leading to predictable ratios of observable traits and genetic makeup [8].\n\n![Mendelian inheritance diagram showing the phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation](image1)"}

This is best illustrated by examining the genetic cross diagram in image3, which shows how traits are passed from the parental (P) generation to the F1 and then to the F2 generations.\n\nThe P generation consists of homozygous plants: one with purple flowers (PP) and the other with white flowers (pp). When these are crossed, all offspring in the F1 generation are heterozygous (Pp), displaying the dominant purple phenotype [3]. \n\nAs the F1 generation produces gametes, each individual can contribute either a P or a p allele, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles in the gametes. When these gametes combine during fertilization, the F2 generation exhibits a range of genotypes and phenotypes. The Punnett square in image2 further supports this explanation, showing that when both parents are heterozygous (Pp), the possible offspring genotypes are PP, Pp, and pp in a 1:2:1 ratio. Correspondingly, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, with three-quarters of the offspring having purple flowers and one-quarter having white flowers [3].\n\n![Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation](image3)\n\nThis demonstrates that the F2 generation has a **genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp** and a **phenotypic ratio of 3 purple : 1 white**."}

As mentioned in [2], many organizations are \"drowning in data\" but not gaining meaningful or actionable insights from it. Additionally, [11] emphasizes that \"You cannot manage what you cannot measure,\" underscoring the need for clear metrics that reflect customer engagement and satisfaction. However, if the data being collected does not align with business objectives, it becomes difficult to drive effective decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, there is often an **overemphasis on quantitative metrics** at the expense of qualitative insights. [1] points out that traditional marketing metrics such as reach and frequency do not capture the sentiment, opinion, or affinity individuals have toward a brand. This can lead to a lack of understanding of customer behavior and preferences, which is critical for building long-term relationships.\n\nImage6 also highlights another major barrier: \"We are too siloed by business line/product/brand,\" with 46% of respondents citing this as a significant issue. This reinforces the idea that internal fragmentation within an organization can impede the adoption of a unified customer management strategy. ![Siloed structures hinder integrated customer management](image6).\n\nIn summary, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include **siloed organizational structures**, **a lack of actionable insights from data**, **an overreliance on quantitative metrics**, and **inadequate leadership commitment and cultural alignment**. These factors collectively create an environment where a holistic, customer-centric approach is difficult to implement and sustain."}

Another image shows a similar structure with 12 offices, 1816 employees, and coverage in 9 countries [8]. These figures suggest that the Assurance department may have a broader geographical reach, operating in more countries compared to the Consulting department, which appears to have fewer offices and slightly fewer employees.\n\nIn contrast, the Consulting department is described as working across a wide range of industries and clients, delivering services such as supply chain management, spending efficiency, and operational improvement [2]. This suggests that while the department may be smaller in terms of office presence and employee count, it is involved in a diverse set of projects and client engagements. \n\nAdditionally, the Consulting department is noted for its rotational programs and focus on helping clients drive innovation and growth through deep industry and functional expertise [6]. This contrasts with the Assurance department’s role in providing assurance services, likely involving audits, compliance checks, and risk assessments, which might require a larger number of offices and a broader geographic footprint to serve clients effectively.\n\n![Broader geographical reach](image7)  \n![Fewer offices and employees](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, the Assurance department differs from the Consulting department in that it typically has more offices, more employees, and covers more countries, reflecting its need for a wider operational presence to provide assurance services globally."}

This aligns with the projected changes in intranet functions, where usage for tasks like posting policies and procedures, and staff communication is expected to decrease over the next two years, while access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are anticipated to increase [image4]. \n\nThis shift reflects a growing emphasis on digital integration and data accessibility, which is also evident in other areas of technology adoption. For example, the use of security measures such as firewalls and user access controls is projected to decline from 98% today to 53% in two years [image1], suggesting a possible transition toward more centralized or cloud-based solutions that may be managed differently. Similarly, the adoption of technologies like bar code systems, speech recognition, and handheld PDAs has increased from 2005 to 2006, indicating an ongoing trend toward more efficient and mobile healthcare delivery [image5].\n\n![Health Information Exchange](image6) illustrates how various entities—such as hospitals, labs, physicians, and payers—are connected through a central data repository, highlighting the importance of integrated systems in modern healthcare.

Current systems are often fragmented, creating redundant efforts and inefficiencies [12]. However, future systems are expected to consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying these efforts [3]. This shift suggests a growing emphasis on interoperability, centralized data management, and streamlined communication between different stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nFrom the available data, we can observe several trends. For instance, the adoption of technologies such as single sign-on/identity management increased from not available in 2005 to 79% in 2006 [image4], indicating a move toward more secure and efficient digital access. Similarly, bar code technology saw an increase from 59% in 2005 to 69% in 2006 [image4], highlighting the growing reliance on automation and digital tools in clinical settings.\n\nIn terms of intranet functions, current usage statistics show that posting policies and procedures (87%) and staff communication (82%) are heavily utilized today. However, these functions are projected to decrease in usage over the next two years, while access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders are expected to rise significantly [image6]. This trend implies a growing need for secure, real-time access to patient data and a stronger role for physicians in managing clinical workflows through digital platforms.\n\nMoreover, the image depicting a Health Information Exchange system shows how entities like hospitals, labs, physicians, and payers are interconnected through a central data repository [image1]. This illustrates the direction in which web and intranet functions are heading—toward more unified, interconnected systems that support seamless data sharing and decision-making.\n\nTo support these evolving trends, staffing needs will likely shift as well. The bar chart showing staffing roles highlights the importance of network support (27%), clinical informaticists (24%), and process/workflow design (24%) [image5]. These roles are essential in maintaining and optimizing the complex web and intranet infrastructures required for modern healthcare systems. Additionally, as the demand for clinical transformation and integration increases [image8], there will be a greater need for professionals skilled in systems integration, application support, and clinical leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in web and intranet functions are moving toward consolidation, interoperability, and real-time data access, which will require specialized staffing in areas such as network support, clinical informatics, and systems integration. ![Health Information Exchange](image1)"}

Earlobe type is one such trait that can be influenced by a single gene with two possible alleles: one for free earlobes and one for attached earlobes. When an individual inherits two copies of the recessive allele for attached earlobes, this results in the physical expression of attached earlobes [6]. This is consistent with the concept of genotype and phenotype, where the genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, and the phenotype refers to the observable characteristics [3].\n\nThe Punnett square is a useful tool for predicting the probability of different genotypes in offspring based on the alleles contributed by each parent [1]. In the case of earlobes, if both parents are carriers (heterozygous), there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit two recessive alleles and thus have attached earlobes [6].\n\n![Attached earlobes are associated with the recessive genotype \"ff\".](image3)"}

These findings suggest that while healthcare providers were increasingly recognizing the value of IT systems, they still faced substantial challenges in securing funding and ensuring reliable vendor support.\n\n![Healthcare IT Priorities Comparison](image5)  \nThis bar chart illustrates the shift in healthcare IT priorities from 2005 to 2006, showing a decline in the importance of implementing wireless systems and upgrading network infrastructure over time.\n\nAnother critical issue was **security concerns**, which remained a major focus during this period. A survey highlighted that **internal breaches of security** were the top concern in 2005 at 56%, slightly decreasing to 51% in 2006 [4]. This indicates that despite growing awareness of IT adoption, security risks continued to be a pressing issue.\n\n![Top Barriers to IT Implementation](image2)  \nThis bar chart compares the percentage of organizations facing various barriers to IT implementation in 2005 and 2006, with **lack of financial support** being the most frequently cited challenge.\n\nIn summary, while there was a gradual increase in the adoption of healthcare IT applications like EMRs, the pace of progress was hindered by ongoing issues such as limited financial resources, vendor reliability, and security concerns. These trends highlight the complex interplay between technological advancement and the structural and operational challenges within the healthcare sector."}

This discrepancy suggests that there might be inefficiencies in how leads are being passed to the sales team or how they are being qualified.\n\n![Lead Funnel Conversion Rates](image2)\n\nTo further refine this understanding, marketers should also consider the impact of different attribution models on conversion tracking. For instance, last-click attribution might not fully capture the contribution of various marketing channels to conversions, as noted in the discussion about navigational search masking the impact of other advertising media [5]. Therefore, using a unified tracking mechanism and looking beyond the last touchpoint can provide more accurate insights into the effectiveness of different marketing efforts.\n\nIn summary, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression directly relate to the average conversion rates found in marketing diagnostics by providing both internal performance metrics and industry benchmarks, allowing for targeted improvements in lead nurturing and conversion strategies."}

Text quote [4] mentions that a standard plywood thickness onsite is 18mm, which is usually sufficient for most pours. However, when the weight of concrete causes a standard thickness plywood to bow out and distort the concrete face, thicker plywood may be used, as noted in text quote [5]. This implies that while 18mm is standard, there are scenarios where a thicker material is necessary to prevent deformation.\n\nText quote [10] specifies that beam sides can use either 18 mm plywood or 25 mm boards, with studs (cleats) spaced between 500 to 600 mm. This provides further evidence that 25 mm is an acceptable and sometimes preferred thickness for certain applications, particularly where additional rigidity is required.\n\nAdditionally, image3 provides a table listing dimensions for construction materials, including sheeting for slabs, beams, columns, and beam bottoms, with thickness ranging from 25 mm to 40 mm.

One of the most significant concerns was the **lack of financial support**, which increased from 18% in 2005 to 20% in 2006 [1]. Similarly, **vendor's inability to effectively deliver products** rose from 12% in 2005 to 18% in 2006, indicating growing dissatisfaction with vendor performance [2]. On the other hand, **lack of staffing resources** decreased slightly from 17% to 13%, suggesting that staffing challenges may have been somewhat mitigated during this period.\n\nIn terms of security concerns, internal breaches remained a top priority, dropping slightly from 56% in 2005 to 51% in 2006 [3]. Concerns around **HIPAA compliance** also decreased significantly, from 35% in 2005 to 18% in 2006, possibly reflecting improved awareness or regulatory alignment. However, the concern about **inadequate systems in place** grew slightly from 14% to 10%, though this is not a major increase [3].\n\nLooking ahead, several security measures are expected to be implemented in the coming years. According to the data, **firewalls** and **user access controls** are currently widely adopted (98% and 88%, respectively), but their adoption is projected to drop to 53% within two years [4]. In contrast, **disaster recovery** is expected to see an increase, rising from 68% today to 74% in two years [4]. This suggests a shift in focus toward more resilient and future-oriented security strategies.\n\n![Bar chart showing changes in perceived barriers to IT implementation from 2005 to 2006](image1)  \n![Bar chart comparing security concerns in healthcare organizations from 2005 to 2006](image3)  \n![Bar graph comparing current and future implementation of security measures](image4)\n\nIn summary, while some barriers like lack of financial support and vendor issues increased, others like staffing concerns decreased. Security concerns such as internal breaches remained high, though HIPAA compliance worries declined. Looking forward, disaster recovery is expected to become more prominent, while traditional measures like firewalls and user access controls may see reduced emphasis."}

The ECU is described as a generic term for any embedded system that controls one or more of the electrical systems or subsystems in a motor vehicle [2]. It functions by reading values from multidimensional maps calculated by sensor devices monitoring the engine, which allows it to determine the amount of fuel, ignition timing, and other parameters needed to keep the engine running efficiently [11].\n\nThe ECU receives input from various sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor, all of which provide critical data about the engine's operating conditions [1]. This information is essential for the ECU to make real-time decisions regarding fuel injection and ignition timing.\n\nFor example, the ECU controls the opening of injectors based on parameters like throttle position and engine temperature. If the throttle pedal is pressed further down, the ECU will inject more fuel according to how much air is entering the engine [4]. Similarly, the ECU adjusts the ignition timing to optimize power and fuel economy [5].\n\nMoreover, the ECU manages idle speed by using a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control step per motor, ensuring smooth engine operation under varying conditions [6]. \n\n![The image is a diagram depicting the flow of information and control in an engine management system.

The process can be broken down into three main stages:\n\nFirst, the **duplication of the chromosome** occurs. In prokaryotes, which typically have a single circular chromosome, this involves the replication of the DNA molecule. As the DNA replicates, it forms two identical copies that remain attached at a specific region called the origin of replication. This step is crucial for ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete copy of the genetic material [11].\n\nNext, the **elongation of the cell** takes place. As the DNA copies separate and move toward opposite ends of the cell, the prokaryotic cell begins to elongate. This elongation allows space for the two copies of DNA to be positioned at opposite poles of the cell. During this phase, the plasma membrane starts to grow inward at the midpoint of the cell, preparing for the final division [11].\n\nFinally, the **separation of the cell into two daughter cells** occurs. The inward growth of the plasma membrane continues until it fully divides the cell into two distinct cells. Each new cell contains one copy of the duplicated chromosome, ensuring that both daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cell [8]. \n\n![A bacterial cell undergoing binary fission, with duplicated DNA moving to opposite ends and the cell splitting into two daughter cells.](image8)"}

Additionally, it is noted that when the camera indicator is on, the infrared camera is in recognition mode [2]. This implies that the camera indicator is directly related to the infrared camera's functionality.\n\nFurthermore, the text describes the components of the infrared camera, indicating that it includes a lens [10], and specifically identifies the infrared camera lens [6]. This helps us associate the infrared camera lens with the camera indicator.\n\nLooking at the image descriptions, image6 shows a close-up of a device with labeled components, including:\n\n1.

This principle is clearly illustrated in the context of hot dog consumption, where the utility from each successive hot dog diminishes, eventually turning negative [8]. For instance, the first hot dog provides +10 units of utility, but by the sixth, it results in -10 units of utility, indicating a clear decline in enjoyment and satisfaction [8]. This aligns with the broader economic theory that excessive consumption of any good can lead to dissatisfaction, as seen in the table described in image8.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the application of diminishing marginal utility may differ significantly. In such settings, focus and intentional practice often lead to improved outcomes, even if the immediate utility of repeated actions might diminish. For example, in sports or skill-based activities, the cumulative effect of focused practice can result in increased utility due to both improved activity experience and better outcomes [11]. This is supported by the idea that while mere repetition may not automatically lead to improvement, directed and focused practice can enhance performance and satisfaction over time [10].\n\nThis distinction is further emphasized by the image showing a table that contrasts \"Diminishing Marginal Utility\" with \"Differential Outcome\" related to hot dog consumption. While the left side of the table illustrates the decreasing utility of consuming more hot dogs, the right side highlights how utility can dramatically increase at a certain point—such as when someone ties a competitor for a championship, suggesting that in competitive contexts, the value of an action can shift depending on its outcome [image1].\n\nMoreover, the importance of focus in achieving mastery is visually represented in image2, where a person is depicted in front of a blackboard with two large question marks, asking how important focus is in mastering a skill. This image underscores the idea that while diminishing marginal utility may apply to passive consumption, in competitive scenarios, focus and training can transform the utility of repeated efforts into meaningful achievements.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility and differential outcomes in hot dog consumption](image1)\n\n![How important is focus when trying to achieve mastery in some area?](image2)\n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility applies broadly to standard consumption, leading to decreased satisfaction with more of the same, competitive contexts often involve focused practice and training that can turn repetitive efforts into valuable outcomes, thus altering the utility curve."}

Each year is represented by a different colored bar, allowing for a visual comparison of export volumes. For Ecuador, we can infer that its export volume likely fluctuated during this period, though the exact trend would require examining the height of the bars corresponding to Ecuador for each year. This kind of visualization uses principles like **continuity** [5] and **proximity** [9], as the data points are aligned temporally and spatially for easy interpretation.\n\nNext, considering the changes in time spent with family and friends, image4 presents two pie charts shaped like clock faces. The left chart represents 2005, where 35% of weekend time was spent with family and friends. The right chart represents 2010, where this percentage dropped to 21%. This significant decrease suggests a shift in leisure activities over the five-year period, possibly due to lifestyle changes, increased work hours, or other societal factors. The use of **closure** [6] and **similarity** [12] in the design helps viewers quickly understand the proportional changes between the two years.\n\nWhile these datasets are unrelated in content—banana exports versus personal time allocation—they both rely on visual perception principles to convey information effectively.

These processes ensure that evolving requirements are captured effectively, allowing teams to remain responsive to change while delivering value.\n\nNeeds Exploration involves identifying and understanding the initial scope of the project, as well as continuously refining it throughout the project lifecycle. This stage emphasizes **requirements envisioning**, which is described as a light specification approach, and allows for flexibility in defining what needs to be built [3]. Additionally, Needs Exploration includes various strategies such as **usage modeling**, **domain modeling**, and **non-functional requirements** planning, which help teams understand not just what the stakeholders want, but also how the solution should function within broader constraints [image3].\n\nElicitation Methods are the techniques used to gather requirements from stakeholders. These can range from **formal modeling sessions** to **interviews**, or even **none** if the team chooses to rely on informal communication [image3]. The choice of method depends on the level of detail required and the nature of the project. For instance, when dealing with **distributed stakeholders**, elicitation methods like **just-in-time model storming** or **look-ahead modeling** become particularly valuable, as they allow for iterative and collaborative requirement gathering [image4].\n\nMoreover, Elicitation Methods directly influence how stakeholders interact with the team. Options include **active stakeholder participation**, where stakeholders are directly involved in the development process, or **indirect interaction via proxies or electronic means** [image4]. These approaches determine how quickly and effectively new needs can be addressed, ensuring that the product evolves in line with stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe integration of these practices is further supported by agile frameworks like **Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)**, which encourages a **people-first**, **goal-driven**, and **learning-oriented** approach to project management [11]. This framework acknowledges that stakeholder needs may shift over time and provides structured ways to manage these changes through **work item management strategies** and **prioritization techniques** [image4].\n\n![Addressing changing stakeholder needs through work item management and prioritization](image4)\n\nIn summary, **Needs Exploration** and **Elicitation Methods** contribute to addressing stakeholder needs by enabling teams to dynamically capture, refine, and prioritize requirements throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring alignment with both business goals and stakeholder expectations."}

It consists of two main stages: **interphase** and the **mitotic phase (M phase)**. These stages are further divided into sub-phases, each with specific functions in preparing the cell for division.\n\nDuring **interphase**, the cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and prepares for mitosis. This stage is subdivided into three phases:\n\n1. **G₁ Phase (First Gap Phase)**: The cell increases in size and synthesizes proteins and organelles necessary for DNA replication [2]. This phase is crucial for growth and preparation before DNA synthesis begins.\n   \n2. **S Phase (Synthesis Phase)**: Chromosomes duplicate during this phase, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of genetic material [1]. DNA replication occurs here, and the cell also continues to grow [2].\n\n3. **G₂ Phase (Second Gap Phase)**: The cell continues to grow and prepares for the actual process of cell division. It synthesizes proteins needed for mitosis and checks for any DNA damage [2].\n\nFollowing interphase is the **mitotic phase (M phase)**, which involves the actual division of the cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. This phase includes two major processes:\n\n1. **Mitosis**: The nucleus divides into two nuclei. This process itself is divided into several sub-stages, including prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, where chromosomes condense, align, separate, and decondense [6].\n\n2. **Cytokinesis**: The cytoplasm divides, resulting in the formation of two distinct daughter cells. This typically begins during late anaphase or telophase and completes the cell division process [6].\n\n![The cell cycle is divided into interphase and the mitotic phase, with interphase consisting of G₁, S, and G₂ phases, and the mitotic phase including mitosis and cytokinesis.](image1)\n\nIn addition to these main stages, it's worth noting that while the diagram above focuses on eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells undergo a simpler form of cell division known as binary fission, which involves the duplication of a single circular chromosome and the separation of the copies into two new cells [10].\n\nThus, the main stages of the cell cycle are **interphase** and the **mitotic phase**, with interphase consisting of **G₁, S, and G₂ phases**, and the mitotic phase involving **mitosis** and **cytokinesis**."}

For instance, **metering modes** determine how the camera measures light in the scene to set the correct exposure. As described in image5, there are three primary metering modes: **Matrix Metering**, which measures light across the entire frame and is ideal for natural landscapes; **Center Metering**, which focuses on light near the center of the screen and is well-suited for portraits; and **Spot Metering**, which focuses on a specific region and is useful for precise areas like a subject's eyes [image5]. These options provide flexibility depending on the lighting conditions and subject matter.\n\nSimilarly, **focus modes** can be adjusted to suit different types of subjects. Image4 outlines three common focus modes: **AF-S (single)**, which is best for stationary subjects; **AF-C (continuous)**, suitable for moving subjects; and **MF (manual)**, where the user manually focuses by touching the subject of interest, such as a face [image4]. This level of control ensures that the camera can accurately focus on the intended subject, whether it is still or in motion.\n\nBy combining these settings, photographers can achieve more accurate exposure and sharper focus, leading to higher-quality images in various situations. For example, when shooting portraits, using **Center Metering** along with **AF-S** ensures that the subject is properly exposed and in focus. In contrast, when capturing fast-moving action, **AF-C** paired with **Matrix Metering** allows for continuous focusing and balanced exposure across the scene.\n\n![Matrix Metering is ideal for natural landscapes](image5)  \n![AF-C is used for moving subjects](image4)  \n\nIn summary, the different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by offering tailored control over exposure and focus, adapting to the specific needs of each shooting scenario."}

Marketing communications are customised to match the prospects characteristics and degree of sales-readiness. Every activity the prospects or lead does is given a score. When the scores reach a pre-determined threshold, the prospector lead is deemed Marketing Qualified and therefore sales-ready and transferred to the sales team.\n\n![Conversion rates from MQL to SAL in different datasets](image4)\n\n[12] Lead Funnel Progression\n\n![Lead source conversion ratios and average transition times](image5)\n\n![Marketing sources and their performance metrics](image6)\n\n![Cross-industry average conversion rates at various stages of a sales funnel](image7)\n\nThe conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales Accepted Leads (SALs) varies across different datasets. In [4], it is stated that only 1.50% of MQLs convert into SALs. However, in [7], while not directly stating the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate, it highlights the importance of metrics like SEO effectiveness, which could influence the quality of leads entering the pipeline. In [10], the process of lead scoring ensures that only leads with a high level of interest and sales readiness are considered MQLs, potentially improving the conversion rate to SALs. According to [7], if the SEO is effective, the quality of leads might be higher, possibly increasing the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate.\n\nIn [12], the concept of \"Lead Funnel Progression\" suggests that the conversion rate from MQL to SAL depends on how well the lead is nurtured through the funnel. In [5], it is noted that long-tail advertising has a higher click-through rate than short-tail advertising, which could imply better engagement and potentially higher-quality leads. In [11], tracking user behavior and the impact of UGC on purchases can help identify content that increases the likelihood of a customer buying, thus improving the chances of MQLs becoming SALs.\n\nAccording to [image4], the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50%, which is quite low. In contrast, [image7] shows that cross-industry average conversion rates from MQLs to SALs range between 45-75%. This significant difference implies that the dataset in [image4] may have issues with lead quality, nurturing strategies, or the alignment between marketing and sales teams. The low conversion rate could indicate that the MQLs are not being properly evaluated or that the sales team is not accepting them as SALs due to insufficient qualification criteria.\n\nIn [image5], the conversion ratio for leads from various sources ranges from 5.44% to 50.88%, but this data refers to all types of leads rather than specifically MQLs to SALs. However, it does suggest that certain lead sources generate higher-quality leads, which might improve the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate. In [image6], the performance metrics of different marketing sources include the \"Lead to Opp Index,\" which measures effectiveness in converting leads to opportunities, further emphasizing the importance of lead quality and source in influencing conversion rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rate from MQL to SAL varies significantly across datasets, with [image4] showing a very low rate of 1.50% compared to the cross-industry average of 45-75% in [image7]. This discrepancy highlights the need for improved lead nurturing, better alignment between marketing and sales teams, and the use of high-quality lead sources to increase the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate."}

These problems can range from simple user errors to more complex mechanical or electrical failures. According to the provided information, various troubleshooting guides and tables outline common problems that users might encounter before needing to call for professional service.\n\nFor instance, one table lists eight distinct problems, such as spilled rinse-aid, stained tub interiors, white film on surfaces, rust stains on cutlery, knocking noises, rattling noises, knocking in water pipes, and dishes not being clean [7]. Another table outlines six different issues, including the dishwasher not starting, water not being pumped out, and suds in the tub [6]. Additionally, another table addresses seven specific problems, such as dishes not drying, incorrect program selection, and use of low-quality coated cutlery [8].\n\nThese examples demonstrate that multiple possible problems can occur, and they are detailed in different sections of the user manual. It is important to review these troubleshooting tips before contacting a technician, as many of these issues can be resolved by the user themselves.\n\n![Dishwasher Troubleshooting Table](image3)  \n![Common Dishwasher Problems and Solutions](image6)  \n![Dishes Not Drying Troubleshooting](image8)\n\nThe dishwasher may encounter **multiple possible problems** before calling for service."}
