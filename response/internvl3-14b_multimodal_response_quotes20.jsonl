Awareness levels correlate with higher realism and enthusiasm; those who have heard a lot about the concept are more likely to find it extremely realistic (48%) and express enthusiasm (47%) [12][image6]. However, even among those with high awareness, worry remains prevalent, with 76% being very/somewhat worried [image6].\n\nPolitical and educational differences are evident.

Similar to Europe, there is an upward trend, but the U.S. consistently shows higher median investments across all stages.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Seed Stage**: Both regions show a gradual increase, but the U.S. starts and remains higher.\n- **First Stage**: The U.S. maintains a higher median investment compared to Europe.\n- **Second Stage**: The U.S. continues to have higher median investments, though the gap narrows slightly.\n- **Later Stage**: The U.S. has significantly higher median investments, reflecting more substantial funding rounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom 2004 to 2009, the U.S. consistently had higher median investments across all stages compared to Europe. However, Europe showed an increasing trend, particularly in later stages, indicating improved performance and possibly more strategic investments post-bubble. The U.S. maintained a lead, especially in later-stage funding, reflecting a more mature and robust VC ecosystem.\n\n```markdown\n![The U.S. consistently had higher median investments across all stages compared to Europe, with Europe showing an increasing trend, particularly in later stages, indicating improved performance and strategic investments post-bubble."}

Republicans were more favorably disposed to working with Obama, with 59% saying GOP leaders should work with him, while 36% wanted them to \"stand up\" to the new president [2]. Nearly eight-in-ten of Obama’s voters said Democratic leaders should work with Republicans, even at the risk of disappointing their supporters [6].\n- **2016 Sentiments**: In 2016, Democratic support for cooperation with Trump was substantially less than GOP support for working with Obama in 2008 [1].

For the first time, more now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) than say the government is doing either very or fairly well (46%). Positive ratings have fallen 26 points since January (when 72% said very/fairly well).

Since the start of the year, there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough. This underscores a growing sentiment that more needs to be done to enhance security.\n\n[5] Both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that the government’s anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country (rather than that they have gone too far restricting civil liberties) since Snowden’s disclosures in 2013.

Image5 further supports this by showing a decline in positive ratings for government performance in reducing the terrorist threat, particularly among Republicans, dropping from 63% to 27% between January and later in the year. This suggests that those who are more likely to associate Islam with violence (Republicans) are also more critical of the government's handling of terrorism, reflecting a complex interplay between religious perceptions and political trust in security measures.\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely to associate Islam with violence and are also more critical of the government's handling of terrorism, while Democrats are less likely to make this association and more likely to believe the government is doing a fair job.

These concerns have grown over the past year, with half of Americans now considering China's human rights policy a very serious problem, up 7 percentage points from the previous year [1][3][8]. The image2 data shows that concerns about cyberattacks from China increased by 7 percentage points from 2020 to 2021, and similar increases are noted for China's policies on human rights, job losses to China, and military power [image2]. \n\nPartisan divisions are evident, with Republicans significantly more likely than Democrats to view China as an enemy and to support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S. [9][image1]. Image1 illustrates these partisan differences, showing that 72% of Republicans think it's more important to get tougher on China economically, compared to 37% of Democrats, and 69% of Republicans support limiting Chinese students, compared to 42% of Democrats [image1].\n\nAmericans are also critical of China's handling of global climate change, with 79% believing it is doing a bad job [6]. When it comes to dealing with China, confidence in President Biden is lower than for other foreign policy issues, with only 53% confident in his ability to handle China, compared to 60% confidence in his general world affairs handling [11]. Image6 reveals that 46% of Americans have no confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China, compared to 53% who do [image6].\n\nThe image7 data indicates a rise in the perception of China as an enemy and the feeling of \"very cold\" feelings toward China from 2018 to 2021, with Republicans showing a steeper increase [image7]. Image8 highlights that \"human rights\" and \"economy\" are the most frequently mentioned concerns, with \"human rights\" being cited by 20% of respondents [image8].\n\n### Conclusion\nAmericans' concerns about China have grown, particularly regarding cyberattacks, job losses, military and technological power, and human rights. These concerns are increasingly divided along partisan lines, with Republicans more critical of China and supportive of tougher measures. Confidence in Biden to handle China is lower than for other foreign policy issues."}

According to the data, the Hispanic unemployment rate has been consistently higher than that of non-Hispanic workers, peaking at 12.8% during the Great Recession and remaining above pre-recession levels, even as it has declined since then [3][8]. This persistent higher unemployment rate contributes to income disparities, as median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, unchanged since the recession [2]. In contrast, the non-Hispanic unemployment rate has also improved but remains lower than that of Hispanics [8].\n\nDespite these economic challenges, Hispanic perceptions of their economic well-being have improved among most demographic subgroups, with 72% expecting their children to be better off financially than themselves [1][4]. This optimism contrasts with the general public, where perceptions of financial conditions have declined since 2004 [6]. The Hispanic poverty rate, while decreasing from a peak of 26.5% in 2010 to 23.6% in 2014, still exceeds pre-recession levels [2]. This indicates a slower recovery compared to the general population.\n\nThe data also shows that Hispanic households experienced the largest percentage decline in net worth during the recession and continued to fall afterward, unlike white households [2]. This persistent decline in wealth exacerbates income disparities, as the median household income for Hispanics remains below the national average of $53,700 [2]. The purchasing power of the Hispanic community, however, is on the rise, contributing to a growing economic impact [11].\n\nThe chart in image8 illustrates the quarterly unemployment rates, showing that the Hispanic unemployment rate has been consistently higher than that of non-Hispanic workers, especially during recessions.

According to the survey, men are slightly more likely than women to encounter harassing or abusive behavior online [2]. Specifically, 29% of men report seeing people being mean or bullying more often than kind behavior, compared to 19% of women [2]. Conversely, women are more likely to see people being kind or supportive [2]. However, the majority of both men (52%) and women (56%) see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior [2]. When it comes to deception, men are twice as likely as women to see people trying to be deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%) [12]. Despite these differences, majorities of both genders see an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation [12].\n\nRegarding the frequency of encountering dramatic or exaggerated posts, 58% of users frequently see posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated, and 59% see people making accusations or starting arguments without all the facts [1][6]. This indicates that dramatic and accusatory content is a common experience for most social media users, regardless of gender.\n\nThe survey also highlights that users' comfort with data usage by social media platforms is context-dependent. For instance, 71% find it acceptable for platforms to recommend events in their area, while only 57% find it acceptable to recommend friends [7][8]. This suggests that users are more accepting of data usage for non-political purposes.\n\n### Conclusion\nMen are more likely than women to encounter bullying and deceptive behavior on social media, but both genders generally see a mix of positive and negative behaviors.

They perceive more gender inequities and are more likely to experience discrimination, including earning less than a man doing the same job, being treated as if they were not competent, and receiving less support from senior leaders [4]. Women in these environments are also more likely to feel the need to prove themselves to be respected by coworkers [6]. The image data further supports this, showing that 78% of women in STEM jobs in mostly male workplaces have experienced gender discrimination, compared to 43% in workplaces with a more even gender mix [image7]. Additionally, women in male-dominated STEM workplaces are more likely to believe their gender has made it harder to succeed (48%) compared to those in majority-female workplaces (12%) [11].

According to the data, in 2014, 63% of GCC youth and 62% of Non-GCC youth were very concerned about unemployment, indicating a nearly equal level of concern between the two regions. However, when looking at the broader context of key issues, Non-GCC youth expressed higher overall concern about unemployment compared to GCC youth, with 55% versus 39% respectively. This discrepancy suggests that while unemployment is a critical issue in both regions, Non-GCC youth may face additional challenges or perceive it as a more pressing problem due to different economic conditions or job market dynamics.

This growth directly correlates with the current capacity issues on trains, as evidenced by the overcrowded conditions depicted in image2 and image7. The data in image6 further illustrates that trains often operate at or above their seated capacity, with some trains reaching up to 158% of seated capacity. The crowded platforms and trains suggest that the existing infrastructure is struggling to accommodate the growing number of passengers, leading to stress at intersections and increased demand for more reliable and frequent service, as mentioned in [3]. The need to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade, as stated in [10], underscores the urgency to address these capacity issues to meet the growing demand.\n\n![Mountain View and Palo Alto ridership growth](image5)  \n![Overcrowded train](image2)  \n![Crowded platform](image7)  \n![Train capacity data](image6)  \n\nThe rapid growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto, combined with the current overcrowding, indicates that the current infrastructure is insufficient to handle the increased ridership, necessitating solutions such as grade separations and improved funding, as discussed in [8] and [3]. This growth also aligns with the trend of millennials preferring car-free living, as noted in [1], further emphasizing the need for expanded transit capacity to accommodate more people with less reliance on cars, as mentioned in [6].

The image6 and image7 provide detailed subscriber data for Telkomsel and other operators. In 2013, Telkomsel had 139.3 million subscribers, which increased to 132.7 million in 2014. This slight decrease might seem counterintuitive, but it could be due to the inclusion of more operators in the 2014 data, as noted in the text [12]. The data also shows a significant increase in smartphone users and data users, indicating a shift in the type of services being used rather than a loss in total subscribers.\n\n### ARPU Changes\nThe text mentions that voice and SMS ARPU have been declining due to reduced usage, while data ARPU is expected to increase as users consume more mobile data [2][5]. Image2 illustrates this trend, showing a decline in voice and SMS ARPU from 2013 to 2014, with data ARPU starting to rise. This aligns with the text's explanation that the shift to data-based communication (like IM and VoIP) is reducing traditional voice and SMS usage [9][10].\n\n### Contributing Factors\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes:\n- **Increased Data Usage**: The rise of data-based communication methods like IM and VoIP, as mentioned in the text [9][10], led to reduced voice and SMS usage, affecting ARPU negatively in those areas.\n- **Smartphone Adoption**: The text highlights the growing preference for smartphones, which increased data consumption [10].\n- **Market Competition**: CDMA operators forced GSM operators to reduce tariffs, impacting ARPU [6].\n- **Government-Initiated Price War**: Initially, reduced ARPU was due to a massive price war initiated by the government [7].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe subscriber base of Telkomsel slightly decreased from 139.3 million in 2013 to 132.7 million in 2014, likely due to expanded data coverage.

According to the text quotes, streaming has become the leading format in the music industry, with hip-hop fans being at the forefront of this digital movement [3][9][12]. The data from the images further illustrate these trends:\n\n- **Rock Genre**: Rock dominates album sales, with 32% of physical albums and 26% of digital albums sold, but it is driven by catalog albums [8]. Streaming accounts for 26% of rock music consumption [4]. This suggests that rock fans prefer owning albums, possibly due to the genre's historical emphasis on album releases and legacy artists.\n\n- **R&B/Hip-Hop Genre**: R&B/Hip-Hop leads in streaming, with 31% of streams, indicating a strong preference for on-demand audio [6][10]. Album sales are lower, with 19% physical and 22% digital, but the genre has a high 40% share in total music activity [7][10]. This reflects the genre's adaptability to digital formats and its appeal to younger, more tech-savvy audiences.\n\n- **Pop Genre**: Pop is mainly driven by current songs, with 34% of streams and 18% of physical album sales [8]. Digital album sales are higher at 31%, showing a balance between current hits and album consumption [6][8].\n\n- **Country Genre**: Country music has a strong physical album market, with 35% of sales, but lower streaming at 18% [4]. This indicates a preference for physical ownership, possibly due to the genre's traditional fan base.\n\n- **Latin Genre**: Latin music has a significant 68% share in streams, highlighting its digital engagement [4]. Album sales are lower, with only 5% physical and 8% digital, showing a strong shift towards streaming.\n\n- **Dance/Electronic Genre**: Dance/Electronic music has a high 51% streaming share, reflecting its digital-first consumption pattern [4].\n\nThese differences imply that the music industry must adapt its strategies to cater to genre-specific consumer behaviors.

Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **User Utterance Encoding**: The user's natural language input is first encoded into a continuous vector using a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) utterance encoder. This encoding captures the meaning of the user's utterance by considering both forward and backward contexts [2]. For example, the user's request \"Movie for the day after tomorrow, please\" is processed by the Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder to produce a vector representation [6].\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The encoded user utterance, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into an LSTM Dialogue State tracker. This tracker maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state, which includes the user's goals and preferences. The dialogue state is updated after each turn by incorporating the user's input and the system's previous action [3][10]. In the example, the dialogue state is updated to reflect the user's request for a movie on Thursday, with the time slot still unknown [6].\n\n3. **Policy Network**: The updated dialogue state is used by the policy network to determine the next system action. The policy network considers the dialogue state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of query results to emit a system action in the form of a dialogue act. This action is conditioned on the estimated user goal and the query results from the knowledge base [5][6].\n\n4. **Query Command and Knowledge Base Interaction**: Based on the dialogue state, a query command is formulated and sent to the knowledge base (KB). The query command is generated by replacing tokens in a template with the best hypothesis for each goal slot from the dialogue state tracking output. The KB returns a ranked list of entities, which are then used to refine the system's response [7].\n\n5. **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: The final system response is generated using a template-based NLG. Delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced with values from either the estimated user goal or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action. For instance, the system's response \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" is generated by the NLG, which uses the dialogue state information to formulate a natural language response [6].\n\n6. **End-to-End Model**: All components, including the utterance encoder, dialogue state tracker, and policy"}

According to the dataset's documentation [4], these functions include simple lookup, comparison, closed-domain knowledge extraction, open-domain knowledge extraction, and numerical operations like subtraction, division, and addition. The proportions of these functions are detailed in image7, which shows that the most common functions are \"Simple lookup\" (20.6%) and \"Comparison\" (19.5%), followed by \"Closed-domain knowledge\" (12.1%). Other functions like \"Subtract,\" \"Divide,\" and \"Rank\" each account for 5.3% of the tasks, indicating a diverse set of reasoning requirements.\n\nThe complexity of reasoning steps required is further illustrated in image3, which presents a histogram of the percentage of claims requiring different numbers of reasoning steps. The majority of claims (18%) require 4 reasoning steps, with a significant portion (20%) needing 6 steps, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. This complexity is compounded by the fact that table-based LLMs do not outperform text-based models, as noted in [3], possibly due to the dissimilarity between scientific tables and those in public corpora, such as the lack of row headers in scientific tables.\n\nThe dataset's design, as shown in image4, involves a process of claim extraction and verification, emphasizing the need for models to accurately ground claims in the table data. Error analysis in image6 reveals that grounding errors (50%) and ambiguity errors (22%) are the most frequent, underscoring the difficulty in accurately applying reasoning functions.

This discrepancy in behavior suggests that GPT-4 has a tendency to make definitive predictions even when the evidence is ambiguous.\n\n![GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted](image3)\n\n[3] The table-based reasoning required for these tasks involves various functions, such as simple lookup, comparison, and arithmetic operations. The most common errors are grounding errors (50%), where the model fails to accurately reference specific cells in the table, and ambiguity errors (22%), where the claim's wording is unclear or open-ended. These errors are particularly challenging for program-based methods like Program-of-Thought (PoT), as shown in image8.\n\n![The most common errors in table-based reasoning are grounding errors and ambiguity errors](image8)\n\n[5] The results in the 3-class setting are notably poorer than in the 2-class setting, underscoring the difficulty models face with the NEI class. This is because distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims is inherently challenging, even for human annotators, as noted by Jiang et al. (2020). The inclusion of the NEI class diminishes models' confidence, causing a shift in predictions from 'supported/refuted' to 'NEI'.\n\n![The 3-class setting results are poorer due to the difficulty in distinguishing between 'refuted' and 'NEI' claims](image3)\n\n[6] Despite these challenges, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 perform better than open-source LLMs, achieving 78.22 macro-F1 for the 2-class setting and 64.80 for the 3-class setting.

As more knowledge is removed, precision and recall both decrease, with precision dropping to 16.3 and recall to 20.4 when three elements are removed, while the F1-Score decreases to 18.1.

In StrategyQA, while Step-Back + RAG still improves performance, the error reduction is less pronounced, and the percentage of introduced errors is slightly higher.\n\n[4] The dataset examples in image6 show that TimeQA has more test examples (5226) compared to StrategyQA (229), suggesting that TimeQA's larger dataset might contribute to the effectiveness of Step-Back + RAG. The task type in TimeQA is more focused on applying principles directly, whereas StrategyQA requires deeper reasoning, making it more challenging for Step-Back + RAG to fix errors.\n\n[5] Image7 further breaks down the error types in TimeQA, showing that Principle Error is the most significant, which aligns with the need for accurate principle extraction and application in TimeQA. In StrategyQA, the error types might be more varied, reflecting the complexity of the task.\n\nIn conclusion, Step-Back + RAG is more effective in TimeQA than in StrategyQA, likely due to the structured nature of TimeQA tasks and the larger dataset size.

This is further supported by image4, which shows that for some language pairs like GL → EN, alignment slightly decreases BLEU scores, while for others like BE → EN, it has a negligible effect. \n\nRegarding F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, [10] and image6 demonstrate that pre-training improves translation accuracy across all word frequencies, with particularly significant gains for low-frequency words. Image6 illustrates this trend, showing higher F-measure scores for pre-trained models compared to standard models, especially for words with fewer occurrences in the training data.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can enhance translation performance in multilingual settings but may not be beneficial in bilingual scenarios. Pre-training significantly improves the translation of low-frequency words, as evidenced by increased F-measure scores for these words in pre-trained models.\n\n![Alignment of word embeddings affects BLEU scores differently across language pairs](image4)\n![Pre-training improves F-measure scores for low-frequency words](image6)"}

The CorefProp and RelProp components significantly influence these results, with CorefProp enhancing entity extraction and RelProp benefiting both entity and relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple entities.\n\n### Detailed Answer\n\nThe DyGIE model achieves superior performance in entity and relation extraction across diverse datasets, including ACE04-O, ACE05-O, GENIA, ACE05, SciERC, and WLPC, as evidenced by its high Entity F1 scores and competitive Relation F1 scores compared to previous systems [2][6][5][10][11][12].

Similarly, on ACE05, DyGIE's Entity F1 is 82.9, and on SciERC, it reaches 65.2, showcasing its versatility across domains [6][5].\n\nThe CorefProp and RelProp components play distinct roles in DyGIE's performance. CorefProp, which handles coreference propagation, is particularly beneficial for entity extraction, especially in datasets like ACE05 where disambiguating pronouns requires cross-sentence context [12]. DyGIE's 6.6% improvement in pronoun performance confirms the effectiveness of CorefProp in such scenarios [12]. However, CorefProp has a smaller effect on entity F1 in SciERC compared to ACE05, indicating dataset-specific impacts [5].\n\nRelProp, responsible for relation propagation, significantly aids both entity and relation extraction, particularly in sentences with multiple entities [8][9]. Image6 illustrates that DyGIE outperforms DyGIE-RelProp in relation extraction across varying numbers of entities per sentence, highlighting RelProp's utility in complex contexts [9].

According to [4], DyGIE includes the coreference graph propagation layer on datasets that have coreference annotations. This is supported by the results shown in image1, where the DyGIE model with coreference propagation (`CorefProp`) achieves higher F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction compared to the base model without coreference propagation. For instance, the entity F1 score increases from 68.1 to 68.2, and the relation F1 score improves from 41.2 to 42.0. This indicates that coreference annotations help DyGIE better disambiguate entity mentions, especially in complex contexts where pronouns refer to entities that need cross-sentence reasoning, as discussed in [3]. \n\nIn datasets like ACE04-O and ACE05-O, where coreference annotations are available, DyGIE shows substantial improvements over previous systems, as seen in image5, where DyGIE achieves entity F1 scores of 84.7 and 82.9, respectively, compared to 75.1 and 74.5 for Wang and Lu (2018). However, in the SciERC dataset, where pronouns are uniformly labeled as \"Generic\" and coreference annotations are not available, the coreference layer (`CorefProp`) does not significantly affect entity extraction performance, as noted in [8]. This is reflected in image2, where the entity F1 score for DyGIE with and without coreference propagation is nearly identical (87.1 vs. 85.7), indicating that the lack of coreference annotations limits the model's ability to leverage this layer effectively.\n\nIn summary, the presence of coreference annotations in datasets allows DyGIE to utilize the coreference propagation layer, thereby improving entity recognition performance, as evidenced by the higher F1 scores in datasets like ACE04-O and ACE05-O. The absence of such annotations, as in SciERC, limits this improvement, highlighting the importance of coreference annotations for enhancing DyGIE's performance in entity recognition tasks.\n\n![Coreference annotations enhance DyGIE's entity recognition performance in datasets where they are available, as shown by higher F1 scores in ACE04-O and ACE05-O compared to SciERC where they are not available.](image1)"}

For instance, GEM achieves a joint accuracy of 53.54% on the hotel domain after fine-tuning, while naive and EWC achieve 36.08% and 40.82%, respectively. This demonstrates GEM's superior ability to adapt to new domains without forgetting the original ones.\n\nSlot similarities play a significant role in model performance. [2] highlights that knowledge about slots like people, area, price range, and day is successfully transferred across domains, but slots unique to a domain, such as parking in the hotel domain, are harder to track. Image4 illustrates this by showing that slots like parking and stars are less frequently tracked correctly compared to more common slots like area and price range. This indicates that slot similarity and frequency of occurrence affect the model's ability to generalize.\n\n![Slot similarities affect performance, with unique slots being harder to track.](image4)\n\nImage2 shows that TRADE achieves a joint accuracy of 60.58% in the zero-shot attraction domain, demonstrating its ability to adapt to new domains. This is higher than training from scratch, which achieves 44.24% with the same amount of data, underscoring the benefits of transfer learning with TRADE.\n\n![TRADE's zero-shot performance is better than training from scratch, highlighting the benefits of transfer learning.](image2)\n\nIn summary"}

The adversarial dataset is designed to eliminate these cues by mirroring the distribution of cues around both labels, leading to random performance. This indicates that BERT's previous performance was not based on genuine argument comprehension but on exploiting these cues.\n\n[6] and [10] show that when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance drops significantly, achieving a maximum test set accuracy of 53%, which is essentially random.

This underscores the importance of using adversarial datasets to ensure that models are evaluated on their true understanding rather than their ability to exploit dataset biases.

Image5 shows the performance of various decoding methods, including greedy decoding, beam search, and random sampling. Greedy decoding achieves an average score of 77.53, which is close to the human validation score of 86.18. This suggests that while greedy decoding is efficient, it slightly underperforms compared to human validation. Beam search with 10 beams and random sampling methods show lower performance, indicating that while they generate more candidates, the quality decreases.\n\n### Effect of Training Data Variations\n\nThe text [7] and image8 highlight the efficiency of learning from seed tuples.

This adjustment reflects the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's international operations, particularly in the U.S. and International Operated Markets, where the balance at December 31, 2020, was $2,773.1 million, up from $2,677.4 million in 2019 [image8].\n\n2. **Cash Flow Hedges**:\n   - The company reported a net expense of $123.3 million in cash flow hedges in 2020, compared to a benefit of $48.9 million in 2019 and a loss of $431.1 million in 2018. This indicates that the hedging strategies did not provide the same level of benefit in 2020 as they did in previous years [image7].\n\n3. **Net Income**:\n   - The net income decreased from $6,025.4 million in 2019 to $4,730.5 million in 2020. This reduction was partly due to strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which added $268 million to net"}

According to the text quotes, the operating income for Sandoz decreased by 12% in constant currencies, while the core operating income decreased by 14% in constant currencies [3][9]. This decline was primarily due to the effects of the pandemic, which led to delays in cancer care and a weak flu season that dampened generics sales [2]. The image data further supports this, showing that the operating income for Sandoz dropped from USD 1,043 million in 2020 to USD 600 million in 2021, a decrease of 41% in constant currencies [image3]. Similarly, the core operating income for Sandoz decreased from USD 2,334 million in 2020 to USD 2,064 million in 2021, a 12% decrease in constant currencies [image2]. These figures highlight the significant impact of the pandemic on the Sandoz segment's financial performance.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Sandoz segment experienced a decline in both operating income and core operating income between 2020 and 2021, primarily due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic, including delays in cancer care and weak flu season sales."}

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points. This decrease was largely due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases.\n\nFrom the image quotes:\n- **image7** shows SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2022, 2021, and 2020.

According to the text [5], the remuneration for Managing/Executive/Whole-time Directors was decided by the Board and recommended for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Non-executive directors did not receive any remuneration except for a sitting fee of Rs. 5,000 for each meeting of the Board and the Board Committee attended by them. This structure is reflected in image5, which shows detailed compensation figures for each director, including salary, perquisites, commissions, and sitting fees. For instance, Mr. K.K. Modi received a total of Rs. 10,000,000, while Mr. Samir Kumar Modi received Rs. 1,236,508, highlighting the disparity in compensation based on roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe company's financial performance during the year 2002-03, as indicated in image4, showed fluctuations in share prices, with the high ranging from Rs. 390.00 in April 2002 to Rs. 420.00 in May 2002, and the low dropping to Rs. 266.00 in March 2003. This volatility is also depicted in image2, which compares the normalized price index of the company (GPI) with the BSE Sensex. The graph shows that while the Sensex remained relatively stable, GPI experienced more pronounced fluctuations, peaking at 106 in July 2002 and dropping to 84 by March 2003. This suggests that the company's stock performance was more volatile than the broader market, which could have influenced director compensation, particularly for those with equity-based incentives.\n\nThe company's adherence to accounting standards and the true and fair view of its financial statements, as confirmed in text [11], indicates a transparent financial reporting process. This transparency is crucial for investor confidence and could impact director compensation, especially for those with performance-based remuneration.

The company's commitment to a 30% payout ratio and stable dividend payments, as shown in image1, reflects its dedication to shareholder value. Additionally, Toyota's strategic shareholdings are evaluated annually to ensure they align with business strategy and contribute to corporate value [3][6]. \n\nIn response to climate scenarios, Toyota has set ambitious environmental goals, such as reducing global average CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 25% by 2030 and achieving zero emissions by 2050, as outlined in image4. These goals are part of the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, which includes measures like promoting electrified vehicles and renewable energy use.

This indicates that the expected return is not a direct reflection of the current year's market performance but is phased in over time.\n\n### Actual Return on Plan Assets\nThe actual return on plan assets can be inferred from the changes in the total plan assets and the net periodic benefit costs. According to text quote [5], the accumulated benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit plans were $992 million in 2020 and $878 million in 2019. The increase in obligations suggests that the actual return on assets did not fully offset the increase in obligations.\n\n### Image Analysis\n- **image5** shows the net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan. The expected return on plan assets was $20 million in 2020, compared to $24 million in 2019. This indicates a decrease of $4 million.\n- **image6** provides the total plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan. The total assets increased from $960 million in 2019 to $987 million in 2020, a $27 million increase.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe expected return on plan assets decreased from $24 million in 2019 to $20 million in 2020, a reduction of $4 million. Despite this decrease, the total plan assets increased by $27 million from 2019 to 2020. This suggests that other factors, such as contributions and actual investment returns, contributed positively to the total assets, offsetting the lower expected return.\n\n![The expected return on plan assets decreased from $24 million in 2019 to $20 million in 2020, while total plan assets increased from $960 million to $987 million, indicating other factors positively impacted the total assets.](image5)\n\nThe expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit decreased"}

The image3 table shows the revenue by geography for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018. The Americas revenue increased from $9,445 million in 2019 to $12,051 million in 2020. This increase, combined with growth in Europe and the Asia Pacific, led to a total revenue increase from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020. This growth can be attributed to the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, as mentioned in text quote [4], which added $650 million to the remaining performance obligation.\n\n### Unearned Revenue\nThe text quote [9] states that approximately 50% of total revenue recognized in fiscal 2020 came from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2019. The image5 table provides a detailed breakdown of unearned revenue changes. The unearned revenue at the beginning of 2020 was $8,564 million, which increased to $10,662 million by the end of 2020. This increase is due to higher billings and other contributions, as well as revenue recognized over time and from business combinations.\n\n### Implications\nThe significant increase in total revenue and unearned revenue suggests robust growth and strong customer demand. The increase in unearned revenue indicates a higher level of prepayments and future revenue recognition, which can stabilize cash flows. However, it also means that a substantial portion of revenue is yet to be recognized, subject to future economic risks as noted in text quote [1]. The acquisitions, particularly Tableau, have a notable impact on both revenue and unearned revenue, as seen in the figures provided.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total revenue increased from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, driven by growth across all regions and acquisitions.

This decline was primarily due to significant sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment, driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in countries like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3]. Additionally, the U.S. experienced positive sales performance, but this was offset by support provided for marketing and incentives to franchisees to accelerate recovery and drive growth [1].

Image1 illustrates the increase in net debt from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021. Additionally, liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities rose significantly to €11,708 million in 2021, primarily for the Varian acquisition [11]. Operating net working capital increased by €720 million to €3,270 million, largely due to the Varian acquisition [6], as shown in image3. The total equity also increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, indicating a positive impact on the company's financial position despite the increased debt [image4].\n\nIn summary, the acquisition of Varian positively influenced Siemens Healthineers' financial performance in 2021, leading to a significant increase in Adjusted EBIT and a notable rise"}

However, the profit before tax dropped significantly to $4.8 billion in 2020, a 7% decrease from $5.172 billion in 2019 [image2].

The net amount recognized in AOCI would also be affected, with higher discount rates potentially reducing net actuarial losses and lower expected returns increasing net actuarial losses.\n\n![Net amount recognized in AOCI](image8)\n\nIn summary, the changes in discount rates and expected returns on plan assets from 2021 to 2022 likely resulted in a decrease in net periodic benefit costs for Pension Benefits due to higher discount rates, partially offset by lower expected returns. For Other Retiree Benefits, the stable expected return on plan assets combined with a slight increase in the discount rate may have had a less pronounced impact on net periodic benefit costs. The net amount recognized in AOCI would reflect these changes, with potential reductions in net actuarial losses for Pension Benefits and increases for Other Retiree Benefits.\n\n**Answer:** The discount rate increased for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits, while the expected return on plan assets decreased for Pension Benefits. These changes likely reduced net periodic benefit costs for Pension Benefits and had a less pronounced impact on Other Retiree Benefits, affecting the net amount recognized in AOCI."}

This increase was primarily due to market volatility, derivatives exposures, investment securities, lending commitments, and equity investments.\n   - [4] mentions that the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule that introduced the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) but did not change the regulatory capital requirements under the Advanced Approach.\n\n2. **External TLAC Changes**:\n   - [7] and [10] discuss the introduction of TLAC buffer requirements, which are part of the regulatory capital framework. The TLAC buffer is a percentage of total RWA and is crucial for maintaining capital distributions and bonuses.\n   - [7] also states that the risk-based TLAC buffer includes the Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital, and eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD).\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Image 4** shows the Credit Risk RWA for both Standardized and Advanced Approaches increased from 2019 to 2020. The balance at December 31, 2020, was $387,066 million for Standardized and $284,930 million for Advanced, up from $342,684 million and $228,927 million, respectively.\n- **Image 7** indicates that External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. However, the actual amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million.\n\n### Interleaved Analysis:\nThe increase in Credit Risk RWA reflects higher risk exposure and market volatility, necessitating more capital to cover potential losses. This increase in RWA would typically require a proportional increase in capital to maintain regulatory ratios, as seen in the higher Tier 1 and Total capital figures in **image 6** compared to **image 3**"}

This represents a decrease from the previous year's net profit of Rs. 4779.55 lakh [5]. The company's net profit was affected by exceptional expenses related to Assam dues, which became doubtful due to a retrospective amendment in the Finance Act 2003 [1]. Despite this, the company's total segment revenues were Rs. 31 crore, and cigarette sales volume increased by 19.64% to 10593 million cigarettes, with sales turnover rising by 14% to Rs. 1077 crore [7]. The company also achieved positive cash flows by the second half of the financial year through restructuring the tea business and reducing overheads [5].\n\nIn contrast, the potential for tobacco export earnings is significantly higher than the current earnings. The company's current export earnings are Rs. 930 crore, but there is a potential to increase this to Rs. 7000 crore by capturing just 5% of the global tobacco trade [3]. This potential is highlighted by the fact that India holds only 0.7% of the USD 30 bn annual global import-export tobacco trade [3]. The company's cigarette exports increased from Rs. 2.4 crore to Rs. 19.2 crore during the year under report, and in the first four months of the current year, the company exported cigarettes worth Rs. 11 crore [9].\n\nThe disparity between the current financial results and the potential export earnings suggests that the company has a significant opportunity to improve its financial performance by increasing its focus on the export market. The company's efforts to launch new brands and grow its market share in the domestic cigarette industry to over 11% [10] could be complemented by strategies to capitalize on the export potential. By increasing its share of the global tobacco trade, the company could substantially boost its revenue and profitability, offsetting the impact of high taxation on cigarettes and other internal challenges.\n\n![India currently holds only 0.7% share of the USD 30 bn. annual Global Import Export Tobacco Trade.](image3)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe company's financial results for 2002-2003"}

This resilience is further illustrated by the image1, which shows that the Asia region's adjusted profit before tax was $13 billion in 2020, down from $15.2 billion in 2019.

The rise in equity securities indicates a shift towards higher-risk investments, potentially to offset the lower returns from fixed income. The overall asset composition reflects a balance between liquidity and growth, with implications for both risk management and investment strategy.\n\n![Net investment income changes from 2020 to 2021](image7)\n\n![Asset composition of the insurance business as of December 31, 2021](image3)\n\n![Float of the insurance business from 2020 to 2021](image8)"}

In 2019, the upstream segment reported a loss of $5,094 million, while the downstream segment earned $2,576 million. By 2020, the upstream segment's loss narrowed to $1,608 million, and the downstream segment's earnings dropped to a loss of $571 million. In 2021, the upstream segment turned profitable with $15,818 million, and the downstream segment earned $2,914 million. These changes in performance were driven by higher oil prices and improved market conditions in 2021, as shown in image1, which depicts the Brent and WTI oil prices and Henry Hub natural gas prices over the same period. The overall net income for Chevron Corporation was negative in 2019 and 2020 but turned positive in 2021, reaching $15,625 million, as detailed in image3 and image4. The increase in net income was primarily due to the strong performance of the upstream segment, which benefited from higher realizations and sales volumes, as noted in [3] and [10]. The downstream segment also improved its earnings in 2021 due to higher margins and sales volumes, as mentioned in [7]. The trends indicate that Chevron's financial health is closely tied to the global energy market dynamics, with significant impacts on its net income.\n\n![Chevron's net income trend from 2016 to 2021](image5)\n\n![Chevron's upstream and downstream earnings from 2019 to 2021](image3)\n\n![Chevron's net income per share and return on capital employed from 2019 to 2021](image4)\n\n![Oil and natural gas prices from 2019 to 2021](image1)\n\n**Answer:** Chevron's upstream and downstream operations saw a significant improvement in financial performance from 2019 to 2021, driven by higher oil prices and market conditions, leading to a substantial increase in overall net income in 2021."}

The fair value of these contracts decreases as interest rates rise, with a 100 basis point increase leading to a decrease in fair value from $99 million to $87,065 million, and a 300 basis point increase reducing it further to $9,319 million. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates increases the fair value from $99 million to $105 million. This sensitivity is due to the inverse relationship between interest rates and the fair value of liabilities, as higher rates increase the discount rate used to value future cash flows, thus reducing the present value of liabilities.\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt, the effects on net earnings differ between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, non-U.S. denominated debt resulted in a net loss of $764 million, while in 2021, it contributed a net gain of $955 million. This change reflects the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of these debts into U.S. dollars, as seen in image1. The significant swing from a loss to a gain indicates favorable currency movements for Berkshire Hathaway in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n### Conclusion\nInterest rate changes inversely affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts, and non-U.S. denominated debt had a net loss in 2020 but a net gain in 2021 due to currency fluctuations.\n\n![Interest rate changes inversely affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts, and non-U.S. denominated debt had a net loss in 2020 but a net gain in 2021 due to currency fluctuations.](image7)  \n![Non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings: Loss of $764 million in 2020, Gain of $955 million in 2021.](image1)"}

This significant decline was primarily due to lower refined product margins and increased operating expenses.\n- **2020 to 2021**: The U.S. downstream earnings improved to $2.4 billion in 2021. This improvement was driven by higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from a 50% owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million.

This decrease was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses.\n- **2020 to 2021**: International downstream earnings further decreased to $525 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million, although there was a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million between periods.\n\n### Significant Factors:\n- **U.S. Downstream**: The increase in earnings was driven by higher refined product margins, increased earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes.

Image7 shows that the average Card Member loans decreased from $6.660 billion in 2019 to $5.933 billion in 2021, a reduction of $727 million. This decline in loans, combined with higher paydown rates, led to a decrease in net interest income from $7,683 million in 2019 to $6,674 million in 2021, a reduction of $1,009 million. Despite this, the company maintained strong financial performance, as evidenced by a 17 percent increase in total revenues net of interest expense to $24.831 billion in 2021, driven by growth in non-interest revenues like discount revenue and net card fees [6].

The effect of the cancellation of these treasury shares was recognized in Class A ordinary shares and Additional paid-in capital with the residual recorded in Retained earnings. There was no effect on total shareholders’ equity as a result of this cancellation.\"\n- **Image 2**: Shows the impact of share-based compensation expense on shareholders' equity.

This reflects the company's commitment to rewarding employees and aligning their interests with shareholders, thereby boosting equity without diluting ownership.\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n   - The substantial net cash provided by operating activities of $8,215,152 in 2020 significantly enhances the company's liquidity and cash reserves. This robust cash flow supports operational stability and provides resources for future investments, dividends, and other strategic initiatives.\n\n### Conclusion\nShare-based compensation and positive cash flow from operating activities both positively impact Accenture plc's financial health in 2020. Share-based compensation increases shareholders' equity by boosting Additional Paid-in Capital, while strong operating cash flow strengthens the company's cash position, ensuring financial flexibility and shareholder value.\n\n![Share-based compensation increases shareholders' equity by enhancing Additional Paid-in Capital](image"}

In 2021, the company issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D, which were used to redeem $850 million of Series C and $750 million of Series B preferred shares [10]. This activity is reflected in the cash flows from financing activities, where the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by these transactions [1]. The issuance of preferred shares provided a substantial inflow of cash, while the redemption of older preferred shares resulted in cash outflows, affecting the net cash used in financing activities.\n\nIn terms of shareholders' equity, the issuance of preferred shares increased the total shareholders' equity. The table in image4 shows that total shareholders' equity increased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, despite the redemption of preferred shares. This indicates that the issuance of new preferred shares offset the reduction from the redemption, maintaining or slightly decreasing the overall equity.\n\nThe detailed cash flow statement in image3 highlights the net cash used in financing activities, showing the impact of these transactions.

According to the text, net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates, although this was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. Meanwhile, net interest expense decreased by $5,245 million to $3,738 million, driven by lower interest-bearing deposits and funding costs. These changes resulted in a net increase in net interest income of $1,507 million.\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes were the lower interest rates, which reduced net interest income, and the reduction in interest-bearing deposits and funding costs, which lowered net interest expense. The deployment of excess deposits into securities and the additional day of interest accrual also played roles in mitigating the decrease in net interest income.

According to the text [4], the company achieved 30.3% women in senior leadership roles by 2020, with a target to increase this to 35% by 2025. This is a notable improvement from 29% in 2019. In contrast, the overall employee distribution is more balanced, with 52% female employees and 48% male employees, as shown in image4. The image illustrates that while women make up a majority of the overall workforce, they are underrepresented in senior leadership positions, where they constitute only 30% compared to 70% of men. This highlights a gender disparity in leadership roles despite a more balanced overall workforce.\n\n![Gender distribution in senior leadership and all employees](image4)\n\nThe company recognizes this disparity and is actively working to address it through initiatives aimed at increasing female representation in senior leadership, as mentioned in the text [1] and [3]. These efforts include launching new programs to enhance career progression for women and other underrepresented groups. The commitment to doubling the number of Black employees in senior leadership roles by 2025, as stated in the text [2] and [5], further underscores the company's broader diversity and inclusion goals. \n\nIn summary, while women are a majority in the overall workforce, they are underrepresented in senior leadership roles, with a significant gap between the two distributions.

According to the text [1], the Asia business, which includes WPB, was the major contributor, delivering $13bn of adjusted profit before tax in 2020. This aligns with the image3, which shows that WPB's adjusted revenue was $4.1bn, representing 34% of the total adjusted revenue. This indicates that WPB played a crucial role in sustaining the group's financial performance.\n\nThe financial performance data reveals a mixed picture for WPB. The adjusted revenue for WPB decreased by 14% from 2019 to 2020, as seen in image4, which shows a drop from $25.565bn in 2019 to $22.013bn in 2020. This decline is further detailed in image4, where the net operating income for WPB decreased by $3,552m, or 14%, from 2019 to 2020. The image5 highlights that the decrease in revenue was driven by lower interest rates and reduced customer activity, as mentioned in the text [10]. However, the image6 shows that HSBC launched HSBC Pinnacle in mainland China, aiming to grow its wealth management business, which could positively impact future performance.\n\nThe image7 indicates that the return on tangible equity (RoTE) for WPB dropped significantly from 25.6% in 2019 to 22.0% in 2020, reflecting the challenging market conditions. The image8 provides a broader view of the adjusted results, showing a substantial decrease in profit before tax from $7,170m in 2019 to $1,868m in 2020, a decline of 74%. This decline is attributed to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, as seen in image8, which increased by over 200% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn summary, while WPB's contribution was significant, the financial performance data reveals a challenging year marked by lower revenues and higher credit losses, reflecting the broader impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the banking sector.\n\n![WPB's adjusted revenue"}

This liability was adjusted to reflect lease payments, re-measurements, and other financial movements, resulting in a balance of $167,154,000 at 28 June 2020 [image1].\n- **Lease Incentives**: Lease incentives were no longer recognized as separate provisions but were instead included in the lease liability. This change was made to align with the new accounting standard, which requires lease incentives to be offset against lease rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term [image7].\n- **Onerous Leases**: The Group no longer recognizes provisions for onerous leases. Instead, the payments due under the lease are included in the lease liability, with the expenditure to settle the lease at the end of the term based on the least net cost alternative [image2].\n- **Rent Concessions**: The Group applied a practical expedient and did not re-measure lease liabilities for rent concessions directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic [11].\n\n### Employee Benefit Liabilities:\n- **Annual and Long-Service Leave**: Liabilities for annual leave and long-service leave were calculated at undiscounted amounts based on expected future wage and salary rates, including related on-costs.

Consolidated operating income is evaluated based on the degree of attainment of the required income set for sustainable growth, while share price volatility is assessed comparatively against the Nikkei stock average [image7]. This dual approach ensures that executives are incentivized to improve both profitability and market stability.\n\nThe remuneration structure includes fixed and performance-linked components, with the latter derived from the balance after deducting fixed remuneration from the Annual Total Remuneration [1]. This performance-linked remuneration is adjusted based on individual performance evaluations, which consider efforts aligned with the company's long-term value improvement goals [11]. The system aims to secure and retain talent by setting remuneration levels that reflect job responsibilities and international standards, ensuring competitiveness [2][3].\n\nShareholder value is further emphasized through a stable payout ratio of 30%, with dividends and share repurchases contributing to total shareholder return [9][image1].

This is a significant increase from 2019, where restructuring charges were a credit of $36 million due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [9].\n- The restructuring charges in 2020 are reflected in the restructuring accrual balances, which are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment [12]. The balance at December 31, 2020, was $18 million, compared to $28 million in 2019 and $29 million in 2018 [image4].\n\n**Inclusion in Operating Profit:**\n\n- The restructuring charges are included in the operating profit. In 2020, operating profit was $1,688 million, which included restructuring charges of $24 million in the second quarter [image5]. This contrasts with 2019, where restructuring charges of $36 million were included in the third quarter, leading to an operating profit of $1,506 million [image5].\n- The inclusion of restructuring charges in operating profit affects the net income. In 2020, net income was $1,688 million, while in 2019 it was $1,305 million [image5]. The increase in net income from 2019 to 2020, despite higher restructuring charges, suggests other factors positively impacted the financial performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe restructuring charges in 2020 significantly impacted the financial statements by increasing operating expenses and reducing operating profit compared to 2019. However, the overall net income increased, indicating that other factors, such as revenue growth or cost management, offset the impact of these charges.\n\n![Restructuring charges and payments from 2018 to 2020](image4)\n\n**Answer:** The restructuring charges in 2020 increased operating expenses and reduced operating profit compared to 2019,"}

For instance, Maharashtra spent ₹70.00 crore on COVID Relief, while Uttar Pradesh spent ₹4.00 crore, and Gujarat spent ₹0.99 crore. Other states like Haryana, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu also allocated funds for COVID Relief.\n- **Implementation Modes**: Most COVID Relief projects were implemented directly by the bank or through implementing agencies. For example, Maharashtra's COVID Relief was implemented directly, while Gujarat's was through Yuva Unstoppable. The mode of implementation for COVID Relief projects is often direct or through specific agencies like the National Health and Education Society or Solace.\n\n### Rural Development Projects (HRDP)\n- **Amount Spent**: HRDP projects are widespread across multiple states, with varying amounts spent. For example, Punjab spent ₹444.72 crore, Uttar Pradesh spent ₹181.86 crore, and Maharashtra spent ₹123.00 crore. Other states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Bihar also invested in HRDP.\n- **Implementation Modes**: HRDP projects are mostly implemented through implementing agencies. For instance, Punjab's HRDP was implemented by Shramik Bharati, while Uttar Pradesh's was through various agencies like Foundation for Ecological Security and Peoples Action for National Integration. The mode of implementation for HRDP is often through third-party agencies.\n\n### Key Differences in Implementation Modes\n- **COVID Relief**: Predominantly direct implementation by the bank or specific agencies, focusing on immediate relief measures.\n- **HRDP**: Primarily implemented through third-party agencies, focusing on long-term rural development.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe key differences lie in the implementation modes and the focus areas. COVID Relief projects emphasize direct intervention for immediate needs, while HRDP projects rely on third-party agencies for sustained rural development efforts.\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation Modes](image1)\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation Modes](image2)\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation Modes](image3)\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation Modes](image4)\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation Modes](image5)\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation Modes](image6)\n\n![COVID Relief and HRDP Implementation"}

This indicates that while there were efforts to boost sales, the overall impact was mixed.\n- **International Operated Markets Segment:** [2] and [6] highlight that the operating income decrease in the International Operated Markets segment was due to sales declines as a result of COVID-19, with over $100 million of support for marketing to accelerate recovery. This segment faced significant challenges due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly in countries like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, as noted in [12].\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image 4** provides detailed revenue figures and growth rates for both segments. For the U.S., company-operated sales decreased by 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, while franchised revenues decreased by 2%.

This decrease was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, despite being partly offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) [9]. The table in image1 shows the net interest income for the year ended 31 Dec 2020 was $27,578 million, down from $30,462 million in 2019.\n\n**Interest Expense:**\n- Interest expense decreased to $14,178 million in 2020 from $24,233 million in 2019, a reduction of $10,055 million or 41.5% [11]. This decrease was driven by lower market interest rates and growth in interest-bearing customer accounts [11].

Image5 shows the net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit risk provisions was $12,023 million in 2020.\n\n**Overall Profitability:**\n- The reported profit before tax decreased by 34% to $8.8 billion in 2020, while adjusted profit before tax decreased by 45% to $12.1 billion [1]. The fall in reported profit was due to increased expected credit losses and reduced revenue, partially mitigated by lower operating expenses [1]. Image5"}

The main components of these costs include separations, asset-related costs, and other costs. The costs are primarily recorded within the Corporate segment for reporting purposes.\n\n### Detailed Answer:\n\nThe total restructuring costs across different segments have shown a significant decrease from 2020 to 2022. In 2020, the total restructuring costs were $782 million, while in 2022, they reduced to $253 million. This reduction is evident from the table in image8, which shows the breakdown of restructuring costs by segment for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n\n**Components of Restructuring Costs:**\n1. **Separations:** Costs related to severance packages for voluntary employee separations. These are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. The costs are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.\n2. **Asset-Related Costs:** These include asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs are made to establish a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal, and accelerated depreciation relates to long-lived assets taken out of service before their normal period.\n3. **Other Costs:** These include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n\nThe restructuring costs are primarily funded by and included within the Corporate segment for both management and segment reporting, as noted in [9]. This ensures consistency in how these costs are reported and managed across different fiscal years.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The decrease in total restructuring costs from 2020 to 2022 reflects the company's ongoing efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure through manufacturing and workforce optimization.\n- The costs incurred in 2022 were within the historical annual range of $250 to $500 million, as mentioned in [4] and [6].\n- The table in image5 provides a detailed breakdown of the costs incurred and paid/settled for each year, showing the transition from higher costs in 2020 to lower costs in 2022.\n\nIn summary, the total restructuring costs decreased from $782 million in 2020 to $253 million in 2022, with the main components being separations, asset"}

By 2021, service costs increased to 87.0%, and other costs rose to 13.0% [6]. This indicates a slight shift towards higher other costs, possibly due to increased agency fees and payment channel fees [2].\n- The total cost of revenues increased from RMB16,761 million in 2019 to RMB21,840 million in 2021, showing a 30.3% increase [6]. This growth suggests higher operational expenses, particularly in service costs, which are primarily content costs and delivery costs [8].\n\n**Operating Expenses:**\n- Selling and marketing expenses increased from RMB2,041 million in 2019 to RMB2,678 million in 2021, a 31.2% increase [12]. This rise is attributed to branding and user acquisition costs, indicating a focus on expanding market presence [12].\n- General and administrative expenses rose from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,099 million in 2021, a 51.7% increase [10]. This includes higher R&D expenses and salaries for administrative personnel, reflecting increased investment in technology and talent [10].\n\n**Financial Management Implications:**\n- The company's financial management appears to prioritize growth and innovation, as evidenced by increased R&D and marketing expenses [10, 12]. However, the rising cost of revenues and operating expenses may impact profitability if not managed efficiently [4].\n- The company's ability to manage these expenses while increasing revenues, as seen in the revenue growth from RMB25,434 million in 2019 to RMB31,244 million in 2021 [image1], suggests a strategic approach to scaling operations and expanding market reach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe company's financial management strategy involves significant investment in growth areas like R&D and marketing, which may drive"}

The significant rise in noninterest income more than offset the sharp decline in net interest income, contributing to the overall growth in total revenue.\n\n![Net interest income and noninterest income changes from 2020 to 2021](image2)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe net interest income decreased significantly due to various factors, while noninterest income increased substantially, leading to an overall increase in total revenue in 2021 compared to 2020."}

This suggests that any unrealized gains or losses did not significantly impact the financial statements.\n- **[9]** States that a 100 basis point change in interest rates would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value for available-for-sale securities. This implies that changes in interest rates, which affect unrealized gains or losses, do not significantly alter the recorded basis.\n- **[12]** Explains that available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized.

This growth was primarily due to strong performance from Red Hat, with Cloud & Data Platforms, which includes Red Hat, growing 20.9% [2][3][9][image7].\n\n### Global Business Services\n- **External Gross Profit Margin**: The external gross profit margin for Global Business Services increased by 2.0 percentage points to 29.7% in 2020 from 27.7% in 2019. This improvement was due to a shift towards higher-value services [image2].\n- **External Revenue**: The external revenue for Global Business Services decreased by 3.8% to $16,162 million in 2020 from $16,798 million in 2019. This decline was attributed to project delays and reduced discretionary spending by clients due to the macroeconomic environment [4][5][9][image6].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Cloud & Cognitive Software segment showed both an increase in external gross profit margin and revenue, driven by strong performance from Red Hat and strategic shifts towards higher-value services. In contrast, Global Business Services experienced a decrease in external revenue but an increase in external gross profit margin, reflecting a strategic pivot towards higher-value services despite challenging market conditions.\n\n![Cloud & Cognitive Software external revenue and margin changes](image7)\n![Global Business Services external revenue and margin changes](image2)"}

The weighted-average all-in financing cost of the total debt was 2.4% in 2020, indicating a relatively low cost of borrowing.\n\n**Financial Liabilities Strategy:**\nThe company's financial liabilities strategy is conservative and well-structured. It maintains a strong credit rating, as evidenced by its investment-grade ratings from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, as shown in image7. This strong credit rating allows the company to access credit facilities at favorable terms and manage its debt effectively. The company's approach to choosing financial counterparties, as described in [4], further underscores its conservative risk management strategy, focusing on institutions with strong credit ratings and avoiding structured or equity-linked products.\n\nThe company's ability to meet its covenants, such as maintaining a consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense ratio of 12.6 to 1.0 at December 31, 2020 [7], indicates a healthy financial position and the ability to service its debt comfortably. The significant amount of debt, combined with the substantial committed credit facilities, suggests a balanced approach to leveraging debt for growth and investment while ensuring liquidity and financial stability.\n\n"}

According to text quote [1], Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%), with little change in party identification over the past few years. This trend is supported by image1, which shows that 53% of Latino registered voters plan to vote for the Democratic candidate, compared to 28% for the Republican candidate, and 18% are undecided or plan to support another candidate.\n\nDespite this alignment, Latino registered voters' future party affiliation remains uncertain, as noted in text quote [4]. A Pew Research Center study found that many Latino voters have soft ties to political parties, indicating potential volatility in their party affiliation. This uncertainty is reflected in image1, where 81% of Dem/Lean Dem voters support the Democratic candidate, while 76% of Rep/Lean Rep voters support the Republican candidate, highlighting a strong but not absolute alignment.\n\nThe economy is the top issue affecting Latino voters' decisions, as stated in text quote [2], with 80% saying it is very important. This is followed by health care (71%), violent crime (70%), education (70%), and gun policy (66%). Image3 illustrates the rise in the importance of abortion as a voting issue, increasing from 42% in March to 57% in August, showing a significant shift in priorities.\n\nPerceptions of party care and effort to earn Latino votes vary.

Additionally, the data shows that the overall concern, including those who are somewhat concerned, has also been on the rise, reflecting a heightened awareness and fear of terrorism in the region.\n\n![Threat of terrorism concern increased from 43% in 2012 to 49% in 2014](image4)\n\nThis trend aligns with the broader context of civil unrest and other regional challenges, as indicated by the survey's findings on the biggest obstacles facing the Middle East. The increasing concern about terrorism is part of a larger pattern of growing worries about security and stability in the region.\n\nIn summary, the perception of the 'Threat of terrorism' among Arab youth has been increasing from 2012 to 2014, with a significant rise in the percentage of those who are very concerned."}

According to the text, nearly three-quarters of Americans overall favor promoting human rights in China, even if it harms economic relations [3][9][10][12]. This preference is consistent across age groups, with younger and older Americans alike showing a strong inclination towards human rights [10]. However, older Americans (50 and older) are more negative towards China, with 81% having an unfavorable view compared to 71% of those aged 30 to 49 and 56% of those under 30 [11]. This heightened negativity among older Americans is reflected in their views on China's leadership, with 62% having no confidence in Xi, compared to 40% of those under 30 [5]. \n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends. Image5 shows that while 73% of the total population prioritizes human rights, this preference is slightly higher among younger age groups (76% for ages 18-29 and 75% for ages 30-49) and slightly lower among those 50 and older (71%). Despite this, the majority in all age groups still prioritize human rights over economic relations [10][12]. Image2 confirms the negative sentiment towards China, with 73% of those 50 and older viewing China negatively, compared to 59% of those aged 30-49 and 54% of those aged 18-29. \n\nIn summary, while all age groups prioritize human rights over economic relations with China, older Americans are more negative towards China and have a slightly lower preference for human rights compared to younger groups, though still a majority. This suggests that while age influences the intensity of negative views, the overall preference for human rights remains strong across generations.\n\n![Majority favors promoting human rights in China over prioritizing economic relations](image5)"}

This trend can be attributed to the consolidation of farms and the enduring presence of ethnic communities that maintained cultural and religious institutions.\n\n![Hamilton County's population peaked in 1890 and then declined, with a recent increase in Aurora](image2)\n\nThe population of Hamilton County grew dramatically from 130 in 1870 to 14,096 in 1890, driven by pioneers and the railroad. However, it declined to 13,337 by 1900 and fluctuated until 1940, when it dropped to 9,982. After 1940, the population stabilized and began to rise again, reaching 9,403 by 2000. This pattern reflects the impact of the Homestead Act, which encouraged settlement, and the decline of small towns as farms consolidated. The town of Aurora, unlike other rural areas, saw a population increase, peaking in 2000, likely due to its role as a regional hub and the resilience of its community.\n\n![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000](image2)\n\nThe establishment of rural school districts and the presence of ethnic communities, such as the Danes and Swedes, contributed to the initial growth. These groups settled in clusters, creating strong religious and cultural centers, like the Zion Lutheran Church and St. John’s complex, which remain focal points in the community. The railroad's influence is evident in the development of towns like Aurora, which became a center for commerce and population.\n\n![Zion Lutheran Church, a focal point for the German settlement](image5)\n\nThe decline in population after 1890 was influenced by the challenges of farming, with many Homestead Act claimants failing to secure land.

Additionally, 73% of Americans believed that significantly reducing infections was the more effective way to help the economy recover, rather than reopening businesses and schools without a significant decline in infections [3]. \n\nPublic opinion on the effectiveness of different levels of government varied, with 48% rating the federal government's response positively and 51% rating state and local governments' responses positively. However, there was a partisan divide, with 68% of Republicans rating state and local governments positively and 64% of Democrats rating the federal government positively [4].\n\nThe survey also identified major reasons for the spread of the virus, with 75% citing insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing, 58% pointing to restrictions being lifted too quickly, and 53% blaming the inadequate federal response [3]. \n\nOverall, the public's assessment of the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak was largely negative, with significant concerns about the pace of reopening and the effectiveness of different government levels in managing the crisis.\n\n![The U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak has been less effective compared to other wealthy countries](image6)"}

According to text quote [6], while Republicans' views on this question have mostly held steady, Democrats have become significantly less likely to see the U.S. as the leading global economy. This trend is visually represented in image1, which shows a steady increase in Republican confidence from 17% in 2012 to 38% in 2020, while Democratic confidence has risen from 11% to 19% over the same period. This indicates a widening gap in economic confidence between the two political affiliations.\n\nThe decline in Democratic confidence is further highlighted by text quote [7], which notes that the percentage of Democrats who see the U.S. as the world's top economy dropped from 54% in March to 44% in the current survey. This decline is consistent with the broader trend of economic uncertainty, as the U.S. unemployment rate has skyrocketed since the coronavirus outbreak, and the International Monetary Fund predicts a GDP shrinkage for the U.S. in 2020, while China's economy is expected to grow.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [8] suggests that those who see China as economically dominant are less likely to support getting tough on China economically, instead prioritizing building a strong relationship. This is supported by image5, which shows that 23% of Americans prioritize economic relations with China, with a higher percentage among older age groups (24% for those 50+).

This trend is visually supported by image2, which shows a steady increase in the percentage of voters who felt news organizations had too much influence, rising from 46% in 1992 to 57% in 2016.

This is demonstrated in Figure 3(b), where SenseBERT assigns the supersense \"noun.food\" to \"bass,\" indicating its role as an edible item being cooked. This approach helps the model generalize semantically similar concepts, even if they are expressed differently.\n\n![SenseBERT's prediction on raw text](image4)\n\nSenseBERT's ability to predict supersenses is a key feature that distinguishes it from vanilla BERT, which only sees the word form. By predicting supersenses, SenseBERT can better handle words with multiple meanings, such as \"bass,\" which can refer to a fish, a musical instrument, or a type of singer. This is achieved through a training process that involves predicting the supersense of a masked word based on its context, as shown in Figure 3(a), where SenseBERT assigns probabilities to different supersenses for a masked position.\n\n![Supersense probabilities assigned by SenseBERT](image6)\n\nThe hierarchical clustering of supersense embeddings in Figure 3(c) further illustrates how SenseBERT organizes semantic information, separating nouns and verbs and clustering semantically related categories together.

This suggests that the style vector is more effective in capturing style information.\n- **[1]**: The VAE imposes a probabilistic distribution on the latent vector and uses the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence for regularization.

This integration is crucial for providing the model with access to the full context surrounding the target token, including the token itself, which is essential for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) [1][5]. The forward and backward states are combined using a self-attention module followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) block, allowing the model to leverage information from both directions of the sequence [5]. This approach ensures that the model can effectively utilize the entire input context to make accurate predictions for each token in the sequence.\n\n![Combination of representations](image6)\n\nThe combination layer is designed to handle the forward states \\( F_{1}^{L} \\ldots F_{i-1}^{L} \\) and backward states \\( B_{i+1}^{L} \\ldots B_{n}^{L} \\), where \\( n \\) is the sequence length and \\( L \\) is the number of layers.

It highlights that controlling for multi-turn repetition is crucial. [10] notes that when repetition control is introduced, the question-asking rate is reduced, especially in the z=10 setting, which should produce 100% questions but only achieves 79.67%. This reduction is due to the weighted decoding feature extrep bigram, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, preventing the model from producing common question bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is.\"\n\n![Repetition control reduces question-asking rate](image4)\n\nImage4 shows the percentage of utterances containing questions across different question-asking control levels. The graph indicates that with repetition control (Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl), the question-asking rate is lower compared to the Question-controlled CT without repetition control. The target for the question-controlled baseline is also lower, showing that repetition control impacts the ability to maintain high question-asking rates.\n\n[10] further explains that introducing repetition control reduces the model's ability to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, leading to a lower question-asking rate. To address this, a boost setting (z=10 boost) is introduced, which allows the model to produce these bigrams without using extrep bigram during beam search, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate but slightly increased external bigram repetition.\n\nIn summary, the presence of repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text by discouraging common question bigrams, as shown in image4. However, a boost setting can mitigate this issue, allowing higher question-asking rates while managing repetition.\n\n**Answer:** Repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text by discouraging common question bigrams, but a boost setting can help maintain higher question-asking rates."}

Initially, both methods show an improvement in performance as \\( p \\) increases from 0. This improvement is due to the reduction in overfitting on the long-term user representation (LTUR), which has many parameters.

This is achieved by using a pre-trained BERT model to encode both the dialog context and the domain-slot pairs, ensuring that the contextualized representations are conditioned on the domain-slot information. For non-categorical slots, a two-way linear mapping is employed to find text spans in the dialog context.

According to the text, these mechanisms are:\n\n- **Base excision repair (BER)**: This pathway is used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases of one DNA strand. It involves the removal of damaged bases by glycosylase enzymes, followed by the addition of new normal bases by a polymerase enzyme and the rejoining of the DNA strand by DNA ligase [5].\n- **Nucleotide excision repair (NER)**: This system excises bulky DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and is crucial for repairing damage caused by UV light and other agents [6].\n- **Mismatch repair (MMR)**: This system corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that arise from errors during DNA replication, ensuring the fidelity of the genetic information [12].\n- **Recombination repair**: This mechanism repairs double-strand breaks in DNA, which are particularly devastating and can lead to chromosomal instability. It includes homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ) [7].\n\nThe image ![DNA Repair Mechanisms](image5) illustrates these processes by showing different types of DNA damage and the corresponding repair pathways. For instance, it highlights how 8-oxoguanine single-strand breaks are repaired by BER, single base mismatches by MMR, pyrimidine dimers by NER, and double-strand breaks by recombinational repair.

This framework leverages the strengths of both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to ensure accurate and reliable logical reasoning.\n\n### Problem Formulation\nIn this stage, the LLM translates the natural language problem and its goal into a task-specific symbolic language. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement and converting them into a symbolic representation. For example, as shown in [image3], a natural language problem about Netflix shows is transformed into a set of predicates and premises in first-order logic (FOL). The LLM uses in-context learning to map the problem to its symbolic form, ensuring that the representation is precise and suitable for further reasoning.\n\n### Symbolic Reasoning\nOnce the problem is formulated symbolically, a deterministic symbolic solver, such as a logic programming engine, performs inference on the symbolic representation. This stage offloads the complex reasoning tasks to reliable, interpretable algorithms. For instance, [image5] demonstrates how different types of logical problems (deductive, first-order logic, constraint satisfaction, analytical) are handled by specific solvers like Pyke, Prover9, or Z3. The solver executes deterministic algorithms (e.g., forward/backward-chaining) to derive the answer.\n\n### Result Interpretation\nThe final stage involves translating the symbolic answer back into natural language. This is done by either an LLM or a rule-based interpreter, ensuring the result is understandable and correctly answers the original question. The process is iterative, with self-refinement using error messages from the solver to improve the symbolic formulation, as illustrated in [image5].\n\n### Performance and Effectiveness\nThe effectiveness of LOGIC-LM is evident in its performance improvements over pure LLMs and chain-of-thought prompting, as shown in [image8]. For example, on the PrOntoQA dataset, LOGIC-LM achieves a significant boost from 61.00% to 85.00% for GPT-3.5 and from 77.40% to 98.79% for GPT-4, demonstrating its ability to enhance reasoning accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy decomposing the problem-solving process into these stages, LOGIC-LM effectively combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the logical precision of symbolic solvers, resulting"}

The image3 provides a detailed breakdown of energy sources for China, Germany, the United States, Amazon-AWS, Google, and Microsoft. According to image3, Amazon-AWS uses 56% renewable energy, 24% gas, 30% coal, and 26% nuclear. In contrast, Microsoft uses 32% renewable energy, 23% gas, 31% coal, and 10% nuclear. This indicates that Amazon-AWS relies more heavily on renewable energy compared to Microsoft, which uses a higher proportion of coal.\n\nThe implications of these energy distributions on CO2 emissions are significant. Coal is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, as it is a fossil fuel that releases substantial amounts of carbon dioxide when burned. Therefore, Microsoft's higher coal usage suggests that its operations may result in higher CO2 emissions compared to Amazon-AWS. This is further supported by the text [11], which highlights the environmental impact of energy consumption and the need to consider the carbon intensity of energy sources.\n\nMoreover, the text [6] emphasizes the importance of characterizing the carbon emissions associated with training neural networks. Given that both Amazon-AWS and Microsoft are major cloud service providers used for training such models, their energy sources directly affect the carbon footprint of these operations. The text [4] also discusses the cost-effectiveness of centralized compute resources, which could potentially be powered by more sustainable energy sources, reducing overall emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, Amazon-AWS uses more renewable energy and less coal compared to Microsoft, which may result in lower CO2 emissions for Amazon-AWS.

This is achieved through two main techniques: cropping and blurring.\n\n1. **Cropping**: As shown in image8, the image is divided into regions of interest using bounding boxes (bbox1, bbox2, bbox3). These regions are then encoded separately, allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the image rather than the entire scene. This is particularly important in object detection tasks where objects of interest are often smaller and more varied in position.\n\n2. **Blurring**: The text [8] mentions that blurring is used to direct the model's attention to the relevant objects by reducing the prominence of non-target areas. This helps in isolating the objects of interest, making it easier for the model to identify them accurately.\n\nBy combining these techniques, the pre-processing step ensures that the model receives a more focused input, enhancing its ability to recognize objects in a zero-shot setting. This is further supported by the retrieval and ranking process, where the encoded regions are matched against stored embeddings to identify the most relevant categories.\n\n### Quote Citation\n- **Text [8]**: \"In object detection datasets, our methodology for extracting image embeddings e_img is slightly different from the approach discussed previously.

Table 1 gives concrete examples: for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), most tokens are backgrounds with tagging class O. Specifically, the number of tokens with tagging class O is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Data-imbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Kocisk y et al., 2018; Dasigi et al., 2019) with the value of negative-positive ratio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the starting and ending indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background.\n\n![QUOREF has a negative-positive ratio of 169](image4)\n\nThe QUOREF dataset has a negative-positive ratio of 169, as shown in image4.

This process is crucial for the reorganization of the nucleus and the preparation for cytokinesis. The nuclear envelope formation is visible in image2, which shows the \"Nuclear envelope Forming\" stage, indicating the reformation of the nuclear membrane around the chromosomes. This aligns with text quote [8], which mentions that cytokinesis often overlaps with telophase, highlighting the sequential nature of these processes.\n\n**Cytokinesis** follows telophase and involves the division of the cytoplasm to form two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, this is achieved through the formation of a cleavage furrow, as depicted in image2, where the \"Cleavage furrow\" is shown. The cleavage furrow pinches the cell in two, leading to the separation of the cytoplasm. This process is also illustrated in image6, which shows the \"Contracting ring of Microfilaments\" that constricts the cell membrane, ultimately leading to the formation of two daughter cells. This aligns with text quote [1], which describes the plasma membrane growing inward to divide the cells, and image3, which shows a cell undergoing cytokinesis.\n\nIn plant cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cell plate, as described in text quote [10], which grows outward to divide the contents into two cells. This process is not explicitly shown in the provided images but is a critical aspect of cytokinesis in plant cells.\n\nThe images and text quotes together provide a comprehensive view of the structural changes during telophase and cytokinesis, emphasizing the dynamic nature of these stages in cell division.\n\n![Nuclear envelope forming](image2)  \n![Cleavage furrow](image3)  \n![Contracting ring of Microfilaments](image6)\n\n**Conclusion**: During telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear envelope reforms, chromosomes decondense, and the cytoplasm divides, either through a cleavage furrow in animal cells or a cell plate in plant cells, resulting in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells."}

Elements of objects tend to be grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form. Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.\n- [12] Proximity. We tend to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **image3** shows a comparison of time spent on various activities on weekends between 2005 and 2010. The pie charts illustrate the distribution of time across different activities, including watching films and fitness.\n\n**Answer Construction:**\nFrom the pie charts in image3, we observe that the time spent on watching films increased from 20% in 2005 to 22% in 2010, while the time spent on fitness activities decreased from 5% in 2005 to 6% in 2010. This suggests a slight increase in leisure activities like watching films and a marginal increase in fitness activities over the period. The use of pie charts helps in visually grouping related activities, making it easier to compare the proportions of time spent on different activities, which aligns with the Gestalt principle of proximity [12]. The continuity principle [10] is also evident as the data is presented in a sequential manner, showing a clear pattern of change over time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe increase in time spent on watching films and the marginal increase in fitness activities suggest a trend towards more sedentary leisure activities and a slight shift towards health consciousness during that period. This indicates a lifestyle shift where people might be opting for more passive entertainment while still making some effort to maintain physical health.\n\n![Time spent on watching films and fitness activities increased from 2005 to 2010, indicating a trend towards more sedentary leisure activities and a slight shift towards health consciousness.](image3)"}

Gregor Mendel discovered that traits are inherited through discrete units, now known as genes, which segregate during gamete formation and combine randomly during fertilization. This leads to specific ratios in offspring.\n\n### Answer Construction\n\nMendel's experiments with pea plants demonstrated that traits are inherited through discrete units, now known as genes, which segregate during gamete formation and combine randomly during fertilization. This results in specific phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the offspring. In a monohybrid cross, such as the one involving flower color, the parental generation consists of true-breeding plants with purple (P) and white (p) flowers. The F1 generation, resulting from the cross, all exhibit purple flowers due to the dominance of the purple allele (P). When F1 plants are self-pollinated, the F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3:1, with three-quarters of the plants having purple flowers and one-quarter having white flowers. This is because the F1 plants are heterozygous (Pp), and during gamete formation, the alleles segregate independently, leading to a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 (PP, Pp, pp) in the F2 generation.\n\n![Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of segregation and independent assortment of alleles.](image1)\n\n### Evidence Selection\n\n- **Text Quotes**:\n  - [1] Gregor Mendel discovered principles of genetics in experiments with the garden pea.\n  - [4] Mendel showed that parents pass heritable factors to offspring (heritable factors are now called genes).\n  - [8] Fertilization is the union of sperm and egg.

Image7 shows a table detailing structured markup errors across different data types. The table highlights significant numbers of errors, particularly in schema.org's Blog and Article data types, with 72,441 and 49,222 items with errors respectively. These errors can confuse search engines, leading to improper indexing and reduced visibility. For instance, incorrect schema markup can prevent rich snippets from appearing, which can negatively affect click-through rates and search engine rankings.\n\n### Meta Description Issues\n\n[8] discusses the importance of meta descriptions in SEO. Image3 provides a graph showing time spent downloading a page and lists issues like duplicate and missing meta descriptions. The graph indicates that pages with duplicate meta descriptions take longer to download, which can affect user experience and SEO. The table in the same image shows 2,215 pages with duplicate meta descriptions and 10 pages missing title tags. Duplicate meta descriptions can dilute the uniqueness of a page, while missing title tags can lead to default titles, both negatively impacting search engine rankings and user engagement.\n\n### Combined Impact\n\nThe combination of structured markup errors and meta description issues can significantly degrade SEO performance. Errors in structured data can lead to improper indexing and display, while meta description issues can affect click-through rates and perceived relevance. Both factors contribute to a lower quality score in search engine algorithms, potentially reducing organic traffic and search engine visibility.\n\n![Structured markup errors and meta description issues can lead to improper indexing, reduced click-through rates, and lower search engine rankings.](image8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStructured markup errors and meta description issues are critical for SEO performance.

The word \"GESTALT\" is designed using various shapes and patterns that illustrate several Gestalt principles, such as proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure.\n\n1. **Proximity** [1]: The letters are grouped together in a way that visually connects them, making it clear they form a single word. This is evident in the design where the shapes are arranged closely to each other, emphasizing their connection.\n\n2. **Similarity** [10]: The design uses different shapes and colors, but the consistent use of geometric patterns within each letter creates a sense of unity. For example, the \"G\" and \"S\" both use grid patterns, while the \"E\" and \"T\" use diagonal lines, showing similarity in their design approach.\n\n3. **Continuity** [3]: The lines and shapes within the letters guide the viewer's eye smoothly from one part of the word to another, creating a continuous flow. This is seen in the way the lines in the \"E\" and \"T\" extend and connect seamlessly.\n\n4. **Closure** [11]: The incomplete shapes within the letters suggest a whole, allowing the viewer to mentally fill in the gaps. For instance, the \"A\" and \"L\" are not fully enclosed but are perceived as complete due to the viewer's tendency to close the gaps.\n\n5. **Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception** [2, 5, 9]: The overall design adheres to the Gestalt principles by creating a coherent and meaningful whole from individual parts. The patterns and shapes are arranged to form a recognizable word, demonstrating how the mind organizes visual information into a unified perception.\n\nThe image of the word \"GESTALT\" illustrates these principles effectively, showing how proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure work together to create a cohesive and meaningful visual experience.\n\n![The word \"GESTALT\" is designed using various shapes and patterns, illustrating Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure.](image2)\n\nThe principles of Gestalt psychology are manifested in the design of the word \"GESTALT\" through the use of proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure, creating a cohesive and meaningful visual experience."}

This stage is crucial for genetic diversity.\n- **Metaphase I:** Homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, as depicted in image4. The spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of homologous chromosomes.\n- **Anaphase I:** Homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, reducing the chromosome number by half. This is shown in image5.\n- **Telophase I and Cytokinesis:** The cell divides into two haploid daughter cells, each with a single set of chromosomes. Image2 illustrates the cleavage furrow forming, leading to the separation of sister chromatids and the formation of haploid daughter cells.\n\n**Meiosis II:**\n\n- **Prophase II:** Chromosomes condense again, and the nuclear envelope breaks down, similar to mitosis.\n- **Metaphase II:** Sister chromatids align at the metaphase plate, as shown in image6.\n- **Anaphase II:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles, as depicted in image6. This results in the formation of four haploid cells, each with a single set of chromosomes.\n- **Telophase II and Cytokinesis:** The cell divides again, resulting in four genetically unique haploid cells. Image6 shows the final stages of telophase II and the formation of tetrads.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- **Chromosome Separation:** In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, while in meiosis II, sister chromatids separate.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis I results in two haploid cells, while meiosis II results in four haploid cells.\n\n![Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate](image5)\n![Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate](image6)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMeiosis I involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half, while meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, resulting in four haploid cells.

Reporting is **descriptive** and **backward-looking**, focusing on summarizing historical data into information through reports, dashboards, and alerts. It answers the question \"What?\" by providing a snapshot of past events without context. This step is crucial for establishing a baseline understanding of what has happened, which is essential for further analysis. Image4 highlights the difference between reporting and analysis, emphasizing that reporting lacks context and is primarily about raising questions rather than answering them.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAnalysis builds upon reporting by transforming information into insights. It is **prescriptive** and **forward-looking**, aiming to answer the question \"Why?\" through data and information. Analysis involves finding patterns, identifying causes, and making recommendations, as shown in image4. This step is critical for understanding the underlying reasons behind observed data trends and for predicting future outcomes. It bridges the gap between what has happened and what could happen, providing actionable insights that drive decision-making.\n\n### Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) focuses on reporting and descriptive analytics, providing historical data and current metrics. It helps organizations understand their current state and identify trends. Image7 illustrates this progression, showing how BI starts with standard reports and ad-hoc reports, moving up to alerts and query drilldowns, which are more analytical in nature. BI is about answering \"What happened?\" and \"How many, how often, where?\"\n\nBusiness analytics, on the other hand, extends beyond BI by incorporating predictive and prescriptive analytics. It involves forecasting, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, aiming to answer \"What will happen?\" and \"What's the best that can happen?\" This progression is depicted in image7, where analytics moves from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive, enabling organizations to anticipate future trends and optimize outcomes.\n\n### Integration and Impact\n\nThe integration of reporting and analysis is vital for a comprehensive analytics strategy. Reporting provides the necessary data foundation, while analysis transforms this data into actionable insights. Together, they enable organizations to move from merely understanding past events to making informed decisions about future actions.

When enjoyment drops we should switch to another choice.\"\n   - [10] \"improvement only minimal even for highly motivated subjects. Hence mere repetition of an activity will not automatically lead to improvement.\"\n   - These quotes suggest that in standard consumption, as more units of a good (e.g., hot dogs) are consumed, the additional satisfaction (utility) from each subsequent unit decreases. This is because the initial units provide more pleasure than the later ones, leading to a natural preference for variety to maintain enjoyment.\n\n2. **Diminishing Marginal Utility in Competitive Contexts**:\n   - [9] \"In competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be good...\"\n   - [11] \"Focused practice may result in increased utility due to 1.

The initial decrease in enjoyment might be offset by the long-term benefits of skill improvement and better outcomes, which can enhance overall satisfaction.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Image1**: Shows a table illustrating diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption. The utility from each hot dog decreases as more are consumed, reaching negative utility beyond a certain point.\n- **Image8**: Another table showing diminishing marginal utility, but with a different utility scale, emphasizing the point where utility becomes negative.\n\n### Interleaved Answer:\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility is evident in both standard consumption and competitive contexts, but the implications differ. In standard consumption, as illustrated by the hot dog consumption tables in **image1** and **image8**, the utility from each additional hot dog decreases, leading to a point where consuming more results in negative utility. This aligns with [2], suggesting that variety is necessary to maintain enjoyment.\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the focus on repetitive practice, as highlighted in [9] and [11], can lead to increased utility over time. The initial decrease in enjoyment is offset by the accumulation of skills and improved outcomes, which can enhance overall satisfaction. This is akin to the competitive hot dog consumption scenario in **image1**, where the"}

This involves identifying and prioritizing requirements, exploring the scope, and aligning the project with the enterprise direction. According to [7], Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is a process decision framework that emphasizes understanding the range of strategies available and when they are best applied. This aligns with the **Inception** phase in image7, where \"Explore initial scope\" is highlighted as a key activity. This phase ensures that the project starts with a clear understanding of stakeholder needs, setting the foundation for subsequent phases.\n\n**Elicitation Methods** are techniques used to gather and document requirements from stakeholders. These methods can include active stakeholder participation, just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, and iteration demos, as shown in image4. These methods facilitate continuous interaction with stakeholders, ensuring that their needs are captured and addressed throughout the project lifecycle. Image4 illustrates how these methods are integrated into the process to address changing stakeholder needs, emphasizing the importance of active stakeholder participation and continuous feedback.\n\n### Interleaved Answer\n\nIn agile project management, **Needs Exploration** and **Elicitation Methods** are pivotal in addressing stakeholder needs.

The nucleoli are visible, and chromosomes are not condensed. This phase is crucial for cell growth and preparation for DNA replication.\n2. **S Phase (Synthesis)**: Chromosomes duplicate, resulting in two sister chromatids for each chromosome. This duplication occurs in the nucleus, and the nucleoli are still visible.\n3. **G2 Phase (Gap 2)**: The cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis. The chromosomes are highly compact, and the nucleoli are no longer visible.\n\n### Mitotic Phase (M Phase)\nThe Mitotic Phase is further divided into two main processes:\n1. **Mitosis**: This involves the division of the nucleus. It includes several stages (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase) where chromosomes are separated and distributed to two daughter nuclei.\n2. **Cytokinesis**: This is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two separate daughter cells.

This could be due to varying definitions of lead quality or sales team thresholds.\n- **Data Source Differences**: Image4 might represent a specific campaign or period"}
