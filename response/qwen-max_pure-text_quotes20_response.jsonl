According to the survey results [7]:\n- Both parties are rated equally at 50% for having good policy ideas.\n- The Democratic Party is rated slightly higher at 42% for having high ethical standards compared to the Republican Party at 41%.\n\nCombining these, the Democratic Party has a total of 92% (50% + 42%) for good policy ideas and high ethical standards, while the Republican Party has a total of 91% (50% + 41%). Therefore, the Democratic Party has the highest total percentage.\n\nNext, we need to find the percentage of Democrats who followed the news about congressional elections very closely. From the text quotes, we see:\n- Identical shares of Republicans and Republican leaners and Democrats and Democratic leaners (52% each) say they have been following news about the upcoming elections very or fairly closely [10].\n\nHowever, to specifically find the percentage of those following the news very closely, we can refer to the image showing how closely different demographic groups follow the news [image4]. The chart indicates that:\n- Among political affiliations, Liberals follow it the most closely (62% NET), but this includes both \"very closely\" and \"fairly closely.\"\n\nSince the text quote [10] provides the combined percentage (52% very or fairly closely), and the image [image4] does not break down the \"very closely\" percentage for Democrats, we can infer that the 52% includes both \"very closely\" and \"fairly closely.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, 52% of Democrats and Democratic leaners reported following the news about congressional elections in their state very or fairly closely. \n\n![The total percentage of people following the subject closely is 50%, with 19% very closely and 31% fairly closely.](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, 52% of Democrats and Democratic leaners reported following the news about congressional elections in their state very or fairly closely."}

According to the text, Cuban voters are the most likely among the Hispanic groups to vote for the Republican candidate. Specifically, [3] states that \"About a quarter of Cuban voters say Trump should run for president in 2024,\" and [8] indicates that \"Cuban registered voters are more likely than Latino registered voters overall (25%) to say Trump should remain a major national political figure.\"\n\nThe image data further supports this. `![Latino registered voters' preferences for Democratic and Republican candidates, with Cuban voters showing the highest preference for Republican candidates](image3)` shows that Cuban voters have the highest percentage (55%) of support for the Republican candidate, compared to other Hispanic groups.\n\nNext, let's consider the support for Trump running for president in 2024. The text quote [8] specifies that \"Cuban registered voters are more likely than Latino registered voters overall (25%) to say Trump should remain a major national political figure. Relatively few Latino voters who are Mexican (23%) or Puerto Rican (21%) say they want Trump to remain a major national figure, with only 15% of Mexicans and 13% of Puerto Ricans saying they want Trump to run for president again.\"\n\nTherefore, based on both the text and image evidence, Cuban voters are the most likely Hispanic origin group to vote for the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and to say Trump should run for president in 2024."}

In January 2018, 46% of the public expressed at least some confidence, which rose to 53% by May 2018 [6]. This suggests that there is a mixed but slightly positive trend in public perception regarding his economic decisions.

Only 15% of conservative Republicans express negative views of the ethical standards of Trump administration officials, while 36% of moderate and liberal Republicans have a less favorable view [5]. This indicates a significant divide within the Republican party itself. The overall public perception is also critical, with only 41% of Americans saying the GOP has high ethical standards, and 42% saying the same about the Democratic Party [1].\n\nThe image provides a detailed breakdown of these perceptions.

However, 45% of Republicans have mixed feelings, indicating some reservations. The image further supports this, showing that 38% of Republicans like the way Trump conducts himself, 45% have mixed feelings, and 16% do not like it `![Bar chart showing 38% of Republicans like, 45% have mixed feelings, and 16% do not like Trump's conduct](image4)`.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats are much more critical. 85% of Democrats say they do not like the way Trump conducts himself in office, and 86% rate the ethical standards of the administration negatively [3][9].

Republicans generally have a more positive view of both his economic policies and ethical standards, whereas Democrats are highly critical of both. \n\nThus, views on Trump's handling of economic policy are more positive among Republicans compared to their perceptions of his ethical standards, which are more polarized and critical, especially among Democrats."}

The public's perception of the administration's ethical standards, which is significantly lower than that of past administrations, aligns with the broader disapproval of Trump's leadership.

By comparison, only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) say this [9].\n\nAdditionally, there are significant differences in views of Trump by education level.

For example, the overall balance of opinion among independents is far more negative than positive: Two-thirds (65%) say the administration’s ethical standards are “not good” or “poor,” while 31% say they are “excellent” or “good.” Among independents who lean toward the GOP, 67% say the administration’s ethical standards are excellent or good, while nearly nine-in-ten independents who lean toward the Democratic Party (88%) rate the standards as not good or poor [7].\n\nIn summary, higher educational levels and political affiliations, particularly being an independent, lead to more critical views of ethical standards and lower approval ratings of Trump."}

The high percentage of 87% of Clinton voters who were surprised by the outcome underscores the unexpected nature of Trump's victory [2].\n\n![{Emotions among voters include 51% feeling hopeful, 36% feeling proud, 53% feeling uneasy, 41% feeling sad, 41% feeling scared, and 31% feeling angry.}](image5)\n\nThese reactions reveal that both sets of voters had different expectations. For Trump voters, while many were optimistic, a significant portion still did not anticipate his win. For Clinton voters, the overwhelming shock and disappointment indicate that they were confident in her victory and unprepared for the outcome. This disparity in expectations highlights the surprising nature of the election results and the emotional impact it had on both sides."}

Democrats, for example, are now the only group where a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well, down from 85% in January [5].

Similarly, a majority of independents who do not lean toward a party (70%) share this view [3]. In contrast, among Republicans, 63% say the U.S. economic system is fair to most Americans, while only 29% say it unfairly favors powerful interests [12].

According to the text, the share of independents who view both parties negatively has declined in recent years. At one point in 2015, more than a third of independents (36%) viewed both parties unfavorably [8]. This indicates that while there was a peak in negative sentiment, it has since decreased.\n\nHowever, when we break down the independents into subgroups, we see different patterns. For example, independents who do not lean toward a party are most likely to have an unfavorable opinion of both parties (37%) [4]. Another 22% have favorable opinions of both parties, and just 11% of independents who do not lean to a party view the Democratic Party favorably, while about as many (9%) have a favorable view of the GOP [4].\n\nFor those who lean toward a party, the trends are more aligned with the partisans. Majorities of Republican and Democratic leaners have a favorable opinion of their own party and are almost as likely as Republican and Democratic identifiers to have an unfavorable opinion of the opposing party [1]. Specifically, 81% of Republican-leaning independents view the Democratic Party unfavorably, and 84% of Democratic-leaning independents view the GOP unfavorably [2].\n\nThe intensity of these unfavorable views has also increased. The share of Democratic-leaning independents with a very unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party has more than quadrupled between 1994 and 2018 (from 8% to 37%).

However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, with a more modest decline among Democrats [12]. This trend is clearly depicted in `![{The graph provides a visual comparison of the two groups over the specified years.}](image3)`.\n\nIn Germany, partisan gaps are also evident. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are generally in favor of defense spending increases, with 51% supporting such increases. Members of the SPD fall in the middle, with 41% saying Germany should increase defense spending, while supporters of the Greens express more skepticism, with only 28% wanting to raise defense spending [1]. This data is visually summarized in `![{The chart is likely used to represent poll results, seats in a parliament, or other similar data related to these political parties.}](image8)`.\n\nIn summary, both American and German views on national defense spending have shifted from 2017 to 2019, with a general trend towards maintaining current spending levels. Partisan differences within each country show that support for increased defense spending is higher among conservatives in both nations, though the gap has narrowed in the U.S."}

According to the data, roughly six-in-ten of these younger Germans believe that U.S. military bases do not contribute to German national security [10]. In contrast, older Germans, specifically those 65 and older, are more inclined to see the bases as important, with 61% believing they are crucial to Germany’s defense [10]. This trend is visually represented in the bar chart, which shows a clear shift in opinion based on age: `![{Older age groups in Germany tend to consider the topic more important than the younger age groups.}](image8)`.\n\nIn the U.S., political affiliations play a significant role in shaping views on foreign policy partners and the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have a stronger preference for Israel as a foreign policy partner (26%) compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (9%) [9]. However, both parties generally agree on the UK being the most important partner. The preferences of each party are further detailed in the bar charts, which show that Republicans/Lean Republicans favor the UK (41%), Israel (26%), and China (20%), while Democrats/Lean Democrats prefer the UK (35%), China (25%), and Canada (23%) [12]. `![{The image contains two bar charts comparing the preferences of Republican/Lean Republican and Democrat/Lean Democrat respondents towards certain countries.}](image1)`\n\nRegarding the U.S. military presence in Germany, there is a strong bipartisan agreement among Americans on its importance. A substantial 85% of Americans believe that U.S. military bases in Germany are important to the security interests of the United States, with nearly six-in-ten seeing them as very important [8]. This is supported by the bar chart, which illustrates that a higher percentage of U.S. respondents view the subject as \"Very important\" (56%) compared to German respondents, who are more divided [8]. `![{A higher percentage of U.S. respondents view the subject as \"Very important\" compared to German respondents, who tend to view it as less important overall.}](image3)`\n\nIn summary, younger Germans are more skeptical about the importance of U.S. military bases, while older Germans see them as more critical.

About three-quarters of Republicans want the U.S. to deal with its own problems and let other countries manage as best they can, with similar shares of conservatives and moderates/liberals within the Republican party taking this view [3]. In contrast, more than half of Democrats (53%) say the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, while 46% say the U.S. should deal with its own problems [12].\n\n![This image is a line graph showing data from 2013 to 2020.

The orange line in the line graph, representing the view that the U.S. does \"Too much,\" starts at 52% in 2013 and rises to 62% in 2020. Conversely, the green line, representing the view that the U.S. does \"Too little,\" begins at 19% in 2013 and drops to 8% in 2020. The purple line, representing the view that the U.S. does the \"Right amount,\" starts at 25% in 2013, peaks at 37% in 2018, and then declines to 29% in 2020 [7].\n\nThese changes reflect a growing sentiment among Republicans that the U.S. is doing too much, while the proportion of Democrats who feel the U.S. is doing too little has remained relatively stable. The partisan gap in these views was far less pronounced in previous years, as noted in the text [5].\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely to believe the U.S. does too much to help solve world problems and should focus on its own issues, while Democrats are more likely to think the U.S. does too little and should help other countries. These perceptions have become more polarized over time, with a significant increase in the number of Republicans who think the U.S. does too much."}

For example, the percentage of Americans who see cyberattacks from China as a very serious problem increased from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021, and the percentage concerned about China’s policies on human rights rose from 43% to 50% over the same period. ![Cyberattacks from China increased from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021, and human rights policies from 43% to 50%](image2)\n\nMoreover, there is a significant partisan divide on many of these issues. Republicans are more likely to view China as an enemy and to support getting tougher on China economically. For example, 72% of Republicans think it is important to get tougher on China rather than building a strong economic relationship, compared to only 37% of Democrats, a 35% difference [image1]. This indicates a broader trend where Republicans are more critical of China across various dimensions.\n\nOverall, the key concerns of Americans regarding China have intensified over the past year, with a particular focus on cyber security, economic impact, military power, and human rights. The increasing concern is reflected in both the overall public sentiment and the specific issues that have gained more attention."}

For example, 87% of college graduates aged 65 and older go online, and 76% have a broadband connection at home, compared to only 40% of those with a high school education or less, with 27% having a broadband connection [8][6]. The table in `![{Total for all 65+: Go online: 59%, Broadband at home: 47%}](image6)` provides a detailed breakdown, reinforcing this pattern.\n\nIncome is another critical factor. Higher-income seniors are more likely to be internet and broadband users. For example, 90% of seniors with a household income of $75,000 or more go online, and 82% have a broadband connection at home. In contrast, only 39% of those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 go online, and 25% have a broadband connection [8][6]. The table in `![{Total for all 65+: Go online: 59%, Broadband at home: 47%}](image6)` clearly illustrates these differences.\n\nWhen comparing these rates with the general adult population, it is evident that while adoption rates among seniors are increasing, they still lag behind the national average. As of 2013, 59% of seniors report using the internet, compared to 86% of all U.S. adults [1]. Similarly, broadband adoption among seniors has more than doubled over a five-year period, from 19% in May 2008 to 47% in 2013, but this is still well below the national average [10]. The line graph in `![{The darker line represents \"All Adults 18+\" and shows an increase from around 50 in 2000 to 86 in 2013. The lighter line represents \"65+\" and shows an increase from about 14 in 2000 to 59 in 2013.}](image5)` visually depicts the growing trend but highlights the persistent gap between the two groups.\n\nIn summary, internet and broadband adoption rates among older adults vary significantly based on age, education, and income, with younger, more educated, and higher-income seniors adopting these technologies at rates closer to, or even exceeding, the general population. However, overall, adoption rates among seniors remain lower than the national average."}

This 22-percentage-point difference is the largest among the four scenarios, indicating a significant gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness. The public's skepticism about the fairness of this system is further highlighted by the fact that 68% find the use of personal finance scores unacceptable, with concerns about privacy and accuracy being prominent [6][image6].\n\nSimilarly, the automated video analysis of job interviews is viewed as 39% effective but only 33% fair [9][image8]. A large majority (67%) find this system unacceptable, with many expressing concerns about the removal of the human element from important decisions and the inability of these systems to capture the nuance of complex situations [7][image5].\n\nThe automated resume screening of job applicants is seen as 47% effective and 43% fair, with a smaller gap of 4 percentage points [image8]. Despite this, 57% of the public still finds it unacceptable, with the top concern being the removal of the human element from the hiring process [7][image2].\n\nIn contrast, the automated scoring of people up for parole is perceived as 49% effective and 50% fair, with a slight difference of -1 percentage point [image8]. While 56% find it unacceptable, there is more balanced support for its use, with some believing it could be more fair and unbiased than human judgment [7][image7].\n\nThese differences in perceptions suggest that public trust in these systems is heavily influenced by the context in which they are used. For example, while the public may see some potential in the effectiveness of these systems, their concerns about fairness, privacy, and the removal of human judgment often outweigh these benefits. The larger the gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness, the lower the public trust and acceptance of the system.\n\nIn summary, the differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems imply that public trust is higher when there is a closer alignment between these two factors, and lower when there is a significant gap, particularly if the system is seen as unfair."}

This indicates that while support is generally high, it varies significantly within the Democratic Party based on race and ethnicity.\n\n![Support for requiring government-issued photo identification to vote varies by racial and ethnic groups, with higher support among non-White Democrats.](image4)\n\nThe image further illustrates this point, showing that 54% of White Democrats, 65% of Black Democrats, 72% of Hispanic Democrats, and 71% of Asian Democrats support the requirement. The asterisk next to \"Asian\" might indicate a note or clarification about the data or categorization, but the overall trend is clear: non-White Democrats are more supportive of this policy.\n\n### Support for Photo ID Requirements by Political Affiliation\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, overwhelmingly support the requirement. The text states that 93% of Republicans support this policy, and 81% strongly favor it, compared to only 30% of Democrats who strongly favor it [11]. This shows a significant partisan divide, with Republicans being much more likely to strongly favor photo ID requirements.\n\n![Approval, disapproval, and uncertainty ratings for requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, with Republicans showing higher approval.](image2)\n\nThe bar chart in the image shows that 38% of the total population approve of the requirement, with 13% disapproving and 38% not sure. Among Republicans and those leaning Republican, 38% approve, 19% disapprove, and 42% are not sure. In contrast, 59% of Democrats and those leaning Democrat approve, 8% disapprove, and 32% are not sure. This aligns with the text, showing that while majorities in both parties support the policy, the intensity of support is much higher among Republicans.\n\n### Overall Public Opinion\n\nOverall, the text indicates that 76% of adults strongly or somewhat favor requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote [6]. This broad support is consistent across the board, although the intensity and specific levels of support vary by race and political affiliation.\n\n![Public opinion on various voting-related policies, including requiring government-issued photo identification, with strong support across different racial groups.](image8)\n\nThe chart in the image shows that 76% of the total population supports requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification, with varying levels of support among different racial groups. This visual representation reinforces the text's findings, showing that while there is broad support, the specific levels of support differ.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while there is broad support for requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, the level of support varies significantly by race and political affiliation. Non-White Democrats are more supportive of this requirement than White Democrats, and Republicans, especially, strongly favor this policy."}

Some 71% say the Democratic Party works hard for Latinos’ votes, 63% say it “really cares about Latinos,” and 60% say the Democratic Party represents the interests of people like themselves [9]. In contrast, fewer Latinos have positive views of the Republican Party, though a somewhat greater share (45%) say that the GOP “works hard to earn the votes of Latinos” [9].\n\nThese findings suggest that the Democratic Party is perceived more favorably by a larger portion of the Latino community, particularly among certain demographic groups. The Republican Party, on the other hand, is seen as less engaged in earning Latino votes, which may contribute to the lower levels of support among this group. This disparity in perceptions highlights the challenges and opportunities for both parties in terms of outreach and engagement with the Latino electorate. \n\nIn conclusion, the differing perceptions of political parties' efforts to earn Latino votes among various demographic groups suggest that the Democratic Party is generally viewed more positively, while the Republican Party faces significant challenges in gaining the trust and support of the Latino community."}

According to the data, a substantial minority of Hispanic partisans have at least a somewhat favorable view of the opposing party on several measures, though there are sharp differences by party affiliation [3]. For instance, 36% of Latino Republicans and GOP leaners say \"the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos\" describes their views at least somewhat well, while 21% of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same about the Republican Party [9]. This indicates that while there is some cross-party acknowledgment, it is more pronounced among Latino Republicans.\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to working hard to earn Latino votes, 56% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latinos’ votes, compared to 35% of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners who believe the same about the Republican Party [12]. This suggests that Latino Republicans are more likely to recognize the Democratic Party's efforts, while Latino Democrats are less likely to see the Republican Party in the same light.\n\n![The image shows survey results comparing perceptions of the Democratic and Republican parties regarding their relationship with Latino voters, including how well they work to earn Latino votes and care about Latinos.](image4)\n\nThe chart in image4 provides a detailed breakdown of these perceptions. It shows that 78% of Democrats and Democratic leaners believe the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, while only 36% of Republicans and Republican leaners feel the same way. Conversely, 68% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe the Republican Party really cares about Latinos, while only 21% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree. Similarly, 81% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latinos' votes, whereas 56% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe the Republican Party does the same.\n\nNow, let's examine how these perceptions have been reflected in party affiliation trends over recent years. The line graph in image1 shows the percentage of Latino registered voters identifying with or leaning toward each party from 2019 to 2022. The Democratic Party has consistently maintained a higher percentage, starting at 62% in 2019, rising to 66% in 2021, and then slightly decreasing to 64% in 2022. The Republican Party, on the other hand, started at 34% in 2019, decreased to 31% in 2021, and then increased to 33% in 2022 [2].\n\n![The image is a line graph comparing the percentages of Latino registered voters identifying with or leaning toward the Democratic and Republican parties over the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.](image1)\n\nThese trends suggest that while there has been some fluctuation, the Democratic Party has generally maintained a strong lead in Latino voter identification. Despite some recognition of the Republican Party's efforts, the overall trend indicates that Latino voters continue to align more with the Democratic Party. This is further supported by the fact that Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) [2].\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some positive perceptions of the opposing party among Latino partisans, the overall trend in party affiliation remains strongly in favor of the Democratic Party, with little change in recent years."}

Specifically, 36% say there is a fair amount of difference, and 16% say there is hardly any difference at all, while 45% see a great deal of difference [2]. This perception is consistent across both Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners (47%) and Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners (48%) [2].\n\nDespite these perceptions, Latino registered voters continue to identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) [4]. This party identification has remained relatively stable over the past few years, indicating that while some Latino voters may not see a large difference between the parties, their overall affiliation has not shifted significantly [7].\n\nThe stability in party affiliation can be further understood by examining the perceived efforts and care of the parties towards Latino voters. The survey results show that a higher percentage of Latino voters believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latinos' votes and really cares about Latinos compared to the Republican Party.

The Republican Party's support, on the other hand, started at 34% in 2019, decreased to 31% in 2021, and then slightly increased to 33% in 2022 [image4].\n\nThese trends suggest that while there is a segment of Latino voters who do not see a significant difference between the parties, the majority still lean towards the Democratic Party. This could be due to the perceived efforts and care of the Democratic Party towards Latino voters, as well as historical and cultural affiliations.\n\nIn conclusion, the views of Latino voters regarding the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties have shown a mix of perceptions, but their party affiliation remains largely with the Democratic Party, influenced by the perceived efforts and care of the parties.

According to the text, STEM workers are more likely to have higher levels of education. Specifically, 65% of STEM workers have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to 32% of non-STEM workers [6]. Additionally, 29% of STEM workers have a master’s, doctorate, or professional degree, which is significantly higher than the 12% of non-STEM workers with advanced degrees [6].\n\n![{The chart indicates that STEM professions generally have a higher percentage of individuals with bachelor's and postgraduate degrees compared to non-STEM professions, which have more individuals with high school or less education.}](image6)\n\nThis educational advantage translates into different employment sectors.

Specifically, 27% of those who do not identify as Hispanic have a mixed background or feel their Hispanic ancestry is too distant, while 16% attribute it to their upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives. Additionally, 15% do not speak Spanish or have no link to Hispanic culture, 12% do not look Hispanic or identify as another race, and 9% were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American. `![Reasons for not identifying as Hispanic](image3)`\n\nAnother significant factor is the importance of having a Spanish last name. While 84% of self-identified Hispanics say it is not necessary, the data shows that only 15% of self-identified Hispanics actually have a Spanish last name, and this percentage decreases with each generation [2]. `![Comparison of speaking Spanish and having a Spanish last name among self-identified Hispanics](image1)`\n\nThe generational differences in self-identification are also evident in how individuals view themselves as typical Americans.

This indicates that unemployment is a significant issue in both regions, but there is no significant difference in the level of concern between GCC and Non-GCC countries.\n\nFurthermore, the image `![Unemployment has been a consistent concern, with 2014 showing the highest level of concern.](image8)` shows that unemployment has also been a consistent concern, with 2014 showing the highest level of concern at 49%.\n\nIn summary, both the rising cost of living and unemployment are major concerns in both GCC and Non-GGC countries. The rising cost of living is a more pervasive issue, with a higher percentage of people being very concerned, while unemployment is a significant concern with similar levels of concern in both regions. This reveals that both issues are regional priorities, but the rising cost of living is slightly more pressing."}

According to the data, Mountain View and Palo Alto have seen significant increases in population and job growth, which directly impacts the demand for public transportation. For instance, Mountain View has experienced a 16% increase in ridership from 2012 to 2014, while Palo Alto University has seen a 38% increase [5]. \n\n![The table contains data for two entities, \"Palo Alto University\" and \"Mountain View,\" showing significant increases in ridership over the years.](image5)\n\nThis growth is reflected in the crowded conditions on the trains. The image of the interior of a train shows many passengers seated and standing, indicating that seating is limited and the train is at or near capacity [2].\n\n![The image shows the interior of a crowded train or bus with many passengers seated and standing in the aisle, indicating a \"standing room only\" situation.](image2)\n\nAdditionally, the high frequency and reliability of services, such as Caltrain, are leading to stress at intersections and at-grade crossings. There are 40 at-grade crossings remaining, which can cause delays and further exacerbate the capacity issues [3].\n\nTo accommodate the growing demand, there is a need to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade [10]. This underscores the urgency to address the current capacity issues and improve the infrastructure to support the increasing number of riders.\n\nThe increase in weekday ridership growth in Mountain View and Palo Alto is directly related to the current capacity issues on trains, as the existing infrastructure struggles to handle the higher demand."}

The energy consumption in terms of kilograms of oil equivalent per capita is a good indicator of this. According to the bar chart, the USA has the highest energy consumption per capita at 8080 kg of oil equivalent [image6]. Germany follows with 4017 kg of oil equivalent, and China is significantly lower at 597 kg of oil equivalent. This suggests that the USA has a much higher per capita CO2 emission compared to Germany and China.\n\nNext, let's consider motor vehicle ownership. The bubble chart provides a visual representation of the motor vehicles per 1,000 people and the percent share in global motor vehicle demand [image3]. The United States has the largest bubble, indicating a significant share of global motor vehicle demand and a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. Germany also has a moderate share and a relatively high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. In contrast, China has a large share in global demand but a lower number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people.\n\nCombining these insights, the USA has both high CO2 emissions per capita and a high rate of motor vehicle ownership. This implies that the environmental impact from transportation and overall energy use is likely to be more significant in the USA. Germany, while having a higher motor vehicle ownership and CO2 emissions per capita than China, still has a lower environmental impact compared to the USA. China, despite its large share in global motor vehicle demand, has a lower number of vehicles per 1,000 people and significantly lower CO2 emissions per capita, suggesting a lower environmental impact from these factors.\n\nIn summary, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, implying a greater environmental impact, while Germany has a moderate impact, and China has the lowest impact among the three countries."}

This indicates that while mobile phones are prevalent, they are more frequently used within the household rather than outside.\n\n### Radio Listening Habits\n\n#### Overall Frequency\nOverall, 46% of respondents never listen to the radio, 27% listen every day, 19% a few times a week, and 7% a few times a month [image5]. \n\n#### Urban vs. Rural\n- In rural areas, 27.4% listen every day, 19.3% a few times a week, 6.7% a few times a month, and 46.3% never.\n- In urban areas, 28.0% listen every day, 18.7% a few times a week, 6.7% a few times a month, and 46.7% never.\n\n#### Gender-Based\n- For females, 55.7% never listen, 20% listen every day, 17.9% a few times a week, and 6.1% a few times a month.\n- For males, 37.1% never listen, 34.3% listen every day, 20.6% a few times a week, and 7.8% a few times a month.\n\n### Devices Used for Listening to the Radio\n\n- Overall, 76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, and 40% use a mobile phone [image4].\n- In rural areas, 77% use a radio and 39% use a mobile phone.\n- In urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone and 49% use a radio.\n- For males, 75% listen via radio and 43% use a mobile phone.\n- For females, 77% use a radio and 36% use a mobile phone.\n\n### Types of Programs Listened To\n\n- 82% listened to News\n- 58% listened to Music\n- 25% listened to Folk Music\n- 13% listened to Sajha Sawal\n- 10% listened to Religious programs\n- 5% listened to SSMK\n- 2% listened to Phone-in programs\n- 1% listened to BBC Nepali [image6]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data shows that while mobile phones are the most commonly owned and used devices within the household, they are less frequently used outside the home. Radios, though less prevalent, are still a significant source of information and entertainment, particularly in rural areas and among females. The primary reasons for not listening to the radio include lack of time, affordability, and interest in the content. \n\n![68% do not use any of these technologies outside of home, 20% use a mobile phone, 11% use television, 4% use a computer, and 4% use the internet.](image7) \n![76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, and 40% use a mobile phone.](image4)\n\nIn summary, there is a notable difference in technology usage within and outside the household, with mobile phones being the most common device inside the home but less frequently used outside. Radio listening habits vary by location and gender, with a higher prevalence in rural areas and among females."}

The data also indicates that 83% of the respondents were from rural areas, and 17% were from urban areas, which provides context for the media consumption patterns [4].\n\nThe image data provides more specific insights. Image4 shows the percentage of people consuming different types of media, with 32% of the group consuming media via television and 7% via the internet [![46% of the group consume media via radio, 32% via TV, 9% via newspapers, and 7% via online.](image4)].

The association of the sample by rural and urban settlement reflects the actual national figures from the 2011 census [10]. This is further corroborated by the image quote which shows no change in the percentage distribution over time: `![The table shows no change in rural and urban population percentages between the initial period and September 2014](image8)`.

For voice and SMS, there is a gradual decline, while mobile data initially declines but then starts to increase towards 2017 [1].\n\n![Voice and SMS ARPU show a declining trend, while Mobile Data ARPU initially declines and then increases.](image1)\n\nThe bar chart comparing the prepaid ARPU for different telecom companies, including Telkomsel and XL, shows a decline from 2008 to 2012. For Telkomsel, the ARPU dropped from 53 in 2008 to 34 in 2012, and for XL, it dropped from 35 in 2008 to 31 in 2012 [2].\n\n![Telkomsel's prepaid ARPU dropped from 53 in 2008 to 34 in 2012, and XL's prepaid ARPU dropped from 35 in 2008 to 31 in 2012.](image2)\n\nSeveral factors influenced these changes. One key factor is the shift in consumer behavior towards data-based services such as instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP), which led to reduced usage of SMS and voice calls [4]. This shift is reflected in the continued decline in voice and SMS ARPU, as mentioned in the text [5].\n\nAdditionally, the price war initiated by the government and the competition among operators, including CDMA operators forcing GSM operators to reduce tariffs, contributed to the reduction in ARPU [8][11]. The increased usage of smartphones and data consumption, however, suggests a potential future increase in data ARPU as more users enroll in larger data plans [5].\n\nIn summary, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL was substantial, with Telkomsel having more users. The ARPU trends showed a decline in voice and SMS, but an initial decline followed by an increase in mobile data ARPU. These changes were influenced by the shift towards data-based services, reduced tariffs, and increased smartphone and data usage."}

For instance, in the \"All Music\" category, streaming (SEA) accounts for 34% of the total, while physical albums (Phys Albums) account for 24%. This trend is consistent across most genres, with R&B/Hip-Hop and Latin music showing the highest percentages for streaming at 39% and 68%, respectively. Country music, on the other hand, still relies more heavily on physical albums, with 35% of its sales coming from this format, compared to 18% from streaming.\n\n![This bar chart compares music sales and consumption in 2014 and 2015, showing a significant increase in streaming.](image2)\n\nThe second image provides a year-over-year comparison, highlighting the growth in streaming.

First, the user's input is processed through a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder, which converts the natural language input into a continuous vector representation [2]. This encoding, combined with the previous system action, serves as the input to a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains the current state of the conversation [3].\n\nThe dialogue state, represented by the dialogue-level LSTM, is updated at each turn based on the user utterance and the previous system action. This state is crucial for tracking the user's goals and maintaining the context of the conversation [10]. The state tracker then updates its estimation of the user’s goal, represented by a list of slot-value pairs, and maintains a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot type [10].\n\nNext, the policy network, which is a deep neural network, takes in three inputs: the dialogue-level LSTM state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results [12]. Based on these inputs, the policy network selects the next system action, which is in the form of a dialogue act [5]. \n\nFinally, the selected system action, along with the state tracker outputs and the retrieved knowledge base (KB) entities, is used to generate the final natural language response via a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG uses a template-based approach, where delexicalised tokens in the template are replaced by the values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action [6].\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response to the user's request by processing the user input, updating the dialogue state, selecting an appropriate system action using the policy network, and generating a natural language response via the NLG.\n\n![The system processes the user input, updates the dialogue state, selects a system action, and generates a natural language response.](image6)"}

This is in contrast to existing datasets, which often have a narrow range of entity categories and lack specific entity mentions [1]. The dataset encompasses 22 major categories, including landmarks, paintings, sculptures, food, fruits, vegetables, mammals, amphibians, insects, fish, birds, reptiles, celebrities, instruments, plants, electronics, tools, transportation, sports, books, household items, and cars. This diversity ensures a comprehensive representation of real-world entities [5].\n\nSecondly, the SnapNTell dataset features a large number of unique entities. Specifically, it contains 7,568 unique entities, with 10 illustrative images and 10 knowledge-intensive QA pairs for each entity. This results in a total of 75,680 QA pairs and 75,680 images, making it one of the most extensive datasets in terms of both the number of entities and the volume of data [10]. \n\nIn terms of knowledge, the SnapNTell dataset is designed to require detailed, entity-specific knowledge in the responses. Unlike other datasets that often rely on simple yes/no answers or broad terms, SnapNTell emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses. For example, while a traditional VQA dataset might ask, \"Is the umbrella upside down?\" and receive a simple \"No\" as an answer, SnapNTell would ask, \"What is the current status of the Mendenhall Glacier?\" and expect a detailed response like, \"The Mendenhall Glacier is currently experiencing a negative glacier mass balance and will likely continue to retreat.\" [image1]\n\nMoreover, the SnapNTell dataset includes a higher degree of anonymity in its questions, meaning they do not provide explicit clues about the entity, thereby testing the model's ability to recognize and understand the entity based on the image and context alone. This is a significant departure from other datasets, which often use question templates or simpler, more direct questions [9].\n\nWhen compared to other VQA datasets, such as ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, SnapNTell surpasses them in terms of the variety of categories, the number of distinct entities, and the overall number of QA pairs. It also boasts a higher count of images and a longer average answer length, with an average answer length of 25.7 words, compared to 1.8 and 3.2 words for ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, respectively [image7].\n\nAdditionally, the SnapNTell dataset is structured to include 10 images for each entity, ensuring a rich and diverse visual representation. This is in contrast to other datasets, where the exact number of images per entity is unspecified or limited [9].\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell dataset excels in terms of categories, entities, and knowledge, offering a more comprehensive and detailed evaluation of models' abilities in recognizing and understanding fine-grained entities."}

The table in `![{The table presents results for different configurations of positional encoding in an encoder-decoder model, showing AP and ΔAP scores.}](image3)` provides detailed insights into how different types of positional encodings in the encoder and decoder impact the AP. For instance, the baseline configuration, which uses fixed sine positional encodings at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder, achieves the highest AP score. Removing spatial positional encodings entirely leads to a significant drop in AP, while passing them only in the decoder results in a minor AP drop. This suggests that spatial positional encodings are essential, especially in the encoder, but their presence in the decoder is less critical.\n\n### Loss Components\n\nThe loss components, particularly the combination of class, ℓ₁, and GIoU losses, also significantly influence the AP.

On PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST, the hard-to-contrast strategy outperforms random selection by significant margins, such as 1.8%, 2.6%, and 5.2% respectively, when querying 0.1% of the entire dataset [3]. Similarly, on CIFAR-10-LT, the hard-to-contrast strategy outperforms random selection by 21.2% and 24.1% when querying 20% and 30% of the entire dataset, respectively [3].\n\nThe importance of selecting a superior initial query is further highlighted in Figure 5, where hard-to-contrast data (red lines) outperform other initial queries in every cycle of active learning on OrganAMNIST. The performance of the initial cycle (20 images) and the last cycle (50 images) are strongly correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.79 to 0.92, depending on the selection strategy [5] [![The image shows a series of graphs demonstrating the impact of label diversity on the performance of different active querying strategies across three datasets within MedMNIST. The red dots generally lie above the gray dots, suggesting that incorporating label diversity results in higher AUC scores.](image5)].\n\nAdditionally, the hard-to-contrast strategy is practical for addressing the cold start problem because it does not require ground truths, unlike easy-to-learn or hard-to-learn strategies. This makes it a label-free and effective approach, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, where the hard-to-contrast strategy yields the highest performance among existing active querying strategies [3] [![The image is a bar chart comparing map-based querying strategies across four datasets. The “hard-to-contrast” strategy tends to outperform others across different datasets.](image3)].\n\nIn summary, the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy outperforms other querying strategies across different datasets and significantly influences the initial query selection, leading to better overall performance in active learning cycles."}

The left graph in the image7 shows the F1 scores for different instruction formats (I0 to I5) on the 20-shot FewNERD dataset. The performance varies across these formats, with some achieving higher scores than others. This indicates that the choice of instruction format can significantly influence the model's performance. For instance, certain instruction formats may be more effective in guiding the model to understand the task, leading to better results [7].\n\nNext, the middle graph in the same image7 illustrates how the F1 score changes with varying numbers of demonstrations. It compares ChatGPT and Codex, showing that ChatGPT generally performs better as the number of demonstrations increases. This suggests that ChatGPT benefits more from additional examples, which can help it better grasp the task requirements and context [11].\n\nThe right graph in the image7 compares F1 scores for three demo selection strategies: random sampling, sentence embedding (embed), and Efficient Prompt Retriever (EPR). The EPR strategy shows the highest performance, followed by embedding, with random sampling performing the least effectively. This highlights the importance of a well-thought-out selection strategy for demonstrations. Specifically, using EPR or sentence embeddings to select relevant and high-quality examples can significantly improve the model's performance [2].\n\n![This image presents three graphs illustrating the performance of ChatGPT and other models on the 20-shot FewNERD dataset, including the impact of instruction formats, demonstration numbers, and selection strategies.](image7)\n\nIn summary, different instruction formats and demonstration selections have a significant impact on the performance of ChatGPT and Codex on the FewNERD dataset.

According to the data, the most common reasoning steps and challenges can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Common Reasoning Steps\n\n1. **Simple Lookup (20.6%)**: This involves retrieving the value for a specific cell in the table, which is a fundamental step in many verification processes [image6].\n2. **Comparison (19.5%)**: Comparing two numbers is another frequent task, often used to verify if the claim aligns with the data presented [image6].\n3. **Closed-Domain Knowledge (12.1%)**: Extracting information from context sentences in the table caption or article, such as understanding that \"Prod.\" refers to \"Productivity\" [image6].\n4. **Open-Domain Knowledge (5.3%)**: Utilizing commonsense knowledge not presented in the table, such as the relationship between precision and recall [image6].\n5. **Commonsense Knowledge (5.3%)**: Applying general knowledge, like knowing that \"random chance\" means 50% accuracy [image6].\n\n### Challenges in Verifying Claims\n\n1. **Numerical Reasoning**: Many claims in SciTAB require numerical operations, such as subtraction, addition, and division, to verify the accuracy of the claims. For example, calculating the difference between 57.5% and 50% to determine if A’s productivity is 7.5% more than expected by random chance [image1].\n2. **Complexity of Reasoning Steps**: The dataset includes claims that demand up to 11 reasoning steps, making the verification process intricate. The histogram in [image4] shows that 20% of claims involve 5 reasoning steps, and 18% involve 4 reasoning steps.\n3. **Diverse Error Types**: Refuted claims in SciTAB exhibit a wide range of error types. The most common are incorrect calculation results (41.7%) and incorrect approximation words (33.3%) [image8].\n4. **Lack of Evidence and Knowledge**: NEI (Not Enough Information) claims often result from insufficient evidence in the table (33.3%) and the lack of necessary background knowledge (25.0% for open-domain and 15.0% for closed-domain) [image8].\n\n### Example from the Dataset\n\nFor instance, in [image1], the claim about \"A’s productivity of 57.5% expressing that it appears in 7.5% more often than expected by random chance\" is verified through a reasoning graph. The process involves:\n- Identifying that \"productivity\" corresponds to the \"Prod.\" column.\n- Using commonsense knowledge to establish that \"random chance\" means 50%.\n- Performing a simple lookup to find the value 57.5%.\n- Subtracting 50% from 57.5% to confirm the 7.5% difference.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset include simple lookups, comparisons, and the use of both closed-domain and open-domain knowledge. The primary challenges are the complexity of numerical reasoning, the need for multiple reasoning steps, and the diversity of error types, particularly those related to calculations and approximations. \n\n![The image illustrates an example from a dataset called S CI T AB, along with a reasoning graph.

There's a claim about \"A’s productivity of 57.5% expressing that it appears in 7.5% more often than expected by random chance.\" The claim is supported because the reasoning graph verifies that productivity corresponds to the Prod. column. Using commonsense and closed-domain knowledge, the graph establishes the productivity as 57.5% and random chance as 50%. Subtraction confirms the claim, leading to the conclusion that the fact checker supports the claim as valid.

Additionally, 6.7% of the refuted claims are due to wrong operation types, and 8.3% have values that do not match the evidence.

For the 2-class setting, the best result is 63.62 (Vicuna-7B), which is only moderately better than random guessing (+13.62) [2]. In the 3-class setting, the best result is 38.05 (FLAN-T5-XL), also only slightly better than random guessing (+4.72) [2]. This indicates that even the best-performing LLMs struggle significantly with the task, especially when the NEI class is included, as it diminishes the models' confidence and shifts their predictions towards NEI [5].\n\n![{The table compares the performance of various large language models across different categories on a classification task, showing zero-shot and in-context performance for 2-class and 3-class settings.}](image5)\n\nWhen examining the performance of specific models, it is noted that table-based LLMs do not outperform models pre-trained on pure text, such as FLAN-T5 [8].

For example, while Falcon performs well in single-turn conversations, it struggles with multi-turn interactions, likely due to a lack of supervised fine-tuning data for such scenarios. `![Llama 2-Chat models perform well in both single and multi-turn conversations.](image5)`\n\nThe training processes that contribute to the safety features of Llama 2-Chat include several key steps. Initially, the models undergo pretraining on a large and diverse dataset, which is then followed by supervised fine-tuning to create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat. This process is further enhanced through the use of human feedback, which helps develop both safety and helpfulness reward models. `![The training process of Llama 2-Chat involves pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with human feedback.](image6)`\n\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a critical component, using techniques like Rejection Sampling and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to iteratively refine the model. As more safety data is added, Llama 2-Chat becomes increasingly adept at recognizing and refusing to generate offensive content. For instance, with 50% of safety data, the model learns to avoid generating offensive content. `![Llama 2-Chat becomes safer with more safety data used in RLHF.](image3)`\n\nAdditionally, the iterative refinement process ensures that the reward models remain well-distributed and effective, contributing to the overall safety and helpfulness of the model. The detailed methodology and approach to improving LLM safety, as described in the paper, provide a robust framework for the community to build upon and continue enhancing the safety of these models.\n\nIn summary, the safety performance of Llama 2-Chat models is generally better than other AI models, and their training processes, particularly the use of RLHF and iterative refinement, significantly contribute to their safety features."}

According to [7], the total emissions for training the LLaMA 2 family of models are estimated to be **539 t CO2eq**. This includes the following breakdown for each model size:\n\n- **7B**: 184,320 GPU hours, 400 W, 31.22 tCO2eq\n- **13B**: 368,640 GPU hours, 400 W, 62.44 tCO2eq\n- **34B**: 1,038,336 GPU hours, 350 W, 153.90 tCO2eq\n- **70B**: 1,720,320 GPU hours, 400 W, 291.42 tCO2eq\n\nThis data is summarized in the table, which shows the cumulative GPU hours, power consumption, and carbon emissions for each model size. \n![Total carbon emissions for different LLaMA 2 model sizes](image8)\n\n### Performance\n\nIn terms of performance, LLaMA 2 has shown significant improvements over its predecessor, LLaMA 1, and competitive results compared to other models. \n\n#### Benchmarks and Metrics\n\n- **MMLU (5-shot)**: LLaMA 2 scores 68.9%, which is close to PaLM (69.3%) and slightly lower than GPT-3.5 (70.0%).\n- **TriviaQA (1-shot)**: LLaMA 2 scores 85.0%, which is competitive with PaLM-2-L (86.1%).\n- **Natural Questions (1-shot)**: LLaMA 2 scores 33.0%, which is between PaLM (29.3%) and PaLM-2-L (37.5%).\n- **GSM8K (8-shot)**: LLaMA 2 scores 56.8%, which is similar to GPT-3.5 (57.1%) and PaLM (56.5%).\n- **HumanEval (0-shot)**: LLaMA 2 scores 29.9%, which is higher than PaLM (26.2%) but lower than GPT-3.5 (48.1%).\n\nThese scores are visualized in the table, showing how LLaMA 2 compares to other models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM, and PaLM-2-L across various benchmarks.\n![Performance comparison of different language models on various benchmarks](image1)\n\nAdditionally, LLaMA 2-Chat, the fine-tuned version, demonstrates strong performance in truthfulness and toxicity. For example, the 70B model shows a significant improvement in truthfulness (50.18 → 64.14) and a dramatic reduction in toxicity (24.60 → 0.01) [1]. This makes it one of the least toxic models among those compared.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLLaMA 2 models have a notable environmental impact, with the 70B model contributing the most to carbon emissions at 291.42 tCO2eq. However, they also show competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming or being on par with other open-source and some closed-source models. The fine-tuned LLaMA 2-Chat models, in particular, excel in safety and helpfulness metrics."}

For instance, Llama 2 70B improves the results on MMLU and BBH by approximately 5 and 8 points, respectively, compared to Llama 1 65B [3]. Additionally, Llama 2 7B and 30B models outperform MPT models of the corresponding size on all categories except for code benchmarks. Llama 2 7B and 34B also outperform Falcon 7B and 40B models on all benchmark categories [3].\n\nWhen it comes to truthfulness, toxicity, and bias, fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat shows substantial improvements over the pretrained Llama 2. For example, the 70B model's truthfulness score increased from 50.18 to 64.14, and its toxicity score decreased significantly from 24.60 to 0.01, making it the least toxic among all compared models [5]. This improvement is also reflected in the sentiment analysis, where Llama 2-Chat tends to generate more positive sentiment overall for many demographic groups.\n\nOn popular aggregated benchmarks like MMLU, Big Bench Hard (BBH), and AGI Eval, Llama 2-Chat models perform well, with Llama 2-Chat 34B having an overall win rate of more than 75% against equivalently sized Vicuna-33B and Falcon 40B models [7].\n\nIn human evaluations, Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models and are on par with some closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations performed [2]. Specifically, Llama 2 70B is close to GPT-3.5 on MMLU and GSM8K but lags behind on coding benchmarks. It performs on par or better than PaLM (540B) on almost all benchmarks, though there is still a gap with GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L [11].\n\nThe specific strengths of Llama 2 models include their high performance in truthfulness, low toxicity, and strong performance on multi-turn prompts. They excel in dialogue and general knowledge tasks, as evidenced by their performance on MMLU, BBH, and AGI Eval. However, their weaknesses lie in coding benchmarks, where they lag behind models like GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L.\n\nTo visualize the training process, the graph in `![{The training loss decreases for each Llama 2 model variant as the number of processed tokens increases, indicating ongoing improvement.}](image1)` shows the training loss, measured as Train Perplexity (PPL), for the Llama 2 family of models. The graph indicates that even after pre-training on 2 trillion tokens, the models continue to improve without showing signs of saturation.\n\nIn summary, Llama 2 models, especially Llama 2-Chat, demonstrate strong performance in various benchmarks, excelling in truthfulness, low toxicity, and dialogue tasks, but they show room for improvement in coding benchmarks."}

This suggests that the model becomes better at identifying and excluding irrelevant information when more knowledge is absent. On the other hand, the recall (orange line with diamond markers) remains relatively stable, starting around 14 and ending slightly below 15, indicating that the model's ability to identify the required knowledge does not improve or deteriorate much with the removal of knowledge elements. The F1-Score (green line with triangle markers) shows a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18, reflecting a balance between precision and recall. `![The image shows the relationship between the number of knowledge elements removed and three metrics: precision, recall, and F1-Score.](image1)`\n\nWhen examining the retrieval analysis, the results show clear downward trends in all metrics as expected when retrieval accuracy drops. Among precision and recall, the impact of poor retrieval quality on recall (green) is much more significant than on precision (yellow). This indicates that the model has the ability to filter out incorrect knowledge to a certain extent, resulting in less noticeable impact on precision compared to recall. The reduction in recall was nearly linear as retrieval accuracy decreased, which is understandable since knowledge cannot be cited if it is not provided. The greatest drop in recall occurred between the ground truth (57.1) and 80% accuracy [1].\n\nFrom the table, we can see the detailed scores for different numbers of removed knowledge elements:\n- When no knowledge is removed (0, gold), the precision is 30.1, recall is 57.1, and F1-Score is 39.4.\n- When one knowledge element is removed, the precision drops to 26.1, recall to 42.5, and F1-Score to 32.3.\n- With two elements removed, the precision further drops to 21.0, recall to 31.4, and F1-Score to 25.2.\n- With three elements removed, the precision is 16.3, recall is 20.4, and F1-Score is 18.1. `![The table displays the following data across five columns: \"Removed\", \"Corr.\", \"Prec.\", \"Rec.\", and \"F1.\"](image2)`\n\nThese changes imply that the models have a limited ability to handle absent knowledge. While they can maintain some level of precision by filtering out irrelevant information, their recall suffers significantly, indicating that they struggle to identify and use the necessary knowledge when it is not available. This highlights the importance of the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, which enables LLMs to recognize the need for supporting knowledge beyond the provided KG, and the critical role of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts.\n\nIn summary, the removal of knowledge elements leads to an increase in precision but a decrease in recall, with a moderate increase in F1-Score. This indicates that while the models can filter out irrelevant information, they struggle to identify and use the necessary knowledge when it is absent."}

For instance, Llama2-13B-PT reaches 26.4% on MAVEN-ERE with CoT and logical constraints, and 13.3% on Causal-TimeBank with logical constraints.\n\nIn summary, incorporating logical constraints and increasing the number of demonstration samples generally improves the performance of models on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, with logical constraints often providing a more significant boost, especially when the number of demonstrations is limited."}

The benchmark is specifically curated to assess college-level, multi-disciplinary understanding and reasoning. It features problems sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, spanning six common disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. This comprehensive coverage ensures that the benchmark meets both the breadth and depth goals [4].\n\n![MMMUs depth and breadth are superior to other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz, as shown in a comparison graph.](image6)\n\n### Unique Features of Image Usage and Question Formats\nMMMU introduces unique challenges in image usage and question formats. The dataset includes 11,550 questions, with 30 different image types, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, and medical images [1].

Many problems require models to jointly understand the images and text, often necessitating the recall of deep subject knowledge and conducting complex reasoning based on this understanding [4]. This is illustrated by an example question asking about the etiology of a finding in the left breast using MRI images labeled as <image 1>, <image 2>, and <image 3> [5].\n\n### Comparison with Other Benchmarks\nCompared to existing benchmarks, MMMU is more challenging and comprehensive. While other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz focus on daily knowledge and common sense, MMMU covers college-level knowledge with 30 image formats, including diagrams, tables, charts, and more. Furthermore, MMMU requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge, unlike the simpler physical or temporal reasoning required by other benchmarks [5].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe MMMU benchmark surpasses other datasets in terms of reasoning depth and knowledge breadth.

For instance, previous benchmarks typically focus on daily knowledge, common sense, and simple physical or temporal reasoning [3]. In contrast, the MMMU benchmark includes tasks that necessitate nuanced perception and step-by-step reasoning, such as applying \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions. This is vividly illustrated through the tasks in the benchmark, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also require the model to use domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason [7].\n\nIn terms of **knowledge breadth**, the MMMU benchmark covers 30 different subjects and 183 subfields, spanning six broad disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. This extensive coverage ensures that the benchmark tests a wide range of expert-level domain knowledge. The prior benchmarks are often limited to daily knowledge and common sense, and their covered image formats are also more restricted [3].\n\nRegarding the **variety of image types**, the MMMU benchmark includes 30 different image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, and more. This diversity in image types challenges the models' ability to handle a wide range of visual inputs, which is crucial for testing comprehensive multimodal understanding. Other benchmarks, while covering some image types, do not match the breadth and complexity of the image formats in the MMMU benchmark [3].\n\nTo further illustrate these points, the table in `![{The table presents performance metrics of various large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs) across different validation and test sets, and specific categories/disciplines.}](image1)` shows how the MMMU benchmark evaluates models across different categories, including Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering.

Open-source models show relatively strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings, which are more frequently seen during training. However, for less common image categories such as Geometric shapes, Music sheets, and Chemical structures, all models obtain very low scores, some close to random guesses.

This involves efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images and text embeddings for quick and accurate retrieval [11]. \n\nIn the case of object detection datasets, the process begins with pre-processing the image. As described, the methodology for extracting image embeddings \\( e_{\\mathrm{img}} \\) includes two additional steps: cropping and blurring [5]. The image regions are cropped based on proposal bounding box coordinates and then resized to a fixed proportion. This helps in focusing on the objects of interest, especially when they are smaller and positioned more variedly within the image. Additionally, the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest are blurred to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, facilitating their identification [5].\n\n![The diagram illustrates how pre-processing techniques like cropping and resizing assist in zero-shot recognition for object detection tasks using multimodal retrieval methods.](image7)\n\nAfter the pre-processing, the image embeddings are used in a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search. An index is created for these embeddings, linked to a memory storage (Memory \\(\\mathcal{M}\\)). The retrieval process associates each bounding box with possible labels, such as \"flower arrangement,\" \"saltshaker,\" and \"vase\" [5].\n\nFollowing the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside the image embedding \\( e \\) are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category [7].\n\n![The pipeline aims to enhance recognition tasks by combining multi-modal data retrieval and ranking processes.](image6)\n\nThe MLLMs use advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, unlike traditional approaches that might rely solely on the initial retrieval order [4].\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by first pre-processing the image with cropping and blurring, then using a k-NN search to retrieve top-k similar results from the memory, and finally employing MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions."}

TimeQA involves more complex temporal reasoning, which is reflected in the higher error correction rate (39.9%) and the lower error introduction rate (5.6%). This indicates that the abstraction step in Step-Back Prompting is particularly effective for this type of task, as it simplifies the problem and makes it easier for the model to retrieve the right information [7].\n\nOn the other hand, StrategyQA requires multi-hop reasoning, which is a different kind of challenge. The lower error correction rate (15.4%) and slightly higher error introduction rate (6.1%) suggest that the task is more challenging in terms of reasoning, and the abstraction step may not be as effective in this context. This is further supported by the fact that reasoning errors are the dominant source of errors in both datasets, but the impact is more pronounced in TimeQA [7, 12].\n\nIn summary, the error analysis results for Step-Back + RAG differ between TimeQA and StrategyQA, with TimeQA showing a higher error correction rate and lower error introduction rate, indicating that the method is more effective for temporal reasoning tasks compared to multi-hop reasoning tasks."}

This process is illustrated in the architecture diagram, where the model retrieves additional information based on recognized entities and integrates it into the LLM [11].\n\n![The SnapNTell model architecture includes a retrieval augmentation step to enhance entity-specific information.](image2)\n\nThe inclusion of RA leads to significant improvements in both accuracy and reduction in hallucination rates, especially for long-tail entities. For head, torso, and tail categories, the accuracy increases, and the hallucination rates decrease. The most notable improvement is seen in the tail category, where the accuracy increases by 85.3% and the hallucination rate decreases by 6.2% [8].\n\n![Retrieval augmentation significantly improves accuracy and reduces hallucination rates, especially for tail entities.](image8)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of entity detection and retrieval augmentation in the SnapNTell model substantially improves its performance, leading to higher accuracy and lower hallucination rates, particularly for long-tail entities."}

Specifically, on the SnapNTell dataset, our model achieves a 66.5% improvement in the BELURT score compared to existing methods [7]. The key components that contribute to its performance include entity detection, retrieval augmentation, and the integration of multimodal data.\n\nFirst, the effectiveness of entity detection (ED) is highlighted through an ablation study, where the inclusion of ED significantly improves the model's performance across all metrics. For instance, with ED, the ROUGE score increases from 28.02 to 35.28, BLEU from 3.73 to 7.81, METEOR from 26.26 to 29.27, and BELURT from 0.45 to 0.55 [6]. This underscores the necessity of the entity detection step in enhancing the model’s overall effectiveness. \n\n![The table compares evaluation metrics for two methods, \"w/o ED\" (without ED) and \"w/ ED\" (with ED), across four metrics. The method \"w/ ED\" shows improved scores across all metrics.](image6)\n\nSecond, retrieval augmentation (RA) plays a crucial role in improving the model's performance, especially for long-tailed entities. The results show that RA significantly enhances the accuracy and reduces hallucinations. For example, the accuracy for tail entities increases from 6.8% to 12.6%, a substantial 85.3% improvement, while the hallucination rate decreases from 93.2% to 87.4% [8].\n\n![The table shows changes in accuracy and hallucination rates for different categories (Head, Torso, Tail) with and without RA. The arrows indicate the direction of change, with orange for increases and blue for decreases.](image8)\n\nFinally, the model architecture integrates these components effectively. It begins with an image-question pair, processes the image to detect and recognize entities, retrieves additional information, and then combines this with the question through word embeddings and projection layers. The combined data is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to generate a knowledgeable answer [10].\n\n![The image is a diagram of the SnapNTell model architecture. It includes pathways for forward and backward passes indicating model training and inference flow.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell model performs better than other models in terms of accuracy, primarily due to the effective use of entity detection, retrieval augmentation, and a well-integrated multimodal architecture."}

Additionally, accuracy and hallucination rate metrics are used, with GPT4 employed to measure the proportion of correct and incorrect answers [4].\n\nWhen comparing SnapNTell to other methods, the evaluation metrics show that SnapNTell outperforms existing approaches. For instance, Table 3 indicates that the retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM proposed in this work surpasses the performance of all existing baseline models across every metric assessed [9]. This strong performance underscores the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation in generating responses enriched with entity-centric information.\n\n![SnapNTell (ours) has the highest scores across all four metrics in this table.](image6)\n\nIn terms of specific metrics, the table in image6 shows that SnapNTell achieves the highest scores in ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BLEURT.

A panel of five human judges (3 male, 2 female) was involved in the assessment, focusing on three key aspects [8]. The human evaluation results indicate that while SnapNTell often neared human-level performance, it did not consistently outperform human annotations, suggesting room for further improvement [3].\n\n![The bar chart shows that SnapNTell has the highest win percentage, while the other models predominantly have a high lose percentage.](image5)\n\nThe bar chart in image5 provides a visual comparison of different models in terms of win, tie, and lose percentages against the manually annotated ground truth from SnapNTell. SnapNTell has the highest win percentage, indicating that it performs better than other models in the human evaluation. Other models, such as MIni-GPT4, Open-Flamingo, COGVLM, mPLUG-Owl2, and LLaVA 1.5, predominantly have a high lose percentage, further emphasizing SnapNTell's superior performance.\n\nIn summary, SnapNTell outperforms other methods in both evaluation metrics and human evaluation results, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating accurate and coherent answers."}

Adding venues slightly decreases performance, except for document classification, where it makes sense due to the high correlation between venues and document topics [2]. However, adding authors as input (along with title and abstract) actually hurts performance. One possible explanation is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. Additionally, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names, leading to noisy correlations [2]. This is further supported by the ablation study in `![This table presents performance metrics for different models or configurations. The columns represent different evaluation criteria: CLS, USR, CITE, REC, and an average (Avg.).

The data augmentation technique used here is similar to the `+negative` method, where negative training examples are chosen as templates. This augmented training set contains 458,477 examples, with 21% being positive and 79% being negative [5]. \n\nThe performance of BERT models under various conditions, including data augmentation, is shown in the following table:\n![Performance metrics of several variations of the BERT model under different conditions.](image2)\n\nFrom this table, we can see that adding negative examples (`+negative`) generally leads to a more imbalanced dataset, which underperforms compared to the original dataset. This is consistent with the expectation that creating a more imbalanced dataset can negatively impact performance [1].\n\nNext, let's consider the sentiment analysis tasks, specifically the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets. The accuracy results for these datasets are presented in the following table:\n![Accuracy results for three different models on two sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2 and SST-5.](image6)\n\nFor the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, BERT with cross-entropy (CE) achieves the highest accuracy, while dice loss (DL) and DSC perform slightly worse. This indicates that the proposed dice loss is not accuracy-oriented and should not be used for accuracy-oriented tasks [2].\n\nIn the context of NER tasks, the performance of BERT models with different enhancements is evaluated on the Chinese MSRA and Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 datasets. The F1-scores for these datasets are shown in the following table:\n![The table presents the performance of different models on two datasets: Chinese MSRA and Chinese OntoNotes 4.0.](image1)\n\nThe BERT-MRC+DSC model shows the highest F1-scores in both datasets, indicating that the dynamic weight adjusting strategy (DSC) helps mitigate the dominating influence of easy-negative examples and improves overall performance [8].\n\nAdditionally, the effect of hyperparameters (α and β) in the Tversky index (TI) is explored on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset and English QuoRef MRC dataset. The highest F1 scores are achieved with specific α values, highlighting the importance of these hyperparameters in controlling the tradeoff between false-negatives and false-positives [10]:\n![The table presents values across two datasets, \"Chinese Onto4.0\" and \"English QuoRef,\" for various values of a parameter denoted as \\(\\alpha\\).](image4)\n\nIn summary, different data augmentation techniques, such as adding negative examples, can lead to more imbalanced datasets and generally underperform.

This further emphasizes the superior performance of COMET-RANK over traditional metrics like BLEU.\n\n![The table presents the results of a translation performance metric called COMET-RANK for various language pairs. The first row lists the language pairs, using ISO language codes; for example, \"en-cs\" refers to English to Czech, and \"cs-en\" refers to Czech to English.

The values in this table represent scores that likely indicate the quality of translation, with higher values suggesting better performance. The last row, labeled \"Δτ,\" shows the difference between the COMET-RANK score without using reference translations and the score using reference translations.

The average joint accuracy across all turns is then calculated. From the provided data, we can see the following:\n\n- **DS-DST** achieves a joint accuracy of 51.21% on MultiWOZ 2.1 [6].\n- **DS-Picklist** achieves a joint accuracy of 53.30% on MultiWOZ 2.1 [6].\n\nThis indicates that DS-Picklist has a higher joint accuracy compared to DS-DST, suggesting it performs better overall in predicting all slot values correctly.\n\n### Slot Accuracy\nTo understand the slot-level accuracy, we can look at the specific performance for different slot categories. The table in image2 provides detailed slot-level accuracies for both DS-DST and DS-Picklist, along with a comparison to DS-Span.\n\n- **Categorical Slots**: These slots have a predefined list of possible values. For example, `hotel-type`, `attraction-name`, and `restaurant-name` are categorical slots.\n- **Non-Categorical Slots**: These slots do not have a predefined list and typically involve span extraction, such as `time` and `number` related slots.\n\nFrom the table in image2, we can observe the following:\n- **DS-DST** shows significant improvements over DS-Span for several slots, including `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking`. These slots benefit from being treated as categorical, where values can be directly predicted from a candidate-value list.\n- **DS-Picklist** also shows improvements over DS-Span, and in some cases, it outperforms DS-DST. This is particularly true for slots where the values have different expressions and cannot be easily extracted from the dialog context.\n\nFor example, the slot `hotel-type` shows a significant improvement in accuracy when using DS-DST and DS-Picklist compared to DS-Span. Similarly, `attraction-type` and `hotel-internet` also show notable improvements.\n\n### Detailed Comparison\n- **DS-DST**: This model handles both categorical and non-categorical slots by adapting a single BERT-style reading comprehension model. It jointly processes domain-slot pairs and recent dialog context, leading to strong interactions between the two. This approach is effective for a wide range of slots but may struggle with time-related slots, as seen in the error analysis [7].\n- **DS-Picklist**: This model assumes a full ontology is available and treats all domain-slot pairs as categorical slots. It leverages the candidate-value list to predict slot values, which is particularly beneficial for slots with diverse expressions. However, in real scenarios, having access to the full ontology might be challenging [6].\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, DS-Picklist generally outperforms DS-DST in terms of joint accuracy, achieving 53.30% compared to DS-DST's 51.21% on MultiWOZ 2.1. At the slot level, both models show significant improvements over DS-Span, especially for categorical slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, and `hotel-internet`.

According to the provided data, DS-Picklist outperforms both DS-DST and DS-Span. Specifically, on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, the joint accuracies are as follows:\n- **DS-Span**: 40.00% [8]\n- **DS-DST**: 51.21% [8]\n- **DS-Picklist**: 53.30% [7]\n\nThis shows that DS-Picklist has the highest joint accuracy, followed by DS-DST, and then DS-Span.\n\n### Slot-Level Accuracy\nFor slot-level accuracy, we can see the performance for each slot type. The table in `![{The table presents accuracy percentages for various slots across three different models: DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist. The slots are related to a dialogue state tracking (DST) task, typically used in natural language understanding systems for applications such as booking systems or intelligent assistants.}](image6)` provides detailed accuracy for each slot. \n\n#### Categorical Slots\nCategorical slots, which are handled by selecting from a predefined list, show significant improvements with DS-Picklist. For example:\n- **hotel-type**: DS-Picklist achieves 97.87%, compared to 95.42% for DS-Span and 96.85% for DS-DST.\n- **attraction-type**: DS-Picklist achieves 97.48%, compared to 95.24% for DS-Span and 96.47% for DS-DST.\n- **hotel-internet**: DS-Picklist achieves 97.62%, compared to 94.91% for DS-Span and 96.51% for DS-DST.\n\n#### Non-Categorical Slots\nNon-categorical slots, which are handled by extracting spans from the dialogue context, also show improvements with DS-Picklist, but the gains are more modest:\n- **hotel-name**: DS-Picklist achieves 96.98%, compared to 95.65% for DS-Span and 96.68% for DS-DST.\n- **train-leave at**: DS-Picklist achieves 94.00%, compared to 92.67% for DS-Span and 93.33% for DS-DST.\n\n### Error Analysis\nThe error analysis in `![{The table presents data about various \"Slot Names\" and their corresponding statistics under three categories: DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist.}](image2)` further supports these findings. For example, for slots like `hotel-internet` and `hotel-parking`, DS-Picklist significantly reduces the errors compared to DS-Span and DS-DST. This is because these slots often have multiple expressions that are better captured by a picklist approach rather than span extraction.\n\n### Examples\nThe examples in `![{The table in the image consists of interactions between a \"User\" and a \"System\" in a dialogue format. It frames three separate conversation segments where a user requests information or assistance, and the system responds. After each dialogue sequence, several outputs are provided: \"Ground Truths,\" \"DS-Span,\" \"DS-DST,\" and, for the last conversation, \"DS-Picklist.\"}](image3)` illustrate specific cases where DS-Picklist outperforms the other models.

The vocabulary size for LANI is 2,292, and it includes 6,000 paragraphs [image4]. The evaluation metrics for LANI include stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC). Our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving an SD of 8.65 and a TC of 35.72, which is a 5% improvement over the method by Chaplot et al. (2018) [image7].\n\nIn contrast, the CHAI dataset, which involves more complex manipulation tasks in a 3D house environment, has a higher mean number of instructions per paragraph at 7.70, with each instruction containing an average of 54.5 actions [image4]. The vocabulary size for CHAI is 1,018, and it includes 1,596 paragraphs. The evaluation metrics for CHAI are stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA). On CHAI, our approach shows an SD of 2.75, outperforming other methods, but the overall performance on manipulation tasks remains challenging [image7].\n\nThe complexity of the CHAI tasks is further illustrated by the need for multiple intermediate goals, such as opening the cupboard, picking items, and moving them, as shown in the example scenario [2]. The manipulation accuracy (MA) for CHAI is also a critical metric, and our approach achieves 39.97% MA, which is better than the baseline methods but still indicates significant room for improvement [image3].\n\nIn summary, while both datasets require solving language challenges, including spatial and temporal reasoning, the CHAI dataset presents a more complex and challenging environment with a higher number of actions and more intricate manipulation tasks.

This indicates that \"Our Approach\" is more effective in navigating and completing tasks in the LANI environment.\n- For the CHAI dataset, \"Our Approach\" shows an SD of 2.75, which is better than the baseline and previous methods. However, the manipulation accuracy (MA) remains a challenge, with all models performing poorly, especially on manipulation tasks.\n\n**Human Performance:**\n- On the LANI task, human performance shows a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and successful task completion (TC) 63% of the time. This suggests that while humans perform well, there is still room for improvement.\n- On the CHAI task, human performance has a stop distance error (SD) of 1.34 and 100% manipulation accuracy, indicating that the task is more challenging for automated systems compared to humans.\n\n**Automated vs. Human Evaluation:**\n- The histogram in `![Histogram showing the distribution of Likert scale ratings for \"Human\" and \"Our Approach\" concerning L ANI.](image7)` illustrates that human ratings are generally higher, with a mean rating of 4.38, compared to \"Our Approach\" with a mean rating of 3.78. This suggests that while the automated system performs reasonably well, it still lags behind human performance.\n\n### Linguistic Categories\n\n**Occurrences and Examples:**\n- The table in `![Table comparing the occurrences of different linguistic categories in LANI and CHAI datasets.](image2)` provides a detailed comparison of various linguistic categories. For example, spatial relations occur 123 times in LANI and 52 times in CHAI, while temporal coordination occurs 65 times in LANI and 68 times in CHAI. This indicates that both datasets have different distributions of linguistic features, with LANI having more instances of spatial relations and CHAI having more instances of temporal coordination.\n\n**Statistical Significance:**\n- The table in `![Table presenting data on different linguistic or semantic categories, comparing \"Present\" and \"Absent\" groups.](image4)` shows the statistical significance of certain linguistic categories. For instance, \"Temporal coordination\" and \"Co-reference\" show statistically significant differences, with p-values of 0.015 and 0.016, respectively. This suggests that these categories play a crucial role in the instructions and their absence or presence significantly affects the performance.\n\n### Summary\nIn terms of task performance, \"Our Approach\" performs well on the LANI task, with improved navigation and task completion metrics, but struggles with the more complex manipulation tasks in the CHAI dataset. Human performance is generally better, especially in the CHAI task, highlighting the challenges in automated systems. In terms of linguistic categories, LANI and CHAI differ in the frequency and importance of various linguistic features, with LANI having more spatial relations and CHAI having more temporal coordination.

This indicates that the proposed method is more effective in completing navigation tasks compared to C HAPLOT 18. The table in `![The image contains two tables summarizing the performance of various methods on a held-out test dataset.](image8)` shows that \"Our Approach\" achieves a TC of 36.9, which is the best among the listed methods, including STOP, RANDOMWALK, MOSTFREQUENT, MISRA17, and CHAPLOT18.\n\nFor the C HAI  task, the comparison is more nuanced.

This is better than the baseline methods such as STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT, and also outperforms previous approaches like MISRA17 and CHAPLOT18. Specifically, on L ANI, our approach outperforms C HAPLOT 18, improving task completion (TC) accuracy by 5% [5].\n\nOn the C HAI dataset, the 'Our Approach' method shows an SD of 3.34 and a manipulation accuracy (MA) of 39.97 [12]. While all models perform poorly on C HAI, especially on manipulation (MA), our approach still shows an improvement on stop distance (SD) [5].\n\nSeveral factors influence the performance of the 'Our Approach' method. One key factor is the explicit separation of goal prediction and action generation. The model maps raw visual observations to goals using L ING UN ET, a language-conditioned image generation network, and then generates the actions required to complete them [1]. This decomposition helps in improving instruction execution performance, particularly in navigation tasks [8].\n\nHowever, there are limitations. The model relies completely on the predicted goal for action generation and is not exposed to the language otherwise. This can lead to cascading errors and difficulties in handling instructions that include constraints on the execution itself [4]. Additionally, inherent ambiguities in instruction following make exact goal identification difficult, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance [8].\n\nTo further illustrate, the table in `![This table presents data on different linguistic categories, specifically in the context of spatial language or navigation instructions. It is organized into four columns: \"Category,\" \"Count\" for two systems (LANI and CHAI), and \"Example.\"](image1)` shows the frequency of various linguistic categories in the LANI and CHAI datasets, highlighting the complexity and variety of instructions. For example, LANI has 123 occurrences of spatial relations between locations, while CHAI has 52 occurrences. These differences in the types and frequencies of instructions contribute to the varying performance across the datasets.\n\nIn summary, the 'Our Approach' method performs well in terms of SD and TC on the LANI dataset and shows some improvement in SD on the C HAI dataset, but faces challenges with manipulation tasks and handling complex instructions."}

For example, spatial relations between locations occur 123 times in LANI and 52 times in CHAI, while constraints on the shape of the trajectory are present 94 times in LANI but not at all in CHAI.

Let's break down the key points from the provided text and image quotes.\n\n### Pretraining Data\n\n1. **Data Type and Structure**:\n   - Using datasets that retain paragraph structure, such as BooksCorpus and Wikipedia, generally performs better than using individual sentences. For example, Common Crawl, which contains multiple sentences, outperforms News Crawl, which consists of individual sentences [3].\n   - The table in `![{Comparison of different models on various NLP tasks.}](image6)` shows that training on \"ccrawl\" (Common Crawl) with 18B tokens yields the highest average performance across tasks, compared to other datasets like \"news crawl\" and \"BWiki.\"\n\n2. **Amount of Data**:\n   - More pretraining data generally leads to better performance. The line graph in `![{The relationship between the amount of Common Crawl data and the average GLUE score.}](image7)` illustrates this, showing a positive correlation between the number of train data tokens and the average GLUE score.\n   - Experiments show that pretraining continues to improve performance up to 18B tokens, and it is likely to continue improving with more data [11].\n\n### Modeling Approaches\n\n1. **Cloze-Driven Training**:\n   - The cloze-driven training regime, where the model predicts the center word given all left and right context, is more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately. The table in `![{Performance metrics for different models on various NLP tasks.}](image1)` shows that the \"cloze\" approach achieves an average score of 80.9, outperforming the \"bilm\" and \"cloze + bilm\" approaches.\n\n2. **Model Architecture**:\n   - Larger and more complex models, such as BERT_LARGE, generally perform better across multiple tasks. The table in `![{Performance of various models on a set of NLP tasks.}](image3)` highlights that BERT_LARGE has the highest scores on tasks like CoLA, QNLI, and RTE.\n   - The illustration in `![{Fine-tuning a model for a downstream classification task.}](image8)` shows how fine-tuning adjusts the model to incorporate more complete information, which can further enhance performance.\n\n3. **Fine-Tuning**:\n   - Fine-tuning the pretrained models on specific tasks can lead to significant improvements. The table in `![{Comparison of different models based on their performance using the F1 score.}](image4)` shows that \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieves the highest F1 scores on both the development and test datasets, outperforming other models like ELMo_BASE and BERT_BASE.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the combination of using large, paragraph-structured pretraining data and employing a cloze-driven training regime, along with fine-tuning, significantly improves the performance on NLP tasks.

This suggests that pre-training and alignment ensure that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language.\n\nHowever, the results from Table 3 show that the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses being insignificant across all languages [7]. This indicates that *a priori* alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios, but it is helpful in multilingual training scenarios [8].\n\nLooking at the specific data, the table in `![{The table shows that aligning word embeddings has mixed results, with some slight improvements and declines in BLEU scores.}](image3)` provides detailed information about the impact of alignment. For example:\n- **GL → EN**: Unaligned: 12.8, Aligned: 11.5 (change: −1.3)\n- **PT → EN**: Unaligned: 30.8, Aligned: 30.6 (change: −0.2)\n- **AZ → EN**: Unaligned: 2.0, Aligned: 2.1 (change: +0.1)\n- **TR → EN**: Unaligned: 17.9, Aligned: 17.7 (change: −0.2)\n- **BE → EN**: Unaligned: 3.0, Aligned: 3.0 (change: +0.0)\n- **RU → EN**: Unaligned: 21.1, Aligned: 21.4 (change: +0.3)\n\nThese results show that the changes in BLEU scores due to alignment are generally small, with some slight improvements and declines. The table in `![{The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs, showing that alignment generally improves the metric scores.}](image2)` further supports this, where the \"align\" metric score is the highest in each case, indicating some improvement.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings has a mixed impact on BLEU scores in different language translation tasks, with some slight improvements and declines. Generally, alignment is more beneficial in multilingual scenarios."}
{"q_id": 424, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 3841, "out_tok": 949, "total_tok": 4790, "response": "Pre-training of word embeddings has a significant impact on translation accuracy, and this effect is influenced by both the training set size and the linguistic similarity between the source and target languages.\n\nFrom the data in Table 3, it is evident that the BLEU scores for different language pairs show varying improvements with pre-training. For example, the more linguistically distant languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) see larger accuracy gains compared to their more similar counterparts, French (FR) and Italian (IT). This can be attributed to the observation that systems with more room for improvement (i.e., those with lower baseline BLEU scores) tend to benefit more from pre-training [1]. \n\n![The table presents data related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family. It contains the following columns: 1. **Dataset:** Lists the source to target language pairs: ES → PT (Spanish to Portuguese), FR → PT (French to Portuguese), IT → PT (Italian to Portuguese), RU → PT (Russian to Portuguese), HE → PT (Hebrew to Portuguese). 2. **Lang. Family:** Shows the language family or common linguistic group of the source language: Spanish belongs to the West-Iberian family, French belongs to the Western Romance family, Italian belongs to the Romance family, Russian is part of the Indo-European family, Hebrew is labeled as having \"No Common\" language family with Portuguese. 3. **std:** Represents some standard metric value for the given language pair. 4. **pre:** Represents another metric, likely a pre-optimized or pre-processing metric value, with the improvement shown in parentheses: ES → PT shows an improvement of +7.0, FR → PT shows an improvement of +5.7, IT → PT shows an improvement of +4.7, RU → PT shows an improvement of +6.2, HE → PT shows an improvement of +8.9](image1)\n\nThe improvement in BLEU scores is particularly noticeable when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training can take effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective [4].\n\n![The image consists of two line graphs illustrating the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translation tasks from Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En). The top graph shows the BLEU scores as a function of training set size, ranging from 0 to 1.0 (representing the proportion of the dataset used). It compares standard training (std) with pre-trained models (pre). There are three pairs of lines: Blue lines represent Pt→En translations, Red lines represent Tr→En translations, Green lines represent Ru→En translations. For each language, the dashed line indicates the pre-trained model's BLEU score, and the solid line indicates the standard model's score. The bottom graph shows the gain in BLEU score achieved by using pre-trained models over standard models, calculated as BLEU(pre) - BLEU(std). It highlights the improvement for each language pair: Blue dots denote Pt→En, Red dots denote Tr→En, Green dots denote Ru→En. The graph suggests that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases. Overall, the graphs demonstrate that using pre-training techniques can result in higher BLEU scores, especially when the training data is limited.](image2)\n\nThe role of training set size is also crucial. As shown in the line graphs, the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases. This is intuitive because pre-trained embeddings provide a better starting point for the model, which is especially beneficial when the available training data is limited [2].\n\nAdditionally, the similarity between the source and target languages plays a key role. When the languages are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods are more similar, leading to larger gains from pre-training. For instance, when translating into Portuguese, the gains are highest for languages within the same or closely related language families, such as Spanish (ES) and French (FR), compared to more distant languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) [3].\n\nIn summary, pre-training improves translation accuracy, with the most significant benefits observed for language pairs with low baseline BLEU scores and small training sets. Linguistic similarity between the source and target languages also enhances the effectiveness of pre-training."}

For instance, when examining the translation from GL to EN, PT to EN, AZ to EN, TR to EN, BE to EN, and RU to EN, the impact of alignment is mixed. In some cases, such as GL to EN, the alignment slightly decreases the BLEU score (12.8 to 11.5), while in others like RU to EN, it slightly increases the score (21.1 to 21.4) [4]. This suggests that the benefit of aligning word embeddings is not consistent and may depend on the specific language pair.\n\nIn a more detailed analysis, the table in `![{Comparison of unaligned and aligned scores for different language pairs translating into English}](image4)` shows that the changes in BLEU scores due to alignment are generally small, with some slight improvements and some slight decreases. This indicates that the necessity of alignment might vary depending on the linguistic characteristics and similarity of the language pairs.\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, pre-training generally improves the accuracy of translation, particularly for low-frequency words. The bar chart in `![{F-measure scores of target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, showing that pre-training often outperforms standard methods, especially for higher frequency ranges}](image6)` illustrates that both standard and pre-trained models show an increase in F-measure with word frequency. However, pre-trained models (in red) often outperform standard models (in blue), especially for words that are less frequent in the training corpus. This highlights the effectiveness of pre-training in enhancing the translation of rarer vocabulary.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings has a mixed impact on translation performance, with some language pairs benefiting slightly and others not. Pre-training, on the other hand, consistently improves the F-measure scores for target words, particularly for those that are less frequent in the training corpus."}

The table in `image4` provides a detailed comparison of different model configurations. When R-GCN is removed (`No R-GCN`), the performance drops to 62.4 (unmasked) and 63.2 (masked) [4]. This indicates that the R-GCN component significantly contributes to the model's performance, as its removal leads to a noticeable decrease in accuracy.\n\nNext, we consider the impact of removing relation types. In the experiment where no relation types are distinguished (`No relation types`), the performance is 62.7 (unmasked) and 63.9 (masked) [1]. This suggests that distinguishing between different types of relations (e.g., DOC-BASED, MATCH, COREF) is beneficial, as the performance is slightly better when these distinctions are made.\n\nNow, let's examine the impact of removing specific relation types. For instance, removing the `DOC-BASED` connections results in a performance of 62.9 (unmasked) and 65.8 (masked) [7]. This indicates that `DOC-BASED` connections are important, especially in the masked condition, where the performance drop is more significant. \n\nRemoving the `MATCH` connections, which link mentions that match exactly, leads to a performance of 64.3 (unmasked) and 67.4 (masked) [7]. This shows that `MATCH` connections are also valuable, but their removal has a less severe impact compared to `DOC-BASED` connections.\n\nFinally, removing the `COREF` connections, which are predicted by the coreference system, results in a performance of 64.8 (unmasked) with no corresponding value for masked [7]. This suggests that `COREF` connections have a marginal role, particularly in the unmasked condition.\n\nIn summary, the removal of the R-GCN component and specific relation types (e.g., DOC-BASED, MATCH, COREF) generally leads to a decrease in model performance, with the most significant impact observed when R-GCN is removed. The importance of specific relation types varies, with `DOC-BASED` and `MATCH` being more critical than `COREF`.\n\n![The table outlines the performance metrics of different models and configurations, showing the impact of various components and relation types.](image4)"}

According to the text, when the R-GCN is removed, the model's performance drops significantly. Specifically, without R-GCN, the model loses 8.0 points in accuracy [4]. This indicates that the R-GCN, which includes coreference information, is crucial for the model's performance.\n\nNext, we look at the specific impact of coreference edges. The text states that coreference links and complement edges play a more marginal role compared to other types of connections, such as DOC-BASED and MATCH [8]. However, this does not mean they are entirely negligible. In fact, the model still benefits from having all these different relations together, as it gives the Entity-GCN a clear advantage [8].\n\nIn the masked setting, the coreference resolution system is not applied due to masking. However, coreferred mentions are labeled with the same identifier, making it easier for the model to recover coreference links [5]. This suggests that the masked setting inherently provides some form of coreference information, which contributes to the model's performance.\n\nWhen comparing the performance with and without coreference, the table in image6 shows that the inclusion of coreference (GloVe with R-GCN) yields an accuracy of 59.2 in the unmasked setting and 11.1 in the masked setting. Without R-GCN (GloVe w/o R-GCN), the accuracy drops to 51.2 in the unmasked setting and 11.6 in the masked setting. This further supports the importance of the R-GCN component, which includes coreference information, in the unmasked setting.\n\nAdditionally, the table in image8 provides a comparison of the Entity-GCN models with and without coreference. The Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) achieves 66.4 in the unmasked test set, while the Entity-GCN without coreference (single model) achieves 67.6. Surprisingly, the model without coreference performs slightly better in the unmasked setting. However, in the masked setting, the model with coreference (65.3) performs better than the one without coreference (64.8) [8].\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of coreference information generally improves the performance of Entity-GCN models, particularly in the unmasked setting. However, in the masked setting, the inherent labeling of coreferred mentions makes the explicit use of coreference less critical, and the model can still perform well without it. \n\nTherefore, the inclusion of coreference information has a positive impact on the performance of Entity-GCN models, especially in the unmasked setting, but its effect is more marginal in the masked setting."}

In contrast, the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model, which uses GloVe embeddings instead of ELMo, has a significantly lower accuracy of 59.2% in the unmasked condition and 11.1% in the masked condition [3].\n\n![The table shows the performance of different models or configurations on some task, possibly related to natural language processing or machine learning, given the mention of GloVe, R-GCN, and different components like MATCH, COREF, and COMPLEMENT.](image3)\n\nThese differences are substantial, especially in the masked condition, where the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model performs very poorly. This suggests that the deep contextualized embeddings provided by ELMo are crucial for handling the masked setting, where surface forms are replaced with generic tokens, and the model must rely more on context and relational information.\n\nNext, let's examine the relation-based accuracy and precision. The 'full (ensemble)' model shows high accuracy and precision for specific relations. For example, it achieves 85.5% accuracy for the `member_of_political_party` relation, 83.0% for `record_label`, and 81.5% for `publisher` [6]. These relations have relatively small candidate sets, which may contribute to the higher accuracy. On the other hand, the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model is not explicitly reported for these specific relations, but given its overall poor performance, it is likely to perform much worse on these tasks as well.\n\n![This table displays examples from a model's predictions versus gold (correct) answers across different queries.

This indicates that the ensemble model is highly effective at ranking the correct answer within the top 2 or 5 candidates.

For example, in the ACE05 dataset, DyGIE shows a 6.6% improvement in pronoun performance with CorefProp [12].\n\n#### Relation Propagation (RelProp)\n- **ACE05 and SciERC**: Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple relation instances across different entities [8].\n- **Impact on F1 Scores**: The graph below shows that relation propagation achieves significant improvements in sentences with more entities, indicating that using broader context helps in these scenarios.\n  ![DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp across all categories.](image6)\n\n### Detailed Performance Metrics\nThe detailed performance metrics for different configurations of DyGIE are provided in the following table:\n![Performance metrics for different models on entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.](image4)\n\n- **Entity Task**:\n  - DyGIE: F1 = 68.2\n  - DyGIE without CorefProp: F1 = 68.0\n  - DyGIE without RelProp: F1 = 67.5\n  - Base: F1 = 68.1\n\n- **Relation Task**:\n  - DyGIE: F1 = 42.0\n  - DyGIE without CorefProp: F1 = 41.2\n  - DyGIE without RelProp: F1 = 40.4\n  - Base: F1 = 39.5\n\nThese metrics show that the inclusion of both CorefProp and RelProp generally improves the F1 scores for both entity and relation tasks, with RelProp having a more significant impact on relation extraction.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe DyGIE model's performance on entity and relation extraction varies across different datasets and configurations. The CorefProp component is particularly beneficial for disambiguating pronominal mentions, while the RelProp component significantly enhances the performance in sentences with multiple relations. Overall, the inclusion of these components improves the model's F1 scores, making DyGIE a robust framework for information extraction across various domains."}
{"q_id": 432, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 4657, "out_tok": 476, "total_tok": 5133, "response": "The presence of coreference annotations in datasets significantly influences the performance of the DyGIE model in entity recognition tasks. For instance, in the ACE05 dataset, where coreference annotations are available, the coreference propagation (CorefProp) layer helps in disambiguating the entity class for pronominal mentions. This is particularly useful when dealing with cross-sentence contexts, as seen in the example: \"One of [them]_PER, from a very close friend of [ours] ORG.\" Without reading previous sentences, it is challenging to determine whether \"them\" and \"ours\" refer to a person (PER) or an organization (ORG). The coreference layer improves pronoun performance by 6.6%, confirming its effectiveness [3].\n\nIn contrast, in the SciERC dataset, where pronouns are uniformly assigned a \"Generic\" label, the CorefProp layer does not have a significant effect on entity extraction performance [8]. This suggests that the utility of coreference propagation is context-dependent and more beneficial in datasets with meaningful coreference annotations.\n\nThe performance metrics across different datasets also highlight the impact of coreference annotations. In the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, which include coreference annotations, the DyGIE model achieves substantial improvements in Entity F1 scores, outperforming other systems. Specifically, for the ACE04-O dataset, DyGIE achieves an Entity F1 score of 84.7, compared to 72.7 for Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and 75.1 for Wang and Lu (2018). Similarly, for the ACE05-O dataset, DyGIE scores 82.9, compared to 70.5 for Katiyar and Cardie (2018) and 74.5 for Wang and Lu (2018) [5]![DyGIE system achieves the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets.](image5).\n\nThese results indicate that the presence of coreference annotations enhances the DyGIE model's ability to accurately recognize and categorize entities, especially in complex contexts where cross-sentence information is crucial. Therefore, the presence of coreference annotations in datasets positively influences the performance of the DyGIE model in entity recognition tasks."}

The left graph in `![{CorefProp and RelProp performance across iterations}](image1)` shows that the F1 score for entity extraction peaks at two iterations (N=2) for CorefProp, indicating that this is the optimal number of iterations for this process. Similarly, the right graph in the same image shows that the F1 score for relation extraction also reaches its highest point at two iterations (M=2) for RelProp. This suggests that both processes benefit from a moderate number of iterations, with diminishing returns beyond two iterations.\n\nFor the impact of the number of entities in a sentence on the relation F1 score, `![{Relation F1 score as a function of the number of entities in a sentence}](image5)` provides insights. As the number of entities in a sentence increases, the performance of both DyGIE and DyGIE-RelProp decreases. However, DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp across all categories, even though the addition of relation propagation in DyGIE-RelProp attempts to address the decline in performance. This indicates that while relation propagation helps, it is not as effective as the full DyGIE model in handling sentences with a higher number of entities.\n\nIn summary, the number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp optimally enhances F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction at two iterations, and the number of entities in a sentence negatively impacts relation F1 scores, with DyGIE performing better than DyGIE-RelProp in such scenarios."}

According to the text, the best performance for coreference propagation is achieved on the second iteration (N=2) [12]. This is visually supported by the left graph in `![The left graph shows the highest Entity F1 score at two iterations for CorefProp.](image3)`, where the blue line with circular markers indicates that the highest F1 score for entity extraction is reached at two iterations.\n\nNext, for the relation extraction task, the best performance is also observed at the second iteration (M=2) [2]. This is further illustrated in the right graph of `![The right graph shows the highest Relation F1 score at two iterations for RelProp.](image3)`, where the red line with square markers indicates that the highest F1 score for relation extraction is achieved at two iterations.\n\nAdditionally, the effect of the number of entities in a sentence on the relation extraction performance is shown in `![The image shows that DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp across all categories, especially as the number of entities increases.](image2)`. The figure demonstrates that as the number of entities in a sentence increases, the performance of both systems decreases, but DyGIE (with relation propagation) generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp (without relation propagation) across all categories. This suggests that relation propagation helps maintain higher F1 scores even when the complexity of the sentence increases due to more entities.\n\nIn summary, both CorefProp and RelProp achieve their best F1 scores for entity and relation extraction tasks, respectively, at the second iteration. Furthermore, relation propagation is particularly beneficial in sentences with a higher number of entities, helping to maintain better performance."}
{"q_id": 435, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 4593, "out_tok": 799, "total_tok": 5392, "response": "To compare the performance of SWEM and CNN models across different datasets and subspace dimensions, we can examine the results from various experiments and visualizations provided.\n\n### Performance Across Datasets\n\n**Document Classification:**\n- On topic prediction tasks, such as Yahoo! Answers and AG News, the SWEM model, particularly the SWEM-concat variant, outperforms both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures. For instance, SWEM-concat even outperforms a 29-layer deep CNN model on predicting topics [1].\n- The hierarchical pooling operation in SWEM-hier is beneficial for sentiment analysis tasks, as it manages to abstract spatial (word-order) information, leading to comparable or superior results compared to CNN or LSTM models [2].\n\n**Sentence Classification:**\n- For short sentence classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis on MR, SST-1, and SST-2, SWEM generally yields inferior accuracies compared to CNN and LSTM. However, on other tasks like subjectivity classification (Subj) and question classification (TREC), SWEM exhibits comparable performance with fewer parameters and faster training [5].\n\n**Natural Language Sequence Matching:**\n- In natural language sequence matching tasks, including SNLI, MultiNLI, and WikiQA, SWEM demonstrates the best results on most datasets, except for WikiQA. Specifically, SWEM-max performs the best among all SWEM variants on the SNLI dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 83.8% with only 120K parameters [12].\n\n### Performance Across Subspace Dimensions\n\n**Subspace Training Analysis:**\n- When using subspace training to measure model complexity, SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions. For example, on the AG News dataset, if the performance threshold is set at 80% testing accuracy, SWEM exhibits a lower intrinsic dimension \\(d_{\\mathrm{int}}\\) than CNN [10]. \n- As the subspace dimension increases, the accuracy of both SWEM and CNN models improves, approaching the accuracy of their direct implementations. This is evident from the line graphs, where SWEM accuracy generally increases and stabilizes at higher dimensions, while CNN starts with high accuracy and remains stable [image8].\n\n### Insights from Accuracies\n\n- **SWEM's Efficiency:**\n  - SWEM models, especially SWEM-concat and SWEM-hier, are more parameter-efficient and computationally efficient compared to CNN and LSTM. They achieve comparable or even superior performance with fewer parameters and faster training times.\n  - The max-pooling operation in SWEM-max extracts complementary features, making SWEM-concat the best-performing variant in many cases [3].\n\n- **Sensitivity to Word-Order:**\n  - For longer documents, SWEM models, particularly SWEM-hier, are effective because they can leverage spatial information. For shorter texts, word-order features are more important, and CNN and LSTM models tend to perform better due to their ability to capture sequential information [5].\n\n- **Dataset-Specific Performance:**\n  - SWEM models excel in tasks where the semantic information provided by word embeddings is sufficient, such as topic categorization and ontology classification. For tasks that require more nuanced understanding of word order, such as sentiment analysis of short sentences, CNN and LSTM models are more effective [4].\n\n- **Sparsity of Embeddings:**\n  - The word embeddings learned from SWEM-max are sparse, with most values concentrated around zero. This suggests that the model may depend on a few key words for predictions, learning the important words for a given task [3].\n\nIn summary, SWEM models exhibit comparable or superior performance to CNN and LSTM models in many NLP tasks, particularly in document classification and natural language sequence matching. They are more parameter-efficient and computationally efficient, but may be less effective in tasks requiring detailed word-order information, such as short sentence classification."}

These tests show that transferring different layers from the document-level model to the aspect-level model has varying impacts. \n\nFor instance, when only the LSTM layer is transferred, there are improvements over the baseline LSTM + ATT model [8]. Similarly, transferring the embedding layer is more helpful for datasets D3 and D4, which have extremely unbalanced label distributions. This suggests that the sentiment information captured by the embeddings trained on a larger corpus is beneficial, especially when there are few training examples for certain classes [8].\n\n![The table presents the performance of different model settings on four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) in terms of accuracy (Acc.) and macro-F1 score (Macro-F1).

As the percentage of document-level training examples increases, both the accuracy and Macro-F1 scores generally improve. For example, the accuracy and Macro-F1 scores for all four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) show a steady increase as the percentage of document-level data is increased from 0.0 to 1.0 [4].\n\n![The image contains two line graphs that illustrate the performance of a method called \"PRET $^+$ MULT\" based on the percentage of document-level training examples. The top graph shows accuracy percentages, while the bottom graph displays Macro-F1 percentages. Both graphs plot the metrics as a function of the percentage of document-level training examples.](image3)\n\nSpecifically, for datasets D3 and D4, there are sharp increases in the Macro-F1 scores when the percentage of document-level examples is changed from 0 to 0.4. This is likely due to the extremely unbalanced label distribution in these datasets, where even small improvements in predicting neutral examples can significantly boost the overall performance [4].\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of different components, particularly the LSTM and embedding layers, improves the model's performance, and increasing the percentage of document-level training examples consistently enhances both accuracy and Macro-F1 scores, with notable gains for datasets with unbalanced label distributions."}

When expanding from four domains to a new domain, fine-tuning TRADE using 1% of the new domain data results in a joint accuracy of 59.83%, outperforming training from scratch, which achieves only 44.24% [3]. This highlights the benefits of transfer learning with the TRADE model.\n\n![The table presents results from an evaluation of a Base Model (BM) trained on four domains and its fine-tuning on a new domain.

Evaluation on 4 Domains - This section compares different methods in scenarios excluding one specific domain each time: Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, and Taxi. - The \"Joint\" and \"Slot\" columns show the performance scores for each approach. - Methods compared include: - Base Model (BM) with results based on the four-domain training. - Fine-tuning BM on 1% of new domain data with sub-strategies: Naive, EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation), and GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory). - The highest values are usually bolded, indicating the top-performing method for each comparison. 2. Evaluation on New Domain - This part assesses performance when training with only 1% of new domain data. - Again, it compares the \"Joint\" and \"Slot\" metrics for different domains: Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, and Taxi. - Strategies compared include training only 1% of the new domain and fine-tuning BM on 1% of the new domain data using Naive, EWC, and GEM methods. - The highest values are noted in bold for clarity. The table highlights how well the different approaches retain performance across the existing and new domains, focusing on domain adaptation and continual learning techniques.](image5)\n\nWhen fine-tuning TRADE with different strategies, GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory) is found to be the most effective. For example, in the hotel domain, fine-tuning with GEM results in a joint accuracy drop of only 5.44% (from 58.98% to 53.54%), while naive fine-tuning causes a more significant drop of 22.9% (to 36.08%) [9].\n\nOverall, the TRADE model not only excels in joint and slot accuracy on the MultiWOZ dataset and its restaurant subset but also demonstrates strong performance in domain adaptation scenarios, especially when fine-tuned with the GEM strategy."}
{"q_id": 439, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 4431, "out_tok": 763, "total_tok": 5194, "response": "When adapting the model to new domain data, fine-tuning strategies like GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory) and EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation) play a crucial role in maintaining performance on the original domains while learning the new domain. \n\nFor instance, when fine-tuning TRADE with GEM, the performance on the original four domains drops only slightly, from 58.98% to 53.54% in joint accuracy for the hotel domain, whereas naive fine-tuning causes a more significant drop to 36.08% [1]. This indicates that GEM is effective in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.\n\nIn the context of zero-shot analysis, knowledge transfer between domains is evident. For example, slots like people, area, price range, and day are successfully transferred from the other four domains to the hotel and restaurant domains. However, unseen slots, such as parking, stars, and internet in the hotel domain, and food in the restaurant domain, are challenging to track correctly [2]. This can be visualized in the bar charts showing zero-shot dialogue state tracking error analysis, where the successful transfer of knowledge for common slots is highlighted, but unique slots have higher error rates:\n![The image contains two bar charts, labeled as Figure 5, showing zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) error analysis in two domains: Hotel (a) and Restaurant (b). In the Hotel domain chart (a), the X-axis represents the number of slots with correct non-empty values for various criteria, including parking, stars, name, book people, area, price range, type, book day, book stay, and internet. The chart indicates that knowledge to track the slots for people, area, price range, and day from other domains seen during training has been successfully transferred. In the Restaurant domain chart (b), the criteria include book time, book people, book day, price range, food, name, and area. Similar to the hotel domain, it shows how accurately the values for each slot are tracked. Both charts provide a visual representation of how effectively the DST model handles zero-shot slot tracking across these domains, with higher bars indicating more successful tracking for the respective slots.](image4)\n\nAdditionally, when considering the hotel and attraction as new domains, GEM outperforms naive fine-tuning. Specifically, GEM achieves 34.73% joint accuracy on the attraction domain, compared to 29.39% for naive fine-tuning [4]. This suggests that preserving the learned parameters of the existing domains helps in achieving better performance on the new domain.\n\nIn terms of slot similarities, the cosine similarity heatmap provides insights into how different slots are related. Slots with high similarity, such as \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars,\" tend to share similar or correlated values, which can facilitate better knowledge transfer and performance [8]:\n![The image is a heatmap visualizing the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset. The slots, such as \"parking,\" \"internet,\" \"food,\" etc., are listed along both the rows and columns. Each cell in the heatmap represents the cosine similarity between pairs of slot embeddings. A darker color indicates a higher similarity, suggesting that the slots have learned similar embeddings likely due to sharing similar or correlated values. For instance, \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars\" show high correlation, suggesting that these pairs typically have related or shared attributes in the context of the dataset.](image8)\n\nOverall, GEM and EWC help in retaining the performance on the original domains while adapting to new domains, and slot similarities can enhance the model's ability to generalize and transfer knowledge effectively."}

The table includes metrics such as overall gender accuracy (Acc), the difference in performance (F1 score) between masculine and feminine scores (ΔG), and the difference in performance (F1 score) between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments (ΔS) [1]. \n\nThe bar chart in `![{Google Translate's performance on gender translation for different languages, showing higher accuracy for stereotypical translations compared to non-stereotypical ones.}](image1)` illustrates that Google Translate consistently has higher accuracy for stereotypical translations compared to non-stereotypical ones across all tested languages. For example, in Spanish, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is 67%, while for non-stereotypical translations, it is 46% [1].\n\nIn terms of specific language performance, German shows better translation accuracy, with three out of four systems achieving their best performance. This may be due to the similarity between German and the English source language [7].\n\nTable 4 in the text further demonstrates the impact of adding stereotypical gender adjectives (e.g., \"handsome\" and \"pretty\") to the input sentences. For instance, in Spanish, the original accuracy is 53.1%, but with the addition of adjectives, it improves to 63.5%, resulting in a 10.4% increase [5]. Similar improvements are observed in Russian and Ukrainian, where the accuracy increases by 11.2% and 4.5%, respectively [10].\n\n`![{Examples of translation bias and gender issues in machine translation from English to Spanish and French.}](image2)` shows specific examples of translation bias. In one case, the word \"baker\" is given a male inflection in Spanish, which is mismatched with the female pronoun \"ella.\" Adding the adjective \"pretty\" corrects this bias, matching the female noun with the pronoun [2].\n\nThe overall findings indicate that all tested MT systems are indeed gender-biased. The accuracy of conveying the correct gender in the target language is generally poor, with most systems performing no better than a random guess [9].\n\nIn summary, the translation accuracy and gender bias vary significantly across different machine translation systems and languages. Generally, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is higher, and adding gender-specific adjectives can improve performance in some languages.

The table compares the original WinoMT corpus with a modified version where stereotypical gender adjectives are added. For example, adding \"pretty\" before a female entity and \"handsome\" before a male entity. This adjustment is designed to see if it can correct the profession bias by mixing signals. The results show that this approach improved performance in some languages, significantly reducing bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian.\n\nSpecifically, the table in `![The table shows the original values, adjusted values, and the difference between them for each entity.](image7)` provides detailed numbers:\n- For Spanish (ES), the original accuracy was 53.1%, and with the addition of adjectives, it increased to 63.5%, resulting in a change (Δ) of +10.4%.\n- For Russian (RU), the original accuracy was 37.7%, and with the addition of adjectives, it increased to 48.9%, resulting in a change (Δ) of +11.2%.\n- For Ukrainian (UK), the original accuracy was 38.4%, and with the addition of adjectives, it increased to 42.9%, resulting in a change (Δ) of +4.5%.\n\nThese improvements indicate that adding stereotypical gender adjectives can help reduce gender bias in machine translation, as the system is more likely to use the correct gender inflection when given additional context.\n\nAdditionally, the bar chart in `![The image is a bar chart displaying the accuracy of Google Translate's performance on gender translation for different languages, specifically comparing stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations.](image4)` shows the accuracy of Google Translate's performance on gender translation for different languages, comparing stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations.

When the model is trained on the original distractors and evaluated on adversarial distractors, the F1 score drops significantly from 67.08 to 46.84 [4]. However, if the model is re-trained on adversarially selected distractors, the F1 score increases to 60.10 on the same adversarial distractors [4].

For example, the single-paragraph BERT model achieves 39.12 F1 with 500 retrieved paragraphs but improves to 53.12 F1 when additional gold paragraphs are provided [8]. This suggests that better retrieval methods for multi-hop questions could significantly improve performance.\n\n![The table displays the F1 scores for various settings related to a task, presumably in the context of natural language processing or machine learning, judging by the terms used.](image7)\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies, such as using adversarial distractors and filtering by entity type, have a significant impact on F1 scores. Training with adversarial distractors and improving retrieval methods can help the model perform better in both multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks."}

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the original ARCT dataset, which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance was found to be largely due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset. Specifically, BERT relied heavily on cue words, particularly \"not,\" in the warrants [2].\n\nTo address this issue, an adversarial dataset was constructed by negating the claims and inverting the labels, thereby mirroring the distribution of statistical cues over both labels [8]. This transformation eliminated the spurious signals that BERT and other models were exploiting.\n\nWhen BERT was evaluated on the adversarial test set, its performance dropped dramatically. The mean and median accuracy fell to around 50%, with a maximum of 53% [6]. This is evident from the results in the table, where BERT's performance metrics are as follows:\n- Mean: 0.504 ± 0.01\n- Median: 0.505\n- Max: 0.533\n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set shows a significant drop, with mean, median, and max scores indicating near-random accuracy.](image3)\n\nThis drastic reduction in performance indicates that BERT has not learned genuine argument comprehension but was instead relying on statistical cues. The adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation, eliminating the spurious signals and revealing the true capabilities of the model [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset is not indicative of true understanding, and it performs at random levels when spurious cues are removed."}

The results are summarized as follows:\n\n- **Top-5 random sampling (n=2500 per relation)**: This method reports an average score of 53.27 across all relations.\n- **Top-10 random sampling (n=5000 per relation)**: This method has lower scores than Top-5 random sampling, with an average of 43.61.\n- **Beam search - 2 beams (n=1000 per relation)**: This method shows improved scores over random sampling, with the highest score of 84.00 for xAttr and an average of 63.29.\n- **Beam search - 5 beams (n=2500 per relation)**: Scores are lower than with 2 beams, averaging 57.57.\n- **Beam search - 10 beams (n=5000 per relation)**: Further reduction in scores, averaging 56.45.\n- **Greedy decoding (n=500 per relation)**: Generally, this method has the highest scores among automated methods, especially for oWant, xIntent, xNeed, xReact, xWant, and an average of 77.53.\n- **Human validation of gold ATOMIC**: Serves as the positive control with high scores across all relations, averaging 86.18.\n\nFrom these results, we observe that greedy decoding performs best among automated methods but still does not reach the performance level of human validation. `![{Greedy decoding performs best among automated methods, but still does not reach the performance level of human validation.}](image5)`\n\n### Variations in Training Data Percentages\n\nThe impact of varying the amount of training data on the model's performance is also evaluated. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Perplexity (PPL)**: Lower perplexity indicates better performance. The PPL values decrease as the amount of training data increases, with the lowest PPL of 11.13 for the full training data with pre-trained weights.\n- **BLEU-2**: This metric evaluates the quality of text, and the BLEU-2 scores increase with more training data, reaching the highest value of 14.34 for the full training data with pre-trained weights.\n- **N/T ° (novelty or type)**: The highest score of 9.54 is observed with 10% of the training data.\n- **N/U ° (novelty or uniqueness)**: The highest score of 58.34 is also observed with 10% of the training data.\n\nThese results indicate that even with only 10% of the available training data, the model can produce generations that are coherent, adequate, and novel. Using only 1% of the training data clearly diminishes the quality of the generated knowledge, with significantly lower observed results across both quality and novelty metrics. `![{Even with only 10% of the available training data, the model can produce generations that are coherent, adequate, and novel.}](image8)`\n\nIn conclusion, greedy decoding performs best among the automated methods but still falls short of human validation. Additionally, using 10% of the training data can achieve high performance in terms of novelty and coherence, while full training data with pre-trained weights yields the best overall performance."}

The metrics used for this evaluation include perplexity (PPL), classifier score, and novelty metrics such as N/T\\(_{sro}\\) and N/T\\(_{o}\\).\n\nFirst, let's look at the accuracy of the models. According to the results in Table 11, the COMET model shows superior performance across most metrics [5]. Specifically, the COMET model has the lowest perplexity (4.32) and the highest classifier score (95.25). This indicates that the model is highly confident in its predictions and that the generated tuples are scored as correct by the pre-trained Bilinear AVG model developed by Li et al. (2016) [3]. The high classifier score suggests that the generated knowledge is of high quality.\n\n![The table presents performance metrics of two models, COMET and COMET (+ hierarchy meta-tokens), across various categories. The categories listed are: oEffect, oReact, oWant, xAttr, xEffect, xIntent, xNeed, xReact, xWant, and Total.](image8)\n\nNext, let's examine the novelty of the generated tuples. The COMET model generates a significant amount of novel knowledge, with 59.25% of the generated tuples not present in the training set. Additionally, 3.75% of the \\(o\\) nodes are novel, indicating that the model can create new nodes to extend the size of the knowledge graph [1].\n\n![The image is a graph showing two curves. The x-axis represents the edit distance, ranging from 0 to 1. The y-axis on the left represents the percentage of novel tuples with an edit distance greater than or equal to a given value, while the y-axis on the right represents classifier accuracy.](image6)\n\nThe graph in Image 6 shows the relationship between the edit distance and the percentage of novel tuples. As the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples generally decreases, but the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%. This implies that even when the generated tuples are significantly different from the training data, they are still considered correct by the classifier.\n\nIn summary, the COMET model outperforms other models in terms of both accuracy and novelty on the ConceptNet dataset. The high accuracy and significant generation of novel knowledge suggest that the COMET model is highly effective in producing high-quality and diverse commonsense knowledge."}

This is particularly effective for open vocabulary models, which consider every unique combination of characters differently, whereas word-only models treat all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words alike [8].\n\nThe image `![{Closed and open vocabulary models show different sensitivities and WERs under various backoff strategies.}](image6)` provides a detailed comparison of the performance of closed vocabulary (word-only) and open vocabulary (char/word+char/word-piece) models under different backoff strategies.

For word-only models, the Pass-through and Neutral strategies have similar sensitivity and WER, while the Background strategy has a slightly lower WER but higher sensitivity. For char-only models, the Background strategy has the lowest WER and sensitivity, followed by the Neutral strategy, with the Pass-through strategy having the highest WER and sensitivity.\n\nIn summary, the closed vocabulary models (word-only) have lower sensitivity and WER with the Neutral backoff strategy, while the open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece) benefit more from the Background and Neutral backoff strategies, which significantly reduce both sensitivity and WER."}

According to the table in `image1`:\n- **Standard Condition:**\n  - **BiDAF:** Test (42.9), Test* (49.7)\n  - **FastQA:** Test (25.7), Test* (27.2)\n\n- **Gold Chain Condition:**\n  - **BiDAF:** Test* (57.9), Test* (63.4)\n  - **FastQA:** Test (44.5), Test* (53.5)\n\nIn the standard condition, BiDAF outperforms FastQA with a significant margin. In the gold chain condition, where only relevant documents are used, both models improve, but BiDAF still outperforms FastQA.\n\nNext, for the MedHop dataset, the same table shows:\n- **Standard Condition:**\n  - **BiDAF:** Test (47.8), Test* (61.2)\n  - **FastQA:** Test (23.1), Test* (24.5)\n\n- **Gold Chain Condition:**\n  - **BiDAF:** Test (86.4), Test* (89.8)\n  - **FastQA:** Test (54.6), Test* (59.2)\n\nAgain, BiDAF outperforms FastQA in both the standard and gold chain conditions. The improvement is more pronounced in the gold chain condition, indicating that BiDAF is better at leveraging the relevant information when it is available.\n\nAdditionally, the masked versions of these models (where the answer expressions are replaced with placeholders) also show a similar trend. For example, in the masked setup:\n- **WikiHop:**\n  - **BiDAF mask:** Test (54.5), Test* (59.8)\n  - **FastQA mask:** Test (35.8), Test* (38.0)\n\n- **MedHop:**\n  - **BiDAF mask:** Test (33.7), Test* (42.9)\n  - **FastQA mask:** Test (31.3), Test* (30.6)\n\nIn the masked setup, BiDAF continues to outperform FastQA, though the gap narrows slightly. This suggests that BiDAF is more robust in handling masked data, which is consistent with the hypothesis that its iterative latent interactions help in integrating information across documents [5][6].\n\nFurthermore, the table in `image2` provides additional insights:\n- **WikiHop:**\n  - **BiDAF:** 54.5 (test), 59.8 (test*)\n  - **FastQA:** 35.8 (test), 38.0 (test*)\n\n- **MedHop:**\n  - **BiDAF:** 33.7 (test), 42.9 (test*)\n  - **FastQA:** 31.3 (test), 30.6 (test*)\n\nThese results reinforce the earlier findings, showing that BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA across both datasets and test conditions.\n\nIn summary, BiDAF generally performs better than FastQA across different datasets and test conditions, particularly in the gold chain and masked setups, due to its ability to integrate information across multiple documents [5][6]."}

According to [8], Seq2Seq models tend to produce shorter sentences with more common words. The ConvAI2 dataset shows that the Seq2Seq model responses have lower word and character counts and use fewer rare words than human responses. The RetNRef model (using the Memory Network retriever) makes some improvements, such as doubling the use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) and smaller gains for words with frequency less than 1000, but still does not match human statistics. The RetNRef++ model, which boosts the use of the retrieval, brings the statistics much closer to human ones. \n\n`![{Word Count, Character Count, and Rare Word Percentage for different methods.}](image4)`\n\n### Performance Metrics\nThe performance metrics, including engagingness, fluency, consistency, and persona, are also evaluated. From [3] and [4], the RetNRef variants, particularly RetNRef++, outperform Seq2Seq and Memory Networks in terms of engagingness. The results in Table 4 show that all RetNRef variants have superior engagingness scores compared to Seq2Seq, with RetNRef++ slightly outperforming the retriever it conditions on. However, RetNRef++ is weaker at using the persona than Seq2Seq.\n\n`![{Comparison of different methods based on Engagingness, Fluency, Consistency, and Persona.}](image3)`\n\n### Conversational Abilities\nIn terms of conversational abilities, the RetNRef++ model provides more engaging conversations according to human judgments, as mentioned in [1]. It has similar statistics to human utterances and is more engaging. The model can effectively learn when to choose the retrieval utterance and when to generate instead, as shown in [6]. This is illustrated in the example dialogues in Tables 7 and 8, where longer sentences with more nuanced entity information come from attending to the retriever, while the generator can produce shorter, contextually appropriate replies.\n\n`![{Conversation simulation between two people and three different response systems: Seq2Seq, MemNet, and RetNRef⁺.}](image1)`\n\n### Overlap and Novelty\nThe overlap between retrieved and generated sentences is another important metric. [9] indicates that RetNRef++ has over 80% word overlap with the retriever output around half the time, whereas Seq2Seq and RetNRef very rarely overlap with the retriever. This shows that RetNRef++ uses the retriever but can also generate novel content when needed, which a standard retriever cannot.\n\n`![{Comparison of methods based on their performance categorized by different percentage ranges.}](image2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the RetNRef++ model outperforms other methods in terms of word statistics, engagingness, and the ability to generate more human-like conversations. It effectively balances the use of retrieval and generation, producing longer, more nuanced sentences with a higher use of rare words, making it more engaging and closer to human conversational abilities."}

This reduction can be attributed to several factors. \n\nFirstly, increased amortization across various categories reduced the net carrying amounts. For example, **Developed Technology** saw its accumulated amortization rise from $(72) million in 2019 to $(111) million in 2020, which lowered its net carrying amount from $220 million to $194 million. Similarly, **Favorable Contracts and Leases, Net** dropped from a net carrying amount of $89 million in 2019 to $81 million in 2020 due to higher accumulated amortization, moving from $(24) million to $(32) million [2].\n\nAdditionally, while some categories like **Trade Names** showed minimal changes, the overall increase in accumulated amortization from $(113) million in 2019 to $(162) million in 2020 contributed significantly to the decline in total net carrying amounts [2].\n\nMoreover, the visual representation of these figures is available for review:\n![Finite-lived intangible assets showed a decrease in net carrying amounts primarily due to increased amortization](image2)\n\nThis analysis reveals that the primary contributing factor to the change in net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets was the increase in accumulated amortization over the year.\n\nIn conclusion, the net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets decreased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to increased amortization expenses across various asset categories [2]."}

Foreign exchange risk is highlighted as the most significant financial risk for Novo Nordisk, with potential impacts on earnings, cash flows, and overall financial results [12]. The company actively mitigates these risks through forward exchange contracts and currency options [5].\n\nA key insight into the impact of exchange rate fluctuations can be seen in the sensitivity analysis provided: an immediate 5% change in major currencies versus EUR and DKK would significantly affect operating profit [6]. For instance, under a 5% increase scenario in 2020, \"Other comprehensive income\" was negatively impacted by (1,893) million DKK, while the \"Income statement\" saw a positive impact of 299 million DKK, resulting in a total effect of (1,594) million DKK `![Sensitivity analysis showing impacts of currency changes](image6)`. This demonstrates that exchange rate movements have a direct and substantial influence on comprehensive income.\n\nRegarding cash flow hedges, deferred gains and losses are transferred to financial income or expenses within the next 12 months [7]. The table detailing reserve movements over several years shows entries related to exchange rate adjustments and cash flow hedges under \"Other comprehensive income\" [7]. Notably, there were significant transfers of cash flow hedge reserves to intangible assets by the end of 2020 `![Reserve movement details including cash flow hedges](image7)`, indicating active management and realization of hedging impacts.\n\nFurthermore, examining derivative financial instruments reveals detailed contract amounts and fair values at year-end, categorized into cash flow and fair value hedges `![Breakdown of derivative financial instruments](image2)`. These figures reflect ongoing efforts to hedge forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities effectively, aligning with their policy to cover the majority of total currency exposure [5].\n\nIn summary, changes in exchange rates significantly affected Novo Nordisk’s comprehensive income, particularly through other comprehensive income components, while cash flow hedges were managed via strategic use of derivatives, impacting financial statements within defined periods. \n\n**The changes in exchange rates notably influenced Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income, primarily affecting other comprehensive income, and cash flow hedges were actively managed using derivatives, impacting financial outcomes within specified timeframes.**"}

According to the data provided in image8, there was a notable increase in AUM over the three years. Specifically, Total AUM grew from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020 [image8]. This growth is observed across all categories: Equity increased from $111 billion to $174 billion, Fixed Income remained relatively stable but showed an increase to $86 billion in 2020, Alternative/Other rose from $131 billion to $145 billion, and Liquidity jumped significantly from $158 billion to $252 billion [image8].\n\nThe increase in AUM would typically contribute positively to the firm's revenues, assuming fee rates remain constant. However, when we examine the fee rates presented in image5, we see a general trend of decreasing rates over the same period. For instance, the fee rate for Fixed Income dropped from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020, Alternative/Other decreased from 66 bps to 58 bps, and the overall Total AUM fee rate fell from 47 bps to 42 bps [image5]. The Equity category was the only one that maintained a steady fee rate at 76 bps throughout these years [image5].\n\nDespite the decline in fee rates, the substantial growth in AUM likely had a positive impact on the firm’s revenues. As noted in text quote [2], asset management revenues increased by 15% in 2020 compared to the prior year, driven by higher average AUM due to strong investment performance and positive net flows [2]. \n\n![Summary of AUM Growth](image8)\n![Summary of Fee Rate Decline](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, while fee rates generally declined from 2018 to 2020, the significant increase in AUM likely resulted in higher overall revenues for the firm due to the larger base of assets managed."}

This increase can be attributed to several components:\n\n- **Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses** under \"Insurance and Other\" increased from $79,854 million in 2020 to $86,664 million in 2021.\n- **Unearned premiums** also increased from $21,395 million in 2020 to $23,512 million in 2021.\n- **Life, annuity, and health insurance benefits** rose from $21,616 million in 2020 to $22,452 million in 2021.\n- **Other policyholder liabilities** increased from $8,670 million in 2020 to $9,330 million in 2021.\n- **Income taxes, principally deferred** increased significantly from $74,098 million in 2020 to $90,243 million in 2021.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease in **notes payable and other borrowings** under \"Insurance and Other,\" which decreased from $41,522 million in 2020 to $39,272 million in 2021.\n\n### Shareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity at Berkshire Hathaway increased from $506.2 billion in 2020 to $569.2 billion in 2021 [1]. The key factors contributing to this increase include:\n\n- **Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders** was $89.8 billion in 2021, which included after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [1].\n- **Consolidated shareholders’ equity** at December 31, 2021, was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020 [1].\n\n### Key Factors Contributing to Changes\n\n1. **Investment Gains:**\n   - The significant increase in net earnings was largely due to after-tax gains on investments, which contributed $61.6 billion to the net earnings [1].\n\n2. **Deferred Tax Liabilities:**\n   - The substantial increase in deferred tax liabilities (from $74,098 million to $90,243 million) reflects the impact of changes in tax laws and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities [image1].\n\n3. **Operating Performance:**\n   - The company's strong operating performance, particularly in its insurance and reinsurance businesses, led to higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, unearned premiums, and other policyholder liabilities [image1].\n\n4. **Capital Management:**\n   - The reduction in notes payable and other borrowings indicates effective capital management and debt repayment strategies [image1].\n\n5. **Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Changes:**\n   - Foreign currency exchange rate changes affected the value of Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt, leading to a decrease in parent company debt outstanding [5].\n\nIn summary, the increase in liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was driven by strong investment gains, higher deferred tax liabilities, and robust operating performance, while being offset by strategic debt management and foreign currency effects. \n\n![The table provides a breakdown of liabilities and shareholders' equity for a company, comparing figures from the years 2021 and 2020.

Despite this, diluted earnings per share (EPS) grew from $10.24 in 2016 to $12.31 in 2020, reflecting the impact of share repurchases on reducing the number of outstanding shares.

The effective tax rate also dropped to 17% in 2020, compared to 34% in 2019, primarily due to a change in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates [9].\n\n### Financial Implications\nThe reduction in Capex and the tax benefits had several financial implications:\n\n1. **Cost Management:** The decrease in Capex helped the Corporation manage its cash flow and reduce debt. By issuing $23 billion of long-term debt and implementing cost reductions, ExxonMobil ended 2020 with $68 billion in gross debt, with intentions to reduce this over time [2].\n\n2. **Tax Benefits:** The tax benefit of $5.6 billion in 2020 provided a significant boost to the Corporation's financial position, helping to offset some of the losses from lower realized prices and earnings [9].\n\n3. **Operational Flexibility:** The lower Capex and tax benefits allowed ExxonMobil to maintain operational flexibility and invest in strategic areas, such as environmental expenditures, which increased to approximately $4.9 billion in 2021 and 2022 [3][7].\n\nIn summary, ExxonMobil's capital expenditures decreased from $23.4 billion in 2019 to $21.4 billion in 2020, and the Corporation experienced a tax benefit of $5.6 billion in 2020, leading to improved financial flexibility and a focus on cost management.

In 2021, U.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. This significant increase was due to higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, higher sales volumes, and higher asset sales gains [4]. Similarly, international upstream reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $825 million in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, and favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher tax charges and lower sales volumes [7].\n\nIn the downstream segment, U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020, driven by higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses [12]. International downstream, however, saw a decrease in earnings from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects [2].\n\nThese improvements in both upstream and downstream segments contributed to an overall positive change in net income. To get a more precise view of the net income and return on stockholders' equity, we can refer to the financial data provided. The table in `![{financial data over three years: 2021, 2020, and 2019}](image2)` shows the financial metrics, including net income and return on stockholders' equity, for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019.

From the provided data, we can see the following:\n\n- **2019:** $7,683 million\n- **2020:** $7,145 million\n- **2021:** $6,674 million\n\nThere was a decrease in net interest income from 2019 to 2021. The primary factors contributing to this change include:\n\n1. **Lower Interest Rates:**\n   - The cost of funds decreased, which reduced the interest expense. For example, the interest expense decreased from $1,731 million in 2019 to $717 million in 2021 [7].\n   - However, the lower interest rates also affected the interest income, as seen by the decrease from $9,414 million in 2019 to $7,391 million in 2021 [7].\n\n2. **Impact of Interest Rate Changes:**\n   - A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on annual net interest income of up to $206 million [3]. This indicates that even small changes in interest rates can significantly affect net interest income.\n   - Interest rate changes can also influence customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments [3].\n\n### Card Member Receivables\nCard member receivables represent the outstanding amounts owed by customers on their credit cards. The data shows the following:\n\n- **2019:** $22.8 billion\n- **2020:** $18.7 billion\n- **2021:** $22.4 billion\n\nThe card member receivables decreased in 2020 but increased again in 2021. The contributing factors for these changes include:\n\n1. **Economic Conditions:**\n   - In 2020, the global macroeconomic outlook deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a decrease in receivables. This was partially offset by decreases in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans [7].\n   - By 2021, there was a recovery in the economy, reflected in an improvement in the unemployment rate projections, which led to an increase in receivables. However, this increase was partially offset by higher outstanding receivable balances [9].\n\n2. **Customer Behavior:**\n   - The improved economic conditions and better portfolio quality in 2021 led to more spending and higher receivables. The increase in commercial billed business of 21% in 2021, reflecting the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the rise in receivables [10].\n\n3. **Reserve Releases:**\n   - Provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily driven by reserve releases in 2021. This was due to improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook, which in turn allowed for higher receivables [7].\n\n### Summary\n- **Net Interest Income:**\n  - Decreased from $7,683 million in 2019 to $6,674 million in 2021.\n  - Contributing factors: Lower interest rates, which reduced both interest income and interest expense, and the impact of interest rate changes on customer behavior.\n  - ![Net interest income and adjusted net interest income have generally decreased from 2019 to 2021](image6)\n\n- **Card Member Receivables:**\n  - Decreased from $22.8 billion in 2019 to $18.7 billion in 2020, then increased to $22.4 billion in 2021.\n  - Contributing factors: Economic conditions, customer behavior, and reserve releases.\n  - ![Card member receivables increased from 2020 to 2021, with a 20% increase overall](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021 due to lower interest rates, while card member receivables decreased in 2020 and then increased in 2021, driven by economic recovery and improved portfolio quality."}

Specifically:\n- **2018:** $3,562 million (22.3% effective tax rate)\n- **2019:** $3,742 million (20.8% effective tax rate)\n- **2020:** $4,973 million (24.0% effective tax rate)\n\nThis trend can be seen in the following table, which breaks down the components of the tax provision:\n\n- **Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate:**\n  - 2020: $4,356 million (21.0%)\n  - 2019: $3,776 million (21.0%)\n  - 2018: $3,348 million (21.0%)\n\n- **State income taxes, net of federal benefit:**\n  - 2020: $315 million (1.5%)\n  - 2019: $271 million (1.5%)\n  - 2018: $168 million (1.0%)\n\n- **Share-based awards — excess tax benefit:**\n  - 2020: $(130) million (-0.6%)\n  - 2019: $(132) million (-0.7%)\n  - 2018: $(161) million (-1.0%)\n\n- **Non-deductible compensation:**\n  - 2020: $134 million (0.7%)\n  - 2019: $119 million (0.7%)\n  - 2018: $117 million (0.7%)\n\n- **Health insurance tax:**\n  - 2020: $626 million (3.0%)\n  - 2019: Not applicable\n  - 2018: $552 million (3.5%)\n\n- **Foreign rate differential:**\n  - 2020: $(164) million (-0.8%)\n  - 2019: $(214) million (-1.2%)\n  - 2018: $(203) million (-1.3%)\n\n- **Other, net:**\n  - 2020: $(164) million (-0.8%)\n  - 2019: $(78) million (-0.5%)\n  - 2018: $(259) million (-1.6%)\n\n- **Provision for income taxes:**\n  - 2020: $4,973 million (24.0%)\n  - 2019: $3,742 million (20.8%)\n  - 2018: $3,562 million (22.3%)\n\n![The table displays financial data related to income taxes over three years (2020, 2019, and 2018), expressed in millions and percentages.](image1)\n\n### Contribution of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities play a significant role in the overall tax provision. The changes in these balances can impact the effective tax rate and the total provision for income taxes. Here are the details for 2020 and 2019:\n\n- **Deferred Income Tax Assets:**\n  - **Accrued expenses and allowances:** $815 million (2020), $654 million (2019)\n  - **U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards:** $276 million (2020), $260 million (2019)\n  - **Share-based compensation:** $98 million (2020), $97 million (2019)\n  - **Nondeductible liabilities:** $252 million (2020), $184 million (2019)\n  - **Non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards:** $340 million (2020), $420 million (2019)\n  - **Lease liability:** $1,200 million (2020), $892 million (2019)\n  - **Other-domestic:** $126 million (2020), $179 million (2019)\n  - **Other-non-U.S.:** $454 million (2020), $329 million (2019)\n  - **Subtotal:** $3,561 million (2020), $3,015 million (2019)\n  - **Less: valuation allowances:** $(170) million (2020), $(147) million (2019)\n  - **Total deferred income tax assets:** $3,391 million (2020), $2,868 million (2019)\n\n- **Deferred Income Tax Liabilities:**\n  - **U.S. federal and state intangible assets:** $(2,588) million (2020), $(2,370) million (2019)\n  - **Non-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets:** $(606) million (2020), $(735) million (2019)\n  - **Capitalized software:** $(731) million (2020), $(683) million (2019)\n  - **Depreciation and amortization:** $(346) million (2020), $(301) million (2019)\n  - **Prepaid expenses:** $(216) million (2020), $(172) million (2019)\n  - **Outside basis in partnerships:** $(342) million (2020), $(317) million (2019)\n  - **Lease right-of-use asset:** $(1,179) million (2020), $(887) million (2019)\n  - **Net unrealized gains on investments:** $(400) million (2020), $(177) million (2019)\n  - **Other-non-U.S.:** $(350) million (2020), $(219) million (2019)\n  - **Total deferred income tax liabilities:** $(6,758) million (2020), $(5,861) million (2019)\n\n- **Net Deferred Income Tax Liabilities:**\n  - **Net amount:** $(3,367) million (2020), $(2,993) million (2019)\n\n![The table displays deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019, measured in millions.](image8)\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Increase in Provision for Income Taxes:**\n  The increase in the provision for income taxes from 2018 to 2020 is primarily due to higher taxable income and specific tax items such as the health insurance tax in 2020, which added $626 million to the tax provision. Additionally, the decrease in share-based awards — excess tax benefit and the increase in non-deductible compensation also contributed to the higher tax provision.\n\n- **Impact of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities:**\n  The deferred income tax assets and liabilities have a significant impact on the effective tax rate. The increase in deferred income tax assets from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020, along with the corresponding increase in deferred income tax liabilities from $5,861 million to $6,758 million, indicates that the company is recognizing more future tax benefits and obligations. This can lead to fluctuations in the effective tax rate, as the net deferred tax liability increased from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the company's provision for income taxes increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher taxable income and specific tax items. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which also increased, contributed to the overall tax provision and effective tax rate."}

This suggests that other factors, such as the repayment or refinancing of long-term debt, may have contributed to the overall decrease in total debt. \n\nFor example, the company may have used cash flows or new borrowings to pay down some of its long-term debt, which would reduce the total debt while increasing current and noncurrent liabilities due to other obligations and accruals.\n\n![{This table shows a financial breakdown of liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019, divided into current and noncurrent categories.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the total current and noncurrent liabilities increased by $2,137 million and $2,438 million, respectively, from 2019 to 2020.

This increase was primarily due to higher earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. Specifically, the net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were $122 million, down from $475 million in 2019 [3]. These benefits in 2020 were mainly related to the conversion of employee share-based awards, while in 2019, they were associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [8].\n\n![Effective Tax Rate and Net Discrete Tax Provisions for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image5)\n\nRegarding compensation expenses, the total recognized in compensation expense increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020.

This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a reduction in operating earnings. The financial statements also highlight that excluding certain items, net income decreased by 24% in constant currencies [4].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss), also saw a decline.

Excluding strategic gains and charges, operating income decreased by 23% in constant currencies [9].\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: The other comprehensive income (loss) for 2020 was a loss of $104.1 million, compared to a gain of $126.8 million in 2019. This was mainly due to:\n   - Foreign currency translation adjustments, which resulted in a smaller gain in 2020 ($63.1 million) compared to 2019 ($174.3 million).\n   - Cash flow hedges, which resulted in a loss of $123.3 million in 2020, compared to a loss of $20.4 million in 2019.\n   - Defined benefit pension plans, which resulted in a loss of $43.9 million in 2020, compared to a loss of $27.1 million in 2019 [image1].\n\n3. **Impact of Strategic Gains and Charges**: In 2020, there were strategic gains of $274 million related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which reduced the company's ownership by about 6%. However, this was partly offset by the write-off of impaired software and other charges [7].\n\n4. **Tax Benefits and Changes**: The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 23.0%, including $50 million of income tax benefits due to new U.S. tax regulations and $48 million of income tax benefits related to the impact of a tax rate change in the U.K. [12].\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income decreased from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the operating income decline, changes in other comprehensive income, and the impact of strategic gains and charges."}

For example, in 2020, FLNA's operating profit increased by 24%, primarily due to net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring and impairment charges [6].\n\n- **QFNA (Quaker Foods North America)**:\n  - QFNA's operating profit decreased by 2% in 2020, with a decline in operating profit margin. This was driven by certain operating cost increases, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings [7].\n\n- **PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America)**:\n  - PBNA's operating profit grew by 23% in 2020, reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings, but this growth was reduced by 3 percentage points due to charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [11].\n\n- **LatAm (Latin America)**:\n  - The operating profit for LatAm also showed an increase, reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings, but it was partially offset by certain operating cost increases [9].\n\n- **Europe**:\n  - Europe's operating profit increased by 2%, primarily due to net revenue growth and productivity savings, but this was partially offset by certain operating cost increases [9].\n\n- **AMESA (Africa, Middle East, South Asia)**:\n  - AMESA's operating profit increased, reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings, but it was also impacted by certain operating cost increases [9].\n\n- **APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, and China)**:\n  - APAC's operating profit increased, reflecting net revenue growth and productivity savings, but it was also impacted by certain operating cost increases [9].\n\n### Distribution of Beverage and Food/Snack Categories\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions is as follows:\n\n- **LatAm**: \n  - 2020: 10% Beverage, 90% Food/Snack\n  - 2019: 10% Beverage, 90% Food/Snack\n  - 2018: 10% Beverage, 90% Food/Snack\n\n- **Europe**: \n  - 2020: 55% Beverage, 45% Food/Snack\n  - 2019: 55% Beverage, 45% Food/Snack\n  - 2018: 50% Beverage, 50% Food/Snack\n\n- **AMESA**: \n  - 2020: 30% Beverage, 70% Food/Snack\n  - 2019: 40% Beverage, 60% Food/Snack\n  - 2018: 45% Beverage, 55% Food/Snack\n\n- **APAC**: \n  - 2020: 25% Beverage, 75% Food/Snack\n  - 2019: 25% Beverage, 75% Food/Snack\n  - 2018: 25% Beverage, 75% Food/Snack\n\n- **PepsiCo**: \n  - 2020: 45% Beverage, 55% Food/Snack\n  - 2019: 45% Beverage, 55% Food/Snack\n  - 2018: 45% Beverage, 55% Food/Snack\n\n### Relationship Between Financial Performance and Category Distribution\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories can provide insights into the financial performance of each region. For instance, LatAm, which has a high percentage of food/snack sales (90%), saw consistent net revenue and operating profit growth. This suggests that the strong performance in the food/snack category may have contributed to the overall financial stability and growth in LatAm.\n\nIn contrast, Europe, which has a more balanced distribution between beverage and food/snack, experienced a slight shift towards a higher percentage of beverage sales (55% in 2020 compared to 50% in 2018). This shift, combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have influenced the modest 2% increase in operating profit, as the beverage segment might have faced more challenges during the pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, AMESA and APAC, which have a higher proportion of food/snack sales, also showed positive operating profit growth, indicating that the food/snack segment may have been more resilient or less affected by the pandemic compared to the beverage segment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely related to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. Divisions with a higher proportion of food/snack sales, such as LatAm, AMESA, and APAC, generally showed more consistent and robust financial performance, while those with a more balanced or higher proportion of beverage sales, like Europe, experienced more modest growth, likely due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n![The table displays the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.](image6)"}

This was a major factor driving the increase in cash inflows from financing activities. Additionally, there were substantial inflows from borrowings in the amount of €10,000 million and an additional financing of €850 million provided by the Siemens Group to finance the acquisition of Varian.

Additionally, cash outflows increased by €117 million due to additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, mainly resulting from investments for capacity expansions.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n- **Financing Activities**: The key driver was the financing of the Varian acquisition, which led to a significant increase in cash inflows.\n- **Investing Activities**: The primary driver was the acquisition of Varian, along with additional investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.\n\nThese changes are clearly reflected in the financial data, as shown in the following table:\n\n- **Cash Flows from Operating Activities**:\n  - 2021: €2,933 million\n  - 2020: €1,928 million\n\n- **Cash Flows from Investing Activities**:\n  - 2021: €-14,140 million\n  - 2020: €-1,912 million\n\n- **Cash Flows from Financing Activities**:\n  - 2021: €11,839 million\n  - 2020: €-249 million\n  ![{The table shows the significant increase in cash flows from financing activities and the substantial increase in cash outflows from investing activities in 2021.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the key factors driving the changes in cash flows from financing and investing activities in 2021 were the financing and acquisition of Varian, along with additional investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment."}

Let's break down the contributing factors:\n\n### Net Income\n- **2018**: $(1,063)$ million (loss) [3]\n- **2019**: $(775)$ million (loss) [3]\n- **2020**: $862$ million (income) [3]\n\nThe net income for 2020 was positive, which is a significant turnaround from the losses in 2018 and 2019. This improvement in net income is a major factor in the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\n### Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n- **Foreign currency translation adjustment**:\n  - **2018**: $(42)$ million (loss) [3]\n  - **2019**: $(28)$ million (loss) [3]\n  - **2020**: $399$ million (income) [3]\n\nThe foreign currency translation adjustment also contributed positively to the comprehensive income in 2020. The large positive adjustment of $399$ million in 2020, compared to losses in the previous years, further enhanced the comprehensive income.\n\n### Noncontrolling Interests\n- **2018**: $(87)$ million (loss) [3]\n- **2019**: $87$ million (income) [3]\n- **2020**: $141$ million (income) [3]\n\nThe noncontrolling interests also had a positive impact on the comprehensive income in 2020. The increase in noncontrolling interests from a loss in 2018 to an income in 2020, with a significant rise to $141$ million, further contributed to the overall improvement.\n\n### Financial Performance and Revenue Growth\nThe company's revenue growth and operational efficiency improvements also played a crucial role. For example, the total revenues increased from $21,461$ million in 2018 to $31,536$ million in 2020, as shown in the following table:\n\n- **Total revenues:**\n  - **2018**: $21,461$ million\n  - **2019**: $24,578$ million\n  - **2020**: $31,536$ million\n  ![Total revenues for 2018, 2019, and 2020](image1)\n\nThis growth in revenues, particularly in automotive sales and regulatory credits, helped drive the overall financial performance.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved from a loss of $(1,018)$ million in 2018 to a profit of $1,120$ million in 2020. This significant improvement was driven by the positive net income, favorable foreign currency translation adjustments, and the positive impact of noncontrolling interests, along with strong revenue growth."}

The Upstream segment, which is more sensitive to crude oil prices, saw a substantial increase in earnings, turning from a loss in 2020 to a significant profit in 2021. The Downstream segment also improved, with both the US and international operations showing positive earnings in 2021 compared to a mixed performance in 2020.\n\n### Asset Values\n\n#### Upstream Segment\n- **2021:**\n  - United States: $41,870 million [8]\n  - International: $138,157 million [8]\n  - Goodwill: $4,385 million [8]\n  - Total Upstream: $184,412 million [8]\n\n- **2020:**\n  - United States: $42,431 million [8]\n  - International: $144,476 million [8]\n  - Goodwill: $4,402 million [8]\n  - Total Upstream: $191,309 million [8]\n\n#### Downstream Segment\n- **2021:**\n  - United States: $26,376 million [8]\n  - International: $18,848 million [8]\n  - Total Downstream: $45,224 million [8]\n\n- **2020:**\n  - United States: $23,490 million [8]\n  - International: $16,096 million [8]\n  - Total Downstream: $39,586 million [8]\n\nThe asset values show that the Upstream segment has significantly higher assets compared to the Downstream segment.

According to [8], net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are recognized in the income statement as financial income or expenses.\n   - The reversals of non-cash income statement items, as detailed in `image1`, show that there were significant non-cash adjustments, particularly in share-based payment costs and provisions, which impact the reported net profit.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet:**\n   - The increase in derivative financial instruments, as shown in `image3`, is reflected in the balance sheet under financial liabilities. These derivatives are used for hedging and other financial strategies, which help manage risk.\n   - The change in working capital, as seen in `image4`, affects the balance sheet by showing the liquidity and operational efficiency of the company. A more favorable change in working capital in 2020 compared to 2019 indicates better management of receivables, payables, and inventories.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - The cash flow changes, as detailed in `image4`, show the actual cash flows generated and used by the company. The improvement in the change in working capital, despite a larger outflow, indicates that the company managed its working capital more effectively in 2020.\n   - The cash flow from operating activities, as described in [12], converts income statement items from the accrual basis to the cash basis, providing a clearer picture of the company's cash generation and usage.\n\nIn summary, the increase in derivative financial instruments and the changes in cash flow, particularly in working capital, have a significant impact on the company's financial statements. The income statement reflects the gains or losses from derivatives, the balance sheet shows the financial position with respect to these instruments and working capital, and the cash flow statement provides insights into the company's liquidity and operational efficiency. \n\n![The table presents financial data in DKK million for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, focusing on the \"Reversals of non-cash income statement items.\"](image1)\n![The table shows financial liabilities (in DKK million) for the years 2020 and 2019, divided into different categories.](image3)\n![The table provides financial data in DKK million for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, presenting various components affecting working capital and cash flow.](image4)"}

Specifically, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points [9]. This decrease is primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases [9].\n\nThe table in image4 provides a breakdown of the financial figures, including what could be interpreted as SG&A expenses. The data shows:\n- **2022:**\n  - Top figure (possibly revenue or sales): $222,730\n  - Second figure (possibly expenses or cost of goods sold): $199,382\n  - Bottom figure (possibly profit): $23,348\n  - Percentage (possibly profit margin): 10.48%\n\n- **2021:**\n  - Top figure (possibly revenue or sales): $192,052\n  - Second figure (possibly expenses or cost of goods sold): $170,684\n  - Bottom figure (possibly profit): $21,368\n  - Percentage (possibly profit margin): 11.13%\n\n- **2020:**\n  - Top figure (possibly revenue or sales): $163,220\n  - Second figure (possibly expenses or cost of goods sold): $144,939\n  - Bottom figure (possibly profit): $18,281\n  - Percentage (possibly profit margin): 11.20%\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the company's SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales have been decreasing, which aligns with the narrative provided in the text.\n\n### Interest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net, saw an increase in 2022, primarily due to higher global interest rates [3]. The table in image1 provides some financial figures, which could represent interest income and other, net.

This indicates an increasing trend in interest income and other, net, over the three years, consistent with the information that higher global interest rates contributed to the increase [3].\n\n### Conclusion\n- **SG&A Expenses:** The SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19.\n- **Interest Income and Other, Net:** There was an increasing trend in interest income and other, net, from 2020 to 2022, driven by higher global interest rates.\n\n![Total financial figures for 2022, 2021, and 2020, showing an increase in interest income and other, net](image1)\n\nIn summary, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased, while interest income and other, net, increased from 2020 to 2022."}

The table in `image5` provides a detailed breakdown of these components:\n\n- **Net Income:**\n  - 2020: $5,185,313\n  - 2019: $4,846,241\n  - 2018: $4,214,594\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax:**\n  - 2020: $278,740\n  - 2019: $(264,406)\n  - 2018: $(481,387)\n\n- **Total Comprehensive Income:**\n  - 2020: $5,472,296\n  - 2019: $4,575,086\n  - 2018: $3,730,974\n\nFrom this data, we can see that:\n- **Net Income** increased steadily from 2018 to 2020.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)** was negative in 2018 and 2019 but turned positive in 2020.\n- **Total Comprehensive Income** also showed a steady increase, with a significant jump in 2020 due to the positive other comprehensive income.\n\n### Components of Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of other comprehensive income include foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. These are detailed in `image5`:\n\n- **Foreign Currency Translation:**\n  - 2020: $197,696\n  - 2019: $(132,707)\n  - 2018: $(305,225)\n\n- **Defined Benefit Plans:**\n  - 2020: $57,100\n  - 2019: $(253,039)\n  - 2018: $21,335\n\n- **Cash Flow Hedges:**\n  - 2020: $24,721\n  - 2019: $123,003\n  - 2018: $(198,645)\n\n- **Investments:**\n  - 2020: $(777)\n  - 2019: $(1,663)\n  - 2018: $1,148\n\nThese components show that the positive other comprehensive income in 2020 was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency translation and defined benefit plan adjustments.\n\n### Changes in Shareholders' Equity\nThe changes in shareholders' equity are reflected in the Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity Statements, as shown in `image3` and `image8`. Key elements include:\n\n- **Net Income:**\n  - 2020: Increased Retained Earnings by $5,107,839, contributing to Total Shareholders’ Equity.\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Income:**\n  - 2020: Added $278,740, adjusted for Noncontrolling Interests ($8,243) totaling $286,983.\n\n- **Share-Based Compensation Expense:**\n  - 2020: Increased Restricted Share Units by 1,118,284 and Additional Paid-in Capital by $79,522, totaling $1,197,806.\n\n- **Dividends:**\n  - 2020: Paid out $2,112,457, leading to a decrease in equity.\n\n- **Other Items:**\n  - 2020: An adjustment of $778, with an overall effect of $348 on equity after accounting for Noncontrolling Interests (-$1,126).\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, Accenture's comprehensive income showed a positive trend from 2018 to 2020, driven by increasing net income and a positive other comprehensive income in 2020.

According to [5], the remuneration for Managing/Executive/Whole-time Directors is decided by the Board and recommended for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Non-executive directors do not draw any remuneration from the Company except for a sitting fee of Rs. 5,000 for each meeting of the Board and the Board Committee they attend.\n\nThe specific remuneration details are outlined in the table provided in `![{The table provides details of financial compensation for directors, including salary, perquisites, commission, and sitting fees.}](image5)`. This table lists the monetary values for each category of compensation, including salary, perquisites, commission, and sitting fees for attending meetings. The total compensation for each director is also provided.\n\n### Company's Financial Performance and Market Conditions\n\nThe company's financial performance and market conditions during the financial year 2002-03 can be assessed through several pieces of information:\n\n1. **Financial Statements and Audit Report**:\n   - The audit report [1] confirms that the balance sheet, profit and loss account, and cash flow statement comply with the requirements of the accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the company's state of affairs as of March 31, 2003.\n   - The audit was conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in India, ensuring reasonable assurance about the financial statements being free of material misstatement [7].\n\n2. **Market Performance**:\n   - The line graph in `![{The image is a line graph comparing the performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex over a series of months from April 2002 to March 2003.}](image2)` shows the performance of Godfrey Phillips India (GPI) compared to the BSE Sensex. Both indices fluctuate, with GPI ranging between 84 and 106, and the BSE Sensex between 98 and 84. This indicates that the company's performance was somewhat volatile but generally in line with the broader market.\n\n3. **Monthly High and Low Prices**:\n   - The table in `![{The table displays the monthly high and low prices (in Rupees) over a span from April 2002 to March 2003.}](image4)` provides the monthly high and low prices of the company's shares. For example, in April 2002, the share price ranged from a high of 390.00 to a low of 340.00, and in March 2003, it ranged from 329.00 to 286.00. This data shows the volatility in the share price over the year.\n\n### Relationship Between Compensation and Performance\n\n- **Compensation Structure**: The remuneration structure, as detailed in `![{The table provides details of financial compensation for directors, including salary, perquisites, commission, and sitting fees.}](image5)`, is designed to align with the company's performance. The compensation includes a base salary, perquisites, and commissions, which are likely tied to the company's financial health and market performance.\n- **Performance Indicators**: The audit report [1] and the financial statements indicate that the company maintained proper books of accounts and provided a true and fair view of its financial position. The market performance, as shown in `![{The image is a line graph comparing the performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex over a series of months from April 2002 to March 2003.}](image2)`, suggests that the company's performance was consistent with the broader market, which would have influenced the directors' compensation.\n- **Share Price Volatility**: The share price data in `![{The table displays the monthly high and low prices (in Rupees) over a span from April 2002 to March 2003.}](image4)` shows that while there was some volatility, the overall trend was within a reasonable range, indicating that the company's financial performance and market conditions were stable enough to support the remuneration structure.\n\nIn summary, the remuneration structures for directors in the financial year 2002-03 were designed to align with the company's financial performance and market conditions, with the compensation reflecting the stability and consistency of the company's financial and market performance."}

This increase of $21,461 million can be broken down into several components:\n\n- **Insurance and Other:**\n  - Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $79,854 million to $86,664 million.\n  - Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts decreased from $40,966 million to $38,256 million.\n  - Unearned premiums increased from $21,395 million to $23,512 million.\n  - Life, annuity, and health insurance benefits increased from $21,616 million to $22,452 million.\n  - Other policyholder liabilities increased from $8,670 million to $9,330 million.\n  - Accounts payable, accruals, and other liabilities remained relatively stable at $30,376 million.\n  - Aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues decreased slightly from $5,856 million to $5,849 million.\n  - Notes payable and other borrowings decreased from $41,522 million to $39,272 million.\n  - **Total Insurance and Other:** Increased from $250,223 million to $255,711 million.\n\n- **Railroad, Utilities, and Energy:**\n  - Accounts payable, accruals, and other liabilities increased from $15,224 million to $15,696 million.\n  - Regulatory liabilities decreased from $7,475 million to $7,214 million.\n  - Notes payable and other borrowings decreased from $75,373 million to $74,990 million.\n  - **Total Railroad, Utilities, and Energy:** Decreased slightly from $98,072 million to $97,900 million.\n\n- **Income taxes, principally deferred:**\n  - Increased significantly from $74,098 million to $90,243 million.\n\n### Shareholders' Equity\nThe consolidated shareholders' equity at December 31, 2021, was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020 [10]. This significant increase in shareholders' equity is primarily due to the substantial net earnings and after-tax gains on investments. Specifically, net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $89.8 billion, including after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [10].\n\n### Net Earnings and Comprehensive Income\n- **Net Earnings:**\n  - 2021: $90,807 million\n  - 2020: $43,253 million\n  - 2019: $81,792 million\n\n- **Comprehensive Income:**\n  - 2021: $91,041 million\n  - 2020: $44,272 million\n  - 2019: $81,594 million\n\n- **Comprehensive Income Attributable to Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders:**\n  - 2021: $90,011 million\n  - 2020: $43,521 million\n  - 2019: $81,189 million\n\n### Analysis\nThe increase in total liabilities, particularly in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the significant rise in deferred income taxes, contributed to the overall increase in liabilities. However, this was offset by a decrease in certain liabilities such as notes payable and other borrowings, and regulatory liabilities.\n\nThe substantial increase in shareholders' equity is directly linked to the strong net earnings and comprehensive income for 2021. The net earnings of $90,807 million, along with the after-tax gains on investments, significantly boosted the shareholders' equity. The comprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income, also saw a substantial increase, reflecting the overall financial strength and performance of the company.\n\nIn summary, the increase in total liabilities and the significant growth in shareholders' equity are closely tied to the robust net earnings and comprehensive income reported in 2021. The financial performance and strategic management of liabilities and equity have contributed to the overall financial health and stability of the company.\n\n![{Total liabilities increased from $422,393 million to $443,854 million, while shareholders' equity grew from $443,250 million to $506,200 million.}](image4)"}

The company aims to balance stability, growth, and efficiency, which are the three pillars of its financial strategy [11]. This approach ensures that Toyota can maintain a robust financial foundation while addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change.\n\n### Shareholder Returns\nToyota places significant emphasis on providing stable and continuous dividends to its shareholders, aiming to maintain and improve upon a consolidated payout ratio of 30% [1]. This commitment is evident in the financial data from 2017 to 2021, where the dividend per share and total amount of payment have shown consistent or increasing trends. For instance, the dividend per share increased from 210 yen in 2017 to 240 yen in 2021, and the total amount of payment also rose, indicating a strong focus on shareholder returns. The payout ratio has been maintained around 30%, aligning with Toyota's stated goal. Additionally, share repurchases have been a significant part of the total shareholder return, further enhancing the value for shareholders.\n![The table presents financial data for five fiscal years, specifically ending in March of each year from 2017 to 2021, showing consistent or increasing trends in dividends and share repurchases.](image1)\n\n### Electrification Measures\nToyota's financial strategy supports its efforts in electrification, which is a critical component of its response to climate scenarios. The company invests retained earnings in next-generation technologies, including environmental technologies aimed at achieving a carbon-neutral society [1]. These investments are essential for responding to tightening regulations and market demands for electrified vehicles.\n\nToyota's Environmental Challenge 2050 sets ambitious goals, such as completely eliminating CO₂ emissions throughout the vehicle life cycle and reducing global average CO₂ emissions from new vehicles by 90% compared to 2010 levels by 2050 [4]. By 2020, Toyota had already made significant progress, reducing emissions by 23% compared to 2010 levels and achieving 16.98 million electrified vehicle sales. These initiatives are supported by the company's financial strategy, which allocates resources to R&D and capital expenditure in a prioritized and efficient manner.\n![The table outlines Toyota's Environmental Challenge 2050 goals, milestones for 2030, and the results of initiatives taken in 2020, showing significant progress in reducing emissions and increasing electrified vehicle sales.](image4)\n\n### Climate Scenarios and Strategic Planning\nToyota's strategic planning in response to climate scenarios includes both risks and opportunities. For example, the tightening of regulations for fuel efficiency and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) presents both the risk of fines for non-compliance and the opportunity to increase sales of electrified vehicles. Toyota is investing in batteries and reducing CO₂ emissions to address these challenges. Similarly, the expansion of carbon pricing poses the risk of increased production costs but also the opportunity to decrease energy costs through conservation and efficient technology [5].\n![The image is a comprehensive infographic detailing the risks, opportunities, and measures Toyota is taking in response to climate scenarios related to the automotive industry, including investments in batteries and energy conservation.](image5)\n\nIn summary, Toyota's financial strategy, which focuses on stability, growth, and efficiency, directly supports its response to climate scenarios. The company maintains a strong commitment to shareholder returns through consistent dividends and share repurchases, while also investing in electrification and other environmental technologies to achieve long-term sustainability and meet climate goals."}

Breaking this down further, we can see the specific figures for each category:\n\n- **Total amortisation:**\n  - 2020: 1,096 million DKK\n  - 2019: 487 million DKK [4]\n\n- **Total impairment losses:**\n  - 2020: 350 million DKK\n  - 2019: 982 million DKK [4]\n\nThe increase in total amortisation from 2019 to 2020 is significant, while the impairment losses decreased. This suggests that more intangible assets were being amortised in 2020 compared to 2019, but fewer impairments were recognized.\n\n### Impact on Net Carrying Amounts\n\nTo understand the impact on the net carrying amounts, we need to look at the changes in the carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.\n\n#### Intangible Assets\n\n- **Impairment tests in 2020 and 2019:**\n  - The impairment tests for patents and licences not yet in use are based on Management’s projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products. In 2020, an impairment loss of 350 million DKK (compared to 982 million DKK in 2019) was recognized, primarily related to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment. [6][10]\n\n- **Additions and Amortisation:**\n  - Of the total addition of intangible assets in 2020, 396 million DKK is internally developed (compared to 221 million DKK in 2019). [7]\n  - The increase in amortisation reflects the growing number of intangible assets being amortised, which impacts the net carrying amount.\n\n#### Property, Plant, and Equipment\n\n- **Depreciation and Additions:**\n  - For \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment,\" the depreciation and additions are detailed in the table:\n    - **2020:**\n      - Land and buildings: Balance at 31 December: 2,901 million DKK\n      - Other equipment: Balance at 31 December: 479 million DKK\n    - **2019:**\n      - Land and buildings: Balance at 31 December: 3,029 million DKK\n      - Other equipment: Balance at 31 December: 503 million DKK [6]\n\n  - The balance at the end of 2020 shows a decrease in the carrying amount for both land and buildings and other equipment, primarily due to higher depreciation and exchange rate adjustments.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe total depreciation and impairment losses increased from 2019 to 2020, driven by a significant rise in amortisation, while impairment losses decreased. This has led to a reduction in the net carrying amounts of both intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. Specifically, the net carrying amount of intangible assets was impacted by the higher amortisation, and the net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment was affected by increased depreciation and exchange rate adjustments.\n\n![The table provides financial data in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019, showing the depreciation and impairment losses for different asset categories.](image8)"}

In 2021, it further decreased by $232 million (from $5,039 million to $4,807 million).\n\nThis decline in net investment income can be attributed to several factors, including lower interest rates and reduced income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.

This value is adjusted by a smoothing technique where certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years [8].\n\nThe expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan was $(36) million in 2020 and $(41) million in 2019 [5]. This indicates a decrease in the expected return, meaning the anticipated returns were lower in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nTo understand the actual return on plan assets, we can look at the changes in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) related to the U.S. Defined Benefit plans. The AOCI balance for the U.S. Defined Benefit (Net Actuarial Loss) increased from $91 million in 2019 to $125 million in 2020, with a total change to AOCI of $34 million [image2].\n\nThis increase in AOCI suggests that the actual return on plan assets was less than the expected return, leading to an additional net actuarial loss. The net actuarial loss increased by $44 million, but after adjustments and tax effects, the total change to AOCI was $34 million.\n\nThe total plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan as of December 31, 2020, were $1,061 million, consisting of fixed income securities and cash equivalents ($743 million) and equity securities ($318 million) [image3].\n\nIn summary, the expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit decreased from $(41) million in 2019 to $(36) million in 2020, and the actual return was lower than expected, resulting in an increase in the net actuarial loss, which is reflected in the higher AOCI balance.

This is a significant increase, as shown in the geographical breakdown of revenues:\n- Americas: Increased from $9,445 million to $12,051 million.\n- Europe: Increased from $2,553 million to $3,430 million.\n- Asia Pacific: Increased from $1,284 million to $1,617 million.\n\nThis growth in total revenue can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of acquisitions, such as the Tableau acquisition in August 2019, which has been the largest acquisition to date [10]. The integration of these businesses into existing operations has contributed to the overall revenue growth.\n\n### Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided [11]. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments.\n\nFrom the unearned revenue data, we see the following changes:\n- **Unearned Revenue, Beginning of Period:**\n  - 2020: $8,564\n  - 2019: $6,995\n\n- **Billings and Other:**\n  - 2020: $18,662\n  - 2019: $14,770\n\n- **Contribution from Contract Asset:**\n  - 2020: $101\n  - 2019: $13\n\n- **Revenue Recognized Ratable Over Time:**\n  - 2020: $(15,586)\n  - 2019: $(12,426)\n\n- **Revenue Recognized Over Time as Delivered:**\n  - 2020: $(716)\n  - 2019: $(629)\n\n- **Revenue Recognized at a Point in Time:**\n  - 2020: $(796)\n  - 2019: $(227)\n\n- **Unearned Revenue from Business Combinations:**\n  - 2020: $433\n  - 2019: $68\n\n- **Unearned Revenue, End of Period:**\n  - 2020: $10,662\n  - 2019: $8,564\n\n![This table displays unearned revenue data for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, and 2019, showing an increase in unearned revenue from 2019 to 2020.](image5)\n\nThe unearned revenue at the end of the period increased from $8,564 million in 2019 to $10,662 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to higher billings and other contributions, as well as the contribution from business combinations, particularly the Tableau acquisition.\n\n### Implications\nThe increase in both total revenue and unearned revenue suggests that the company is successfully growing its customer base and securing more long-term contracts. The higher unearned revenue indicates that the company has a strong pipeline of future revenue, which is positive for financial stability and growth. However, it also means that the company needs to manage its cash flow and ensure that the revenue is recognized appropriately over time.\n\nIn summary, the total revenue increased from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, and the unearned revenue increased from $8,564 million to $10,662 million, indicating strong growth and a robust future revenue pipeline."}

Several categories contributed to this change:\n\n- **Loss and other carryforwards**: This category saw a decrease from $1,030 in 2021 to $914 in 2022, indicating that some losses were utilized or expired.\n- **Pension and other retiree benefits**: There was a significant drop from $1,476 in 2021 to $740 in 2022. This could be attributed to actuarial gains related to increases in discount rates as noted in the text quotes [12].\n- **Capitalized research & development**: Increased from $358 in 2021 to $646 in 2022, showing higher capitalized R&D expenses providing future tax benefits.\n- **Valuation allowances**: The negative figures indicate an increase in valuation allowances from $(569) in 2021 to $(409) in 2022, reflecting potentially lower expectations of realizing these deferred tax assets.\n\n### Deferred Tax Liabilities\nThe total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 in 2021 to $9,288 in 2022 [image8]. Key contributing categories include:\n\n- **Goodwill and intangible assets**: Slight increase from $5,761 in 2021 to $5,783 in 2022, indicating ongoing capitalization or acquisitions.\n- **Fixed assets**: A small rise from $1,512 in 2021 to $1,542 in 2022.\n- **Other retiree benefits**: Significant increase from $645 in 2021 to $1,031 in 2022, consistent with the actuarial assumptions mentioned in the text [12].\n- **Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions**: Notable jump from $111 in 2021 to $439 in 2022, likely due to market fluctuations or currency changes.\n- **Lease right-of-use assets**: Minor decrease from $191 in 2021 to $179 in 2022.\n- **Foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated**: Decreased from $108 in 2021 to $70 in 2022, possibly due to changes in repatriation plans or tax laws.\n\n![Summary of Deferred Tax Assets](image2)\n![Summary of Deferred Tax Liabilities](image8)\n\nIn conclusion, deferred tax assets decreased primarily due to reductions in loss carryforwards and pension benefits, while deferred tax liabilities increased mainly because of higher values in goodwill, fixed assets, and unrealized gains."}

This significant improvement can be attributed to several key factors across different cash flow activities.\n\n### Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3,426 million in 2020 [3]. This increase was driven by several factors, including:\n- An increase in deferred taxes of $4,060 million, primarily due to the intra-entity sale of IP in the first quarter [4].\n- An increase in prepaid pension assets of $745 million, driven by higher returns on plan assets and plan remeasurements [4].\n- A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,626 million, resulting from sales of receivables and product cycle dynamics [4].\n\nAdditionally, there was an increase in cash provided by receivables of $4,795 million, primarily driven by sales of receivables, including sales of financing receivables of $3,076 million [9]. Other contributing factors included payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 [9].\n\n### Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million in 2020, primarily due to a significant decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, which was $32.3 billion lower compared to the prior year, mainly because of the Red Hat acquisition in 2019 [7]. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables of $6.2 billion, driven by the wind-down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations [7].\n\n### Financing Activities\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 [12]. This change was driven by:\n- A decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions of $19,998 million, primarily due to a higher level of net additions in the prior year to fund the Red Hat acquisition [6].\n- A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $1,361 million [6].\n\n### Summary\nThe net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5,361 million, as shown in the cash flow summary table `![{Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $5,361 million, compared to a decrease of $3,290 million in 2019.}](image3)`.

This decline was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in many markets, particularly in the International Operated Markets segment. The U.S. market showed positive sales performance, but this was offset by increased marketing support and incentives provided to franchisees to accelerate recovery and drive growth [1]. \n\nThe change in total revenues is illustrated by the pie charts showing revenue segments over the years: ![The pie charts show a consistent breakdown of revenue segments with slight decreases in 2020](image3). In 2020, there was a noticeable shift as company-operated sales and franchised revenues both saw declines, contributing to the overall decrease in total revenues [8].\n\nRegarding restaurant margins, total restaurant margins also decreased by 13% in 2020 [8]. This reduction was influenced by several factors including sales declines in the International Operated Markets due to the pandemic, partly offset by positive sales performance in the U.S. Additionally, incremental COVID-19 expenses were incurred for employee-related costs, personal protective equipment, and other restaurant costs [10]. Franchised margins were impacted by higher depreciation costs related to investments in Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\") and support provided for marketing initiatives like the free Thank You Meals [11].\n\nThe bar chart further demonstrates the decline in restaurant margins: ![The bar chart shows a decline in both franchised and company-operated margins from 2019 to 2020](image5).

These were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses and customer service expenses [7].\n- **Sky:** Increased direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation [7].\n- **Corporate and Other:** A decrease in expenses primarily due to severance charges related to businesses in the prior year period [7].\n\n### Comparison Across Segments\n\n- **Cable Communications:** The segment saw a slight increase in revenue (0.7% from 2020 to 2021) and a significant increase in operating expenses, particularly in programming and technical support [7].\n- **NBCUniversal:** This segment experienced a 6.9% increase in revenue, driven by higher costs in Media, Studios, and Theme Parks, leading to a substantial increase in operating expenses [7].\n- **Sky:** The segment had a 11.4% increase in revenue, with increased direct network costs and other expenses, but also saw a reduction in programming and production costs [7].\n- **Corporate and Other:** This segment showed a decrease in both revenue and expenses, likely due to one-time items such as severance charges [7].\n\nIn summary, the main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue and operating expenses from 2020 to 2021 were the NBCUniversal and Sky segments, which saw significant increases in both revenue and operating expenses, while the Cable Communications segment had a modest revenue increase but higher operating expenses."}

According to [9], the VIEs accounted for 99.8% of the total net revenues in 2020 and 99.1% in 2021. This indicates a slight decrease in the proportion of revenues generated by the VIEs from 2020 to 2021.\n\n### Total Assets\nIn terms of total assets, the VIEs held a substantial portion of the company's assets. As per [4], as of December 31, 2020, and 2021, the total assets of the Group’s VIEs mainly consisted of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepayments, deposits, and other current assets, intangible assets, and land use rights, as applicable. The specific breakdown of these assets is detailed in the financial statements.\n\nFor a more detailed comparison, we can refer to the financial data in the tables provided:\n\n- **2020 and 2021 Financial Data**:\n  - The table in `![{Consolidated financial data for various entities, including Parent, VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries, WOFEs, and Other subsidiaries, with eliminating adjustments for consolidation}](image4)` provides a comprehensive view of the assets and liabilities for the parent company, VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries, WOFEs, and other subsidiaries.\n  - In 2020, the total assets of the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries were 26.5% of the consolidated total assets, as mentioned in [9].\n  - In 2021, this percentage increased slightly to 26.9%.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n- **Revenues**:\n  - The table in `![{Financial performance of a parent company and its subsidiaries over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, including revenues, cost of revenues, gross profit, operating profit, and profit for the year}](image7)` shows the revenue figures for the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n  - For 2020, the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries contributed significantly to the total revenues, as seen in the \"Revenues\" section.\n  - For 2021, there was a slight decline in the proportion of revenues, but the VIEs still accounted for the majority of the total revenues.\n\n- **Total Assets**:\n  - The table in `![{Financial statement as of December 31, 2021, detailing assets and liabilities for a parent company, VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries, WOFE, other subsidiaries, and consolidated totals}](image4)` provides a detailed breakdown of the assets.\n  - The non-current assets include investments in subsidiaries, VIEs, intangible assets, and goodwill, among others.\n  - The current assets include amounts due from subsidiaries and VIEs, prepayments, deposits, and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Revenues**: The VIEs and their subsidiaries generated 99.8% of the total net revenues in 2020 and 99.1% in 2021, indicating a slight decrease in the proportion of revenues.\n- **Total Assets**: The total assets of the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries increased slightly from 26.5% of the consolidated total assets in 2020 to 26.9% in 2021.\n\nThus, while the proportion of revenues generated by the VIEs decreased slightly, the total assets of the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries increased marginally from 2020 to 2021."}
{"q_id": 534, "model": "qwen-max-latest_llm", "in_tok": 4975, "out_tok": 773, "total_tok": 5748, "response": "To understand how changes in stock-based compensation expenses and net earnings per share reflect Procter & Gamble's financial trends from 2020 to 2022, we can analyze the data provided through both text and images. \n\nFirstly, let’s look at the stock-based compensation expenses over the years. According to the financial metrics shown in `![Stock-based expenses and tax benefits](image5)`, the total stock-based expense decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $540 million in 2021, and further to $528 million in 2022 [5]. This downward trend indicates a reduction in the cost associated with stock options, RSUs, and PSUs. Specifically, the expenses for stock options were $249 million in 2020, $279 million in 2021, and $271 million in 2022, showing an initial increase followed by a slight decrease. The RSUs and PSUs showed a consistent decline from $309 million in 2020 to $261 million in 2021, and then to $257 million in 2022.\n\nThese reductions in stock-based compensation expenses could be attributed to various factors, including changes in the number of awards granted or modifications in the valuation models used, as mentioned in the lattice-based option valuation model discussion [4]. The decrease might also suggest that the company is optimizing its compensation strategy, possibly aligning it more closely with performance outcomes.\n\nNext, examining the net earnings per share (EPS), the data in `![Financial data for P&G](image7)` reveals an upward trend. The diluted net earnings per share increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.50 in 2021, and further to $5.81 in 2022 [7]. This growth in EPS reflects improved profitability and effective cost management, which is corroborated by the overall increase in net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, rising from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,306 million in 2021, and reaching $14,742 million in 2022 [9].\n\nAdditionally, the intrinsic value and exercise details of stock options in `![Status and characteristics of stock options](image2)` provide insights into the financial health and employee engagement through equity participation. For instance, the aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options was $5,124 million as of June 30, 2022, indicating substantial potential gains for employees who exercised their options, thereby aligning employee interests with shareholder value [2].\n\nFurthermore, the expected volatilities and interest rates presented in `![Financial metrics](image4)` illustrate the underlying assumptions affecting stock option valuations. With expected volatility decreasing slightly from 20% in 2021 to 19% in 2022, alongside stable dividend yields, these figures support the stability and predictability in P&G's stock performance, which likely contributes to steady EPS growth [4].\n\nIn summary, the decrease in stock-based compensation expenses coupled with the increase in net earnings per share demonstrates Procter & Gamble's improving financial efficiency and profitability from 2020 to 2022. These trends reflect strategic adjustments in compensation practices and robust earnings growth, enhancing shareholder value.\n\nProcter & Gamble's financial trends from 2020 to 2022 show a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses and an increase in net earnings per share, reflecting improved financial efficiency and profitability."}

According to image2, there is a notable adjustment recorded:\n\n- In the balance at September 27, 2020, foreign currency translation adjustments amounted to $41 million.\n- By September 26, 2021, these adjustments were only $6 million.\n\nThis indicates a decrease in foreign currency translation adjustments by $35 million from 2020 to 2021. The reduction suggests that exchange rate movements had less of an impact on the company's financial position in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n### Components of Income Before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes can be broken down by jurisdiction, as shown in image3:\n\n- **United States**:\n  - 2020: $5,004 million\n  - 2021: $8,781 million\n  - Increase: $3,777 million\n\n- **Foreign**:\n  - 2020: $715 million\n  - 2021: $1,493 million\n  - Increase: $778 million\n\n- **Total**:\n  - 2020: $5,719 million\n  - 2021: $10,274 million\n  - Increase: $4,555 million\n\nThe total increase in income before income taxes from 2020 to 2021 was $4,555 million. This substantial rise is primarily driven by increased earnings in the United States, which contributed an additional $3,777 million, while foreign earnings added $778 million more.\n\n### Tax Provisions and Benefits\nTax provisions provide further insight into the composition of the income before taxes. From image4, we observe the following for the year 2021:\n\n- **Current provision (benefit)**:\n  - Federal: $942 million\n  - State: $8 million\n  - Foreign: $518 million\n  - Total: $1,468 million\n\n- **Deferred (benefit) provision**:\n  - Federal: $(251) million\n  - State: $2 million\n  - Foreign: $12 million\n  - Total: $(237) million\n\n- **Grand Total**: \n  - 2021: $1,231 million\n\nThese figures indicate that the current tax provisions significantly outweighed deferred benefits in 2021, contributing to the overall tax expense.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by $35 million from 2020 to 2021 `![Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by $35 million from 2020 to 2021](image2)`. Meanwhile, the components of income before income taxes showed a substantial increase, primarily due to higher U.S. earnings, with a total increase of $4,555 million `![Income before income taxes increased by $4,555 million from 2020 to 2021](image3)`.\n\nTherefore, the changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and components of income before income taxes from 2020 to 2021 are characterized by a decrease in foreign currency adjustments and a significant rise in income, predominantly from U.S. operations."}

This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) [image4].\n\n### Retained Earnings\nRetained earnings decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021. This reduction is influenced by net income and dividends paid. The net income for 2021 was $8,060 million, which is significantly higher than the 2020 net income of $3,135 million [image5]. However, this increase in net income did not fully offset the impact of dividends and other adjustments, leading to a net decrease in retained earnings.\n\n### Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) also showed a decrease, moving from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021. This change is driven by:\n- Net unrealized debt securities gains: Decreased from $65 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021.\n- Foreign currency translation adjustments: Increased from $(2,229) million in 2020 to $(2,392) million in 2021.\n- Net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits: Improved from $(731) million in 2020 to $(576) million in 2021 [image4].\n\n### Comprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The other comprehensive income (loss) for 2021 was $(50) million, compared to $(158) million in 2020 and $(140) million in 2019. The net effect on comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, up from $2,977 million in 2020 and $6,619 million in 2019 [image5].\n\n### Summary\nThe changes in shareholders' equity, particularly the decrease in retained earnings and the slight increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, had a direct impact on comprehensive income. Despite the significant increase in net income, the overall comprehensive income was affected by the negative other comprehensive income, resulting in a lower comprehensive income than the net income alone would suggest.\n\n**In summary, the changes in shareholders' equity, including decreases in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, contributed to a comprehensive income of $8,010 million in 2021, up from $2,977 million in 2020 and $6,619 million in 2019.**"}

The Committee specifically reviewed how the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and climate change scenarios, including those aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, were reflected in the financial statements. This included considerations of portfolio impacts, demand for commodities, decarbonization costs, and Scope 3 emissions [2]. \n\nThe Committee also acknowledged global trends, such as increased disclosure within financial statements, and considered requests from institutional investors for Paris-aligned financial statements and the disclosure of material climate risks [3]. The potential financial implications and appropriate disclosures related to climate risks were a significant focus for the Committee [9].\n\nFurthermore, the Board regularly includes climate change on its agenda, integrating it into strategy discussions, portfolio reviews, investment decisions, and risk management oversight. The Sustainability Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Group’s climate change performance and governance responsibilities [6]. The Risk and Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee also play crucial roles in the oversight of climate-related risk management [6].\n\n### Director Training\n\nBHP places a strong emphasis on the continuous development and training of its directors. The Nomination and Governance Committee is responsible for the induction, training, and development programs for the Board and its committees. This includes updates to the Committee terms of reference and closed sessions for more focused discussions [image1, column 3].\n\nIn FY2021, BHP conducted briefings and development sessions to provide directors with a deeper understanding of the company’s activities, environment, key issues, and strategic direction.

This change was driven by several key factors.\n\nFirst, the higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments contributed significantly to the increase in free cash flow. The operating income from continuing operations increased from USD 10.152 billion in 2020 to USD 11.689 billion in 2021. When adjusted for non-cash items, this figure rose to USD 18.719 billion in 2021, compared to USD 17.952 billion in 2020 [8].\n\nAdditionally, lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year, also positively impacted the free cash flow. This reduction in legal payments helped to boost the overall cash flow from operating activities, which increased from USD 13.650 billion in 2020 to USD 15.071 billion in 2021 [5].\n\nHowever, this increase was partly offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. [9].\n\nTo summarize, the main contributing factors to the increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 were higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for legal provisions, despite the significant upfront payment for tislelizumab.\n\n![{Free cash flow increased from USD 11.7 billion in 2020 to USD 13.3 billion in 2021, a 14% increase.}](image5)"}

This is a substantial shift from 2020, where the changes in financial assumptions led to a gain of 72 million euros, contributing to the total actuarial gain of 67 million euros [image1].\n\nThe discount rate, a key financial assumption, also played a crucial role. The discount rate decreased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 [image6]. A lower discount rate generally increases the present value of future pension obligations, leading to higher liabilities and potential actuarial losses. This is consistent with the observed actuarial loss in 2021.\n\nTherefore, the changes in financial assumptions, particularly the decrease in the discount rate, were the primary factors that led to the total actuarial loss of -22 million euros in 2021, compared to a gain of 67 million euros in 2020. \n\n![Total actuarial gains (–) and losses: -22 million euros in 2021 and 67 million euros in 2020](image1)"}
{"q_id": 546, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 5920, "out_tok": 949, "total_tok": 6869, "response": "To understand how the foreign tax provision and foreign income before taxes changed between 2019 and 2021, and the potential impact on the company's financial strategy, we need to analyze the relevant data from both the text and image quotes.\n\n### Foreign Income Before Taxes\nThe table in `image1` provides the income before income taxes for the United States and Foreign regions across three years. For the Foreign region, the income before income taxes is as follows:\n- **2019**: $439 million\n- **2020**: $715 million\n- **2021**: $1,493 million\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the foreign income before taxes increased significantly, from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021. This represents a substantial growth, which could be attributed to various factors such as market expansion, operational improvements, or favorable economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions.\n\n### Foreign Tax Provision\nThe table in `image4` shows the current and deferred tax provisions for different jurisdictions, including the Foreign category. The current foreign tax provision is as follows:\n- **2019**: $(407) million (a benefit)\n- **2020**: $526 million\n- **2021**: $518 million\n\nIn 2019, the company experienced a significant tax benefit of $(407) million, which turned into a tax expense of $526 million in 2020 and $518 million in 2021. This change indicates a shift from a tax benefit to a tax expense, which could be due to changes in tax laws, restructuring, or other strategic decisions.\n\n### Impact on Financial Strategy\nThe increase in foreign income before taxes and the shift from a tax benefit to a tax expense can have several implications for the company's financial strategy:\n\n1. **Tax Planning and Compliance**:\n   - The company may need to reassess its tax planning strategies, especially given the potential for future changes in U.S. tax rates and the FDII deduction, as mentioned in [1]. If U.S. tax rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is reduced, the company's provision for income taxes, results of operations, and cash flows would be adversely affected.\n   - The company should also consider the impact of customer manufacturing operations moving to the United States, which could reduce the FDII deduction, as noted in [1].\n\n2. **Cash Flow Management**:\n   - The unrecognized tax benefits, as detailed in [2], indicate that there is a possibility of significant cash payments in fiscal 2022. This could affect the company's cash flow management and require careful planning to ensure liquidity.\n   - The estimated remaining future payments of $1.9 billion for a one-time repatriation tax, with the next installment due in January 2022, as stated in [3], will also impact cash flow.\n\n3. **Investment and Operational Decisions**:\n   - The company may need to adjust its investment and operational strategies to align with the changing tax landscape. For example, the decision to treat certain foreign subsidiaries as U.S. branches (check-the-box elections) in 2018 and 2019, as described in [8], had significant tax implications, including the creation and subsequent derecognition of deferred tax assets.\n   - The company should also monitor the status of its tax incentives in Singapore, as failing to meet the specified criteria could result in the refund of previously realized tax benefits, as noted in [10].\n\n4. **Risk Management**:\n   - The company should continue to manage the risks associated with tax audits and legal proceedings, as mentioned in [12]. Adequate reserves should be maintained to address potential adjustments from tax examinations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe foreign income before taxes increased significantly from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, while the foreign tax provision shifted from a benefit of $(407) million in 2019 to an expense of $518 million in 2021. These changes necessitate a reevaluation of the company's tax planning, cash flow management, and operational strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects and capitalize on opportunities. \n\n![Foreign income before taxes and foreign tax provision for 2019, 2020, and 2021](image4)"}

The table in image4 provides a comprehensive view of the balance sheet data, showing the average and period-end values for various asset categories. For example, the available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity debt securities both saw changes, with the fair value of AFS and HTM debt securities decreasing from $432,699 million in 2020 to $449,630 million in 2021, as seen in image2. This change was driven by higher interest rates, which led to a decrease in the total net unrealized gains on these securities [6]. Additionally, the amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of AFS and HTM debt securities increased, reflecting continued purchases and repositioning of the portfolio for capital management purposes [8].\n\n![The table presents financial data comparing December 31, 2021, with December 31, 2020, for two categories: \"Available-for-sale\" and \"Held-to-maturity\" securities, shown in millions of dollars.](image2)\n\nNext, we examine the impact of WFAM AUM. The table in image8 shows that the beginning balance of WFAM AUM was $508.8 billion in 2020 and $603.0 billion in 2021. However, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, resulted in a significant outflow of $587.1 billion, reducing the end-of-period balance to $115.9 billion. This sale was part of Wells Fargo's strategic decision to divest non-core businesses, as indicated in the text [5] and [7]. The sale of WFAM and the Corporate Trust Services business generated net gains of $674 million and $269 million, respectively, contributing positively to the company's financial performance.\n\n![The table presents data on \"WFAM assets under management\" over three years, focusing on broken down categories and financial movements.](image8)\n\nThese changes in total assets and WFAM AUM influenced Wells Fargo's financial strategy by allowing the company to focus on core banking operations, manage liquidity and interest rate risk more effectively, and generate additional capital through the sale of non-core businesses.

The key areas of focus include revenue changes, cost management, and how these factors influenced profit margins.\n\nStarting with the **Global Markets** segment, there was a notable increase in revenue. According to the data, Global Markets saw an increase of $1,562 million (27%) from 2019 to 2020 [image2]. This growth is further detailed in text quote [8], which highlights strong performance in Global Markets that offset lower interest rates and adverse credit and funding valuation adjustments. This segment's robust performance contributed positively to the overall net operating income, as shown in the table where net operating income increased by $434 million (3%) from 2019 to 2020 ![Summary of financial performance](image1).\n\nIn contrast, the **Securities Services** and **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** segments experienced significant declines. Securities Services revenue fell by $234 million (12%), and Global Liquidity and Cash Management dropped by $701 million (26%) [image2]. These reductions are consistent with the broader trend of lower global interest rates impacting income, as mentioned in text quote [1]. Such decreases directly affected the net operating income negatively, contributing to the overall decline in profit before tax, which decreased by $342 million (7%) from 2019 to 2020 ![Summary of financial performance](image1).\n\nThe **Global Banking** segment showed a modest decrease in revenue of $71 million (2%) [image2]. However, text quote [12] explains that despite lower real estate and structured finance fee income, there was growth in capital markets revenue and corporate lending net interest income. This mixed performance indicates that while there were challenges, strategic actions helped mitigate some losses. The overall impact on profit before tax can be seen in the context of reduced operating expenses, which were down by $280 million (3%) in 2020 compared to 2019 ![Summary of financial performance](image1).\n\nAnother critical aspect is the change in expected credit losses and other impairment charges, which surged significantly by $1,056 million (>200%) from 2019 to 2020 ![Summary of financial performance](image1). This surge, explained in text quote [9], reflects the global economic uncertainty due to the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly affecting regions like the UK and Asia. Such increases in credit loss provisions directly reduced the profit before tax figures.\n\nLooking at specific segments like **Global Trade and Receivables Finance**, revenue decreased by $82 million (4%) [image2], attributed to lower lending balances and fees due to reduced global trade volumes [7]. Despite this, wider margins in certain regions offered partial offsets. The cumulative effect of these changes is reflected in the pie chart showing contributions to group adjusted profit before tax, highlighting a section representing $4.8 billion or 40% of total profits ![Contribution to group adjusted profit](image4).\n\nFinally, examining the overall figures for adjusted profit before tax across years, we observe a substantial drop from $7.2 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020 ![Adjusted profit before tax over three years](image7). This decline underscores the compounded negative impacts of reduced revenues and higher credit loss provisions across multiple segments.\n\nIn conclusion, while certain segments like Global Markets demonstrated resilience and growth, others such as Securities Services and Global Liquidity and Cash Management faced significant declines. The overall adjusted net operating income saw a slight increase, but the profit before tax was substantially impacted by higher credit loss provisions and reduced revenues, resulting in a considerable year-over-year decrease."}

This increase was driven by a growth in commercial loans, which rose from $478,417 million to $513,120 million. Specifically, the commercial and industrial loan portfolio saw an increase due to higher loan demand, resulting in more originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [8]. On the other hand, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million to $382,274 million, primarily due to a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, reflecting the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) [8].\n\n![The table shows financial data for total loans, including commercial and consumer loans, as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, with a total increase of $7,757 million.](image4)\n\n### Deposits\nTotal deposits increased from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, a 6% increase [3]. The composition of these deposits changed, with noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits showing significant growth. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased from $467,068 million (33%) to $527,748 million (36%), a 13% increase. Interest-bearing demand deposits also grew, from $447,446 million (32%) to $465,887 million (31%), a 4% increase. Savings deposits rose from $404,935 million (29%) to $439,600 million (30%), a 9% increase. Conversely, time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined. Time deposits fell from $49,775 million (4%) to $29,461 million (2%), a 41% decrease, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices dropped from $35,157 million (2%) to $19,783 million (1%), a 44% decrease [3].\n\n![The table shows a breakdown of deposits in millions of dollars for two different years, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, with a total increase of 6%.](image3)\n\n### Strategic Inferences\nThe increase in commercial loans, particularly in the commercial and industrial segment, suggests that the financial entity is focusing on supporting business growth and responding to higher demand from businesses. The decline in consumer loans, especially in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, indicates a strategy to manage risk and possibly reduce exposure to long-term fixed-rate assets in a low-interest-rate environment. \n\nThe growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, along with the decline in time deposits and non-U.S. deposits, suggests a strategy to optimize liquidity and reduce funding costs. The reduction in time deposits, which are typically more expensive, and the shift towards more stable, lower-cost deposits, aligns with a focus on improving net interest margins and maintaining a strong liquidity position.\n\nIn summary, the financial entity's strategy appears to be focused on growing commercial lending, managing consumer loan exposure, and optimizing its deposit base to enhance liquidity and reduce funding costs."}

This significant drop could be influenced by various factors such as operational expenses, revenue changes, or specific one-time events.\n- **2019 to 2020**: The net income for Amberjack increased from $102 million in 2019 to $114 million in 2020. This suggests a recovery, possibly due to improved operational efficiency, higher revenues, or lower costs.\n\n#### Mars\n- **2018 to 2019**: The net income for Mars decreased slightly from $154 million in 2018 to $126 million in 2019. This decline could be attributed to similar factors as Amberjack, such as operational challenges or market conditions.\n- **2019 to 2020**: The net income for Mars remained stable at $126 million in 2020. This stability indicates that the entity managed to maintain its financial performance despite any external challenges.\n\n### Potential Influences\n\n1. **Operational Expenses and Revenues**: Changes in total revenues and operating expenses can significantly impact net income. For example, if operational expenses increased more than revenues, it would lead to a decrease in net income. Conversely, if revenues increased while expenses were controlled, net income would improve.\n   - **Amberjack's Revenue and Expenses**:\n     - 2018: Total Revenues = $204 million, Total Operating Expenses = $47 million [1]\n     - 2019: Total Revenues = $102 million, Total Operating Expenses = (not directly provided, but inferred from net income) [3]\n     - 2020: Total Revenues = $114 million, Total Operating Expenses = (not directly provided, but inferred from net income) [5]\n   - **Mars' Revenue and Expenses**:\n     - 2018: Total Revenues = $241 million, Total Operating Expenses = $87 million [1]\n     - 2019: Total Revenues = $126 million, Total Operating Expenses = (not directly provided, but inferred from net income) [3]\n     - 2020: Total Revenues = $126 million, Total Operating Expenses = (not directly provided, but inferred from net income) [5]\n\n2. **Market Conditions and Economic Environment**: The economic environment, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, can affect revenues and expenses. For instance, the company evaluated the potential impairment of long-lived assets due to the continuing effects of the pandemic, which could have influenced their financial performance [1].\n\n3. **Capital Contributions and Expenditures**: Capital contributions and expenditures, such as those made to Permian Basin, can also impact financial performance. For example, the company made capital contributions of zero, $\\S25$ million, and $\\mathbb{S}28$ million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively [2].\n\n4. **Interest Rates and Debt Management**: The interest rates on credit facilities and the management of debt can affect the overall financial health. For example, the annualized weighted average interest rate for the Five Year Revolver due July 2023 was 2.06% as of December 31, 2020 [7]. Lower interest rates can reduce interest expenses, potentially improving net income.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Amberjack's net income** decreased from $157 million in 2018 to $102 million in 2019, and then increased to $114 million in 2020. This suggests a period of decline followed by a partial recovery.\n- **Mars' net income** decreased slightly from $154 million in 2018 to $126 million in 2019, and remained stable at $126 million in 2020. This indicates a more consistent performance with a minor initial decline.\n\nThese changes in net income are likely influenced by fluctuations in revenues and operational expenses, as well as broader economic conditions and strategic financial decisions.\n\n![Net income for Amberjack and Mars in 2018, 2019, and 2020](image5)"}
{"q_id": 556, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 5379, "out_tok": 1013, "total_tok": 6392, "response": "To understand how the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation compared across different segments and years from 2019 to 2021, and the reasons for these changes, we need to look at both the financial data and the specific segment performance.\n\n### Overall Adjusted EBITDA Trends\nFirst, let's look at the overall Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation. The table in image4 shows that the Adjusted EBITDA was:\n- 2021: $34,708 million\n- 2020: $30,826 million\n- 2019: $34,258 million\n\nThis indicates a decrease in 2020, followed by a recovery in 2021. \n\n### Segment Performance\n#### Cable Communications\nThe most significant capital expenditures are in the Cable Communications segment. According to [5], capital expenditures increased primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital. This can be seen in the detailed breakdown in image3, where:\n- **Customer Premise Equipment**: Decreased from $2,659 million in 2019 to $2,203 million in 2021.\n- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Increased from $2,000 million in 2019 to $2,658 million in 2021.\n- **Line Extensions**: Increased from $1,392 million in 2019 to $1,565 million in 2021.\n- **Support Capital**: Decreased from $858 million in 2019 to $503 million in 2021.\n\nThese changes reflect strategic investments in network capacity and expansion, which likely contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2021.\n\n#### NBCUniversal\nFor NBCUniversal, revenue and expenses played a significant role. From [8] and [11], revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at Comcast Spectacor and sales of Sky Glass televisions. However, expenses also increased, particularly in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. Specifically:\n- **NBCUniversal expenses** increased due to higher costs in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments.\n- **Cable Communications segment expenses** increased due to higher programming, technical and product support costs, franchise and other regulatory fees, and advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses, partially offset by decreases in other expenses and customer service expenses.\n\n#### Sky\nFor the Sky segment, expenses increased primarily due to higher direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation [11].\n\n### Financial Data Analysis\nThe financial data in image1 provides a more detailed view of the revenue and operating costs and expenses across different segments. For example:\n- **Direct-to-consumer revenue** increased from $15,223 million in 2020 to $16,455 million in 2021, a 2.0% increase.\n- **Advertising revenue** increased from $1,998 million in 2020 to $2,489 million in 2021, an 18.4% increase.\n- **Programming and production costs** decreased slightly from $8,649 million in 2020 to $8,949 million in 2021, a 1.3% increase.\n- **Direct network costs** increased from $2,086 million in 2020 to $2,612 million in 2021, a 17.1% increase.\n\n### Summary\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed a dip in 2020, followed by a recovery in 2021. The key factors contributing to these changes include:\n- **Strategic Investments**: Increased capital expenditures in scalable infrastructure and line extensions in the Cable Communications segment.\n- **Revenue Growth**: Increased revenue in the Direct-to-consumer and Advertising segments.\n- **Expense Management**: Higher expenses in certain segments, such as NBCUniversal and Sky, were managed with cost savings initiatives and reallocations to content and other strategic initiatives.\n\nThus, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed a recovery in 2021, driven by strategic investments and revenue growth, despite higher expenses in some segments. \n![{Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation was $34,708 million in 2021, $30,826 million in 2020, and $34,258 million in 2019.}](image4)"}

The adjusted revenue for GBM increased significantly, largely driven by a strong performance in Global Markets which offset the adverse impacts of lower global interest rates and credit adjustments [1]. Specifically, Global Markets revenue rose by $1,562 million (27%) in 2020 compared to 2019, with notable increases in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) revenues [image1]. \n\nFICC revenues surged by $1,541 million (33%), reflecting robust performances across Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit. In particular, Credit revenues soared by $556 million (90%), underscoring the strength in trading activities during periods of market volatility [image1]. However, some areas like Global Banking saw a decrease in revenue by $71 million (2%), mainly attributed to lower real estate and structured finance fee income, though this was somewhat mitigated by growth in capital markets revenue and increased net interest income from corporate lending [7].\n\nOn the other hand, Securities Services and Global Liquidity and Cash Management experienced declines in revenue, dropping by $234 million (12%) and $701 million (26%), respectively [image1]. These declines were partially offset by improvements in Credit and Funding Valuation Adjustments, which decreased adversely by $293 million, showing a more than 200% change [image1]. Furthermore, Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense, and Argentina Hyperinflation allocations contributed positively with an increase of $284 million in revenue [image1].\n\nAt the Corporate Centre level, the bank took significant actions to manage risks and reallocate resources effectively. This included reallocating both financial and non-financial resources and adapting risk appetite statements to support strategic goals [3]. The management delivered gross Risk-Weighted Asset (RWA) reductions of $37 billion globally, contributing to a net RWA reduction of $8 billion in 2020 [10]. Such measures helped maintain a resilient balance sheet and liquidity position, enabling the bank to support customers through government-imposed restrictions and their subsequent easing [5].\n\nOverall, while the reported profit before tax fell by 34%, and adjusted profit before tax dropped by 45%, the Group’s funding and liquidity positions remained strong, with significant increases in deposits across the Group [11].

According to the data, interest and other investment income declined by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [12]. This decline was largely due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021, resulting in significantly lower interest income.\n\nDespite the decline in interest and other investment income, dividend income increased by 3.5% from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021. This increase helped to partially offset the overall decline in pre-tax net investment income, which still decreased by 5.0% from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021 [7].\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes, particularly in the composition of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as fixed maturity securities. The table shows a significant increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, rising from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This increase is consistent with the strategy of maintaining ample liquidity, even at the expense of lower yields on short-term investments. \n\nOn the other hand, the value of fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021. This reduction aligns with the lower interest income, as the company may have reduced its holdings in fixed maturity securities due to the prevailing low interest rate environment.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by a significant decrease in interest and other investment income, while dividend income provided some offset. The asset allocations reflect a shift towards higher liquidity through increased holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, and a reduction in fixed maturity securities. \n\n![This table presents financial data for two different years, specifically showing figures as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

This increase was primarily due to the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14 million due to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019. Additionally, other income increased by $4 million related to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020 [11].\n- **Operating Activities**: The net cash provided by operating activities increased from $507 million in 2018 to $597 million in 2019, and further to $650 million in 2020. This increase is reflective of the overall growth in net income and adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities [image2].\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership increased from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to higher investment, dividend, and other income, and improved operating activities. The main contributing factors were the acquisitions of additional interests in Explorer, Colonial, and Mattox, and higher distributions from Poseidon. \n\n![The table presents financial information for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, showing net income, other comprehensive loss, and comprehensive income.](image3)"}

In the period from April 15 through September 30, 2021, Varian achieved an adjusted EBIT of €221 million, with a very high margin of 17.0% [12]. This contribution, along with the strong performance in the Diagnostics segment, which saw its adjusted EBIT margin rise to 13.3% from 1.9% due to high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, helped drive the overall adjusted EBIT for the company. The total adjusted EBIT for 2021 was €3,142 million, a 40% increase from the prior year's €2,248 million [4]. The table below shows the breakdown of Adjusted EBIT across segments, highlighting the positive contribution from Varian:\n\n![This table indicates the financial performance improvements across most segments from 2020 to 221, particularly in Diagnostics.](image2)\n\n### Net Debt and Financial Liabilities\nThe acquisition of Varian also significantly affected the company's net debt and financial liabilities.

Specifically, the change in sales prices resulted in an increase of $16,965 million. This was primarily due to higher realized prices for key commodities such as iron ore, copper, and nickel. However, this was partially offset by higher royalties, which increased by $870 million, leading to a net positive impact of $16,095 million [7].\n\n### Impact of Operating Cash Costs\nThe change in controllable cash costs, including operating cash costs, also played a role. The operating cash costs decreased slightly by $34 million, mainly due to inventory drawdowns and increased volumes post-maintenance shutdowns. Additionally, there was a reduction in exploration and business development expenses by $109 million, resulting in a net total change in controllable cash costs of $75 million [7].\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the significant increase in sales prices, with a net positive impact of $16,095 million, and a slight decrease in operating cash costs, with a net total change of $75 million, contributed positively to BHP's Underlying EBITDA, which rose from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021.\n\n![The table details the various factors contributing to a significant increase in EBITDA over the year, with major contributions from sales prices and strategic cost management, offset by negative impacts from exchange rates and inflation.](image7)"}

In 2019, unallocated revenues were primarily due to licensing revenues resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers [5]. In 2020, unallocated revenues were mainly from the settlement agreement with Huawei and royalties for sales made in the March and June 2020 quarters under the new global patent license agreement [5]. By 2021, unallocated revenues were much lower, consisting of the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results [5].\n\n#### Unallocated Expenses\n- **Unallocated cost of revenues**:\n  - 2019: $(430) million\n  - 2020: $(340) million\n  - 2021: $(277) million\n- **Unallocated research and development expenses**:\n  - 2019: $(989) million\n  - 2020: $(1,046) million\n  - 2021: $(1,820) million\n- **Unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses**:\n  - 2019: $(413) million\n  - 2020: $(401) million\n  - 2021: $(538) million\n- **Unallocated other income (expenses)**:\n  - 2019: $(414) million\n  - 2020: $28 million\n  - 2021: $0 million\n- **Unallocated interest expense**:\n  - 2019: $(619) million\n  - 2020: $(599) million\n  - 2021: $(559) million\n- **Unallocated investment and other income, net**:\n  - 2019: $243 million\n  - 2020: $105 million\n  - 2021: $166 million\n\nThese unallocated expenses show a mixed trend, with some categories increasing and others decreasing. For instance, unallocated R&D expenses increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, while unallocated other income (expenses) showed a large improvement from 2019 to 2020.\n\n### Net Assets Acquired During the Acquisition of NUVIA in 2021\n\nThe acquisition of NUVIA was completed on March 16, 2021, for a total of $1.1 billion (net of cash acquired) [4].

The company saw an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, which rose to $10.6 billion in 2020 compared to $9.6 billion in 2019 [7].

According to the data, the net operating income for 2020 was $15,303 million, up from $14,869 million in 2019, representing a 3% increase [image2].\n\nHowever, the profit before tax for the GBM division decreased from 2019 to 2020. The profit before tax in 2020 was $4,830 million, down from $5,172 million in 2019, which is a 7% decrease [image2].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes. On the positive side, the Global Markets business, particularly within FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), showed strong performance. The revenue in 2020 for FICC was $6,278 million, an increase of $1,541 million or 33% compared to 2019. This was driven by higher volatility levels, increased client activity, and wider spreads, especially in Foreign Exchange and Credit [image3]. Additionally, the Rates segment also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds.\n\nOn the other hand, there were several negative factors. The expected credit losses and other impairment charges (ECL) significantly increased, rising by $1,056 million, more than 200% from 2019 [image2]. This was largely due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic outlook, particularly in Europe, MENA, and North and Latin America [10].\n\nMoreover, the operating expenses, while lower, did not fully offset the rise in ECL. The operating expenses in 2020 were $9,264 million, down by $280 million or 3% from 2019 [image2]. This reduction was partly due to management's cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay, which more than offset the growth in regulatory program costs and investments in technology [6].\n\nOverall, the GBM division's net operating income increased by 3%, but profit before tax decreased by 7% from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to higher expected credit losses and other impairment charges, despite strong performance in Global Markets and FICC."}

This philosophy is evident in Toyota's annual conferences and networking events, such as the Annual Toyota Women’s Conference in Australia, which brings together women to celebrate achievements and discuss strategies for advancement ![{conclusion}](image5).\n\nTo further bolster these efforts, Toyota has introduced systemic changes within its organizational framework. For example, prohibitions against discrimination or harassment of LGBT individuals have been incorporated into employee behavioral guidelines, reflecting a broader commitment to inclusivity [8]. Additionally, data from various Toyota locations highlights ongoing progress in increasing the percentage of women in different employment categories, though disparities remain, particularly in director-level positions ![{conclusion}](image1).\n\nToyota’s approach also involves leveraging training and human resource development programs to equip employees with the skills needed to succeed globally [1]. Such investments ensure that women and other underrepresented groups receive equitable opportunities for growth. Furthermore, physical and mental well-being are prioritized through health and safety initiatives, reinforcing Toyota's mission of \"Producing Happiness for All\" [4].\n\nIn summary, Toyota supports female employee participation and diversity by implementing region-specific initiatives, fostering inclusive workplace cultures, and integrating diversity into its corporate strategy. Specific examples include mentorship programs in Europe, breastfeeding breaks in China, and leadership workshops in South Africa ![{conclusion}](image7). Through these comprehensive efforts, Toyota aims to build a more equitable and empowered workforce worldwide. \n\n**Toyota promotes female participation and diversity through tailored regional initiatives, systemic policy changes, and inclusive workplace practices.**"}

The decrease in 2020 was particularly substantial, with a reduction of $15,7 billion compared to 2019. This decline was driven by a shift from an income tax expense of $5,3 billion in 2019 to an income tax benefit of $5,6 billion in 2020, primarily due to asset impairments recorded in 2020 [10].\n\n### Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\nIncome tax expense, both current and deferred, also saw a significant change. In 2018, it was $9,532 million, which decreased to $5,282 million in 2019, and then became a benefit of $(5,632)$ million in 2020. The effective tax rate, calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, dropped from 37% in 2018 to 34% in 2019, and further to 17% in 2020. The primary reasons for these changes were the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and the impact of asset impairments [10][11].\n\n### Total Other Taxes and Duties\nTotal other taxes and duties also showed a downward trend. They were $35,230 million in 2018, decreased to $33,186 million in 2019, and further to $28,425 million in 2020 [10][11].\n\n### Average Realizations for Crude Oil and Natural Gas\nThe worldwide average realizations for crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) per barrel were $62.79 in 2018, $56.32 in 2019, and $35.41 in 2020. For natural gas, the realizations were $3.87 per thousand cubic feet in 2018, $3.05 in 2019, and $2.01 in 2020. These figures indicate a consistent decline in both crude oil and natural gas prices over the three-year period [6].\n\nIn summary, ExxonMobil's total tax expenses decreased significantly from 2018 to 2020, with a notable shift from tax expense to tax benefit in 2020. The average realizations for crude oil and natural gas also declined consistently over the same period. \n\n![{The table provides financial data regarding taxes for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, expressed in millions of dollars.}](image7)\n![{The table shows the worldwide average realizations for crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL), and natural gas for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.}](image6)\n\nExxonMobil's total tax expenses decreased from $44,762 million in 2018 to $22,793 million in 2020, while the average realizations for crude oil and natural gas also declined consistently over the same period."}

For instance, in 2020, the company had a strong free cash flow of $5.5 billion, which was 38% of revenue [10]. This indicates a positive operating performance. Additionally, the company's cash and short-term investments increased by $1.18 billion, reaching $6.57 billion at the end of 2020 [7].\n\nThe image3 provides a more detailed breakdown of the financial figures for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n- For 2020, the total is $14,461.\n- For 2019, the total is $14,383.\n- For 2018, the total is $15,784.\n\nThese totals could represent the net income or other financial metrics. The decrease from 2018 to 2019 and then a slight increase in 2020 suggests some fluctuation in the company's financial performance. `![Total financial figures for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image3)`\n\nAdditionally, the image4 shows a table with monetary values, which could include components of the retained earnings and net income. The 2020 column ends with $6,139, while the 2019 column ends with $6,649, and the 2018 column ends with $7,189.

A higher discount rate generally reduces the present value of future benefit obligations, leading to a lower liability. Conversely, a lower expected return on plan assets increases the cost of providing benefits, which can lead to a higher expense and a lower net amount recognized.\n\nFor Pension Benefits, the increase in the discount rate from 1.7% to 3.7% would reduce the present value of the liabilities, potentially decreasing the net amount recognized. However, the decrease in the expected return on plan assets from 6.5% to 5.5% would increase the cost, partially offsetting the reduction in liabilities.\n\nFor Other Retiree Benefits, the increase in the discount rate from 3.2% to 5.0% would similarly reduce the present value of the liabilities. The expected return on plan assets remained unchanged at 8.4%, so there is no additional impact from this factor.\n\n### Summary\n- **Pension Benefits:**\n  - **Discount Rate:** Increased from 1.7% to 3.7%.\n  - **Expected Return on Plan Assets:** Decreased from 6.5% to 5.5%.\n  - **Impact:** The increase in the discount rate likely reduced the liabilities, but the decrease in the expected return on plan assets increased the cost, resulting in a mixed impact on the net amount recognized.\n\n- **Other Retiree Benefits:**\n  - **Discount Rate:** Increased from 3.2% to 5.0%.\n  - **Expected Return on Plan Assets:** Remained at 8.4%.\n  - **Impact:** The increase in the discount rate likely reduced the liabilities, with no change in the expected return on plan assets, leading to a more straightforward reduction in the net amount recognized.\n\nIn summary, the changes in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets had a mixed impact on the net amount recognized for Pension Benefits, while for Other Retiree Benefits, the increase in the discount rate likely led to a reduction in the net amount recognized."}

Specifically, the net operating income in 2020 was $(262) million, compared to $(654) million in 2019, which represents a $392 million increase (a 60% improvement). This is evident from the financial metrics table, which shows a positive change in net operating income [6].\n\n### Adjusted Revenue from Global Markets\nThe adjusted revenue from Global Markets also increased significantly.

The total future lease payments for 2019 are $303, and while the exact 2018 figure is not provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the total future lease payments were higher in 2018.\n\nIn summary, the total future lease payments decreased from 2018 to 2019."}

The reduction in equity was due to several factors:\n- Losses amounted to $22.4 billion.\n- Distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders, all in the form of dividends, were $14.9 billion.\n- Foreign exchange translation effects, which increased equity by $1.8 billion due to a weaker U.S. dollar.\n- A $1.0 billion increase in equity from a change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves.\n\nIn 2019, the total equity also saw a slight decrease, but the factors were different. The ExxonMobil share of equity decreased by $0.1 billion to $191.7 billion [12]. The changes in 2019 included:\n- An addition to equity for earnings of $14.3 billion.\n- Reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders, all in the form of dividends, amounting to $14.7 billion.\n- Foreign exchange translation effects, which increased equity by $1.4 billion due to a weaker U.S. currency.\n- A $1.4 billion decrease in equity from a change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves.\n\nThe table in `image7` provides a detailed account of ExxonMobil's shareholders' equity for the years 2017 through 2020. This table shows the opening balance, various changes throughout the year, and the closing balance for each year. It includes components such as common stock, earnings reinvested, accumulated other comprehensive income, and common stock held in treasury. \n\nThe specific figures in `image5` show a comparison of financial data between 2020 and 2019. The first column for 2020 and the second column for 2019 provide a summary of the equity and liabilities. The largest figures in the table sum up to 332,750 for 2020 and 362,597 for 2019, suggesting they might represent a total or aggregate amount. These figures align with the significant decrease in total equity observed in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the total equity of ExxonMobil decreased from $191.7 billion in 2019 to $157.2 billion in 2020, primarily due to losses and dividend distributions, partially offset by foreign exchange gains and changes in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves. \n![{ExxonMobil's total equity decreased from $191.7 billion in 2019 to $157.2 billion in 2020, primarily due to losses and dividend distributions, partially offset by foreign exchange gains and changes in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves.}](image7)"}

[5]\n\n**Additional Paid-in Capital:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Increased from RMB 35,044 million to RMB 36,238 million. This increase is primarily due to the issuance of shares and share-based compensation. [5]\n\n**Shares Held for Share Award Schemes:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Decreased from RMB (78) million to RMB (183) million. This indicates a reduction in the value of shares held for award schemes, likely due to the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units. [5]\n\n**Treasury Shares:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Increased significantly from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million. This large increase suggests that the company repurchased a substantial amount of its own shares. [5]\n\n**Other Reserves:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Decreased from RMB 6,300 million to RMB 3,726 million. This decrease could be due to reclassifications or adjustments in reserves. [5]\n\n**Retained Earnings:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Grew from RMB 11,111 million to RMB 14,194 million. This growth is primarily due to the profit for the year and other comprehensive income. [5]\n\n**Total Equity:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Decreased from RMB 52,731 million to RMB 51,055 million. Despite the increase in additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, the overall equity decreased, mainly due to the significant increase in treasury shares. [5]\n\n**Non-Controlling Interests:**\n- **2020 to 2021:** Increased from RMB 486 million to RMB 738 million. This increase is due to the higher non-controlling interests' share of the company's profits. [5]\n\n### Major Transactions Affecting Equity\n\n**Exercise of Share Options/RSUs:**\n- The exercise of share options and RSUs contributed to the increase in additional paid-in capital and the decrease in shares held for share award schemes. [5]\n\n**Acquisition of Treasury Shares:**\n- The company repurchased a significant number of its own shares, leading to a substantial increase in treasury shares. [5]\n\n**Profit for the Year:**\n- The profit for the year contributed to the growth in retained earnings. [5]\n\n**Fair Value Changes:**\n- Fair value changes on financial assets and other comprehensive income items affected the equity, with some positive and negative impacts. [5]\n\n**Currency Translation Differences:**\n- Currency translation differences also had an impact on the equity, contributing to the overall changes. [5]\n\n**Dividends and Other Payments:**\n- Dividends paid and other payments related to financing activities also influenced the equity. [5]\n\n### Summary\nThe components of equity experienced various changes between 2020 and 2021. The share capital remained constant, while additional paid-in capital increased, and shares held for share award schemes decreased. The most significant change was the substantial increase in treasury shares, which led to an overall decrease in total equity. Retained earnings grew due to the profit for the year, and non-controlling interests increased. Major transactions included the exercise of share options, acquisition of treasury shares, and fair value changes. \n\n![The table provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in equity, including share capital, additional paid-in capital, shares held for share award schemes, treasury shares, other reserves, retained earnings, total equity, and non-controlling interests.](image5)"}

This increase in revenue was significantly influenced by the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, which contributed $1.8 billion. Excluding this, the revenue still increased by 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution, advertising, and other revenues, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Peacock, a direct-to-consumer service, generated $778 million in revenue in 2021, compared to $118 million in 2020, reflecting a significant growth in its contribution to the Media segment [6].\n\n**Studios Segment:**\n- Studios segment revenue increased by 16.2% to $9.4 billion, driven by higher content licensing, theatrical, and home entertainment revenues as film and television production returned to full capacity [6].\n\n**Theme Parks Segment:**\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased by 141.2% to $5.1 billion, with Adjusted EBITDA improving from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the reopening of theme parks and the launch of a new park in Beijing, China [6].\n\n**Sky:**\n- Sky's revenue increased by 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding foreign currency impacts, revenue increased by 3.1%, driven by higher advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue [7].\n- The average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship for Sky increased by 8.7% to $59.29 in 2021, reflecting rate adjustments and changes in service levels [8].\n\n### Customer Relationships\n\n- Total customer relationships for Sky remained relatively consistent, with a net loss of 198 in 2021, 56 in 2020, and a net addition of 394 in 2019 [5]. Despite these minor fluctuations, the overall number of customer relationships remained stable, indicating that the focus was on maintaining and enhancing the value per customer rather than expanding the customer base.\n\n### Financial Performance\n\n- **Revenue Growth:** The overall revenue for NBCUniversal increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion, with Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 6.0% to $5.7 billion [10]. This growth was driven by strong performances in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments, as well as the positive impact of the Tokyo Olympics and the recovery from the pandemic.\n\n- **Operating Costs and Expenses:** Operating costs and expenses decreased by 10.5% in 2021, primarily due to reduced costs related to the impacts of COVID-19, including severance charges [3]. However, there were increased costs associated with the launch of Sky Glass and XClass TV, which are expected to continue in 2022.\n\n- **Adjusted EBITDA:** Despite the revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA for the Media segment decreased by 18.0% to $4.6 billion, primarily due to the high costs associated with the Tokyo Olympics and continued investments in Peacock [6]. The overall Adjusted EBITDA for NBCUniversal increased by 6.0% to $5.7 billion, reflecting the strong performance of the other segments.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe revenue trends and customer relationships had a significant impact on the financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021. The company saw substantial revenue growth, particularly in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments, driven by the recovery from the pandemic, the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, and the growth of Peacock. While customer relationships remained stable, the focus was on increasing the average revenue per customer, which contributed to the overall financial improvement. The financial performance was also influenced by cost savings initiatives and strategic investments, leading to a 6.0% increase in Adjusted EBITDA for NBCUniversal. \n\n![{The table shows financial data for the years ended December 31 for 2021, 2020, and 2019, with values in millions.

The committee oversees a structured and rigorous process to manage these aspects, which includes several key steps.\n\nFirst, the committee uses a continuous and rigorous approach to manage Board succession planning. This involves considering unforeseen departures and replacing current Board members, with a focus on diversity, size, tenure, skills, experience, and the attributes necessary for effective governance and risk management within BHP [12]. The process is ongoing, particularly for Non-executive Directors, with a nine-year tenure as a guide. The Board aims to maintain a balance between experience and new perspectives and ensure that the Board is equipped to adapt to changing external factors and BHP's specific circumstances. This step also involves preparing pipelines for the Nomination and Governance Committee membership. \n\n![The table outlines an eight-step process for BHP's Board succession planning and appointment of new Board members, including a rigorous and continuous approach, role description, selection and appointment of a search firm, Board interviews, Committee recommendation, background checks, and a letter of appointment.](image1)\n\nFor new appointments, the Nomination and Governance Committee outlines a role description, incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document and section 2.1.7. An external search firm, selected to carry out a global search, is provided with the role description to align with the Board's criteria. Shortlisted candidates are initially considered by the Chair and the Nomination and Governance Committee. Candidates meet with each Board member before a decision is made about their appointment. The Nomination and Governance Committee then recommends the preferred candidate for Board appointment. The Board, supported by external consultants, performs background and reference checks on the candidate. Finally, a letter of appointment is produced, detailing the terms for Non-executive Directors, indemnification by the Group, and definitions of their role, independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement. Written agreements are established for all Non-executive Directors [12].\n\nAfter induction, Non-executive Directors participate in continuous improvement activities (training and development program), which are overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee. The training and development program covers matters of a business nature, including environmental, social, and governance matters and provides updates on BHP’s assets, commodities, geographies, and markets. Programs are designed and periodically reviewed to maximize effectiveness, and the results of Director performance evaluations are incorporated into these programs [8].\n\n![The table outlines various areas of focus in governance and risk management, including integrity of financial statements, external auditor, internal control, climate change risks, and other governance matters.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the Nomination and Governance Committee supports the Board in authorizing conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate. A procedure operates to ensure the disclosure of conflicts and for the consideration and, if appropriate, the authorization of those conflicts by non-conflicted Directors. The committee reviews requests from Directors for authorization of situations of actual or potential conflict and makes recommendations to the Board. It also regularly reviews any situations of actual or potential conflict that have previously been authorized by the Board and makes recommendations on whether the authorization remains appropriate [11].\n\nIn summary, BHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a structured eight-step process, continuous improvement activities, and the management of conflicts of interest."}

The table in `![{The table shows changes in balances due to acquisitions, disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange differences over two periods.}](image1)` provides a breakdown of the changes in the \"Guarantees\" and \"Other\" categories over the specified periods. \n\nFrom 01/02/2020 to 31/01/2021, the initial balance for \"Guarantees\" was 378, with acquisitions adding 6, disposals reducing it by 42, transfers decreasing it by 4, and foreign exchange translation differences reducing it by 9. This resulted in a final balance of 329 for \"Guarantees\" at 31/01/2021. For \"Other,\" the initial balance was 78, with disposals reducing it by 22 and foreign exchange translation differences reducing it by 4, resulting in a final balance of 51 at 31/01/2021.\n\nFrom 01/02/2021 to 31/01/2022, the initial balance for \"Guarantees\" was 329, with acquisitions adding 6, disposals reducing it by 54, transfers increasing it by 5, and foreign exchange translation differences increasing it by 4.

The goodwill arising from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts corresponds to the amount of the intangible assets that did not meet the requirements established in IFRS 3 for separate recognition. These requirements related essentially to the capacity of the assets to generate future cash flows [9].\n\nIn summary, the key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 include changes in the balances due to acquisitions, disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange translation differences, with the final balances for \"Guarantees\" and \"Other\" being 290 and 50, respectively, at 31/01/2022."}

Let's break down these changes and their effects.\n\n### Changes in Credit Risk RWA\nCredit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. This increase was primarily driven by several factors, including an increase in Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, and higher exposure and market value gains in Equity investments. Additionally, credit risk RWA under the Advanced Approach increased for CVA, mainly due to increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility [3].\n\n- **Standardized Approach:**\n  - Initial balance (Dec 31, 2019): $342,684 million\n  - Total change: $44,382 million\n  - Final balance (Dec 31, 2020): $387,066 million\n\n- **Advanced Approach:**\n  - Initial balance (Dec 31, 2019): $228,927 million\n  - Total change: $56,003 million\n  - Final balance (Dec 31, 2020): $284,930 million\n\nThese increases in credit risk RWA reflect a higher level of risk exposure, which in turn affects the required capital ratios. The table showing the detailed breakdown of RWA components illustrates this clearly:\n![The table provides a detailed breakdown of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) for a financial institution as of the end of 2020, presented in both \"Standardized\" and \"Advanced\" approaches. Here's what's included in the table: 1. **Credit Risk RWA** 2. **Market Risk RWA** 3. **Operational Risk RWA** 4. **Total RWA**](image4)\n\n### Changes in External TLAC as a Percentage of RWA\nExternal TLAC as a percentage of RWA also changed from 2019 to 2020. The regulatory minimum and required ratio for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA are 18.0% and 21.5%, respectively. The actual percentages were:\n\n- **At December 31, 2020:** 47.7%\n- **At December 31, 2019:** 49.9%\n\nDespite a slight decrease, the institution maintained a substantial buffer above the regulatory minimum and required ratio. The table showing the External TLAC and Eligible LTD data highlights this:\n![The table shows data related to capital requirements, specifically External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) and Eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD). It compares actual amounts/ratios at December 31, 2020, with those at December 31, 2019, alongside the regulatory minimum and required ratios.](image7)\n\n### Impact on Capital Structure\nThe increase in credit risk RWA led to a need for more capital to maintain the required capital ratios. However, the institution managed to maintain strong capital ratios, as shown in the risk-based capital information table:\n\n- **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio:**\n  - 2020: 17.4% (Standardized), 17.7% (Advanced)\n  - 2019: 16.4% (Standardized), 16.9% (Advanced)\n\n- **Tier 1 Capital Ratio:**\n  - 2020: 19.4% (Standardized), 19.8% (Advanced)\n  - 2019: 18.6% (Standardized), 19.2% (Advanced)\n\n- **Total Capital Ratio:**\n  - 2020: 21.5% (Standardized), 21.8% (Advanced)\n  - 2019: 21.0% (Standardized), 21.5% (Advanced)\n\nThese ratios are well above the required levels, indicating that the institution has sufficient capital to cover its risk exposures. The table showing the risk-based capital information further supports this:\n![The table shows risk-based capital information in millions of dollars. It compares capital under \"Standardized\" and \"Advanced\" approaches as of December 31, 2020, with corresponding required ratios.](image1)\n\nIn summary, while the increase in credit risk RWA and the slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA posed some challenges, the financial institution maintained robust capital ratios, ensuring it remained well-capitalized and compliant with regulatory requirements."}

Specifically, brands increased from $3,908 million in 2021 to $4,299 million in 2022 [image1]. Similarly, patents and technology saw a slight decrease from $2,781 million to $2,769 million, while customer relationships increased marginally from $1,789 million to $1,797 million. The total gross carrying amount for intangible assets with determinable lives rose from $8,628 million in 2021 to $9,012 million in 2022 [image1].\n\nRegarding accumulated amortization, there was an increase across all categories, contributing to the total accumulated amortization rising from $(6,100) million in 2021 to $(6,273) million in 2022 [image1]. This suggests that while the company acquired more intangible assets, it also continued to amortize these assets over time.\n\n![Summary of intangible assets changes](image1)\n\nIn terms of amortization expenses, the company reported $312 million for 2022 compared to $318 million for 2021 [image2]. Despite the rise in gross carrying amounts, the amortization expense slightly decreased, indicating efficient management or possibly different amortization schedules for newly acquired assets.\n\n![Amortization expense trends](image2)\n\nFurthermore, looking forward, the estimated amortization expenses are projected to remain relatively stable but gradually decrease from $316 million in 2023 to $258 million in 2027 [image3]. This projection aligns with the current trend where even as new assets are added, the overall annual amortization expense does not proportionally increase.\n\n![Future amortization estimates](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, Procter & Gamble's intangible assets with determinable lives increased from 2021 to 2022, accompanied by a rise in accumulated amortization.

According to the table, the shareholding at both the beginning and end of the year for each Tata entity is as follows:\n\n- **Tata Sons Private Limited**:\n  - Number of shares: 2,702,450,947\n  - Percentage of total shares: 72.0% (both at the beginning and end of the year)\n  - Percentage of shares pledged/encumbered: 2.1%\n\n- **Tata Industries Limited**:\n  - Number of shares: 7,220\n  - Percentage of total shares: 0.0002% (both at the beginning and end of the year)\n\n- **Tata Investment Corporation Limited**:\n  - Number of shares: 1,036,269\n  - Percentage of total shares: 0.03% (both at the beginning and end of the year)\n\n- **Tata Steel Limited**:\n  - Number of shares: 46,798\n  - Percentage of total shares: 0.001% (both at the beginning and end of the year)\n\n- **The Tata Power Company Limited**:\n  - Number of shares: 766\n  - Percentage of total shares: 0.00002% (both at the beginning and end of the year)\n\nThere was no change in the number of shares or the percentage of total shares held by any of these Tata entities. This is further confirmed by the statement that \"there is no change in the percentage shareholding for any of the Tata group companies during this period.\" [image4]\n\n### Public Shareholders\n\nThe shareholding pattern for public shareholders also remained largely unchanged. The total public shareholding as a percentage of the company's equity share capital stayed steady at 28%.

After accounting for an exceptional item of Rs. 2270.09 lac, the total profit carried to the balance sheet was Rs. 16929.38 lac [5]. \n\nIn contrast, the potential for tobacco export earnings is significantly higher. The current export earnings are Rs. 930 crore, but the potential export earnings could be as high as Rs. 7000 crore, representing a sevenfold increase with just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade. This indicates substantial untapped potential in the international market. `![Potential export earnings could be Rs. 7000 crore, a significant increase from the current Rs. 930 crore.](image3)`\n\nThe implications of these financial results and the potential for export earnings suggest that the company should focus on expanding its export operations.

The adjusted profit before tax for CMB was $1.9 billion, which was $5.3 billion or 74% lower than in 2019 [11]. This decline was primarily due to higher expected credit losses (ECL) and a fall in adjusted revenue, both of which were significantly impacted by the global economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nThe increase in ECL charges reflected the challenging economic conditions, while the decrease in adjusted revenue was mainly due to the impact of lower global interest rates. Despite these challenges, CMB continued to support its customers' liquidity and working capital needs, growing deposit balances and leveraging technology to provide support under difficult circumstances [8].\n\nAdditionally, the financial data from 2020, 2019, and 2018 shows that the net operating income for CMB decreased by $1,852 million (12%) from 2019 to 2020, and the change in ECL and other credit impairment charges increased by $3,592 million (more than 200%).

Despite this, GBS saw an increase in its external gross profit margin, which rose by 2.0 points to 29.7 percent in 2020, up from 27.7 percent in 2019. This improvement was driven by a shift towards higher-value offerings and enhanced operational efficiency [8]. The pre-tax income for GBS, however, decreased by 16.8 percent, and the pre-tax margin declined by 1.2 points to 8.3 percent, primarily due to higher workforce rebalancing charges [8].\n\n![GBS financial data shows a 3.0% increase in external gross profit, a 2.0 point increase in gross profit margin, a 16.8% decrease in pre-tax income, and a 1.2 point decrease in pre-tax margin.](image8)\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, GBS revenue decreased by 2.7 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, but there was a sequential improvement from the third quarter [11].

This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income across multiple categories:\n- **Interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments** saw a decrease of $1,464 million from 2019 to 2020, compared to a decrease of only $103 million from 2018 to 2019.\n- **Time deposits and federal funds** also showed significant decreases, particularly between 2019 and 2020.\n- **Debt Securities and Loans and Leases** experienced declines, with U.S. commercial loans showing a decrease, whereas there were increases in some areas from 2018 to 2019.\n\n![The data suggest a notable downturn in net interest income primarily due to the significant decrease in interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses from 2019 to 2020.](image2)\n\n### Changes in Net Interest Expense\nNet interest expense decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020, compared to an increase of $714 million from 2018 to 2019. The reduction in interest expense was primarily due to:\n- **Interest-bearing deposits** consistently decreased, with total deposits declining by $5,245 million from 2019 to 2020.\n- **Non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits** also saw decreases in both periods, with slight reductions from 2019 to 2020.\n- **Loans and Federal Funds Purchased** experienced significant reductions in expenses by $14,120 million from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThese changes reflect the broader economic environment, where lower interest rates led to reduced interest income but also lowered the cost of funding. The organizational structure of Bank of America, with its diverse business segments, played a role in how these changes were distributed.\n\n### Organizational Structure Impact\nBank of America is organized into several business segments, each contributing differently to the overall financial performance. For example, the Consumer Banking segment, which includes consumer deposits and lending, saw a significant decrease in net interest income and noninterest income. Specifically, net interest income for Consumer Banking decreased by $3.5 billion, primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [9].\n\n![The table provides financial data for the years 2020 and 2019, showing figures in millions of dollars, with percentage changes between the two years.](image8)\n\nAdditionally, the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment, which includes Merrill Lynch and Bank of America Private Bank, saw a 16% decrease in net interest income, while noninterest income increased slightly, driven by investment and brokerage services [8].\n\nOverall, the changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020, compared to 2018 to 2019, reflect a challenging economic environment, with lower interest rates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes are evident across the different business segments of Bank of America, with varying degrees of impact on each segment's financial performance."}

The table shows:\n\n- **Net Investment Income:**\n  - 2021: $4,807 million\n  - 2020: $5,039 million\n  - Percentage Change: -4.6% [7]\n\nThe decrease in net investment income can be attributed to a significant decline in interest and other investment income, which dropped by 44.4% from 2020 to 2021. This was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as a result of low interest rates prevailing through 2021 [4].\n\n- **Interest and Other Investment Income:**\n  - 2021: $589 million\n  - 2020: $1,059 million\n  - Percentage Change: -44.4% [7]\n\nDespite the decline in interest income, dividend income increased slightly by 3.5% from 2020 to 2021, contributing to a more stable component of the investment income.\n\n- **Dividend Income:**\n  - 2021: $5,060 million\n  - 2020: $4,890 million\n  - Percentage Change: 3.5% [7]\n\n### Asset Composition\n\nThe asset composition of the insurance business also changed from 2020 to 2021. The key changes are reflected in the following categories:\n\n- **Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills:**\n  - 2021: $90,688 million\n  - 2020: $67,082 million\n  - Increase: $23,606 million [image3]\n\n- **Equity Securities:**\n  - 2021: $334,907 million\n  - 2020: $269,498 million\n  - Increase: $65,409 million [image3]\n\n- **Fixed Maturity Securities:**\n  - 2021: $16,386 million\n  - 2020: $20,317 million\n  - Decrease: $3,931 million [image3]\n\n- **Other:**\n  - 2021: $4,296 million\n  - 2020: $6,220 million\n  - Decrease: $1,924 million [image3]\n\n### Implications\n\n1. **Impact of Low Interest Rates:**\n   The substantial decline in interest and other investment income is a direct result of the low interest rate environment. This has negatively affected the earnings from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, leading to a decrease in overall net investment income [4]. \n   - `![{Total assets increased, with significant growth in cash, cash equivalents, and equity securities, while fixed maturity securities and other assets decreased.}](image3)`\n\n2. **Shift in Asset Allocation:**\n   The increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills indicates a strategic shift towards maintaining ample liquidity, which is crucial in uncertain economic conditions. This aligns with the company's priority of safety over yield for short-term investments [4].\n   - `![{Total assets increased, with significant growth in cash, cash equivalents, and equity securities, while fixed maturity securities and other assets decreased.}](image3)`\n\n3. **Stability from Dividend Income:**\n   The slight increase in dividend income provides some stability to the investment income, offsetting the decline in interest income. This suggests that the company's portfolio includes a mix of high-dividend-yielding stocks, which helps in maintaining a more balanced income stream [5].\n\n4. **Volatility in Equity Securities:**\n   The significant increase in equity securities reflects the company's continued investment in this asset class. However, this also increases the volatility of reported earnings due to the inherent volatility of equity prices [6][7]. \n   - `![{Total assets increased, with significant growth in cash, cash equivalents, and equity securities, while fixed maturity securities and other assets decreased.}](image3)`\n\nIn summary, the net investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower interest income, while the asset composition shifted towards higher liquidity and equity securities. These changes reflect a strategy to maintain financial flexibility and balance, despite the challenging interest rate environment."}

This significant improvement was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million. The increase in total refined product sales of 1.14 million barrels per day in 2021, which increased 14 percent from 2020, was mainly driven by higher gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel demand as travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continued to ease [5].\n\nFor 2019, the table in image1 shows that the U.S. downstream sector had earnings of $1,559 million. Moving to 2020, the same table indicates a substantial loss of $571 million. By 2021, however, the earnings rebounded significantly to $2,389 million ![Earnings in the U.S. downstream sector saw a major recovery in 2021](image1). \n\n### International Downstream Earnings\nInternational downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared with $618 million in 2020 [11]. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million between periods. \n\nThe table in image8 displays this trend, showing international downstream earnings of $922 million in 2019, dropping to $618 million in 2020, and further declining to $525 million in 2021 ![International downstream earnings showed a decline from 2019 through 2021](image8).\n\n### Significant Factors Affecting Changes\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes:\n\n1. **Higher Margins and Sales Volumes**: For the U.S. downstream sector, higher margins and sales volumes were key drivers of improved earnings in 2021 [4]. This is supported by the increase in total refined product sales mentioned in text quote [5].\n\n2. **Impact of the Pandemic**: Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic heavily influenced demand and margins. As restrictions eased, demand for refined products surged, boosting U.S. downstream earnings [5].\n\n3. **Foreign Currency Effects**: In the international downstream sector, foreign currency effects played a significant role. There was a favorable swing in foreign currency impacts contributing positively to the earnings [11], as shown in image8.\n\n4. **Operating Expenses**: Higher operating expenses negatively affected both U.S. and international downstream earnings, though they were more pronounced in the international sector [4] ![Operating expenses remained relatively stable but still impacted net earnings](image2).\n\nIn summary, U.S. downstream earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to substantial profits in 2021, driven by higher margins and sales volumes amid easing pandemic restrictions. Conversely, international downstream earnings declined from 2019 to 2021, affected by lower margins and higher operating expenses, despite some relief from favorable foreign currency effects.\n\n**Final Answer:** U.S. downstream earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to profits in 2021 due to higher margins and sales volumes, while international downstream earnings declined from 2019 to 2021 due to lower margins and higher operating expenses, partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects."}

According to the financial data, the balance as of January 1, 2020, was $303 million, and by December 31, 2020, it had reduced to $89 million [11].

This decline was primarily driven by a 11.8% decrease in cigarette shipments, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020. However, there was a 50.8% increase in heated tobacco unit shipments, from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020. This is illustrated in the following data:\n![Total shipment volume for Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.6% from 2019 to 2020, with a 11.8% decrease in cigarettes and a 50.8% increase in heated tobacco units.](image3)\n\nThe financial activities also showed notable changes. For instance, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding unfavorable currency movements, it increased by $0.2 billion, mainly due to higher net earnings, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs [3]. The higher working capital requirements were primarily due to the build-up of inventory in the supply chain related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of excise tax-paid inventory movements and excise tax payments [8].\n\nAdditionally, the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures led to a reduction in net cash used in investing activities by $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [11].

This significant increase in net income was driven by several factors, including higher noninterest income, a decrease in the provision for credit losses, and lower noninterest expenses. \n\nTotal revenue increased by 6% from the previous year, with lower net interest income more than offset by growth in noninterest income. The company benefited from strong gains in affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains from the sales of its student lending, asset management, and corporate trust businesses, which are not expected to repeat in 2022. Additionally, there was broad-based revenue growth across various business segments, including Home Lending, Consumer & Small Business Banking, credit cards, Auto lending, Commercial Real Estate, investment banking, and Wealth & Investment Management [6].\n\n### Selected Balance Sheet Data: Loans and Deposits\n**Loans:**\n- Total loans (average and period-end) decreased as paydowns exceeded originations. Home Lending loan balances were also impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations. Small Business period-end loan balances were also affected by a decline in PPP loans [5].\n- For specific data, the table shows that total loans in 2021 were $181,237 million, down from $211,436 million in 2020, representing a decrease of $30,199 million or -14%. Compared to 2019, total loans decreased from $229,354 million, a drop of $48,117 million or -21%.\n- ![Selected Balance Sheet Data (average) and (period-end) showing decreases in total loans and changes in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and lease financing and other loans.](image8)\n\n**Deposits:**\n- Total deposits (average and period-end) increased, driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [11].\n- The table provides detailed data on the increase in total deposits, showing that in 2021, total deposits were significantly higher compared to 2020 and 2019, reflecting the impact of these factors.\n- ![Selected Balance Sheet Data (average) and (period-end) showing increases in total deposits.](image2)\n\n### Key Changes\n- **Net Interest Income and Margin:**\n  - Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in 2021 due to lower interest rates, lower loan balances, and other factors, partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. In 2021, net interest income included interest income from PPP loans of $518 million and interest income from loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools of $1.1 billion [1].\n  - ![Income Statement showing net interest income and noninterest income, with changes over the years.](image3)\n\n- **Noninterest Income:**\n  - Noninterest income increased, driven by higher mortgage banking noninterest income, card fees, and deposit-related fees. Specifically, higher gains related to the resecuritization of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools, higher interchange fees, and higher consumer transaction volumes contributed to the growth [12].\n  - ![Income Statement showing noninterest income categories and total noninterest income.](image3)\n\n- **Expenses:**\n  - Noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating losses, restructuring charges, and professional and outside services expense, partially offset by higher incentive and revenue-related compensation in personnel expense [8].\n  - ![Table showing financial data over a three-year period ending December 31 for various categories of expenses.](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the net income for Consumer Banking and Lending increased significantly, driven by higher noninterest income and lower provisions for credit losses.

Specifically, in 2019, the average loans were $13.3 billion, which dropped to $12.9 billion in 2020. This decline can be attributed to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lower consumer spending and higher paydown rates.\n- **2020 to 2021**: The average Card Member loans increased from $12.9 billion in 2020 to $15.0 billion in 2021. This growth reflects the recovery from the pandemic, with increased consumer spending and economic activity. \n\n### Net Interest Income\n- **2019 to 2020**: Net interest income declined from $866 million in 2019 to $967 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and a reduction in the outstanding balances of receivables and loans, as noted in the text [12].\n- **2020 to 2021**: Net interest income increased slightly from $967 million in 2020 to $1,011 million in 2021. This increase was driven by lower cost of funds, partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances, as stated in [12].\n\n### Implications for Financial Performance\n- **Revenue Growth**: Despite the initial decline in 2020, the company saw a strong rebound in 2021. Total revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, reflecting double-digit growth in all non-interest revenue lines, including discount revenue and net card fees [2]. This growth was driven by higher Card Member spending and an increase in new card acquisitions, as mentioned in [2] and [6].\n- **Provisions for Credit Losses**: Provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to reserve releases in 2021 versus reserve builds in 2020 and lower net write-offs. The reserve releases were driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, as indicated in [4].\n- **Expense Management**: While salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased, the overall financial health of the company remained robust. The company maintained strong levels of customer retention and satisfaction, and achieved record levels of Card Member spending, as highlighted in [8].\n\nThe table in `![{Total Revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses increased from $9,126M in 2020 to $12,938M in 2021.}](image3)` shows that the total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses increased significantly from $9,126 million in 2020 to $12,938 million in 2021, reflecting the positive impact of the recovery in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the average Card Member loans and net interest income experienced a decline in 2020 due to the pandemic but recovered in 2021, leading to improved financial performance, higher revenues, and a net benefit from provisions for credit losses."}

{"q_id": 623, "model": "qwen-max", "in_tok": 4905, "out_tok": 741, "total_tok": 5646, "response": "Share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities both play significant roles in contributing to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position for the year 2020. Let's break down how each of these factors impacts the company.\n\n### Share-Based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation is a form of payment to employees or executives using shares of the company. This can include stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and other equity awards. For the year 2020, share-based compensation had the following effects:\n\n- **Increase in Additional Paid-in Capital**: The issuance of RSUs and other share-based awards increases the Additional Paid-in Capital. As noted, share-based compensation expense increased Restricted Share Units by 1,118,284 and Additional Paid-in Capital by $79,522, totaling $1,197,806 [image2].\n- **Impact on Retained Earnings**: The expense related to share-based compensation is recognized in the income statement, which reduces net income. However, this is offset by the increase in Additional Paid-in Capital, leading to an overall positive impact on shareholders' equity.\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nCash flow from operating activities is a critical component of a company's financial health, as it reflects the cash generated from its core business operations. For the year 2020, the cash flow from operating activities contributed to Accenture's cash position in the following ways:\n\n- **Net Income**: Net income for 2020 was $5,185,313, which is the starting point for the cash flow from operating activities [image4]. This strong net income indicates a robust operational performance.\n- **Adjustments for Non-Cash Items**: Adjustments such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation are added back to net income to determine the cash generated from operations. These adjustments help to provide a clearer picture of the actual cash inflow.\n- **Changes in Working Capital**: Changes in working capital, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities, also affect the cash flow from operating activities. Positive changes in working capital can further enhance the cash position.\n\n### Combined Impact on Shareholders' Equity and Cash Position\n\n- **Shareholders' Equity**: The increase in Additional Paid-in Capital from share-based compensation directly boosts shareholders' equity. Additionally, the net income, after accounting for all expenses, including share-based compensation, contributes to retained earnings, further enhancing shareholders' equity.\n- **Cash Position**: Strong cash flow from operating activities ensures that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations, invest in growth opportunities, and return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For 2020, the cash flow from operating activities provided a solid foundation for Accenture's financial stability and flexibility.\n\nIn summary, share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities both contribute positively to Accenture plc's shareholders' equity and cash position for the year 2020. Share-based compensation increases Additional Paid-in Capital, while strong cash flow from operating activities ensures robust liquidity and financial health. \n\n![The table provides a detailed overview of changes in shareholders' equity for Accenture over the fiscal year running from August 31, 2017, to August 31, 2018.](image7)\n![This table presents a company's cash flow statement for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

This substantial increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Varian, which required significant financing. The table shows that the liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities rose from €2,982 million in 2020 to €11,708 million in 2021, reflecting the additional borrowing to finance the acquisition. `![{Liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.}](image1)`\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\nThe current liabilities also saw a notable increase. For example, other current financial liabilities rose from €93 million in 2020 to €263 million in 2021, and other current liabilities increased from €1,198 million to €2,016 million. These increases can be attributed to the higher operational and financial activities associated with the acquisition. `![{Other current financial liabilities and other current liabilities increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.}](image2)`\n\n**Non-Current Liabilities:**\nDeferred tax liabilities increased from €470 million in 2020 to €2,082 million in 2021, driven by the acquisition and related financial transactions. `![{Deferred tax liabilities increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.}](image5)`\n\n### Equity\n\n**Issued Capital and Capital Reserves:**\nEquity rose by €3,828 million to €16,339 million, mainly due to the issuance of new shares for financing the acquisition of Varian. Issued capital increased by €53 million, and capital reserves by €2,275 million. `![{Total equity increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by issued capital and capital reserves.}](image6)`\n\n**Treasury Shares:**\nThe number of treasury shares held increased, with the company repurchasing more shares to fulfill share-based payment programs. As of September 30, 2021, 5,328,965 treasury shares were held, compared to 898,249 in 2020. `![{Treasury shares increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.}](image6)`\n\n**Retained Earnings and Other Components of Equity:**\nRetained earnings improved from -€1,276 million in 2020 to -€300 million in 2021, and other components of equity improved from -€741 million to -€85 million, indicating better financial performance and management. `![{Retained earnings and other components of equity improved from 2020 to 2021.}](image6)`\n\n### Key Drivers\n\n- **Acquisition of Varian:** The acquisition of Varian was a major driver, leading to increased borrowings and a rise in liabilities.\n- **Capital Increase:** The capital increase in March 2021, which raised €53 million in issued capital and €2,284 million in capital reserves, significantly boosted equity.\n- **Operational Performance:** Improved operational performance, as seen in the net income and free cash flow, contributed to the positive changes in equity. `![{Net income and free cash flow improved from 2020 to 2021.}](image7)`\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity changed significantly from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian, a capital increase, and improved operational performance."}

Specifically, the company issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D, and used the proceeds to redeem in full $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C, and $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B [10]. This activity is reflected in the cash flows from financing activities, which showed a net cash used of $14,933 million in 2021, as seen in the statement of cash flows. `![Net cash used in financing activities was $14,933 million in 2021, reflecting the issuance and redemption of preferred shares.](image3)`\n\nFor 2020, while there were no specific issuances or redemptions of preferred shares mentioned, the overall net cash used in financing activities was $9,068 million. This amount included other financing activities such as changes in customer deposits, short-term borrowings, long-term debt transactions, and dividends paid, but not specific to preferred shares. `![Net cash used in financing activities was $9,068 million in 2020, with no specific mention of preferred share activities.](image3)`\n\nIn terms of shareholders' equity, the issuance and redemption of preferred shares in 2021 affected the balance sheet. The preferred shares outstanding remained at 1,600 shares, with a par value of $1.66⅔, as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. However, the additional paid-in capital decreased from $161 million in 2020 to $153 million in 2021, likely due to the redemption of preferred shares. `![Preferred shares outstanding remained at 1,600 shares, with a decrease in additional paid-in capital from $161 million in 2020 to $153 million in 2021.](image4)`\n\nThe total shareholders' equity also decreased from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, partly influenced by the issuance and redemption of preferred shares, along with other factors such as retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). `![Total shareholders’ equity decreased from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021.](image4)`\n\nIn summary, the issuance and redemption of preferred shares in 2021 significantly impacted the cash flows and shareholders' equity, with a net cash outflow in financing activities and a reduction in additional paid-in capital and total shareholders' equity."}

The total assets for the consolidated segment include current and non-current assets. \n\n- **Current Assets**: These include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, prepaid expenses, and inventories.\n- **Non-Current Assets**: These include property, plant, and equipment, long-term receivables, intangible assets, goodwill, and other assets.\n\nWhile the exact figures for total assets are not directly stated, the table shows the components that make up the total assets. To determine the change, we would need to sum these components for both years and compare them.

The amounts are in millions of dollars.}](image2)` provides a detailed breakdown of the cash flow from operating activities for the consolidated segment.\n\n- **Net cash provided by operating activities** was $7.18 billion in 2021, compared with $4.05 billion in 2020 [1].\n- The increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2021 adjusted for non-cash items, which included higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. Additionally, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow [1].\n\n### Implications on Business Operations\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities suggests that the company's core business operations were more profitable and efficient in 2021 compared to 2020. This improvement can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Higher Profit**: The company generated more profit in 2021, which, when adjusted for non-cash items, contributed significantly to the cash flow.\n- **Accruals and Payments**: Higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation and lower actual payments for these incentives positively affected the cash flow.\n- **Working Capital Management**: While there were increased working capital requirements, the favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset the unfavorable changes in inventory and accounts receivable [1].\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom 2020 to 2021, the total assets and cash flow from operating activities for the consolidated segment increased, indicating improved financial performance and operational efficiency. The higher cash flow from operating activities, driven by higher profits and better management of working capital, suggests a stronger financial position and potential for future growth."}

This change can be attributed to several key factors:\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: There was a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents, from $32,965 million in 2020 to $22,028 million in 2021, a reduction of $10,937 million. This is evident from the financial statement, which shows a drop in both cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other banks.\n- **Investment Securities**: The investment securities also saw a substantial decrease, from $21,631 million in 2020 to $2,591 million in 2021, a reduction of $19,040 million.\n- **Card Member Receivables and Loans**: On the other hand, there was an increase in Card Member receivables (less reserves for credit losses) from $43,434 million in 2020 to $53,581 million in 2021, and in Card Member loans (less reserves for credit losses) from $68,029 million in 2020 to $85,257 million in 2021. These increases partially offset the decreases in cash and investment securities.\n\n### Total Liabilities\nThe total liabilities of the entity decreased from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021, a reduction of $2,012 million. This change can be attributed to:\n- **Customer Deposits**: A slight decrease in customer deposits from $86,875 million in 2020 to $84,382 million in 2021.\n- **Long-term Debt**: A reduction in long-term debt from $42,952 million in 2020 to $38,675 million in 2021.\n- **Other Liabilities**: An increase in other liabilities from $27,234 million in 2020 to $30,497 million in 2021, which partially offset the decreases in customer deposits and long-term debt.\n\n### Comprehensive Income\nThe comprehensive income for the entity increased from $2,977 million in 2020 to $8,010 million in 2021. This increase is primarily due to a higher net income, which rose from $3,135 million in 2020 to $8,060 million in 2021. However, the other comprehensive loss also improved, decreasing from $(158) million in 2020 to $(50) million in 2021. The improvement in other comprehensive loss is driven by net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits, which showed a positive adjustment of $155 million in 2021 compared to a negative adjustment of $(150) million in 2020. `![The table provides a breakdown of net income and various component adjustments to arrive at comprehensive income for each year.](image2)`\n\n### Cash Flows\nThe cash flows for the entity provide further context for these changes:\n- **Operating Activities**: Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $5,591 million in 2020 to $14,645 million in 2021, indicating stronger operational performance.\n- **Investing Activities**: Net cash used in investing activities shifted from a positive $11,632 million in 2020 to a negative $(10,529) million in 2021, reflecting significant investments in card member loans and other assets.\n- **Financing Activities**: Net cash used in financing activities increased from $(9,068) million in 2020 to $(14,933) million in 2021, primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments. `![The table provides a detailed account of cash inflows and outflows, including operating, investing, and financing activities.](image7)`\n\nIn summary, the entity's total assets and total liabilities both decreased from 2020 to 2021, with significant reductions in cash and investment securities, partially offset by increases in card member receivables and loans. The comprehensive income improved, driven by higher net income and better other comprehensive loss. The cash flows indicate strong operational performance but significant investments and financing activities that impacted the overall financial position."}

According to the detailed revenue table, the net operating income for Retail Banking, which is part of WPB, was $12,938 million in 2020 [8]. For Wealth Management, also under WPB, it was $7,818 million in the same year [8]. Combining these figures gives us an approximate total net operating income for WPB. Meanwhile, the overall net operating income across all segments in 2020 was $13,312 million ![Summary of financial data showing a decrease in net operating income](image1).\n\nFor CMB, specific segment details are less explicit, but we can infer from quote [2] that despite challenging conditions, they managed to grow deposit balances. However, the global lower interest rates significantly impacted their revenues. The table showing management’s view indicates that Global Liquidity and Cash Management, often associated with CMB, saw a revenue drop of $1,754 million (-30%) from 2019 to 2020 ![Detailed breakdown of revenues showing significant drops in certain segments](image7). \n\nNext, let's look at the profit before tax. In 2020, the adjusted profit before tax was $1,868 million, which was $5,302 million (74%) lower than in 2019 ![Summary of financial data showing a sharp decline in profit before tax](image1). This significant decrease affected both WPB and CMB. Specifically, WPB faced challenges like lower customer activity due to the Covid-19 outbreak impacting non-interest income [9], while CMB grappled with higher adjusted ECL charges and reduced interest rates [2].\n\nIn summary, both WPB and CMB experienced declines in net operating income and profit before tax in 2020 compared to previous years. WPB had a combined net operating income of approximately $20,756 million ($12,938 million + $7,818 million), whereas CMB’s components showed notable decreases, particularly in liquidity and cash management. Both segments saw reduced profitability, primarily driven by the global economic impacts of the pandemic and lower interest rates.\n\nTherefore, the financial performance of HSBC's Wealth and Personal Banking showed a higher net operating income but faced similar profit before tax challenges as Commercial Banking in 2020."}

According to the data, total equity went down from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020 [image6].

In 2019, the effective tax rate was notably high at 41%, which significantly dropped to 9% in 2020 and further adjusted to 12% in 2021 [image2]. This reduction is indicative of strategic financial maneuvers and external influences on their tax liabilities.\n\nOne substantial factor contributing to these fluctuations is the benefit from FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) deduction. The figures show a consistent deduction over the three years: $(419) million in 2019, $(381) million in 2020, and $(550) million in 2021 [image2]. These deductions have played a role in lowering the overall tax burden, particularly noticeable in 2021 with a more significant deduction.\n\nAnother considerable influence is the derecognition of deferred tax assets on distributed intellectual property, which occurred solely in 2019 with a charge of $2,472 million [image2]. This one-time event drastically increased the total tax provision for 2019, explaining the spike in the effective tax rate that year.\n\nAdditionally, the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets in 2019 resulted in a benefit of $(570) million [image2]. Such strategic tax asset management contributed to managing the effective tax rate despite other increases in provisions.\n\nLooking at unrecognized tax benefits, there is a clear upward trend from $1,705 million in 2019 to $1,901 million in 2020, and further to $2,136 million in 2021 [image5]. This increase suggests ongoing assessments and adjustments in response to audits and potential legal proceedings, as noted in the text [10].\n\nThe geographical distribution of revenues also sheds light on tax considerations. The United States segment showed revenues of $7,042 million in 2019, $5,004 million in 2020, and rebounded to $8,781 million in 2021 [image1]. Conversely, foreign revenues were relatively stable but saw a notable rise in 2021 to $1,493 million [image1]. This variance might influence the regional tax strategies and provisions due to differing tax regimes.\n![Revenue distribution by region](image1)\n\nFurther insight comes from the current and deferred tax provisions. The federal current tax provision saw a significant drop from $1,563 million in 2019 to $210 million in 2020 before rising again to $942 million in 2021 [image7]. On the deferred side, a substantial benefit of $2,037 million was recognized in 2019, contrasting with provisions of $(251) million in 2021 [image7]. These swings reflect the complex interplay of timing differences and regulatory changes affecting tax liabilities.\n\nIn summary, Qualcomm’s tax provisions and benefits from 2019 to 2021 reveal a dynamic landscape influenced by strategic tax planning, significant one-time events, and fluctuating unrecognized tax benefits. The effective tax rate decreased substantially from 2019 to 2020 due to various deductions and adjustments, stabilizing slightly higher in 2021 amidst continued strategic tax management. \n\nThe significant changes in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 include a notable decrease in effective tax rate driven by increased FDII deductions and strategic deferred tax asset management, alongside rising unrecognized tax benefits reflecting ongoing compliance and audit activities."}

According to the data, the balance at the beginning of 2021 was $603.0 billion. By the end of the year, after accounting for inflows, outflows, and market impacts, the sale resulted in a substantial reduction, with the final balance being $(587.1) billion, as shown in the table [![The sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, significantly reduced the total assets under management.](image2)].\n\nThis sale also had broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet. The sale generated a net gain of $269 million, which contributed to the increase in other income for 2021 [1]. This gain, along with the gains from the sale of the Corporate Trust Services business ($674 million) and the student loan portfolio ($355 million), helped to boost noninterest income, which increased by $5,120 million, or 104%, from 2020 to 2021 [![Noninterest Income increased by 104% from 2020 to 2021.](image1)]. \n\nHowever, the sale of WFAM also led to lower asset-based fees, as the company no longer earned fees from managing and administering these assets [5]. This reduction in fees, combined with other factors such as lower interest rates and unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness, contributed to a decrease in net interest income, which fell by $1,982 million, or 45%, from 2020 to 2021 [![Net Interest Income decreased by 45% from 2020 to 2021.](image1)].\n\nAdditionally, the sale of WFAM and other divestitures led to lower expenses related to divested businesses, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and deferred compensation expenses [10]. The overall impact on the balance sheet included a decrease in total loans and a shift in the composition of the company's securities, as seen in the changes in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities [![The total fair value of securities decreased from 2020 to 2021.](image8)].\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, significantly reduced the total assets under management and led to a mix of positive and negative financial impacts, including a substantial gain in noninterest income but a decline in asset-based fees and net interest income."}

Let's break down the key factors and their effects.\n\n### Net Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [6]. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, which reduced the income generated from various financial instruments. For example, the interest income from interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments decreased by $1,464 million from 2019 to 2020, as shown in the table `![{Net interest income and interest expense data for 2019 and 2020, showing a significant decrease in interest income and a smaller decrease in interest expense.}](image1)`. Additionally, there were significant decreases in interest income from time deposits and federal funds, as well as from debt securities and loans and leases.\n\n### Net Interest Expense\nNet interest expense also decreased, but by a smaller amount. The table `![{Net interest income and interest expense data for 2019 and 2020, showing a significant decrease in interest income and a smaller decrease in interest expense.}](image1)` shows that the total interest expense decreased by $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020. This reduction was mainly due to lower interest rates on interest-bearing deposits, non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits, and loans and federal funds purchased.\n\n### Net Interest Spread\nThe net interest spread, which is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, was affected by these changes. The overall decrease in net interest income outpaced the decrease in net interest expense, leading to a compression of the net interest spread. This is evident from the detailed breakdown in the table `![{Detailed financial performance data over three years, highlighting trends and shifts in balance and interest rates.}](image8)`, which shows the rates on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n### Main Contributing Factors\n- **Lower Interest Rates**: The primary factor was the decline in interest rates, which reduced the income from interest-earning assets more significantly than the reduction in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n- **Deposit Growth**: Despite the lower rates, the company experienced continued deposit growth, which was invested in long-term securities. This contributed to the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet, as mentioned in [2].\n- **Economic Conditions**: The economic conditions, including the impact of the pandemic, led to lower client activity and higher deposit balances, further reducing interest income [4].\n\nIn summary, the net interest spread was compressed in 2020 due to a larger decrease in net interest income compared to the decrease in net interest expense, primarily driven by lower interest rates and changes in economic conditions."}

The segment saw an increase in sales volume and favorable price realization, which positively impacted the operating profit [11].\n- Specifically, the fourth quarter of 2021 saw an operating profit of $1,611 million, up from $1,380 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and lower manufacturing costs, despite higher SG&A/R&D expenses [12].\n- ![The chart shows the breakdown of factors contributing to the increase in consolidated operating profit from 2020 to 2021, resulting in a total of $6,878 million for 2021.](image8)\n\n### Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n\n**Consolidated:**\n- The consolidated operating cash flow for 2021 was $7.20 billion, up $871 million compared to 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. Lower payments for short-term incentive compensation also favorably impacted cash flow, though this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements [8].\n\n**Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T):**\n- For ME&T, the net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $7,177 million, compared to $4,054 million in 2020.

Here are the key figures:\n\n- **Beginning of period:**\n  - 2020: $1,423 million\n  - 2019: $1,056 million\n\n- **Gross increases:**\n  - **Current year tax positions:**\n    - 2020: $416 million\n    - 2019: $512 million\n  - **Prior year tax positions:**\n    - 2020: $120 million\n    - 2019: $2 million\n\n- **Gross decreases:**\n  - **Prior year tax positions:**\n    - 2020: $(130) million\n    - 2019: $(96) million\n  - **Settlements:**\n    - 2020: $— \n    - 2019: $(46) million\n  - **Statute of limitations lapses:**\n    - 2020: $—\n    - 2019: $(5) million\n\n- **End of period:**\n  - 2020: $1,829 million\n  - 2019: $1,423 million\n\nFrom this, we can see that the gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million at the end of 2019 to $1,829 million at the end of 2020. This increase is primarily due to the current year tax positions, which added $416 million, and prior year tax positions, which added $120 million. There were no significant settlements or statute of limitations lapses in 2020, which also contributed to the overall increase.\n\n### Common Share Repurchases\nThe table in `image1` shows the common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019:\n\n- **Common share repurchases, shares:**\n  - 2020: 14 million\n  - 2019: 22 million\n\n- **Common share repurchases, average price per share:**\n  - 2020: $300.58\n  - 2019: $245.97\n\n- **Common share repurchases, aggregate cost:**\n  - 2020: $4,250 million\n  - 2019: $5,500 million\n\n- **Board authorized shares remaining:**\n  - 2020: 58 million\n  - 2019: 72 million\n\nThe company repurchased fewer shares in 2020 (14 million) compared to 2019 (22 million), but at a higher average price per share ($300.58 in 2020 vs. $245.97 in 2019). The aggregate cost of repurchases was lower in 2020 ($4,250 million) compared to 2019 ($5,500 million).\n\n### Implications for Financial Position\n- **Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits:** The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits from $1,423 million to $1,829 million suggests that the company has more uncertain tax positions. This could potentially lead to future cash outflows if these positions are not sustained. However, the company believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [6].\n\n- **Common Share Repurchases:** The reduction in the number of shares repurchased and the lower aggregate cost in 2020 indicate a more conservative approach to capital management. This could be due to market conditions or strategic decisions. The remaining authorization to repurchase up to 58 million shares as of December 31, 2020, provides flexibility for future share repurchases [7].\n\nIn summary, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020, while the common share repurchases decreased from 22 million shares in 2019 to 14 million shares in 2020, with a lower aggregate cost. These changes suggest a more cautious approach to both tax and capital management, with potential future adjustments based on audit outcomes and market conditions. \n\n![The table presents financial data related to common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.](image1)\n\n![The table presents data on gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.](image5)"}

This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, and the impact from changes in dealer inventories [3].\n\n- **North America**: Sales increased by 29 percent, influenced by higher end-user demand for services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, but inventories remained about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021 [2].\n- **EAME (Europe, Africa, Middle East)**: Sales increased by 24 percent, mainly due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services, and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021 [4].\n- **Asia/Pacific**: Sales increased by 9 percent, primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services, and favorable price realization.

The key factors contributing to this increase include:\n\n- **Sales Volume**: Increased by $687 million.\n- **Price Realization**: Increased by $507 million.\n- **Manufacturing Costs**: Decreased by $816 million.\n- **SG&A / R&D**: Decreased by $272 million.\n- **Currency**: Decreased by $48 million.\n- **Financial Products**: Increased by $63 million.\n- **Other**: Increased by $110 million.\n\nThese changes are visually represented in the bar chart, which shows the consolidated operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 as $1,611 million, up from $1,380 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The chart breaks down the contributions from various factors, such as sales volume, price realization, and manufacturing costs, among others. `![4th Qtr 2021 Operating Profit is shown as $1,611 million.](image4)`\n\n### Contributing Factors:\n- **Higher Sales Volume**: Driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. For example, Construction Industries’ total sales were $5.736 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $228 billion, or 27 percent, compared with $4.508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 [9].\n- **Favorable Price Realization**: This contributed significantly to the overall increase in operating profit. For instance, Resource Industries' profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 12 percent, compared with $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, partly due to favorable price realization [1].\n- **Increased Manufacturing Costs and SG&A/R&D Expenses**: These were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight and material costs [1].\n\nIn summary, the changes in sales volume and operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 were driven by higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, despite increased manufacturing and SG&A/R&D expenses."}

According to the financial data, the net interest income for Consumer Banking dropped from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020, a decrease of $3,460 million [1]. This decline was primarily driven by lower interest rates, although it was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. The total noninterest income also decreased from $10,429 million in 2019 to $8,564 million in 2020, a reduction of $1,865 million. This decline was due to lower card income and service charges, as well as other income, which was impacted by the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results. Consequently, the total revenue, net of interest expense, for Consumer Banking fell from $38,587 million in 2019 to $33,262 million in 2020, a decrease of $5,325 million. `![The table shows a general decline in net interest income and revenue figures from 2019 to 2020, with detailed insights into each major aspect of banking operations.](image1)`\n\nIn **Wealth Management**, specifically within Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM), the revenue also saw a decline. MLGWM's revenue decreased by five percent, from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows [6]. The total revenue, net of interest expense, for the combined wealth management segments (Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank) decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020, a reduction of $954 million. `![The table provides financial data for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank for the years 2020 and 2019, showing a decline in total revenue.](image2)`\n\nIn summary, both the consumer banking and wealth management sectors experienced a decline in net interest income and total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019."}

These payments reduce the company's retained earnings and can affect the overall equity structure. According to the Consolidated Statement of Equity, the company paid out cash dividends, which are reflected in the following:\n\n- **Retained Earnings:** The amount of retained earnings is reduced by the total cash dividends paid during the year.\n- **Common Stock Share Activity:** The table shows that cash dividends were paid, reducing the retained earnings for the year 2021 [5].\n\n### Treasury Stock Transactions\nTreasury stock refers to shares that a company has bought back from the market. These transactions impact the equity structure and cash flow as follows:\n\n- **Treasury Stock (at cost):** The cost of repurchasing shares is recorded as a reduction in the company's equity. In 2021, there were purchases and issuances of treasury shares, which affected the number of outstanding shares and the overall equity.\n- **Outstanding Shares:** The number of outstanding shares increased, likely due to fewer treasury shares being held by the company [5].\n\n### Impact on Cash Flow\nThe cash flow statement provides details on the inflows and outflows of cash, including those related to dividend payments and treasury stock transactions.\n\n- **Operating Activities:** The net income (loss) is adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. For 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was $29,187 million [6].\n- **Financing Activities:** This section includes cash flows from financing activities such as the payment of dividends and the purchase or issuance of treasury shares. In 2021, the net cash used for financing activities was ($23,113 million), which includes the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares [6].\n\n### Summary\n- **Cash Dividends:** Reduced retained earnings and contributed to the net cash used for financing activities.\n- **Treasury Stock Transactions:** Affected the equity structure by reducing the cost of treasury stock and increasing the number of outstanding shares. These transactions also contributed to the net cash used for financing activities.\n\nIn conclusion, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions in 2021 reduced Chevron's retained earnings and overall equity, and they contributed to the net cash used for financing activities. \n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities: $29,187 million (2021), $10,577 million (2020), $27,314 million (2019).

Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $0.5 billion, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.2 billion, due primarily to higher net earnings (excluding 2019 non-cash charges related to the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the loss on deconsolidation of RBH), partially offset by higher working capital requirements of $0.5 billion and higher cash payments in 2020 for asset impairment and exit costs.\n\nFrom the table, we can see:\n- **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities**: \n  - 2020: $9,812 million\n  - 2019: $10,090 million\n  - 2018: $9,478 million\n\nThis shows a decrease of $278 million from 2019 to 2020, which aligns with the text quote [6].\n\n### Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $0.7 billion from the comparable 2019 period [2]. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets principally related to changes in exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. dollar.\n\nFrom the table, we can see:\n- **Capital Expenditures**:\n  - 2020: $602 million\n  - 2019: $852 million\n  - 2018: $1,436 million\n\nThis confirms the decrease in capital expenditures from 2019 to 2020, contributing to the reduced cash used in investing activities.\n\n### Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $0.4 billion from the comparable 2019 period [3]. The change was due primarily to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity.\n\nFrom the table, we can see:\n- **Dividends Paid**:\n  - 2020: $7,364 million\n  - 2019: $7,161 million\n  - 2018: $6,885 million\n\n- **Payments to Noncontrolling Interests and Other**:\n  - 2020: $776 million\n  - 2019: $357 million\n  - 2018: $537 million\n\nThese figures show an increase in both dividends and payments to noncontrolling interests, supporting the increase in net cash used in financing activities.\n\n### Overall Cash Balance\nThe overall cash balance is influenced by the net changes in operating, investing, and financing activities. From the table, we can see the following:\n\n- **Net Cash Used in Financing Activities**:\n  - 2020: $(8,496) million\n  - 2019: $(8,061) million\n  - 2018: $(9,651) million\n\n- **Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash**:\n  - 2020: $258 million\n  - 2019: $27 million\n  - 2018: $(685) million\n\n- **Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash**:\n  - **Increase (Decrease)**:\n    - 2020: $420 million\n    - 2019: $245 million\n    - 2018: $(1,856) million\n  - **Balance at End of Year**:\n    - 2020: $7,285 million\n    - 2019: $6,865 million\n    - 2018: $6,620 million\n\nDespite the decrease in operating cash flows and the increase in financing outflows, the overall cash balance increased by $420 million in 2020, partly due to favorable exchange rate changes and lower cash used in investing activities.\n\n![{The table presents financial data, specifically the cash flow information for a company, over three years ending December 31 for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

The evaluation of executive remuneration is based on several key factors, including consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance.\n\n### Consolidated Operating Income\nConsolidated operating income is a critical indicator of Toyota's business performance. This metric is used to evaluate the degree of attainment of the required income set for Toyota’s sustainable growth. For instance, the evaluation method considers the degree of attainment of consolidated operating income in the current fiscal year, using the required income set in 2011 as a benchmark [5]. The reference value for this metric is 1 trillion yen, and the evaluation result for the current fiscal year is 150%, indicating strong performance. `![{The table shows an evaluation framework for Toyota, divided into two main criteria: Consolidated Operating Income and Volatility of Toyota’s Share Price, each with a 50% evaluation weight.}](image7)`\n\n### Volatility of Toyota’s Share Price\nThe volatility of Toyota’s share price is another significant indicator. It serves as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota’s efforts. The evaluation method compares the volatility of Toyota’s share price with the Nikkei stock average at the end of the previous fiscal year. The reference values are 6,501 yen for Toyota’s share price and 18,917 yen for the Nikkei average. This comparison helps in assessing the stability and market perception of Toyota. `![{The table shows an evaluation framework for Toyota, divided into two main criteria: Consolidated Operating Income and Volatility of Toyota’s Share Price, each with a 50% evaluation weight.}](image7)`\n\n### Individual Performance Evaluation\nIn addition to these financial metrics, individual performance evaluations are conducted to assess the qualitative performance of each director. This includes evaluating their contributions and efforts in their respective roles. `![{The table contains three rows with two columns each, detailing the indicators for evaluating Toyota’s efforts: Consolidated operating income, Volatility of Toyota’s share price, and Individual performance evaluation.}](image5)`\n\n### Remuneration Structure\nThe total remuneration for executives is composed of fixed and performance-linked components. Fixed remuneration is set based on job responsibilities and home country standards, while performance-linked remuneration is determined by the consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance. For example, the total remuneration for directors, including bonuses and share-based compensation, is 2,595 million yen, with outside directors receiving 159 million yen. `![{The table shows the remuneration details for different categories of executives, expressed in million yen.}](image2)`\n\n### Conclusion\nToyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects business performance and shareholder value indicators through a balanced approach that considers consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance.

This is a significant change from 2019, where the company had a credit of $36 million due to the sale of their manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [9].\n\nThe restructuring charges in 2020 were included in the operating profit. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, the company reported $24 million in restructuring charges, which impacted the operating profit, bringing it down to $1,228 million [image5]. In contrast, in 2019, the second quarter saw a credit of $36 million, which increased the operating profit to $1,506 million [image5].\n\nAdditionally, the restructuring accrual balances are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment [12]. The table in [image4] shows that the balance of restructuring charges at the end of 2020 was $18 million, compared to a zero balance at the end of 2019.\n\nIn summary, the restructuring charges in 2020 decreased operating profit, while the credit in 2019 increased it, resulting in a net negative impact on the financial statements in 2020."}

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $2,005 million, which rose to $2,731 million in 2019 and further to $6,346 million in 2020 [5].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this change:\n\n1. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**:\n   - In 2020, Danaher recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2.9 billion, compared to a translation loss of $75 million in 2019 and $632 million in 2018 [3]. This significant shift from a loss to a substantial gain was a major contributor to the increase in comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Pension and Postretirement Plan Benefit Adjustments**:\n   - The pension and postretirement plan benefit losses were $147 million in 2020, $90 million in 2019, and $13 million in 2018 [3]. While these losses increased slightly, they were relatively minor compared to the gains from other components.\n\n3. **Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Available-for-Sale Securities**:\n   - There was a small unrealized gain of $1 million in 2020, compared to a gain of $1 million in 2019 and a loss of $1 million in 2018 [5]. This had a minimal impact on the overall comprehensive income.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Hedge Adjustments**:\n   - The cash flow hedge adjustments resulted in a loss of $72 million in 2020, compared to a loss of $113 million in 2019 and no adjustment in 2018 [5]. The decrease in the loss from 2019 to 2020 also contributed positively to the comprehensive income.\n\n5. **Net Earnings**:\n   - Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled approximately $3.6 billion, compared to approximately $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 [6]. This increase in net earnings was driven by higher sales, net earnings from Cytiva, and the gain on the sale of product lines, partially offset by the 2019 gain on the disposition of Envista Holdings Corporation.\n\n6. **Total Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n   - The total other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, was $2,700 million in 2020, compared to a loss of $277 million in 2019 and a loss of $646 million in 2018 [5]. This significant improvement in other comprehensive income, primarily due to the foreign currency translation gain, was a key factor in the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased from $2,005 million in 2018 to $6,346 million in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by a large foreign currency translation gain, higher net earnings, and a reduction in cash flow hedge losses, among other factors. \n\n![Comprehensive income increased from $2,005 million in 2018 to $6,346 million in 2020, driven by foreign currency translation gains and higher net earnings.](image5)"}

For example, in `image7`, a PAN India COVID relief project has an expenditure of ₹24.73 crore. This is one of the highest amounts spent on a single project in the table. Additionally, other smaller-scale COVID relief projects are also listed, indicating a significant focus on this area.\n\n### Amount Spent on Rural Development Projects\nRural Development Projects (HRDP) are detailed in multiple images, including `image2`, `image3`, `image5`, and `image6`. These projects span various states and districts, with individual project expenditures ranging from 0.14 crore to 2.09 crore. The total amount spent on these projects is substantial, with `image2` showing a combined expenditure of 444.72 crore for three projects in Punjab.\n\n### Key Differences in Project Implementation Modes\n- **COVID Relief Projects**:\n  - **Mode of Implementation**: These projects are often implemented through implementing agencies. For instance, in `image7`, the PAN India COVID relief project is implemented through Give India, which has a CSR registration number.\n  - **Direct Implementation**: Some projects may be directly implemented by the organization, but most are executed through external agencies to ensure broader reach and efficiency.\n\n- **Rural Development Projects (HRDP)**:\n  - **Mode of Implementation**: These projects are primarily implemented through external agencies. For example, in `image2`, all three HRDP projects in Punjab are implemented by Shramik Bharti and Centre for Advance Research and Development.\n  - **Direct Implementation**: None of the rural development projects listed in the images are directly implemented by the organization. They rely on specialized agencies with expertise in rural development.\n\n### Summary\n- **Amount Spent**:\n  - **COVID Relief Projects**: Significant amounts, with a PAN India project costing ₹24.73 crore.\n  - **Rural Development Projects**: Individual projects range from 0.14 crore to 2.09 crore, with a combined total of 444.72 crore for some projects in Punjab.\n\n- **Implementation Modes**:\n  - **COVID Relief Projects**: Primarily through implementing agencies, with some direct implementation.\n  - **Rural Development Projects**: Exclusively through external implementing agencies, with no direct implementation by the organization.\n\nIn conclusion, while both types of projects have significant financial commitments, the key difference lies in the implementation mode, with rural development projects being entirely managed by external agencies, whereas COVID relief projects may involve both direct and agency-based implementation. \n\n![PAN India COVID relief project with an expenditure of ₹24.73 crore](image7)\n![Combined expenditure of 444.72 crore for three HRDP projects in Punjab](image2)"}

In 2021, the changes in financial assumptions led to a decrease of 26 million euros, as shown in the actuarial gains and losses table [image4]. This indicates that the financial assumptions, such as discount rates, had a notable effect on the DBO.\n\nThe discount rates, which are crucial for valuing the DBO, saw an increase from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021, as indicated in the table showing percentage rates for different financial indicators [image2]. Higher discount rates generally reduce the present value of future obligations, thereby decreasing the DBO. This is consistent with the observed decrease in the DBO due to changes in financial assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, the effects of demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, also impacted the DBO. The table shows a change in demographic assumptions resulting in a decrease of 8 million euros in 2021, compared to a decrease of 3 million euros in 2020 [image4]. This suggests that the updated mortality assumptions, which are based on Siemens-specific tables and other country-specific data [image5], led to a reduction in the DBO.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets, which includes various categories such as equity securities, fixed income securities, and alternative investments, increased from 2,813 million euros in 2020 to 3,259 million euros in 2021 [image6]. This increase can be attributed to better performance in the financial markets, as well as strategic investment decisions aligned with the liability-driven investment approach [12].\n\nIn summary, the changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly the increase in discount rates and updates in demographic projections, led to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation, while the fair value of plan assets increased due to improved market conditions and strategic investments. \n\n![{The table provides detailed financial data related to defined benefit plans across different fiscal years, focusing on components such as the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the effects of the asset ceiling.}](image1)\n![{The table presents percentage rates for different financial indicators as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.}](image2)\n![{The table shows actuarial gains and losses in millions of euros for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.}](image4)\n![{The table provides information on actuarial assumptions or demographic projections used in different countries as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.}](image5)\n![{The table displays financial data in millions of euros as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.

The table in `![image3]` shows the detailed breakdown of RWA for both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. \n\n### Changes in RWA Components\n- **Credit Risk RWA:**\n  - **Standardized Approach:** Increased from $342,684 million to $387,066 million, a change of $44,382 million.\n  - **Advanced Approach:** Increased from $228,927 million to $284,930 million, a change of $56,003 million.\n\n- **Market Risk RWA:**\n  - **Standardized Approach:** Increased from $51,493 million to $66,040 million, a change of $14,547 million.\n  - **Advanced Approach:** Increased from $51,597 million to $66,040 million, a change of $14,443 million.\n\n- **Operational Risk RWA:**\n  - **Advanced Approach:** Decreased from $101,972 million to $94,181 million, a change of -$7,791 million.\n  - **Standardized Approach:** Not applicable.\n\n- **Total RWA:**\n  - **Standardized Approach:** Increased from $394,177 million to $453,106 million.\n  - **Advanced Approach:** Increased from $382,496 million to $445,151 million.\n\n### Changes in External TLAC\nThe table in `![image7]` provides the data on External TLAC and its percentages relative to RWA and leverage exposure.\n\n- **External TLAC:**\n  - At December 31, 2020: $216,129 million\n  - At December 31, 2019: $196,888 million\n\n- **External TLAC as a % of RWA:**\n  - At December 31, 2020: 47.7%\n  - At December 31, 2019: 49.9%\n\n### Analysis\nThe increase in RWA, particularly in Credit Risk and Market Risk, contributed to the overall increase in RWA from 2019 to 2020. Despite the increase in External TLAC from $196,888 million to $216,129 million, the percentage of External TLAC to RWA decreased from 49.9% to 47.7%. This decrease is due to the more significant increase in RWA compared to the increase in External TLAC.\n\nIn summary, the changes in various components of the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), especially the increases in Credit Risk and Market Risk, led to an overall increase in RWA. This increase in RWA outpaced the increase in External TLAC, resulting in a decrease in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020."}

The key figures are:\n\n- **Solar energy systems in service:**\n  - 2020: $6,758 million\n  - 2019: $6,682 million\n\n- **Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization:**\n  - 2020: $(955) million\n  - 2019: $(723) million\n\n- **Net value of Solar energy systems in service after depreciation:**\n  - 2020: $5,906 million\n  - 2019: $6,061 million\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the accumulated depreciation on solar energy systems increased from $723 million to $955 million. This increase in accumulated depreciation led to a decrease in the net value of solar energy systems from $6,061 million in 2019 to $5,906 million in 2020. \n\n### Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)\n\nThe table in image3 shows the total asset values and accumulated depreciation for PPE:\n\n- **Total asset values before depreciation:**\n  - 2020: $17,864 million\n  - 2019: $14,130 million\n\n- **Less: Accumulated depreciation:**\n  - 2020: $(5,117) million\n  - 2019: $(3,734) million\n\n- **Total net value of assets:**\n  - 2020: $12,747 million\n  - 2019: $10,396 million\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the accumulated depreciation on PPE increased from $3,734 million to $5,117 million. Despite this increase in accumulated depreciation, the total net value of PPE still increased from $10,396 million in 2019 to $12,747 million in 2020. This is because the gross asset values also increased significantly, from $14,130 million in 2019 to $17,864 million in 2020, which more than offset the increase in depreciation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe accumulated depreciation increased for both solar energy systems and PPE from 2019 to 2020. For solar energy systems, this increase in depreciation led to a decrease in the net value. However, for PPE, the significant increase in gross asset values more than offset the increase in depreciation, resulting in an overall increase in the net value of PPE. \n\nThus, the net value of solar energy systems decreased, while the net value of property, plant, and equipment increased from 2019 to 2020. \n\n![The table provides a breakdown of asset categories and their recorded values as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, along with accumulated depreciation and total net value.](image3)\n![The table shows financial data related to solar energy systems for the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.](image5)"}

On November 1, 2021, the sale of WFAM was completed, and the company recorded a net gain of $269 million from this transaction [7].\n\nThe table detailing WFAM assets under management for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 shows that the total WFAM assets under management at the beginning of 2021 were $603.0 billion. During the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $(96.8) billion, with a market impact of $11.6 billion.

For instance, total assets (period-end) decreased modestly, reflecting the timing of cash deployment by the investment portfolio near the end of 2021, partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to the affiliated venture capital business [12]. The detailed breakdown of these changes can be seen in the selected balance sheet data [![Selected balance sheet data for 2021 and 2020, showing changes in various categories](image1)].\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in total WFAM assets under management, which in turn impacted Wells Fargo's balance sheet, particularly in the areas of managed assets and certain financial instruments."}

The company has focused on entering new markets and expanding its presence in existing ones, leveraging its ability to quickly adapt and respond to market demands.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Lovisa significantly increased its store count across various countries. The table in `![The table displays numbers across various countries and regions from 2016 to 2020, showing an increase in store counts.](image1)` shows the number of stores growing from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, with notable increases in regions like the UK, France, and the USA. This expansion is part of Lovisa's strategy to leverage existing international territories and capitalize on large international markets [9].\n\nOne of the key achievements during this period was the successful opening of 47 stores outside of Australia, including 14 in the UK, 8 in France, and 7 in the USA, as well as franchise stores in the Middle East and Vietnam. This demonstrates Lovisa's capability to operate profitably in international territories [9]. The company also completed the global rollout of piercing services, which enhances customer loyalty and provides additional revenue streams [11].\n\nHowever, the expansion has not been without challenges. One of the main risks faced by Lovisa is the competitive nature of the fast fashion jewellery sector, where customer preferences are ever-changing [2]. To mitigate this, Lovisa employs a product team of more than 20 people who travel the world to identify global trends and ensure that the products remain in line with the latest fashion [6]. Additionally, the company uses daily inventory monitoring software and airfreight to move products to store locations within 48 hours, ensuring that stores are always stocked with the latest trends [1].\n\nAnother challenge is the substantial barrier to entry costs, particularly in securing premium store locations. Management believes it would take a number of years for a new entrant to establish a comparable portfolio of leases in these locations [5]. Despite these barriers, Lovisa has refined its global store model, focusing on optimal store size, location, and format, allowing it to quickly roll out new stores at a low cost [8].\n\nIn terms of business strategy, Lovisa has outlined several key pillars, including international expansion, streamlining the global supply chain, enhancing existing store performance, brand proliferation, and leading and pre-empting trends. The table in `![The table outlines the business strategy for a company, focusing on different growth pillars, and is divided into five main sections: International expansion, Streamline global supply chain, Enhance existing store performance, Brand proliferation, and Lead and pre-empt trends.](image2)` provides a detailed breakdown of these strategies, associated risks, and achievements. For instance, the international expansion strategy includes leveraging existing territories, capitalizing on large international markets, and exploring franchise options [2].\n\nOverall, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy from 2016 to 2020 has been marked by significant growth, with key achievements in opening new stores and rolling out additional services. The main challenges have been managing competition and maintaining a strong, trend-driven product offering."}

According to the table presented in `![Zone EMENA's financial overview with decreases in various categories](image1)`, milk products and ice cream constituted 4.2% of total sales, amounting to CHF 849 million [1]. The overall underlying trading operating profit margin for this zone was 18.6%, which indicates a healthy profitability despite challenges in certain categories.\n\nIn Zone AOA, as shown in `![Zone AOA's financial overview showing decreases across most categories](image3)`, milk products and ice cream sales decreased from CHF 4,982 million to CHF 4,862 million, representing 23.4% of total sales. This suggests that while there was a slight decline in sales, milk products and ice cream remained a significant portion of the sales mix in this region.\n\nLooking at Zone AMS, detailed figures are provided in `![Zone AMS's financial breakdown highlighting growth metrics](image7)`. Here, milk products and ice cream made up 15.5% of total sales, decreasing from CHF 7,291 million to CHF 5,288 million. Despite the reduction in sales, the zone reported an organic growth rate of +4.8% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 20.5%.\n\nThe specific figures for milk products and ice cream across all zones are further illustrated in `![Sales and profit data for milk products and ice cream indicating growth rates](image5)`. Total sales for milk products and ice cream combined amounted to CHF 11,007 million in 2020, with a growth rate of +5.6%. The underlying trading operating profit for these products was CHF 2,652 million, reflecting a growth rate of 24.1%.\n\nOverall, while there were variations in sales figures due to regional factors, the profitability of milk products and ice cream remained robust, contributing significantly to the overall performance. \n\nIn conclusion, although sales for milk products and ice cream varied across different geographical zones, they generally maintained strong profitability metrics in 2020 [1]."}

According to the data, NII for 2020 was $27.6 billion, which was a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared with 2019 [9]. The year-on-year decrease was driven by lower market interest rates, predominantly in Asia and North America, although it was partly offset by higher NII from growth in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) [8].\n\nThe table in `![{NII and AIEA figures for 2019 and 2020}](image1)` provides specific figures:\n- **Interest Income** for 2020: $41,756 million\n- **Interest Expense** for 2020: $(14,178) million\n- **Net Interest Income** for 2020: $27,578 million\n\n### Interest Expense\nInterest expense also saw a significant reduction. For 2020, the interest expense was $2.7 billion, down $2.9 billion year-on-year [11]. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates, partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts, which increased by $142.9 billion.\n\nThe table in `![{NII and AIEA figures for 2019 and 2020}](image1)` shows:\n- **Interest Expense** for 2020: $(14,178) million\n\n### Net Operating Income\nThe net operating income is affected by both NII and interest expense. The decrease in NII and the reduction in interest expense had a combined effect on the net operating income. \n\nFrom the text, we see that the reported profit before tax for 2020 decreased by 34%, and adjusted profit before tax decreased by 45% [1]. This fall in profit was due to an increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, as well as a reduction in reported revenue. However, these factors were partly mitigated by lower reported operating expenses.\n\n### Overall Profitability\nThe overall profitability, as measured by return on average tangible equity (RoTE), was 3.1% for 2020, significantly lower than the target of 10-12% [1]. The RoTE decline was a direct result of the challenging operating environment, including the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant reduction in global interest rates.\n\nThe table in `![{Financial metrics over five years, including RoTE}](image7)` provides further context:\n- **Return on Average Tangible Equity (RoTE)** for 2020: 3.1%\n- **Return on Average Tangible Equity (RoTE)** for 2019: 8.4%\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in net interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 had a significant impact on the net operating income and overall profitability of the organization. The decrease in NII, driven by lower market interest rates, and the reduction in interest expense, partially offset by balance sheet growth, led to a decline in reported and adjusted profit before tax. This, combined with increased credit impairment charges, resulted in a lower RoTE and overall reduced profitability. \n\nThus, the changes in NII and interest expense contributed to a 34% decrease in reported profit before tax and a 45% decrease in adjusted profit before tax, leading to a RoTE of 3.1% in 2020."}

This is a decrease of $232 million, or -4.6% [6].\n\nThe primary factors contributing to this decrease were:\n- **Interest and Other Investment Income**: This segment saw a significant decline, falling from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a 44.4% decrease. This was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [9].\n- **Dividend Income**: Dividend income increased from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, a 3.5% increase. This helped to partially offset the decline in interest and other investment income [6].\n\n### Railroad Operating Earnings\nRailroad operating earnings increased from $5,161 million in 2020 to $5,990 million in 2021, a 15.9% increase [6].\n\nThe key factors contributing to this increase were:\n- **Operating Revenues**: Railroad operating revenues increased by 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher volumes (6.9%) and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit. The higher volumes were a result of continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, although there were ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain [5].\n- **Operating Expenses**: While railroad operating expenses increased by 10.2% in 2021, the ratio of operating expenses to operating revenues decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 60.9%. This improvement in the expense ratio was due to higher volumes and productivity gains, which partly offset the impact of higher fuel prices and volume-related costs [11].\n- **Volume and Revenue Per Car/Unit**: The volume increase in 2021 was significant, with a 6.9% increase in total cars/units. Additionally, the average revenue per car/unit also increased, contributing to the overall revenue growth. This was particularly evident in consumer products, where both volumes and average revenue per car/unit increased [10] and [7].\n\n### Summary\n- **Net Investment Income**: Decreased by 4.6% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a 44.4% decline in interest and other investment income, partially offset by a 3.5% increase in dividend income.\n- **Railroad Operating Earnings**: Increased by 15.9% from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher volumes and average revenue per car/unit, as well as improved productivity, which offset the impact of higher fuel prices and volume-related costs.\n\n![{The table shows the financial data for a railroad company over three years: 2021, 2020, and 2019, including figures for railroad operating revenues, operating expenses, and earnings, along with other financial metrics.}](image8)"}

According to the table in image1, the total net carrying amount for finite-lived intangible assets decreased from $334 million in 2019 to $298 million in 2020 [image1]. This reduction indicates a decline in the value of these assets over the year, primarily driven by increased accumulated amortization and possibly other adjustments.\n\nNext, examining **amortization expenses**, text quote [8] mentions that \"Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $232 million, $227 million and $276 million, respectively.\" This shows an increase in amortization expenses from $227 million in 2019 to $232 million in 2020 [8].\n\nFurther corroborating this, image1 breaks down the accumulated amortization for different categories of finite-lived intangible assets. For instance, developed technology's accumulated amortization rose from $(72) million in 2019 to $(111) million in 2020, indicating higher amortization expenses incurred during 2020 [image1].\n\nAdditionally, looking at the broader financial context, depreciation and amortization figures provided in text quote [11], show an overall rise in depreciation expenses from $1.37 billion in 2019 to $1.57 billion in 2020 [11]. Although this encompasses more than just intangible assets, it aligns with the trend of increasing amortization expenses noted specifically for finite-lived intangibles.\n\n![{The table compares finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31 for the years 2020 and 2019 showing a decrease in net carrying amount and increase in accumulated amortization}](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets decreased from 2019 to 2020, while the amortization expenses increased during the same period."}

Specifically, the total recognized in compensation expense was $1,126 million in 2018, $1,878 million in 2019, and $2,119 million in 2020 [5]. This trend indicates a significant rise in compensation expenses over the three years.\n\nIn 2020, the compensation expenses were distributed across different business segments as follows:\n- **Institutional Securities:** $851 million\n- **Wealth Management:** $1,000 million\n- **Investment Management:** $268 million\n\nThese figures show that Wealth Management had the highest compensation expenses, followed by Institutional Securities and Investment Management. The distribution of these expenses can be visualized in the following table:\n\n![The table shows compensation expenses in millions of dollars for three categories—Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management—over three years (2020, 2019, and 2018).](image1)\n\nOverall, the total recognized compensation expenses increased from $1,126 million in 2018 to $2,119 million in 2020, with the largest portion allocated to the Wealth Management segment in 2020."}

The operating lease Right of Use (ROU) assets increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020. This increase is reflected in the total operating lease liabilities, which also rose from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020. The weighted average remaining lease term remained at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020. \n\n![{Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities increased from 2019 to 2020, with a decrease in the weighted average discount rate.}](image4)\n\n### Inventories\nThe inventory data in `image6` indicates that the total inventory increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. This increase is broken down into the following categories:\n- **Finished goods**: Increased from $833 million in 2019 to $1,232 million in 2020.\n- **Work in process**: Increased from $285 million in 2019 to $369 million in 2020.\n- **Raw materials**: Increased from $510 million in 2019 to $691 million in 2020.\n\n![{Total inventory increased from 2019 to 2020, with significant increases in finished goods, work in process, and raw materials.}](image6)\n\n### Financial Statement Impact\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories have several implications for the financial statements:\n\n1. **Operating Leases**:\n   - The increase in operating lease ROU assets and liabilities suggests that the company has taken on more lease obligations, which could be due to new leases or the reclassification of existing leases under new accounting standards (e.g., ASC 842).\n   - The total operating lease expense, as shown in `image3`, increased from $241 million in 2019 to $262 million in 2020. This includes both fixed and variable lease expenses, which are recognized in the income statement and affect the company's operating costs.\n\n2. **Inventories**:\n   - The significant increase in inventory levels, particularly in finished goods, indicates that the company may have been preparing for higher sales or addressing supply chain disruptions. This aligns with the information in [12], where it is noted that demand for the company's products and services increased, and acquisitions, primarily Cytiva, contributed to the growth in sales.\n   - The higher inventory levels also suggest that the company is managing its cash conversion cycle, as mentioned in [3]. The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $161 million in 2019, indicating a slight improvement in cash flow management.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced an increase in both lease assets and inventories from 2019 to 2020. These changes reflect the company's growing operational needs and strategic investments, such as the Cytiva acquisition, and have a direct impact on the financial statements, particularly in terms of operating expenses and cash flow management."}

The table in `![{The table provides financial data related to tax positions over the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, detailing the balance, additions, reductions, settlements, and interest.}](image1)` shows that the balance of uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million at the beginning of 2020 to $89 million by the end of 2020. This significant reduction is primarily due to a large reduction for tax positions of prior years, which amounted to $249 million [1]. Additionally, there were smaller reductions due to settlements with tax authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations, totaling $11 million.\n\nNext, we can look at the detailed breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities provided in `![{The table presents details about deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 for the years 2020 and 2019, including deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards, accrued expenses, stock compensation, inventories and related reserves, retirement costs, and other items.}](image4)`. The total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance decreased from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020. This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards, accrued expenses, and stock compensation. However, the valuation allowance also decreased slightly from $180 million in 2019 to $179 million in 2020, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $466 million in 2020, compared to $482 million in 2019.\n\nOn the liability side, the total deferred tax liabilities decreased significantly from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020. This reduction is attributed to decreases in property, plant, and equipment, international earnings, acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments, and other items.\n\nCombining these changes, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020. This increase is primarily driven by the larger decrease in deferred tax liabilities compared to the decrease in deferred tax assets.\n\nIn summary, the significant reduction in uncertain tax positions and the substantial decrease in deferred tax liabilities, combined with a smaller decrease in deferred tax assets, led to an increase in the net deferred tax asset from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020."}

The main components typically include separations, asset-related costs, and other restructuring charges.\n\nStarting with the figures from 2020 to 2022, the total restructuring costs were $782 million in 2020, $330 million in 2021, and $253 million in 2022 [8]. This indicates a significant decrease over the three years.

Employee separation costs relate to severance packages, often voluntary, based on salary levels and past service periods [5]. Asset-related costs include write-downs and accelerated depreciation, primarily associated with manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations [5].\n\nIn summary, the total restructuring costs decreased significantly from 2020 to 2022, driven by reductions in all major components—separations, asset-related costs, and other charges. The largest decreases were seen in Corporate and Health Care segments. \n\nTherefore, the total restructuring costs across different segments decreased from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to reduced separations and asset-related costs [5]."}

Comparing this to FY19, where they were granted 2,564,103 rights valued at $8,000,000, it shows that while the number and value of rights granted decreased, there was still a substantial allocation aimed at incentivizing long-term performance.\n\nThe implications on S Fallscheer's financial position are noteworthy. The increased shareholding enhances their alignment with shareholder interests, potentially increasing their wealth if the company performs well and the share price appreciates. Additionally, the vesting of performance rights over time ties their remuneration closely to the company’s future success, aligning their personal financial outcomes with corporate performance [image5].\n\nIn summary, S Fallscheer significantly increased their shareholding and received continued long-term incentives in FY20, reinforcing their vested interest in the company’s success. ![Summary of shareholdings and remuneration changes](image7)\n\nS Fallscheer's financial position improved through increased shareholding and ongoing long-term incentive awards in FY20."}

This is based on U.S. Treasury yields at the time of grant.\n- **Expected volatility**: Ranges from 22.2% to 29.5% [5]. This is derived from the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock.\n- **Expected dividend yield**: Ranges from 1.4% to 1.7% [5]. This is based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company.\n- **Forfeiture rate**: 5.0% [5]. This is estimated using historical data to predict the likelihood of option exercises and forfeitures.\n- **Expected life in years**: 5.1 years [5].

Increased spending on R&D and administrative functions may indicate a strategic focus on innovation and operational improvement.\n- **Cost Control**: Despite the increases, the company has managed to maintain a relatively stable cost structure, with service costs consistently around 87-89% of total cost of revenues. This stability suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the cost structure and operating expenses show a trend of increasing investment in content, marketing, and administration, indicating a strategic focus on growth and innovation while maintaining cost control."}

This increase was driven by:\n- An increase in deferred taxes of $4,060 million ($3,915 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to the intra-entity sale of IP in the first quarter.\n- An increase in prepaid pension assets of $745 million ($526 million adjusted for currency) driven by higher returns on plan assets and plan remeasurements.\n- A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,626 million ($1,811 million adjusted for currency) as a result of sales of receivables and product cycle dynamics.\n- A decrease in net intangible assets and goodwill of $44 million ($1,283 million adjusted for currency) resulting from intangibles amortization, partially offset by an increase from new acquisitions.\n\n### Long-Term Debt\nLong-term debt decreased from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, which is a slight increase of $253 million. However, total company debt decreased by $1,361 million ($2,859 million adjusted for currency) [12], primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million.\n\n### Cash Flows and Equity\nThe cash flows and equity data provide additional context:\n- Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, resulting in a year-to-year change of $18,763 million [2].\n- Total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million [6].\n\n### Summary of Financial Changes\n- **Noncurrent Assets**: The increase in noncurrent assets, particularly in deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets, suggests that IBM has made strategic investments and adjustments that are expected to provide future benefits. The decrease in long-term financing receivables and intangible assets indicates a focus on optimizing the balance sheet.\n- **Long-Term Debt**: The slight increase in long-term debt, combined with the overall decrease in total debt, suggests that IBM is managing its debt levels more efficiently, possibly through refinancing or restructuring.\n- **Cash Flows and Equity**: The significant shift in financing activities from a net source to a net use of cash, along with the decrease in total equity, indicates that IBM is using cash for various purposes, including dividend payments and strategic investments, while maintaining a balanced approach to debt management.\n\nThese changes collectively suggest that IBM is making strategic financial decisions to optimize its balance sheet, manage debt, and invest in future growth, which can be seen in the detailed breakdowns:\n\n- `![{This table presents a financial summary of transactions or adjustments over the course of a year, from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.}](image1)`\n- `![{The table displays financial data for the years 2020 and 2019, showing a decrease in total client financing assets and total assets.}](image2)`\n- `![{The table provides financial data related to Global Financing for the years 2020 and 2019, highlighting a consistent return on equity.}](image3)`\n- `![{The table presents financial data as of December 31 for the years 2020 and 2019, showing an increase in the total allowance for credit losses.}](image4)`\n- `![{The table is a summary of cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, showing a significant change in financing activities.}](image5)`\n- `![{The table provides a comparison of company debt figures for the years 2020 and 2019, showing a decrease in total company debt.}](image6)`\n- `![{This table seems to track some form of financial metric or account balance over 2020, including adjustments, write-offs, and other changes.}](image7)`\n- `![{The table provides financial data for the years 2020 and 2019 as of December 31, showing an increase in noncurrent assets and long-term debt.}](image8)`\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt, along with the shifts in cash flows and equity, indicate that IBM is strategically managing its financial position, focusing on optimizing its balance sheet, and investing in future growth."}

This decline was driven by lower retail spending and higher payments.\n- **Purchase Volumes**: Credit card purchase volumes declined by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion [10]. This drop was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, with overall spending improving in the second half of 2020, but travel and entertainment spending remaining lower compared to 2019.\n- **Debit Card Purchase Volumes**: Debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion [10], indicating a shift towards more immediate and essential spending.\n- **Risk-Adjusted Margin**: The risk-adjusted margin for the credit card portfolio increased by 88 basis points to 9.16% in 2020 [10]. This increase was driven by a lower mix of customer balances at promotional rates, the lower interest rate environment, and lower net credit losses.\n\n### Home Equity Metrics\n- **Outstanding Balances**: The home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [1].\n- **First-Lien Positions**: At December 31, 2020, 40% of the total home equity portfolio, or $13.8 billion, were in first-lien positions, down from 37% or $15.0 billion in 2019 [1].\n- **Second-Lien or More Junior-Lien Positions**: Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where the bank also held the first-lien loan totaled $5.9 billion [1].\n\n### Indicators of Consumer Behavior\n- **Shift in Spending Patterns**: The decrease in credit card purchase volumes and the increase in debit card purchase volumes suggest a shift towards more cautious and essential spending, likely due to economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n- **Paydowns and Lower Originations**: The reduction in outstanding balances in both credit card and home equity portfolios indicates that consumers were paying down debt and being more conservative with new borrowing, possibly as a response to financial uncertainties.\n- **Lower Interest Rates and Promotional Rates**: The increase in the risk-adjusted margin for credit cards suggests that fewer customers were taking advantage of promotional rates, which could be a sign of reduced consumer confidence and a preference for lower-risk financial behavior.\n\nThese changes indicate that consumers were more focused on reducing debt and managing their finances conservatively in 2020, likely in response to the economic challenges posed by the pandemic. \n\n![The table provides financial data comparing aspects of Consumer Banking for the years 2020 and 2019, with values expressed in millions of dollars.

The average realized prices for metallurgical coal and energy coal also saw a decline, with metallurgical coal dropping from $130.97 per tonne in 2020 to $106.64 per tonne in 2021, and thermal coal increasing slightly from $57.10 per tonne in 2020 to $58.42 per tonne in 2021 [6]. This decline in prices, combined with increased maintenance and stripping costs, led to higher unit costs and a decrease in underlying EBITDA. For example, Queensland Coal's cost per tonne increased from $67.59 in FY2020 to $81.81 in FY2021, and NSWEC's cost per tonne increased from $56.53 in FY2020 to $64.41 in FY2021 [8].\n\n![The table compares the financial and operational performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC over fiscal years 2020 and 2021, showing significant changes in revenue, underlying EBITDA, and cost per tonne.](image8)\n\nFor nickel, the underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs [9]. The average realized sales price for nickel in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020, driven by positive investor sentiment and strong end-use demand [6].

In 2020, capex was $1.64 billion, a decrease of $753 million or 31% compared to 2019. This reduction was largely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to fewer investments in existing restaurants [11]. The breakdown of these expenditures is illustrated in the bar graph, showing that while new restaurant expenditures remained relatively stable, spending on existing restaurants and other categories saw significant reductions:\n- **New Restaurants**: $488 million in 2018, $605 million in 2019, and $535 million in 2020.\n- **Existing Restaurants**: $2,111 million in 2018, $1,702 million in 2019, and $1,060 million in 2020.\n- **Other**: $143 million in 2018, $87 million in 2019, and $46 million in 2020.\n![Expenditures for new and existing restaurants, and other categories, with total expenditure decreasing from 2018 to 2020.](image8)\n\n### Shareholder Returns\nShareholder returns were also impacted during this period. The company continued to pay dividends, increasing the dividend amount every year. In 2020, the full-year dividend was $5.04 per share, with a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.29 per share in the fourth quarter, reflecting the company’s confidence in its cash flow [6]. Additionally, the company returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders, primarily through dividends paid [7].\n\nThe performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns relative to the S&P 500 Index and DJIA companies. Despite the challenges, McDonald's maintained its dividend payments and increased the dividend, indicating a commitment to shareholder value:\n- **Dividends Declared per Share**:\n  - 2020: $5.04\n  - 2019: $4.73\n  - 2018: $4.19\n- **Total Returned to Shareholders**:\n  - 2020: $4,627 million\n  - 2019: $8,562 million\n  - 2018: $8,503 million\n![Cumulative total shareholder returns for McDonald's, S&P 500 Index, and DJIA companies from 2015 to 2020.](image5)\n\nIn summary, McDonald's capital expenditures decreased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to reduced investments in existing restaurants, while the company continued to return substantial value to shareholders through consistent and increasing dividend payments."}

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\n\nRegarding the impact on net deferred tax assets, the increase in the valuation allowance from $214 to $313 reflects a more conservative estimate of the realizability of these tax credits. This adjustment reduces the net deferred tax assets, as the valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized [11].\n\nIn summary, the valuation allowance increased from $214 in 2021 to $313 in 2022, which reduced the net deferred tax assets. \n\n![{The table shows an increase in the valuation allowance from $214 in 2021 to $313 in 2022, with corresponding adjustments to the final balance.}](image1)"}

Cigarette sales decreased by 9.7%, from 49,951 to 45,100 [image8]. This decline in cigarette sales was partly offset by an increase in heated tobacco unit sales, which grew by 10.4% from 30,677 to 33,862 [image8]. The overall total sales volume in the region decreased by 2.1% [image8].\n\nIn Latin America & Canada, a similar pattern was observed. The shipment volume of cigarettes declined by 11.8%, from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020 [image7]. Conversely, the shipment volume of heated tobacco units increased by 50.8%, from 299 million units to 451 million units [image7]. The overall shipment volume in the region decreased by 11.6% [image7].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes:\n\n- **Out-switching to Heated Tobacco Units**: In both regions, there was a significant shift from traditional cigarettes to heated tobacco units. This trend is evident in the increased sales and shipment volumes of heated tobacco units, as consumers opted for these products over conventional cigarettes [3].\n\n- **Market Share and Total Market Decline**: In East Asia & Australia, the lower total market for cigarettes, particularly in Japan, was a key factor. Despite a higher market share driven by heated tobacco units, the overall cigarette market saw a decline [6].\n\n- **Excise Tax-Driven Price Increases and Pandemic Impact**: In Latin America & Canada, excise tax-driven price increases in January 2020 and pandemic-related measures significantly impacted adult smoker consumption patterns. For example, in Mexico, the combination of price increases and pandemic restrictions led to a 13.6% decrease in cigarette shipment volume [5].\n\n- **Economic and Consumer Behavior Changes**: The economic impact of the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior, such as reduced product availability and lower average daily consumption, also played a role. In Colombia, reduced product availability and pandemic-related mobility restrictions contributed to a 14.2% decrease in cigarette sales [5].\n\n- **Deconsolidation of RBH**: The deconsolidation of RBH (Rothmans, Benson & Hedges) had a notable impact on the financial performance in Canada, leading to a 18.6% decline in net revenues [1]. This also affected the overall shipment volume in the region.\n\nThese factors collectively influenced the shifts in cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volumes in both East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada between 2019 and 2020. \n\n![Cigarette sales in East Asia & Australia decreased by 9.7%, while heated tobacco unit sales increased by 10.4%](image8)\n![Cigarette shipment volume in Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.8%, while heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 50.8%](image7)\n\nIn summary, the changes in cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volumes in East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada between 2019 and 2020 were driven by out-switching to heated tobacco units, market share and total market declines, excise tax-driven price increases, and the economic and behavioral impacts of the pandemic."}

This issuance significantly increased the company's preferred stock balance. The table showing the consolidated financial data for the years 2018 to 2020 indicates that the preferred stock balance increased from $1,600 million in 2019 to $3,268 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of the MCPS Series B issuance. \n\n### Changes in Cash Flow from Financing Activities\n\nThe cash flows from financing activities also played a crucial role in the changes in total stockholders' equity. In 2020, Danaher had significant cash inflows from financing activities, including proceeds from the issuance of common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock. Specifically, the 2020 Common Stock Offering and the 2020 MCPS Offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.73 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively [4]. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and, pending such use, were invested in short-term bank deposits and/or interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.\n\nThe statement of cash flows shows that in 2020, the total financing cash provided by continuing operations was $1,006 million, which includes the net proceeds from the stock issuances. This positive cash flow from financing activities contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents, as well as other components of stockholders' equity, such as additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.\n\n### Impact on Total Stockholders' Equity\n\nThe combined effect of the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flow from financing activities is evident in the increase in total stockholders' equity. The table detailing the equity components from 2018 to 2020 shows that total stockholders' equity rose from $30,271 million in 2019 to $39,766 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to the following:\n\n- **Preferred Stock**: Increased from $1,600 million in 2019 to $3,268 million in 2020, primarily due to the issuance of MCPS Series B.\n- **Additional Paid-in Capital**: Increased from $7,565 million in 2019 to $9,698 million in 2020, reflecting the proceeds from the stock issuances.\n- **Retained Earnings**: Increased from $24,166 million in 2019 to $27,159 million in 2020, driven by net earnings and the positive cash flow from financing activities.\n\n![The table details the equity components, showing an increase in total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020, with significant contributions from preferred stock and additional paid-in capital.](image6)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flow from financing activities significantly increased Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020."}

Several factors contributed to this change.\n\nFirst, the company saw an increase in proceeds from investments and other activities. The increase in proceeds from investments and other in 2021 was primarily due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments [3]. This is reflected in the financial data, where the proceeds from investments and other rose from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021. \n\nSecond, there was a significant decrease in income tax payments. The decrease in income tax payments in 2021 was primarily due to the tax deductions resulting from the senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in the current year period and more than offset the higher taxable income from operations in 2021 [4]. This reduction in tax payments also contributed positively to the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nAdditionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities played a role. The decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics. These decreases were partially offset by increases related to the operations of the theme parks [9].\n\nFinally, the overall improvement in the company's operating performance, as seen in the operating margin, also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities. The operating margin improved from 42.1% in 2020 to 43.7% in 2021, indicating better cost management and operational efficiency [7].\n\nIn summary, the net cash provided by operating activities increased from $24,737 million in 2020 to $29,146 million in 2021, driven by increased proceeds from investments, reduced income tax payments, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, as well as improved operating margins. \n\n![{Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $24,737 million in 2020 to $29,146 million in 2021.}](image8)"}

The net income attributable to Chevron Corporation increased from a loss of $(5,543) million in 2020 to a profit of $15,625 million in 2021 [4]. This substantial increase was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [11].\n\nThe comprehensive income also saw a significant positive change, moving from a loss of $(3,798) million in 2020 to a gain of $17,106 million in 2021. This is reflected in the table, which shows the comprehensive income for 2021 at $17,412 million, compared to a loss in 2020 [8].\n\n### Financial Activities Contributing to These Changes\n\n#### Operating Activities\nThe operating activities section of the cash flow statement indicates that net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly from $10,577 million in 2020 to $29,187 million in 2021. This improvement was largely due to higher net income, as well as adjustments such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization [image1].\n\n#### Investing Activities\nInvesting activities showed a decrease in net cash used, from $(6,965) million in 2020 to $(5,865) million in 2021. This reduction in cash outflow can be attributed to lower capital expenditures and proceeds from asset sales [image1].\n\n#### Financing Activities\nFinancing activities saw a significant change, with net cash used for financing activities increasing from $(3,736) million in 2020 to $(23,113) million in 2021. This was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt and dividends paid [image1].\n\n### Additional Factors\n- **Upstream Earnings**: U.S. upstream earnings improved from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 to a profit of $7.3 billion in 2021, driven by higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments, and higher sales volumes [1].\n- **Downstream Earnings**: U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020, primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales and higher earnings from CPChem [8].\n- **International Upstream Earnings**: International upstream earnings also improved, from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to a profit of $8.5 billion in 2021, driven by higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [10].\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income improved significantly from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher upstream and downstream earnings, the absence of impairments, and favorable operating and investing activities."}

According to the provided table, there are notable differences in how many male and female employees are entitled to and avail parental leave [5]. \n\nFor instance, while 21,746 female employees are entitled to parental leave, a significantly larger number of male employees—98,347—are also entitled. However, when it comes to availing this leave, only 1,025 females and 2,023 males actually take it. This suggests that although both genders have access to parental leave, the uptake is relatively low overall, but proportionally higher among those who are entitled.\n\n![The table presents data on parental leave entitlements for female and male employees](image5)\n\nFurther analysis reveals that a high percentage of both men and women return to work after taking parental leave: 967 females (94%) and 1,941 males (96%). Yet, the long-term retention figures paint a different picture. Only 66 females (6%) and 75 males (4%) remain employed 12 months after returning from leave. This indicates potential challenges in retaining employees post-leave, which could be reflective of underlying issues within the workplace environment or support systems.\n\nIn terms of gender diversity policies, the bank has implemented several initiatives aimed at creating an inclusive work environment. For example, efforts are being made to increase the representation of women in the workforce to 25% by FY25 through talent acquisition and retention strategies [5]. Additionally, programs like Careers 2.0 provide opportunities for skilled women professionals to transition back to work after personal breaks [5].\n\n![Graphic showing gender diversity across different job categories and age groups](image6)\n\nThese initiatives reflect the bank's commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion. The push for intentional inclusion is further highlighted through campaigns such as 'Uncovering Unconscious Biases' and the #Intentional Inclusion video series, which aim to sensitize managers and leaders about the unique challenges faced by women and other underrepresented groups [4].\n\nOverall, while there are structural supports in place for parental leave, the disparity in entitlement versus usage rates, coupled with retention challenges post-leave, underscores areas where policy adjustments may enhance gender diversity outcomes. \n\nIn conclusion, the differences in parental leave entitlement and usage between male and female employees at HDFC Bank highlight ongoing challenges in achieving equitable workplace practices despite robust gender diversity policies."}

This increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables, including sales of financing receivables of $3,076 million [1]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 also contributed to this increase [1].\n\n### Investing Activities\n- **2020**: $(3,028) million\n- **2019**: $(26,936) million\n\nThe net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million. This significant decrease was mainly due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million, as the Red Hat acquisition occurred in the prior year [9]. This was partially offset by a decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, primarily driven by the wind-down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations, and an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million [9].\n\n### Financing Activities\n- **2020**: $(9,721) million\n- **2019**: $9,042 million\n\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by various factors, including the repayment of debt and changes in the company's capital structure [2].\n\n### Impact on Overall Cash Flow\n- **Net Change in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash**:\n  - **2020**: $5,361 million\n  - **2019**: $(3,290) million\n\nThe overall net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5,361 million in 2020, compared to a net decrease of $3,290 million in 2019. This positive change in 2020 was largely due to the significant improvement in cash flows from operating activities and the reduced outflows from investing activities, despite the negative impact from financing activities.\n\n![The table is a summary of cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019.

The table in [11] provides a summary of these expenses and benefits:\n\n- **Stock-based compensation expense:**\n  - 2022: $5,759\n  - 2021: $4,931\n  - 2020: $4,204\n\n- **Recognized income tax benefit:**\n  - 2022: $2,081\n  - 2021: $1,749\n  - 2020: $1,163\n\n- **Net stock-based compensation expense:**\n  - 2022: $7,840\n  - 2021: $6,680\n  - 2020: $5,367\n\nFrom this, we can see that both the stock-based compensation expense and the recognized income tax benefit have increased over the three years.

Inditex has been very active in store optimization activities, including openings, refurbishments, and enlargements [1]. For example, in 2021, Inditex opened stores in 40 markets and absorbed 578 stores as part of its optimization plan. This indicates a strategic focus on expanding and improving the store network, particularly in regions where they see growth potential.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the pandemic, which had a significant effect on store operations in 2020, likely influenced these changes. With up to 90% of stores closed in the first quarter of 2020, the subsequent reopening and recovery efforts may have driven the increase in the number of stores, especially in regions that were less affected or recovered more quickly [11].\n\nMoreover, the streamlining plan, which included absorbing between 1,000 and 1,200 stores during 2020 and 2021, focused on closing stores at the end of their useful life, particularly those in younger formats, with sales being recuperated in local shops and online [12]. This could explain the slight decrease in franchises in some regions, as the company might have consolidated and optimized its store network.\n\nIn summary, the geographical distribution of stores changed from 2021 to 2022, with an overall increase in the number of company-managed stores and a mixed trend in franchises, driven by store optimization, recovery from the pandemic, and strategic expansion."}

This increase of $3,039 million (or $829 million adjusted for currency) was driven by several factors [11]. The rise in noncurrent assets suggests that the company is investing in long-term growth, which could include capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other strategic investments.\n\n### Long-Term Debt\nLong-term debt remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020. This minimal change indicates that the company is managing its long-term debt levels carefully, possibly to maintain a balanced capital structure and financial flexibility. \n![Total company debt decreased from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020, with Global Financing segment debt decreasing from $24,727 million to $21,167 million.](image7)\n\n### Noncurrent Liabilities (Excluding Debt)\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020. This increase of $1,621 million (or $251 million adjusted for currency) is primarily driven by various factors [1]. The rise in noncurrent liabilities could be due to deferred tax liabilities, pension obligations, or other long-term commitments.\n\n### Implications on Financial Strategy\nThe increase in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, along with the stability in long-term debt, suggests that IBM is focusing on long-term growth and investment while maintaining a prudent approach to debt management. The slight increase in long-term debt and the more significant increase in noncurrent liabilities indicate that the company is leveraging its strong liquidity position and cash flows to support its strategic initiatives, such as the refocused Global Financing strategy and the integration of Red Hat [10].\n\nOverall, these changes reflect a balanced approach to financial management, where the company is investing in growth while keeping debt levels under control. This strategy supports IBM's aim to operate at a single A credit rating and to deleverage over time [5].\n\nIn summary, the increase in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, coupled with the stability in long-term debt, indicates a strategic focus on long-term growth and financial prudence."}

One key factor was the decline in the interest income driven by lower revolving Card Member loan balances, as noted in [10]. This decline in interest income was partially offset by lower cost of funds, but it still had a significant impact on the overall yield.\n\nAdditionally, the higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances led to a decrease in the interest yield, as mentioned in [5]. The higher paydown rates were driven by the continued liquidity and financial strength of the customer base, which resulted in lower outstanding loan balances and, consequently, lower interest income.\n\nAnother factor was the change in the rate of interest paid on borrowings compared to the rate of interest earned on loans. As stated in [7], if the rate of interest paid on borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest earned on loans, the net interest yield could decrease. This was evident in the hypothetical scenario where a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on annual net interest income.\n\nThe table in `![{Net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, with fluctuations in interest income and expenses.}](image2)` provides a detailed breakdown of the net interest income, adjusted for non-attributable items, and the average Card Member loans. The data shows that the adjusted net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021, while the average Card Member loans also declined, leading to a lower net interest yield.\n\nIn summary, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, primarily due to lower interest income from reduced revolving loan balances and higher paydown rates, as well as the impact of interest rate changes on borrowing costs."}

Specifically, for the year ended December 31, 2020, ENBREL's total sales decreased by 4% compared to 2019, amounting to $4,996 million [5]. This is corroborated by the financial data table where ENBREL’s U.S. sales dropped from $5,050 million in 2019 to $4,855 million in 2020, marking a 4% decrease. Similarly, ENBREL sales in Canada also fell by 20% during the same period, from $176 million in 2019 to $141 million in 2020 ![Summary of ENBREL sales](image1). The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2020 was primarily driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, although there were favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory which partially offset these declines [4].\n\nIn contrast, Prolia exhibited more stable growth in sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Prolia's total sales increased by 3%, reaching $2,763 million [2]. The breakdown shows that U.S. sales rose by 3% from $1,772 million in 2019 to $1,830 million in 2020, while ROW (Rest of World) sales increased by 4% from $900 million in 2019 to $933 million in 2020 ![Summary of Prolia sales](image2). The increase in global Prolia sales for 2020 was attributed to higher unit demand and net selling price. However, disruptions in patient visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand during 2020 by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients [11].\n\nOverall, ENBREL sales have been declining due to lower unit demand and net selling price, compounded by market share losses and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Prolia has managed to maintain growth through higher unit demand and improved net selling prices despite challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, ENBREL sales decreased due to lower demand and pricing pressures, while Prolia sales increased driven by higher demand and better pricing."}

The provision was driven by actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for sectors affected by the pandemic. Charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment [2].\n\n2. **CECL Adoption**: The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020, resulted in an initial increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million, with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax. However, the overall effect of CECL adoption on the ACL was a decrease of $58 million, as shown in the table [5].\n\n3. **Gross Charge-offs and Recoveries**: There were gross charge-offs of $103 million, partially offset by recoveries of $8 million, resulting in a net (charge-offs) of $95 million [2].\n\n4. **Economic and Business Conditions**: The base scenario used in the ACL models assumed a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures. Given the nature of the lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input was U.S. GDP, which influenced the ACL calculations [2].\n\nIn summary, the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) increased from $533 million in 2019 to $1,130 million in 2020, primarily due to the provision for credit losses, the impact of the CECL adoption, and the economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."}

In 2019, Bank of America reported detailed data on its GHG emissions, including Scopes 1, 2, and 3, which cover direct and indirect emissions from various sources [1]. The bank has achieved a 40% reduction in energy use and a 50% reduction in location-based GHG emissions, and it has sourced renewable energy to power its facilities. Additionally, the bank has purchased and retired carbon offsets for unavoidable emissions, contributing to its carbon-neutral status [4].\n\n![Bank of America's 2019 GHG emissions, with reductions since 2010, and their commitment to TCFD and Paris-aligned targets.](image1)\n\n### Air Pollution\nBank of America also monitors and reports on its air emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter. In 2019, the bank's global sites emitted SOx (1 metric ton), NOx (20 metric tons), CO (32 metric tons), VOCs (2 metric tons), and particulate matter (3 metric tons).

These differences can be observed through the data provided in the image quotes.\n\n### Financial Expenditures\nThe financial expenditures for the projects reveal significant disparities between **COVID Relief** and **Rural Development** initiatives:\n\n- For **COVID Relief**, the table in `![image1]` indicates that one of the projects, specifically a PAN India initiative, had an expenditure of ₹24.73 crore [image1]. This is among the highest amounts spent on any project listed, reflecting the scale and urgency of addressing the pandemic's impact across multiple regions.\n  \n- In contrast, **Rural Development Projects** detailed in `![image3]` show much smaller expenditures. The amounts range from ₹0.14 crore to ₹2.09 crore per project, with most falling on the lower end of this spectrum [image3]. This suggests that rural development initiatives are typically more localized and may not require the same level of funding as large-scale relief efforts.\n\n### Implementation Methods\nThe implementation methods also highlight notable distinctions between the two types of projects:\n\n- **COVID Relief** projects, as seen in `![image1]`, are implemented both directly and through various agencies such as *Setu Charitable Trust*, *National Health and Education Society*, and *Give India*. The diversity in implementing partners reflects the need for specialized expertise and widespread outreach during a crisis [image1].\n\n- On the other hand, **Rural Development Projects** described in `![image3]` are exclusively implemented **indirectly** through specific agencies like *Sanjeevani Institute for Empowerment & Development* and *BAIF Development Research Foundation*. None of these projects are marked as being implemented directly by the organization itself, indicating a reliance on external entities with established local networks [image3].\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, **COVID Relief** projects tend to have higher financial expenditures and utilize a mix of direct and agency-based implementation methods to achieve broad coverage. Conversely, **Rural Development** projects involve smaller budgets and rely solely on indirect implementation through specialized agencies. \n\nTherefore, the key differences lie in the **scale of funding** and the **methods of execution**, tailored to the nature and scope of each type of project.  \n`![COVID Relief projects involve larger expenditures and diverse implementation methods](image1)`  \n`![Rural Development projects have smaller budgets and rely on indirect implementation via agencies](image3)`  \n\nThe financial and operational strategies differ significantly between COVID Relief and Rural Development projects."}

However, the higher penetration of gasoline sales generally lowers the gross margin percentage [11][12].\n\nFurthermore, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176, primarily attributable to Other International Operations [5].\n\nOverall, the gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, higher LIFO charges, and the negative impact of higher gasoline sales penetration, partially offset by positive impacts from ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and other operational efficiencies. \n\n![{The table shows financial data for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, including revenue, cost of goods sold, profit, and profit margin.}](image8)\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, higher LIFO charges, and the negative impact of higher gasoline sales penetration."}

According to the provided text quotes, financial exposure includes loans and lending commitments [7]. The change in these exposures can be influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, borrower requests for loan modifications, and growth in specific types of loans [3].\n\nFrom the image quotes, particularly `![The table shows changes in loan categories over time](image1)` and `![The table provides a breakdown of financial exposure across various sectors](image6)`, we see detailed figures:\n\n- In `![The table shows changes in loan categories over time](image1)`, there is an increase in the percentages of Corporate Loans, Secured Lending Facilities, Commercial Real Estate, and Other categories from 2019 to 2020. This suggests that these areas have grown in significance within the Institutional Securities loans portfolio.\n  \n- From `![The table provides a breakdown of financial exposure across various sectors](image6)`, we observe that the total exposure increased from $168,518 million in 2019 to $176,632 million in 2020. The sectors showing notable increases include Financials ($44,358 million in 2020 vs. $40,992 million in 2019), Industrials ($15,861 million in 2020 vs. $13,136 million in 2019), Information Technology ($11,358 million in 2020 vs. $9,201 million in 2019), Consumer Discretionary ($11,177 million in 2020 vs. $9,589 million in 2019), and Energy ($10,064 million in 2020 vs. $9,461 million in 2019).\n\nAdditionally, `![The table presents financial data on loans and lending commitments](image3)` highlights that the total exposure for Institutional Securities loans and lending commitments increased significantly, with Total Exposure rising from $21,755 million in 2019 to $19,898 million in 2020. This indicates substantial growth in lending activities within the IS segment.\n\nFurthermore, the rise in the aggregate allowance for credit losses (ACL) depicted in `![The table shows adjustments in ACL over time](image2)` and `![The table displays changes in ACL values](image4)` reflects the heightened risk and uncertainty due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The ACL for loans increased from $297 million in 2019 to $739 million in 2020, and for lending commitments from $236 million to $391 million. These increases are primarily attributed to the continued economic impact of the pandemic [2].\n\nLastly, `![The table presents percentage data related to Accrual and Nonaccrual](image7)` shows that the accrual rates remained high (above 99%) for both IS and Wealth Management (WM) segments, indicating that most loans were performing well despite the challenging environment [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the total financial exposure of Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities business segment increased from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by growth in sectors like Financials, Industrials, Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Energy. The main contributing sectors to this change were Financials and Industrials, reflecting expanded lending activities and the economic recovery supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures [2]."}

For instance, the sale of Alcon Inc. shares with a fair value of USD 9 million and the gain on disposal of USD 1 million, along with the sale of other equity securities with a fair value of USD 254 million and a gain on disposal of USD 211 million, added to the overall financial performance [6].\n\n- **Core Financial Metrics**: Core operating income from continuing operations and core net income both showed positive growth. Core operating income increased from USD 15,416 million in 2020 to USD 16,588 million in 2021, an 8% increase in USD. Similarly, core net income rose from USD 13,158 million in 2020 to USD 14,094 million in 2021, a 7% increase in USD [image1].\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the significant 202% increase in total basic earnings per share (USD) from 2020 to 2021. \n\n![Total basic earnings per share (USD) increased from 3.55 to 10.71, a 202% increase](image7)"}

The breakdown is as follows:\n- **Intangible assets**: Increased from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020.\n- **Property, plant, and equipment**: Slightly decreased from DKK 50,551 million in 2019 to DKK 50,269 million in 2020.\n- **Investments in associated companies**: Increased from DKK 474 million in 2019 to DKK 582 million in 2020.\n- **Deferred income tax assets**: Increased from DKK 4,121 million in 2019 to DKK 5,865 million in 2020.\n- **Other receivables and prepayments**: Decreased from DKK 841 million in 2019 to DKK 674 million in 2020.\n- **Other financial assets**: Decreased from DKK 1,334 million in 2019 to DKK 1,066 million in 2020.\n\nThe total non-current assets increased from DKK 63,156 million in 2019 to DKK 79,113 million in 2020. This significant increase was primarily due to the rise in intangible assets, which is further explained by the acquisition of Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. and Emisphere Technologies Inc. [5].\n\n![The table is a financial statement showing the various components of assets for a company, expressed in millions of DKK (Danish Krone) for the years 2020 and 2019.

The breakdown is as follows:\n- **Share capital**: Decreased slightly from DKK 480 million in 2019 to DKK 470 million in 2020.\n- **Treasury shares**: Decreased from DKK (10) million in 2019 to DKK (8) million in 2020.\n- **Retained earnings**: Increased from DKK 57,817 million in 2019 to DKK 63,774 million in 2020.\n- **Other reserves**: Decreased from DKK (694) million in 2019 to DKK (911) million in 2020.\n\nThe total equity increased from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by higher retained earnings, which reflects the company's profitability and the reinvestment of profits back into the business [7].\n\n![The table is a balance sheet summarizing equity and liabilities for a company in DKK million. It compares figures from the years 2020 and 2019. Here's the breakdown:](image7)\n\n### Impact on Financial Position\nThe increase in non-current assets, particularly intangible assets, indicates that the company made significant investments in long-term growth opportunities, such as the acquisitions mentioned. This suggests a strategic focus on expanding its portfolio and enhancing its competitive position. \n\nThe increase in total equity, primarily through retained earnings, indicates that the company is generating and retaining more profit, which strengthens its financial position. Higher equity levels generally provide a buffer against financial risks and support future investment and expansion plans.\n\nIn summary, the increase in non-current assets and total equity from 2019 to 2020 strengthened the company's financial position by enhancing its asset base and increasing its equity, reflecting both strategic investments and improved profitability."}

The significant amount of committed credit facilities provides the company with substantial liquidity, ensuring that it can meet its short-term and medium-term financial obligations. The absence of any commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2020, despite having an aggregate issuance capacity of $8.0 billion, indicates that the company has not needed to tap into this additional source of liquidity [6].\n\nThe majority of the long-term debt being fixed-rate helps to mitigate interest rate risk, providing stability in the company's interest expense.

The overall 36.0% increase in total net sales from 2020 to 2021 is a positive sign of the company's financial performance.\n\nIn contrast, the non-current assets show more modest changes. While there was a slight increase in Spain and the Americas, the rest of Europe and Asia saw small decreases. The total non-current assets remained relatively stable, with only a 0.1% increase. This suggests that while the company is generating more revenue, it is not significantly expanding its long-term asset base, possibly indicating a focus on operational efficiency and leveraging existing assets.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe net sales and non-current assets of Inditex Group showed significant growth in net sales across all regions, particularly in the Americas, while non-current assets remained relatively stable. This indicates a strong financial performance and recovery in 2021, with a focus on revenue generation rather than substantial increases in long-term investments."}

The retained earnings for 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n- **2021**: $11,495 million\n- **2020**: $11,881 million\n\nThe decrease in retained earnings from 2020 to 2021 by $386 million can be attributed to several factors, including cash dividends and other adjustments. The table in image3 shows a detailed breakdown of the changes in equity, including the impact of cash dividends, which reduced retained earnings. \n\n### Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) includes items that are not recognized in the net income but still affect the equity. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) for 2021 and 2020 are:\n- **Net unrealized debt securities gains (losses)**: \n  - 2021: $(42) million\n  - 2020: $32 million\n- **Foreign currency translation adjustments**:\n  - 2021: $(163) million\n  - 2020: $(40) million\n- **Net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits**:\n  - 2021: $155 million\n  - 2020: $(150) million\n\nThe total other comprehensive loss for 2021 was $(50) million, compared to $(158) million in 2020. This improvement is primarily due to the positive net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits, which offset the negative impacts from foreign currency translation and debt securities losses.\n\n### Total Shareholders' Equity\nThe total shareholders' equity also decreased from 2020 to 2021:\n- **2021**: $22,177 million\n- **2020**: $22,984 million\n\nThis decrease is reflected in the table in image3, showing a reduction in total shareholders' equity by $807 million. The primary drivers of this decrease include the decline in retained earnings and the overall other comprehensive loss, as well as other equity adjustments such as the repurchase of common shares and changes in additional paid-in capital.\n\n### Financial Position\nThe changes in shareholders' equity, particularly the decrease in retained earnings and the improvement in other comprehensive income, indicate a mixed impact on the company's financial position. While the company experienced a reduction in retained earnings, likely due to dividend payments and other adjustments, the improvement in other comprehensive income suggests some stabilization in certain financial metrics, such as pension and postretirement benefits.\n\nIn summary, the changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021, with a focus on retained earnings and other comprehensive income, show a decrease in total equity, primarily driven by lower retained earnings and partially offset by an improvement in other comprehensive income. This indicates a more balanced but slightly weakened financial position. \n\n![{The table provides financial details related to Shareholders’ Equity, including Preferred Shares, Common Shares, Additional Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and Total Shareholders’ Equity for 2021 and 2020.}](image3)\n\n![{The table presents a summary of financial data over several years, showing Net Income, Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, and Comprehensive Income for 2021, 2020, and 2019.}](image6)"}

The consolidated cash flow statement provides a detailed breakdown of the cash inflows and outflows related to the company's operations. According to the table, the net cash from operating activities can be seen in the \"Net cash from operating activities\" section. \n\n![The table is a consolidated cash flow statement comparing financial data from 2020 and 2019. The values are in thousands of dollars. It includes the following sections: Cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, financing activities, and net increase in cash and cash equivalents.](image1)\n\nFrom the text, we know that the Group’s net cash flow from operating activities, adjusted to remove the impact of AASB 16, was $48.0 million [3]. This indicates a positive cash flow from operations, which generally contributes to the company's overall financial health and can be used to support various business activities, including investments and dividends.\n\nNext, let's consider the changes in retained earnings. Retained earnings are the portion of net income that is not distributed as dividends but is instead kept by the company for reinvestment or other purposes. The consolidated statement of changes in equity provides a detailed view of the movements in retained earnings over the period.\n\n![The table shows the equity attributable to the equity holders of a company over the period from July 2, 2018, to June 28, 2020. It breaks down the equity into various components, including share capital, common control reserve, retained earnings, share-based payments reserve, cash flow hedge reserve, and foreign currency translation reserve.](image4)\n\nThe retained earnings section of the equity statement starts at $43,352 and undergoes adjustments due to profit, changes in accounting policy, and dividends. Specifically, the company reported a profit after tax of $11,221,000 in 2020, which would have been added to the retained earnings. However, the company also paid dividends, which would have reduced the retained earnings. For example, an interim fully franked dividend of 15.0 cents per fully paid share was deferred and later paid with a reduced franking percentage [12].\n\nCombining these factors, the positive cash flow from operating activities contributed to the company's ability to generate profits, which in turn increased the retained earnings. However, the payment of dividends, even if deferred, reduced the retained earnings.

This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in pension and other retiree benefits, which dropped from $1,476 million to $740 million. There was also a significant increase in capitalized research & development, which rose from $358 million to $646 million. The valuation allowances also decreased, indicating a more favorable outlook for the utilization of these assets.\n- **Deferred Tax Liabilities**: The total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. This increase is mainly driven by a rise in other retiree benefits, which increased from $645 million to $1,031 million, and an increase in unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions, which rose from $111 million to $439 million.\n\n### Impact on Financial Position\nThe changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities can impact the company's financial position in several ways. A decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in deferred tax liabilities generally indicate a higher future tax liability, which could affect the company's cash flow and overall financial health. However, the specific impact would depend on the context of the company's overall financial performance and strategic plans.\n\nIn summary, the total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022, while the total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million to $9,288 million over the same period. This indicates a higher future tax liability, which could have implications for the company's financial position."}

According to the text:\n\n- In December 2003, 28% of Republicans said it was too early to tell about Bush [1].\n- At the start of Barack Obama’s third year in office (January 2011), nearly half of the public (47%) said it was too early to tell whether he would be successful [2].\n- In January 2011, 45% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats said it was too early to tell about Obama [7].\n- In the new Pew Research Center survey conducted in January 2019, 23% said it was too early to tell whether Trump will be successful or unsuccessful [5].\n\nNone of these years match the 58% figure. However, the closest year with a high percentage of \"too early to tell\" is January 2011, with 47% for Obama. Since the 58% figure does not directly match any provided data, we can infer that the question might be referring to a similar context, which is likely January 2011.\n\nNext, let's find out how many people believed that Trump's economic policies had not much effect on the economic situation in January 2011. The relevant information is:\n\n- In January 2011, 49% of the public said Obama's economic policies had not much effect [8].\n\nHowever, since the question asks about Trump's economic policies, we need to look at the corresponding data for Trump. The closest available data is from October 2017 and January 2019:\n\n- In October 2017, 49% of the public said Trump's economic policies had not much effect [6].\n- In January 2019, 29% of the public said Trump's economic policies had not much effect [8].\n\nSince the 58% \"too early to tell\" figure does not match any specific year, and the closest year with a high \"too early to tell\" percentage is January 2011, we can use the data from January 2019 as the most recent and relevant point for Trump's economic policies.\n\nThus, in January 2019, 29% of people believed that Trump's economic policies had not much effect on the economic situation. \n\n![In January 2019, 29% of people believed that Trump's economic policies had not much effect on the economic situation.](image6)"}

According to the data, only 30% of voters gave Trump an A or B for his campaign conduct [3], which is historically low and marks the lowest grades for any victorious candidate in 28 years. In contrast, 43% of voters gave Clinton an A or B, making her the first losing candidate to receive higher grades than the winner [9][11].\n\nAdditionally, the grades for Trump were particularly poor among supporters of the losing candidate. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Clinton voters gave Trump a failing grade, which is the highest percentage among election winners dating back to 1988 [12]. This stark difference in grading can be visualized in the bar chart showing the distribution of grades for winning presidential candidates from 1988 to 2016, where Trump's grades are notably lower compared to previous winners `![Trump receives historically low grades overall (30% A or B), in part because his own supporters are not all that positive about his campaign conduct.](image3)`.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton's grades were more positive, with 43% of voters giving her an A or B, which is comparable to the grades given to Mitt Romney in 2012 [11]. This trend is also reflected in the bar chart for losing candidates, where Clinton's grades are similar to those of previous losing candidates `![The image is a bar chart representing the grades of losing U.S. presidential candidates from 1988 to 2016.

The graph indicates that around 2005, an \"Exit boom starting in 2005 started to drive up demand\" [image2].

This improvement in exit activity further contributed to the increasing demand for capital.\n\nThe scarcity of VC money not only led to low entry valuations but also drove up capital efficiency, making European startups more capital-efficient than their U.S. counterparts [10].

In 1870, the county's population was just 130, but it surged to 8,267 by 1880 and reached its peak of 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This rapid growth can be attributed to several historical factors, including the influence of the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, both passed in 1862. These acts transformed Nebraska from a \"thinly populated corridor of westward expansion into a booming agricultural state\" [5].\n\n![The table shows population data for various census years, indicating a peak in 1890 and subsequent decline](image2)\n\nFollowing the peak in 1890, the population began to decline, with the 1900 census recording 13,330 residents. The population continued to fluctuate over the next few decades, with a notable drop to 9,982 in 1940. The mid-20th century saw further declines, with the 1950 census showing 8,778 residents, and the 1960 census at 8,714. The population then stabilized somewhat, with slight increases and decreases, reaching 9,403 in 2000 [1].\n\nThe initial surge in population was driven by the influx of settlers, many of whom were immigrants from various European countries. These settlers established communities and rural school districts, contributing to the county's growth [1][2]. For example, the Danish community in Kronborg, the Swedish in Hordville, and the German and Russian Mennonites in other parts of the county, all played a role in this demographic shift [2][7].\n\n![The image shows a map highlighting Hamilton County in Nebraska and its communities, providing a geographical context](image3)\n\nThe consolidation of farms also had a significant impact on the population trends. As farming methods became more mechanized, the number of individual farms decreased, while the size of each farm increased. This trend, which began in the early 20th century, continued into the 21st century, with the average farm size in Hamilton County increasing from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002 [6].\n\n![The table displays the number of farms in the U.S. at ten-year intervals, showing a decline in the number of farms over time](image8)\n\nAdditionally, the establishment of railroads and the changing economic landscape influenced the population distribution. Towns that did not have rail connections often declined, as seen with the town of Hamilton, which was eventually absorbed by Aurora [10].\n\nIn summary, the population of Hamilton County, Nebraska, peaked in 1890 and then gradually declined, influenced by the Homestead Act, the arrival of immigrant settlers, and the consolidation of farms."}

According to this infographic, 76% of respondents overall listen to the radio via a radio set, and 40% use a mobile phone. In rural areas, 77% use a radio and 39% use a mobile phone for listening, while in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone and 49% use a radio. This indicates a higher reliance on traditional radio sets in rural areas and a greater preference for mobile phones in urban areas. `![{Rural areas show a higher reliance on traditional radio sets, while urban areas prefer mobile phones for radio listening.}](image4)`\n\nAdditionally, the data from image5 shows the types of programs people listen to on the radio.

The provided text and image quotes offer insights into these areas.\n\nFrom the text, we see that the share of women varies widely across different STEM occupations. Specifically, [4] mentions:\n- \"the share of women varies widely across the 74 standard occupations classified as STEM in this study – from under one-in-ten for sales engineers (7%) and mechanical engineers (8%) to 96% of speech language pathologists and 95% of dental hygienists. Women are a majority of those working in health-related occupations but just 14%, on average, of those.\"\n\nThis indicates that there is a significant gender gap in certain engineering fields, particularly in sales and mechanical engineering, where women are severely underrepresented. \n\nAdditionally, [7] provides information about the experiences of women in computer jobs, which includes positions such as software development or data science. It states:\n- \"Women in computer jobs are more likely than women in STEM, overall, to say they have experienced discrimination (74% vs. 50%) and these women are particularly likely to report pay inequities (46% vs. 29% of all women in STEM) and 40% say have been treated as if they were not competent at work because of their gender (29% of all women in STEM jobs say this).\"\n\nThis suggests that while women in computer jobs experience higher levels of discrimination and pay inequities, it does not directly indicate that they are the highest paid. However, it does highlight the significant gender gap and pay disparity in this field.\n\nTo further support this, let's consider the image evidence. `![The chart shows that 74% of women in computer jobs have experienced gender-related discrimination, compared to 16% of men, and 30% of women have experienced sexual harassment, compared to 7% of men.](image5)` This image highlights the stark differences in experiences between men and women in computer jobs, reinforcing the notion that computer jobs have a significant gender gap and pay disparity.\n\nGiven the information, the type of STEM major with the largest gender gap and consistent employment in the field, and where women experience the highest pay disparities, is likely to be in **computer jobs**.

Specifically, when \\( K = d \\), SWEM is faster than CNN or LSTM by a factor of \\( n \\cdot d \\) or \\( d \\), respectively [1].

For higher-resource languages, the gains from pre-training are consistent, with an increase of approximately 3 BLEU points for all three language pairs [2]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains can be much more substantial. For example, the G L (Galician) to EN (English) translation saw a gain of up to 11 BLEU points, indicating that pre-trained embeddings are particularly useful for bootstrapping models that are on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [2].\n\nWhen examining the effect of pre-training in a more controlled environment by down-sampling the training data for higher-resource languages, the results show that pre-training helps more when the size of the training data is small. This is evident in the line graphs, where the BLEU scores for pre-trained models are consistently higher, especially at smaller training set sizes `![The top graph shows the BLEU scores as a function of training set size, and the bottom graph shows the gain in BLEU score achieved by using pre-trained models over standard models.](image7)`.\n\nIn multilingual translation systems, the similarity of the source and target languages also affects the efficacy of using pre-trained embeddings. For instance, the G L /P T pair, which has the highest similarity, showed the largest gains, while the B E /R U pair, which has the lowest similarity, showed a small decrease in BLEU scores [10]. \n\nFurthermore, aligning the embedding spaces between the source and target languages can help improve BLEU scores.

Let's break down these error types and their comparisons:\n\n1. **Reasoning Error**:\n   - This type of error occurs when the model makes a mistake in the intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. It is one of the most significant sources of errors, comprising more than 90% of the total errors [12].\n   - The bar chart in Figure 7 (right) shows that Reasoning Error has a value of 0.52, which is the highest among the error types, further emphasizing its dominance [image7].\n\n2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Error**:\n   - RAG errors occur when the retrieval system fails to fetch relevant information, even though the step-back question is on target. This is another major source of errors, with a value of 0.45 in the bar chart [image7].\n   - According to the error analysis, RAG errors are also significant, contributing to 45% of the errors [1].\n\n3. **Context Loss**:\n   - Context Loss happens when the model's response deviates from addressing the original question. This type of error has a value of 0.07 in the bar chart, indicating it is less frequent compared to Reasoning and RAG errors [image7].\n\n4. **Principle Error**:\n   - Principle Error occurs when the first principles generated by the model are wrong or incomplete. This type of error is relatively rare, comprising only a small fraction of the total errors, with a value of 0.09 in the bar chart [image7].\n\n5. **Factual Error**:\n   - Factual errors happen when the model recites incorrect factual knowledge. This type of error is the least frequent, with a value of 0.04 in the bar chart [image7].\n\n6. **Math Error**:\n   - Math errors occur when there is an error in the intermediate math calculations involved in deriving the final answer. This type of error has a value of 0.25 in the bar chart, making it a significant but not dominant error type [image7].\n\nIn summary, the main error types identified in Step-Back Prompting on TimeQA are Reasoning Error and RAG Error, with Reasoning Error being the most dominant. Context Loss, Principle Error, Factual Error, and Math Error are also present but occur less frequently. \n\n![{The pie charts show the distribution of prediction outcomes and the bar chart highlights the five classes of errors, with Reasoning Error being the most frequent.}](image6)"}

The strategies include using human feedback, a reward model, and automated feedback. For example, Direct Optimization with Human Feedback is one such method where candidate outputs are generated by LLMs, humans provide feedback, and the LLMs are then optimized based on this feedback [7]. Another method is self-training, where the model is trained with its own high-quality output filtered out by the critic model [4].\n\n**Generation-Time Correction:**\nGeneration-time correction utilizes automated feedback to guide the LLM to correct errors during the generation process. Two main strategies are Generate-then-Rank and Feedback-Guided Decoding. In Generate-then-Rank, multiple outputs are generated and evaluated by a critic model to select the best output. In Feedback-Guided Decoding, the generation process is more interactive, with continuous feedback loops from the critic model to refine the outputs [12]. \n\n![Generate-then-Rank and Feedback-Guided Decoding](image1)\n\n**Post-Hoc Correction:**\nPost-hoc correction refines the model output after it has been generated, without updating the model parameters. This typically involves an iterative process of generating output, receiving feedback, and refining the output. Post-hoc correction allows for more diverse natural language feedback, ranging from specific diagnostic reports to broader writing suggestions. The key post-hoc correction strategies include Self-Correction, Correction with External Feedback, and Multi-Agent Debate [1][2].\n\n![Post-hoc correction strategies](image5)\n\nFrom the provided information, the post-hoc correction strategy is described in detail with various methods and applications.

This is a straightforward sequence-to-sequence model where the attention mechanism helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during the generation process [11].\n\nIn contrast, the multitask model (Figure 1b) has two decoders, each with its own attention mechanism. Both decoders share the same encoder, but they have separate attentions and decoders. This means that each decoder can attend to different parts of the encoded input, allowing the model to handle two related tasks, such as transcription and translation, more effectively [12].\n\nTo visualize this, consider the following:\n\n- **Single-task Model (Figure 1a)**: The decoder generates the output by attending to the encoder's hidden states, focusing on the most relevant parts of the input sequence.\n  - `x_1 ... x_N` (input sequence) → `h_1 ... h_N` (encoder states) → `c_1 ... c_M` (context vectors) → `s_1 ... s_M` (decoder states) → `P(y_1 ... y_M)` (output prediction).\n\n- **Multitask Model (Figure 1b)**: Each decoder has its own attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on different aspects of the shared encoder states.

These embeddings are crucial for representing the visual content in a form that can be efficiently stored and retrieved.\n   - **Feature Index**: The extracted embeddings are stored and indexed here, which allows for quick and accurate retrieval. The indexing process is optimized using techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to handle large volumes of data efficiently [7].\n   - **Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$)**: This is an external storage for the multimodal embeddings. It serves as a repository of information that can be accessed during the inference stage to retrieve relevant category labels and image embeddings [9].\n   - **Retrieving Process**: Utilizes k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) for both image-image and image-text retrieval. This process helps in finding the most similar results from the memory based on the input query [image1].\n\n2. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - **Inference Stage**: During this stage, an input image is encoded into embeddings. These embeddings are then used to query the memory for the most similar results [image1].\n   - **Top-K Categories**: The system retrieves the top-k most similar categories from the memory. These categories are the candidates that will be further refined and ranked [image1].\n   - **Ranking**: MLLMs are employed to rank these retrieved candidate results. The MLLMs combine internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction [2].\n   - **Final Prediction**: The final output is the predicted label, such as \"Monarch butterfly,\" which is the result of the ranking process [image1].\n\nThe RAR pipeline leverages the strengths of both retrieval and ranking to enhance the performance of MLLMs in various recognition tasks. The multimodal retriever ensures that the system can access a large and diverse set of pre-stored embeddings, while the ranking process refines these results to provide precise and accurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, the main components of the RAR pipeline are the **multimodal retriever** (including the Image Encoder, Feature Index, Memory, and Retrieving Process) and the **retrieving & ranking** (involving the Inference Stage, Top-K Categories, Ranking, and Final Prediction).

We can infer that the template would follow a similar structure to other event templates.\n\nFrom the provided image quotes, we can see an example of event templates in `image5` and `image6`.\n\n`image5` provides examples of event templates, such as:\n- **Movement.Transport**: The word \"{evt}\" triggers a TRANSPORT event, such as moving an object or person from one place to another.\n- **Conflict.Attack**: Triggers an ATTACK event involving violence or harm.\n\n`image6` lists different event triggers and their descriptions, including:\n- **Justice.Fine**: A financial punishment involving a geopolitical entity, person, or organization.\n- **Life.Divorce**: Two people officially divorced under the law.\n\nGiven this, the template for 'Contact.Meet' would likely follow a similar format. For example, it might be structured as:\n\n- **Contact.Meet**: The word \"{evt}\" triggers a MEET event, indicating a meeting or encounter between entities.\n\nThus, the prompt template for 'Contact.Meet' in the filter-then-rerank method would be:\n\n- **Template for Contact.Meet**: \"The word {evt} triggers a MEET event, indicating a meeting or encounter between entities.\"\n\nThis template ensures that the LLMs can recognize and classify the 'Contact.Meet' event when it appears in the text. \n\n![{The word {evt} triggers a MEET event, indicating a meeting or encounter between entities.}](image5)\n\nThe prompt template used for the label 'Contact.Meet' in the filter-then-rerank method is: \"The word {evt} triggers a MEET event, indicating a meeting or encounter between entities.\""}

The tree is then traversed starting from the root. At each level, the top nodes are selected based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This method allows for a controlled and layered approach, where the algorithm starts with a broad outlook and progressively narrows down to finer details as it descends through the tree. By adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer, this method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved [8][9]. \n![The image illustrates the tree traversal retrieval, where the tree is traversed layer-by-layer, selecting the top nodes based on cosine similarity to the query vector.](image3)\n\nOn the other hand, **Collapsed Tree Retrieval (B)** also starts with encoding the query. However, instead of traversing the tree layer-by-layer, it collapses the multi-layered tree into a single layer. This means all nodes are considered simultaneously, and the most relevant nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity until a threshold number of tokens is reached. This approach provides greater flexibility, as it can search through all nodes at once, retrieving information that is at the correct level of granularity for the given question [10][11].\n![The image illustrates the collapsed tree retrieval, where the tree is flattened into a single layer, and nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity.](image3)\n\nBoth methods ultimately combine the retrieved context with the query to generate an answer using a language model (LLM). The key difference lies in how they handle the tree structure: Tree Traversal Retrieval follows a structured, layer-by-layer approach, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval flattens the tree and considers all nodes simultaneously.\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval traverses the tree layer-by-layer, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval flattens the tree and retrieves nodes collectively."}

In the style space plots (left column), the data points are color-coded as 'neg' (negative, in blue) and 'pos' (positive, in red). For the DAE model, the points are separated into distinct clusters for each class, indicating a clear separation between negative and positive styles. In contrast, the VAE model also shows clustering but with less distinct separation, suggesting that while it still captures the style, the separation is not as sharp as in the DAE model.\n\nIn the content space plots (right column), both DAE and VAE models have overlapping clusters of 'neg' and 'pos' points, indicating that the content space is more uniformly distributed and does not separate the styles. This suggests that the content space is effectively disentangled from the style, as it does not carry style information.\n\nAdditionally, the latent space learned by the VAE is smoother and more continuous compared to the one learned by the DAE. This smoothness in the VAE's latent space can be attributed to the probabilistic nature of the VAE, which imposes a prior distribution on the latent variables, leading to a more continuous and structured representation.\n\nIn summary, the DAE model shows more distinct clustering in the style space, while the VAE model has a smoother and more continuous latent space, but with less distinct separation in the style space.

However, when fine-tuning for specific tasks, this masking is removed. As stated in the text, \"When the model predicts token \\( i \\), the input to the attention module are forward states \\( F_{1}^{L} \\ldots F_{i-1}^{L} \\) and backward states \\( B_{i+1}^{L} \\ldots B_{n}^{L} \\)\" [5].

This suggests that as the number of entities increases, the model's ability to leverage broader context through relation propagation becomes increasingly important.\n\n![Relation F1 score as a function of the number of entities in a sentence, showing that DyGIE generally outperforms DyGIE-RelProp across all categories.](image7)\n\nFrom the image, we can see that for sentences with 2 entities, both systems perform similarly with high F1 scores. As the number of entities in the sentence increases, the performance of both systems decreases. However, \"DyGIE\" (represented by a blue line with circle markers) generally outperforms \"DyGIE-RelProp\" (represented by a red line with square markers) across all categories. This implies that the addition of relation propagation in \"DyGIE\" helps maintain better performance even as the number of entities increases.\n\nNext, let's consider the implications of utilizing relation propagation. Relation propagation involves defining a beam \\( B_{R} \\) consisting of \\( b_{r} \\) entity spans that are most likely to be involved in a relation [6]. Unlike coreference, the weights of relation edges capture different relation types. For the \\( t \\)-th iteration, a tensor \\( \\mathbf{V}_{R}^{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b_{R} \\times b_{R} \\times L_{R}} \\) captures scores of each of the \\( L_{R} \\) relation types. This allows the model to aggregate neighboring span representations on the relation graph, which is crucial for handling complex sentences with multiple entities.\n\nThe use of a non-linear function \\( f \\), such as the ReLU function, helps to remove the effect of unlikely relations by setting all negative relation scores to 0 [4]. This ensures that only the most relevant relations are considered, reducing noise in the new representation. The matrix \\( \\mathbf{A}_{R} \\) helps transform the embedding \\( \\mathbf{g}_{j}^{t} \\) according to each relation type, allowing the model to better capture the specific context of each relation.\n\nIn summary, relation extraction performance tends to decrease as the number of entities in a sentence increases, but the utilization of relation propagation in D Y GIE helps mitigate this decline. Relation propagation allows the model to effectively leverage broader context, leading to improved performance in sentences with more entities."}

The table in [5] indicates that COMET achieves a 51% relative improvement over the top-performing model of Sap et al. (2019). Specifically, the BLEU-2 results in Table 1 show that COMET exceeds the performance of all baselines, achieving a 51% relative improvement over the top-performing model. Additionally, the human evaluation reported a statistically significant relative Avg performance increase of 18% over the top baseline. This suggests that COMET is highly effective in generating high-quality and accurate tuples.\n\nNext, the novelty of the generated tuples is also an important factor. According to [1], COMET produces more novel tuple objects than the baselines. Specifically, 59.25% of the tuples generated by COMET are not present in the training set, indicating that the model can generate new edges between nodes and even create new nodes, with 3.75% of the object nodes being novel.\n\nThe quality of the generated knowledge is further supported by the classifier score, as mentioned in [4]. The classifier score of 95.25% indicates that the KB completion model of Li et al. (2016) scores the generated tuples as correct in most cases. A human evaluation also scored 91.7% of the greedily decoded tuples as correct, confirming the high quality of the generated knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, the graph in `![{The graph shows that as the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples generally decreases, and the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%, but slightly decreases as the edit distance increases.}](image7)` illustrates that the classifier's accuracy for the generated tuples remains high, even as the edit distance from the training data increases.

Each cell contains a number, which likely represents a performance metric like BLEU score, indicating the quality of the translation output for that language pair and model. [image3]\n\nBased on the details in the table, the best model for the French-to-English (fr→en) translation is the `multitask s → x, t` model, with a BLEU score of **38.2**.\n\nTherefore, the model that performed best for the French-to-English language pair according to Table 4 is the `multitask s → x, t` model, with a BLEU score of 38.2."}

According to the provided quotes, word-order is crucial for accurately predicting sentiment orientations. For instance, the phrase \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negative sentiment, which can only be distinguished by their word order [7].\n\nTo further illustrate this, consider the following evidence:\n- **Sentiment Analysis Tasks**: Both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, suggesting that word-order information is required for analyzing sentiment orientations. This is consistent with the findings in [7], where it is hypothesized that the positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of LSTM on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set shows a noticeable drop, indicating that word-order does matter for sentiment analysis [11]. The shuffled training set removes the word-order features, and the resulting drop in accuracy highlights the importance of word-order in LSTM models.\n\n![The table presents two reviews or comments categorized as \"Negative\" and \"Positive.\" The negative comment emphasizes that the food is \"just okay, not great,\" while the positive comment expresses excitement about finding specialties.](image3)\n\nMoreover, the results on the Yelp polarity dataset show that when the training set is shuffled, the LSTM model's performance drops significantly, further supporting the idea that word-order is critical for sentiment analysis [12]. This suggests that the main difference between LSTM and SWEM is the ability of LSTM to capture word-order features, which is essential for sentiment analysis tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, word-order information significantly affects the accuracy of LSTM models in sentiment analysis, as it allows the model to distinguish between phrases with different sentiments based on the sequence of words."}

This is evident from both the text and image evidence provided.\n\nIn the text, it is mentioned that the proposed adversarial learning process, DSGAN, can recognize true positive samples from a noisy distant supervision dataset [12]. The generator in DSGAN is designed to generate true positive samples, which are then used to challenge the discriminator. As the training progresses, the generator becomes more robust, leading to a decline in the discriminator's performance [10]. This indicates that the generator is effectively generating high-quality true positive samples, thereby improving the overall quality of the dataset.\n\nEmpirically, the performance improvements are significant. For instance, when the cleaned dataset generated by DSGAN is used to train recent state-of-the-art models, there is a notable improvement in their performance [4]. Specifically, the comparison with other methods shows that DSGAN provides a robust true-positive generator, outperforming both random selection and pre-trained generators [9].\n\nThe images further support these findings. In `![PR curves for CNN-based models](image4)`, the PR curves for different CNN-based models show that adding DSGAN (e.g., \"CNN+ONE+DSGAN\" and \"CNN+ATT+DSGAN\") results in higher precision at various recall levels. Similarly, `![Aggregate PR curves for PCNN-based models](image6)` illustrates that the configurations with DSGAN (e.g., \"PCNN+ONE+DSGAN\" and \"PCNN+ATT+DSGAN\") maintain higher precision compared to those without DSGAN.\n\nAdditionally, `![Performance comparison table](image8)` provides a quantitative comparison of model performance with and without DSGAN. The table shows that the AUC values for all models increase when DSGAN is added. For example, the AUC for \"CNN+ONE\" increases from 0.177 to 0.189, and for \"PCNN+ATT\" from 0.253 to 0.264. The p-values are all less than 0.05, indicating that these improvements are statistically significant.\n\nIn summary, the addition of DSGAN significantly enhances the performance of different models in relation extraction by providing a more accurate and robust dataset."}

However, with repetition control, the same setting (z=10) only produces 79.67% questions [6].\n\n![Question-asking rates with and without repetition control](image2)\n\nThe primary issue is the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This prevents the model from producing common question-asking bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [6]. To address this, an additional setting, `z=10 (boost)`, was introduced. This setting does not use the `extrep bigram` feature during beam search but applies it to rerank candidates afterward, allowing the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams. This adjustment results in a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with slightly increased external bigram repetition [6].\n\nIn summary, the introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level (z=10) from 97.72% to 79.67%, but this can be mitigated with a modified approach."}

This module is also implemented using InstructGPT, prompted with a suite of ten demonstrations [4].\n\n5. **Reasoner**:\n   - The reasoner module outputs the final veracity label based on all collected contexts. While not explicitly stated, it is likely that this module also leverages an LLM to synthesize the information and provide the final decision.\n\nIn summary, the QACHECK system implements four out of the five key modules with Large Language Models: the Claim Verifier, Question Generator, QA Module, and Validator. The Reasoner, while not explicitly detailed, is also likely to use an LLM. Thus, the system heavily relies on LLMs for its core functionalities. \n\nThe number of modules implemented with Large Language Models backbone is 4."}

It includes 30 subjects across six broad disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. The distribution of these questions is detailed in a chart, which shows the percentage of questions for each discipline and subject [12]. For example, Science makes up 23% of the questions, with subfields like Biology, Chemistry, Geography, Math, and Physics. Similarly, Tech & Engineering accounts for 26%, covering areas such as Agriculture, Architecture Engineering, Computer Science, and more. This broad coverage ensures that the benchmark evaluates models across a diverse set of domains, making it a robust tool for assessing general multimodal understanding.\n\n![The image is a chart displaying the distribution of 11.5K multimodal questions across six broad disciplines, 30 subjects, and 183 subfields.](image1)\n\nIn terms of **depth**, the MMMU benchmark requires models to demonstrate expert-level reasoning and deep domain-specific knowledge. Unlike other benchmarks that focus on basic perception abilities or common sense, MMMU includes problems that require nuanced understanding and complex reasoning. For instance, it tests the application of advanced concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" and \"Equilibrium Theory,\" which are typically found in college-level exams and textbooks. This is further illustrated by the variety of image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, and medical images, which test the perceptual capabilities of the models. Additionally, the benchmark features interleaved text-image inputs, where models must jointly understand the images and text, often requiring deep subject knowledge and complex reasoning [6].\n\n![The image is a dual representation comparing the MMMU benchmark with other benchmarks.

The last row, labeled \"Δτ,\" shows the difference between the COMET-RANK score without using reference translations and the score using reference translations. This value indicates the improvement in the metric when references are included.\n\nFor example, for the language pair \"en-cs\" (English to Czech), the scores are 0.660 (ref. only) and 0.711, with a Δτ of 0.051. Similarly, for \"en-de\" (English to German), the scores are 0.764 (ref. only) and 0.799, with a Δτ of 0.035. These improvements are consistent across all language pairs, as indicated by the positive Δτ values.\n\nThe most significant improvement is observed in the reverse language pairs (source to English). For instance, for \"cs-en\" (Czech to English), the scores are 0.249 (ref. only) and 0.356, with a Δτ of 0.107. For \"de-en\" (German to English), the scores are 0.390 (ref. only) and 0.542, with a Δτ of 0.155. The largest improvement is seen in \"tr-en\" (Turkish to English), where the scores are 0.128 (ref. only) and 0.260, with a Δτ of 0.132.\n\nThus, the inclusion of reference translations significantly enhances the performance of the COMET-RANK metric, with the most significant improvement observed in the \"tr-en\" (Turkish to English) language pair."}

This is essential for the subsequent components of the dialogue system to understand and respond appropriately to the user's request.\n\nAs described, the user input, such as \"Movie for the day after tomorrow, please,\" is fed into the bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder.

This dual-directional processing enhances the model's ability to understand the nuances and context of the user's utterance. \n\nThe output of the Bi-LSTM is then generated by concatenating the last forward and backward LSTM states. Specifically, if \\( \\mathbf{U}_{k} = (w_{1}, w_{2}, ..., w_{T_{k}}) \\) represents the user utterance at turn \\( k \\) with \\( T_{k} \\) words, these words are first mapped to an embedding space and then serve as the step inputs to the bidirectional LSTM.

According to [7], the Transformer big model (T2T_big; 213M parameters) was trained for 3.5 days (84 hours) on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. The power consumption and other relevant metrics for this model can be found in the provided tables.\n\nFrom `image4`, we can see the power consumption and cloud compute costs for different models, including T2T_big. The table provides the following information for T2T_big:\n- **Hardware**: 8 P100 GPUs\n- **Power (W)**: 1200 W\n- **Cloud Compute Cost**: $1200–$4000\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total energy consumption. The formula for total power \\( p_t \\) required during training, as given in [11], is:\n\\[ p_t = (p_c + p_r + p_g \\times g) \\times \\text{PUE} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( p_c \\) is the average power draw from all CPU sockets,\n- \\( p_r \\) is the average power draw from all DRAM sockets,\n- \\( p_g \\) is the average power draw of a GPU during training,\n- \\( g \\) is the number of GPUs used to train,\n- PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) is 1.58, the 2018 global average for data centers.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the power consumption is primarily from the GPUs, and the CPU and DRAM contributions are negligible. Therefore, the total power consumption \\( p_t \\) can be approximated as:\n\\[ p_t = p_g \\times g \\times \\text{PUE} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( p_g = 1200 \\) W (from `image4`)\n- \\( g = 8 \\)\n- PUE = 1.58\n\nThe total power consumption is:\n\\[ p_t = 1200 \\times 8 \\times 1.58 = 15,168 \\text{ W} \\]\n\nTo find the total energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh), we use the training time:\n\\[ \\text{Energy (kWh)} = \\frac{\\text{Total Power (W)} \\times \\text{Time (hours)}}{1000} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Energy (kWh)} = \\frac{15,168 \\times 84}{1000} = 1274.112 \\text{ kWh} \\]\n\nNow, we need to convert this energy consumption into CO2 emissions. The carbon intensity of electricity varies by location. From `image2`, we can see the energy mix for different regions. For a general estimate, we can use the average carbon intensity of the United States, which is 0.475 kg CO2/kWh (based on the U.S. energy mix).\n\nThus, the CO2 emissions are:\n\\[ \\text{CO2 emissions (kg)} = \\text{Energy (kWh)} \\times \\text{Carbon Intensity (kg CO2/kWh)} \\]\n\\[ \\text{CO2 emissions (kg)} = 1274.112 \\times 0.475 = 606.904 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the CO2 equivalent emission for training a Transformer (big) NLP model on a GPU is approximately 606.904 kg. \n\n![The table provides data on the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions associated with different types of consumption.](image5)"}

Specifically, the model uses two BERT models: one fixed and one fine-tuned.\n\n1. **Fixed BERT Model**:\n   - This model acts as a feature extractor for the candidate-value list of each categorical slot. It processes the candidate values and outputs value representations. For example, for the \"price range\" slot, the candidate values might be \"cheap,\" \"expensive,\" and \"moderate.\" The fixed BERT model generates embeddings for these values, which are then used for matching.\n   - The output of this model is a set of value representations, denoted as `y_cls`, `y1`, ..., `yc` [12].\n\n2. **Fine-Tuned BERT Model**:\n   - This model processes the concatenation of domain-slot pairs and the recent dialog context. For instance, it might handle a domain-slot pair like \"hotel, price range\" along with the recent conversation about hotel availability.\n   - The fine-tuned BERT model outputs start and end vector distributions for each domain-slot pair and dialog context, denoted as `r_cls`, `r1`, ..., `rK` [8].\n\n3. **Cosine Similarity**:\n   - The cosine similarity is used to match the value representations from the fixed BERT model with the contextualized representations from the fine-tuned BERT model. This step ensures that the most plausible values are selected based on the context.\n   - For non-categorical slots, a two-way linear mapping is used to find text spans in the dialog context. For categorical slots, the most plausible values are selected from the picklists based on the contextual representation [6].\n\nThis approach allows the DS-DST model to effectively handle both categorical and non-categorical slots by leveraging the strengths of BERT in encoding and matching contextual information. The strong interactions between the dialog context and domain-slot pairs are crucial for accurate state tracking.\n\n![The image shows the architecture of the DS-DST model, where a fixed BERT model processes candidate values and a fine-tuned BERT model processes the dialog context, with cosine similarity used for matching.](image8)"}

These mechanisms include base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair [4].\n\n- **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This is one of the most frequent DNA repair pathways, used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases of one DNA strand. The process involves the recognition and removal of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, followed by the action of endonuclease and lyase to remove the damaged base(s). A specific polymerase then adds new normal base(s), and DNA ligase regains the phosphodiester bonds, thus restoring the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand [5].\n\n- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: NER is highly conserved among species and is capable of excising a broad range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. This mechanism is more complex in higher eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes [6].\n\n- **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly repairs UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts. It does not involve incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA; instead, the mutated bases are reverted to their original states. For example, photolyase enzymes can repair pyrimidine dimers through light-dependent photo-reactivation, while alkyltransferases can reverse alkylation adducts [11].\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: Mismatch repair recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors during DNA replication. This process involves the recognition of the mutated strand, removal of the mismatched sequence by an endonuclease, addition of new pairs by DNA polymerase, and final ligation by DNA ligases [12].\n\n- **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism primarily targets double-strand breaks, which are the most devastating mutation-induced lesions. Recombination repair includes homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair. HR uses undamaged homologous DNA as a template for accurate repair, while non-homologous end-joining directly ligates two double-strand break ends, which can lead to loss of genetic information [7].\n\n- **Transcription-Coupled Repair (TCR)**: TCR is a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that specifically targets and repairs lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring the rapid restoration of gene expression.\n\nThese repair mechanisms collectively ensure the stability and integrity of the genome by addressing various types of DNA damage, as illustrated in Figure 11. \n\n![{The image illustrates various DNA repair mechanisms in response to different types of damaging agents, including Base Excision Repair (BER), Mismatch Repair (MMR), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), and Recombinational repair.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, Figure 11 demonstrates the following DNA repair mechanisms: Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Direct Reversal Repair, Mismatch Repair (MMR), Transcription-Coupled Repair (TCR), and Recombination Repair."}

For example, if the problem is about the popularity of a Netflix show and Karen's behavior, the LLM would translate the textual conditions into a symbolic representation, such as defining predicates and premises [3].\n\n![The image shows a logic problem involving two Netflix shows, \"Stranger Things\" and \"Black Mirror,\" and a person named Karen. The problem is posed in a textual format at the top, detailing conditions regarding Karen's behavior related to these shows based on their popularity and her actions of binge-watching or downloading them. Below the problem, the image provides a symbolic representation of the predicates and premises related to the problem.](image3)\n\nIn the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation. The symbolic solver, which could be a logic programming engine, a first-order logic prover, or a constraint optimization tool, processes the symbolic representation to derive a solution. For instance, if the problem is a deductive reasoning problem, the solver might use logical programming (LP) to determine the truth value of a given statement [2].\n\n![The image is a diagram outlining the structure of the LOGIC-LM model, which is composed of three main modules: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter. The Problem Formulator generates a symbolic representation of the input problem using language processing models (LLMs) through a technique called in-context learning. The Symbolic Reasoner performs logical inference on the formulated problem using various methods such as Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, and Constraint Optimization. The Result Interpreter interprets the symbolic answer derived by the Symbolic Reasoner to provide a comprehensible answer to the original problem posed.](image5)\n\nFinally, in the **Result Interpretation** stage, the result interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into natural language. This module ensures that the final output is understandable and directly answers the original problem. For example, if the symbolic solver determines that \"Black Mirror is not popular,\" the result interpreter will convey this conclusion in a clear and concise manner [12].\n\nBy leveraging the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic solvers, the LOGIC-LM model effectively handles complex logical reasoning problems, ensuring accurate and faithful reasoning.\n\nThe LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first translating the natural language problem into a symbolic representation, then using a symbolic solver to perform logical inference, and finally interpreting the symbolic result back into natural language."}

The table shows that the EN-TAG system consistently outperforms the EN system in all these test sets. For example, in the \"FR (M)\" test set, the EN system scores 37.58, while the EN-TAG system scores 38.71. Similarly, in the \"FR (F)\" test set, the EN system scores 37.75, and the EN-TAG system scores 38.97.

This shows a clear lineage and influence from father to daughter.\n- **Artistic Techniques**: Orazio provided Artemisia with the opportunity to study with him, allowing her to learn and develop her skills. His expertise in naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes, and the use of chiaroscuro technique was passed down to Artemisia, who incorporated these elements into her own work.\n\n![The knowledge graph illustrates the influence of Orazio Gentileschi on Artemisia Gentileschi's life and career, showing their relationship as father and daughter, their shared occupation, and the artistic styles they were associated with.](image7)\n\nOrazio's influence on Artemisia's career is also reflected in her notable works, such as \"Judith Slaying Holofernes,\" which showcases the dramatic realism and chiaroscuro technique that she learned from her father. This painting, created when she was around twenty years old, is a prime example of how Orazio's teachings and influence shaped her artistic development.\n\nIn summary, Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia's career is clearly depicted in the knowledge graph through their shared occupation, the artistic techniques he taught her, and the impact on her notable works."}

Specifically, it involves two main stages: cropping and resizing of the image regions based on bounding box coordinates.\n\n1. **Cropping**: The image is first divided into regions based on the bounding boxes that highlight different objects. For example, in the diagram, an image with multiple bounding boxes is shown, each highlighting different objects such as flowers and a vase. This step ensures that each object is isolated and can be processed individually.\n\n2. **Resizing**: After cropping, each region is resized to a fixed proportion. This standardization is important because it normalizes the input size for the image encoder, making the embeddings more consistent and easier to compare.\n\nThese pre-processing steps are essential for the following reasons:\n\n- **Isolation of Objects**: By cropping, the system isolates individual objects, which helps in focusing the model's attention on specific parts of the image. This is particularly useful in object detection datasets where multiple objects of varying sizes are present.\n- **Normalization**: Resizing the cropped regions to a fixed proportion ensures that the input to the image encoder is standardized. This normalization is critical for generating consistent and comparable embeddings, which are then used in the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search.\n\nThe pre-processed images are then encoded into embeddings, which are stored in memory and used for retrieval. During the retrieval process, these embeddings are compared to the existing indexed embeddings to find the most similar ones. This process is illustrated in the diagram, where the embeddings are used to associate each bounding box with possible labels, such as \"flower arrangement,\" \"saltshaker,\" and \"vase.\"\n\nBy isolating and normalizing the objects, the pre-processing steps significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the zero-shot recognition system, ensuring that the model can accurately identify and classify objects even when they are part of a complex scene.\n\n![Pre-processing techniques like cropping and resizing assist in zero-shot recognition for object detection tasks using multimodal retrieval methods.](image8)"}

The BERT classifier is visualized in Figure 3, where the claim and reason are joined to form the first text segment, which is paired with each warrant and independently processed. The final layer CLS vector is passed to a linear layer to obtain the logits \\( z_{j}^{(i)} \\). The whole architecture is fine-tuned, and the learning rate is \\( 2e^{-5} \\) with a maximum of 20 training epochs [2]. This architecture allows the model to independently calculate logits for each argument-warrant pair before combining them for a final prediction.\n![The image depicts the general architecture of a model used in the experiments described in the accompanying caption.](image2)\n\nNext, we examine the detailed performance metrics for BERT in different configurations. Table 4 provides the test performance metrics (Mean, Median, and Max) for various BERT configurations:\n- **BERT**:\n  - Mean: 0.671 ± 0.09\n  - Median: 0.712\n  - Max: 0.770\n\n- **BERT (W)**:\n  - Mean: 0.656 ± 0.05\n  - Median: 0.675\n  - Max: 0.712\n\n- **BERT (R, W)**:\n  - Mean: 0.600 ± 0.10\n  - Median: 0.574\n  - Max: 0.750\n\n- **BERT (C, W)**:\n  - Mean: 0.532 ± 0.09\n  - Median: 0.503\n  - Max: 0.732\n\nThese results show that the BERT model achieves its highest mean and median scores when using the full configuration (claim, reason, and warrants). The performance drops slightly when only considering warrants (W), and further decreases when including reasons (R, W) or claims (C, W) [4].\n\nAdditionally, Table 3 provides more evidence on how BERT's peak performance can be entirely accounted for by exploiting spurious cues. By just considering warrants (W), BERT can achieve 71% accuracy. Adding cues over reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) accounts for the remaining six points, leading to a peak of 77% [5].\n![The table presents test performance metrics (Mean, Median, and Max) for different models and configurations.](image4)\n\nIn summary, the BERT model's test performance is highest when using the full configuration (claim, reason, and warrants), with a mean score of 0.671 and a maximum score of 0.770.

Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison [4]. This method is more flexible and often yields better performance, as it can retrieve information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question [6].\n\nOn the other hand, the tree traversal method traverses the tree layer-by-layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level [9]. By adjusting the depth \\( d \\) and the number of nodes \\( k \\) selected at each layer, this method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved [10]. However, the ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details remains constant, which may not be ideal for all questions [6].\n\nThe performance of these methods is visually represented in a graph where the x-axis represents the context length, and the y-axis shows the F1 score. The graph shows that the collapsed tree method (green line) peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, slightly decreasing as the context length increases to 2500. In contrast, the tree traversal method (blue line) shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length but overall performs lower than the collapsed tree method. `![{Collapsed tree method peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, while tree traversal method shows a steady increase but performs lower.}](image8)`\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree method generally achieves higher F1 scores, particularly at a context length of 2000 tokens, compared to the tree traversal method."}

This large and diverse dataset is sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, ensuring a broad and deep coverage of various disciplines. `![{The table shows the distribution of 11,550 questions across 6 disciplines, 30 subjects, and 183 subfields, with 30 different image types.}](image2)`\n\nSecond, regarding **image types**, the MMMU dataset includes a wide variety of 30 different image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, and medical images. This diversity is illustrated in the horizontal bar chart, where diagrams and tables are the most frequent types, followed by plots and charts. `![{The image is a horizontal bar chart showing the distribution of image types in the MMMU dataset, with Diagrams and Tables being the most common.}](image1)`\n\nFinally, in terms of **reasoning depth**, the MMMU benchmark requires models to perform expert-level reasoning, often involving complex subject-specific knowledge. For example, tasks may require applying concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" to derive solutions. This is in contrast to previous benchmarks that typically focus on daily knowledge and common sense, and only require simple physical or temporal reasoning. `![{The image highlights four key challenges of the MMMU dataset, including the need for expert-level visual perception and reasoning.}](image4)`\n\nAdditionally, the comparison with other benchmarks, such as VQA, GQA, and VisWiz, shows that MMMU excels in both breadth (covering a wide range of knowledge) and depth (requiring advanced reasoning). `![{The graph shows MMMU excelling in depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) compared to other benchmarks.}](image6)`\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark stands out due to its larger dataset size, more diverse image types, and the requirement for deeper, more complex reasoning."}

Specifically, it shows the impact of excluding crowd-sourced data, head word supervision, and entity linking (EL) data on the model's performance.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the Ultra-Fine category is particularly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of specific data sources. Here are the key observations:\n\n- **Excluding Crowd-Sourced Data (– Crowd)**: When the crowd-sourced data is excluded, the Precision, Recall, and F1-score for the Ultra-Fine category drop significantly. The F1-score, for instance, decreases from 24.5 (when all data is used) to 19.7. This indicates that the crowd-sourced data is crucial for predicting ultra-fine labels, as it provides a significant amount of fine-grained information.\n\n- **Excluding Head Word Supervision (– Head)**: Excluding the head word supervision also leads to a noticeable drop in the F1-score for the Ultra-Fine category, from 24.5 to 20.8. This suggests that head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels, as it provides additional context and specificity.\n\n- **Excluding Entity Linking Data (– EL)**: When the entity linking data is excluded, the F1-score for the Ultra-Fine category drops from 24.5 to 21.6. This indicates that entity linking data, which includes both KB and Wikipedia definitions, is also important for improving the model's performance on ultra-fine labels.\n\nThese observations align with the text quote [10], which states:\n> \"All sources of supervision appear to be useful, with crowdsourced examples making the biggest impact. Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels, while entity linking improves fine label prediction.\"\n\nIn summary, the exclusion of different data sources, especially crowd-sourced data, head word supervision, and entity linking, negatively impacts the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category. Each of these data sources provides unique and valuable information that contributes to the model's ability to predict ultra-fine labels accurately."}

For instance, quote [2] describes an authentic fishing village setting with a shop, but it doesn't specify year-round accessibility. Quote [5] highlights Bryggen, which is primarily focused on historical tours rather than shopping. However, quote [3] mentions the Bergen Card, which provides discounts on cultural events and experiences, and directs visitors to pages 16-17 for more information.

This is consistent across multiple images, such as `![20 Offices, 12 Countries, 1914 Employees](image3)`, `![20 Offices, 12 Countries, 1914 Employees](image4)`, and `![20 Offices, 12 Countries, 1914 Employees](image6)`.\n\nHowever, the specific distribution of these metrics between the Assurance and Consulting sectors is not explicitly detailed in the text or images. The images suggest a unified presence, but the text indicates that both sectors have distinct roles and services. \n\nIn summary, while both the Assurance and Consulting sectors at PwC Middle East operate within a similar geographical and personnel framework, they differ in their specific services and focus areas. Assurance emphasizes compliance and internal audit, whereas Consulting focuses on strategic and operational problem-solving, particularly in the digital and IT domains."}

This step helps you get an accurate measurement without constricting your wrist.\n\n3. **Select the Strap**: Based on the measurement, select the size of the strap and fasten the nail buckle [3]. The strap should be comfortable and not too tight or too loose.\n\n4. **Ensure Proper Placement**: To ensure the accuracy of the measurement, place the watch body in the middle of the back of your wrist. The edge of the watch's body should be below the root of the ulnar styloid process, and should not press the root of the ulnar styloid process or be too far away from it. The center of the watch's face should be on your wrist about two fingers width away from the palm [5]. This ensures that the watch is positioned correctly for both comfort and functionality.\n\n5. **Adjust the Strap**: Adjust the strap based on your wrist's circumference to ensure a proper fit [9]. The illustration in the image shows the placement of a wrist-worn device, such as a smartwatch, approximately 2.5 to 3 centimeters from the wrist joint, as indicated by the red arrow and measurement line. The hand is holding the strap, suggesting how to adjust it for a proper fit. `![The image shows the correct placement and adjustment of a wrist-worn device, approximately 2.5 to 3 centimeters from the wrist joint.](image3)`\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately measure your wrist circumference and select the appropriate strap for your watch.\n\n**Answer**: To properly measure your wrist circumference for selecting a strap, position the ruler about two fingers' width from the bottom of your palm, pull it snugly, record the measurement, and select the corresponding strap size, ensuring the watch is placed correctly on your wrist."}

The analytics value chain, as described in the text, involves a series of steps that start with data collection and end with impact [3]. This chain ensures that data is not only collected and analyzed but also used to drive decisions and actions, ultimately leading to tangible business value.\n\n![Data-driven process from data to value](image1)\n\nIn the flowchart, the process begins with \"Data,\" which is stored and then used for \"Reporting.\" This phase generates various reports and visualizations, providing a descriptive view of what has happened. Next, the \"Analysis\" phase delves deeper into the data to gain insights, answering questions like \"Why?\" and \"What if?\" This analysis is forward-looking and prescriptive, helping to identify the root causes and potential future trends [2].\n\n![Comparison of Reporting and Analysis](image2)\n\nThe table comparing \"Reporting\" and \"Analysis\" highlights that reporting is descriptive and backward-looking, while analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking. Reporting raises questions, whereas analysis answers them by transforming data and information into insights. The outputs of reporting are typically reports and dashboards, while analysis provides findings and recommendations, often with context and storytelling [2].\n\nFollowing the analysis, the next step is \"Action,\" where the insights are used to make informed decisions or take specific actions. These actions, when effectively implemented, lead to increased \"Value,\" as shown by the upward trend in the graph. This final step ensures that the insights and decisions derived from the data have a positive impact on the business [3].\n\nAdditionally, the levels of analytics, as outlined in the text, provide a more detailed breakdown of how data is transformed into value. Starting from standard reports, which answer \"What happened?\" to ad-hoc reports, query drilldowns, and alerts, the process moves towards more advanced analytics such as statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization [8].\n\n![Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image8)\n\nThe diagram illustrates the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, showing an increase in both business value and degree of intelligence.

This involves several strategies and considerations that help in defining and managing the scope effectively.\n\nIn the DA framework, the initial scope is explored through various levels of detail and modeling strategies. The level of detail can range from goals-driven to detailed specifications [5]. For instance, you might start with high-level requirements and then move to more detailed specifications as needed. This flexible approach allows teams to tailor their efforts based on the project's specific needs.\n\nThe framework also emphasizes different view types for modeling, such as usage modeling, domain modeling, process modeling, and user interface modeling. These views help in understanding the different aspects of the system and ensuring that all relevant perspectives are considered [5].\n\nFor the modeling strategy, the DA framework suggests options like informal and formal modeling sessions, as well as interviews. These methods allow teams to gather and validate requirements in a way that suits the project context and stakeholder preferences [5].\n\nAdditionally, the work item management strategy is a key consideration. Teams can use a work item pool, a work item list, or a requirements backlog to manage and prioritize the work. The choice of strategy depends on the team's preference and the nature of the project [5].\n\nNon-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability, are also crucial.

Mirrors are designed to reflect light, and this is illustrated in the diagram showing the principle of reflection. In the image, two green arrows represent light rays. One arrow is labeled with an angle \\( i^\\circ \\), indicating the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incident ray and the normal (the dashed pink line perpendicular to the surface). The other arrow is labeled with an angle \\( r^\\circ \\), indicating the angle of reflection, which is equal to the angle of incidence according to the law of reflection. The arrows meet at the surface, depicted as a solid black line at the bottom, showing how light reflects off the surface. This is a clear demonstration of how a mirror works [12]. \n![The image is a diagram illustrating the principle of reflection, showing two green arrows representing light rays and their angles of incidence and reflection.](image1)\n\nAnother example is the **surface of a CD or DVD**. These optical media have microscopic pits that act like the absence of light in morse code. When a laser hits a shiny surface, it reflects, but when it hits a pit, it does not reflect. This then sends a message to computer chips, which then send a visual or audio track to the player. This is a practical application of reflection in technology [9].\n![The image contains text on a green background that reads: \"P1c: Reflection, Refraction, Diffraction\".](image8)\n\nIn summary, two examples of reflecting surfaces are mirrors and the surface of CDs or DVDs."}

Mendel showed that parents pass heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [4]. In a classic monohybrid cross, such as the one involving purple and white flowers, the parental generation (P) consists of homozygous plants: PP for purple flowers and pp for white flowers. \n\n![The image illustrates a genetic cross diagram, showcasing the inheritance of traits in plants. It uses a classical Mendelian genetics approach.](image1)\n\nWhen these plants are crossed, the F1 generation is entirely heterozygous (Pp), and all plants display the dominant purple phenotype. This is because the P allele for purple flowers is dominant over the p allele for white flowers.\n\nIn the F1 generation, the heterozygous plants (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. When these gametes combine during fertilization, the F2 generation results in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers. The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp.\n\n![This image illustrates Mendelian inheritance. It shows a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered plants in the P (parent) generation, resulting in all purple-flowered plants in the F₁ generation due to dominant traits. In the F₂ generation, the offspring consist of ¾ purple-flowered and ¼ white-flowered plants, demonstrating the segregation of alleles.](image4)\n\nThe 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation can be explained by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation. Each F1 plant (Pp) produces equal numbers of P and p gametes, and the random combination of these gametes during fertilization results in the observed ratios. Specifically, 1/4 of the F2 plants will have the genotype PP (purple), 1/2 will have the genotype Pp (also purple), and 1/4 will have the genotype pp (white).\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of dominance, segregation, and random fertilization."}

Let's break down the specific impacts based on the provided figures.\n\n### Structured Markup Errors\nThe table in image7, titled \"Structured Markup,\" shows a detailed breakdown of different data types with specific markup sources, including the number of items, items with errors, and pages. For example, the \"Blog\" data type has 135,747 items, but 72,441 of these have errors [image7]. Similarly, the \"Article\" data type (first instance) has 130,554 items, with 49,222 having errors. These errors can lead to search engines not properly understanding the content, which can result in lower visibility and ranking [7].\n\n### Meta Description Issues\nImage3 provides a table that includes meta description and title tag issues. Specifically, it shows:\n- **Duplicate meta descriptions**: 2,215 pages\n- **Long meta descriptions**: 21 pages\n- **Short meta descriptions**: 1,450 pages\n- **Missing title tags**: 10 pages\n- **Duplicate title tags**: 621 pages\n\nThese issues can negatively affect how search engines interpret and display the content, leading to lower click-through rates and reduced organic traffic [3].\n\n### Impact on SEO Performance\nBoth structured markup errors and meta description issues can hinder the effectiveness of SEO efforts. Structured markup helps search engines understand the context and relevance of the content, and errors in this markup can prevent rich snippets from being displayed, reducing the attractiveness of the search result. Meta description issues, such as duplicates, missing, or improperly formatted descriptions, can also lead to poor user experience and lower click-through rates, further impacting SEO performance.\n\nIn summary, structured markup errors and meta description issues can significantly reduce SEO performance by affecting how search engines interpret and display the content, leading to lower visibility and reduced organic traffic."}

Traditional marketing and measurement methods fail to capture the sentiment, opinion, and affinity a person has towards a brand, which are crucial for understanding customer behavior [1]. Additionally, there is often too much data, but it is not always insightful or actionable, and there is a lack of a 360-degree view of all activities and customer behavior [2].\n\nFurthermore, the lack of a consistent and relevant digital marketing taxonomy, along with unclear roles and responsibilities, contributes to the challenges. The absence of clear processes and skilled resources can also hinder the implementation of an integrated customer management approach [2].\n\nCultural and management barriers are also significant.

This indicates that elements can be perceived as separate entities based on their spatial arrangement.\n\nThe principle of **Fechamento (Closure)** is illustrated by the \"G\" and \"E\" together, making us perceive a closed shape or form, even though part of it is missing [image2]. This principle highlights our tendency to fill in gaps and see incomplete figures as complete.\n\n**Proximidade (Proximity)** is demonstrated by the letter \"E,\" which is depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together, suggesting unity [image2]. This shows that objects that are close to each other are often perceived as a single group.\n\n**Continuidade (Continuity)** is exemplified by the \"S,\" which follows a continuous contour line, suggesting a smooth flow or pathway [image2]. This principle illustrates how we tend to see lines and curves as continuous, even if they are interrupted.\n\n**Semelhança (Similarity)** is shown by the letters \"T\" and \"A,\" which share a similar striped pattern, indicating that we group them together based on visual similarity [image2]. This principle, as mentioned in the text, states that objects that are similar in shape and color are perceived as belonging to part of a group [10].\n\nLastly, the principle of **Pregnância (Prägnanz)** is evident in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A,\" suggesting that our perception tends towards seeing the simplest form [image2]. This aligns with the idea that our perception focuses on the most concise and regular forms, as described in the text [4].\n\nThese principles collectively help explain how the design of the word 'GESTALT' leverages our natural tendencies in visual perception to create a cohesive and meaningful whole.\n\n![The image depicts the word \"GESTALT\" using various principles of Gestalt psychology, which are concepts related to visual perception and how we tend to view objects as part of a greater whole.

This method is used by 52% of marketers, as shown in the bar chart ![Attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint: 52%](image2).\n\nHowever, this approach can be problematic because it often over-attributes the conversion to the last interaction, such as a Paid Search (PPC) or Organic Search (SEO) click, while ignoring the contributions of earlier marketing efforts. For example, if someone types in a branded search term like \"Commonwealth Bank Home Loans,\" the customer has already been exposed to other forms of advertising, but only the last click gets the credit [5]. This can lead to an inaccurate understanding of the effectiveness of different marketing channels.\n\nTo improve attribution, it's recommended to use a more comprehensive tracking mechanism that measures the performance of all ad types and looks beyond the last ad when attributing value [1]. Additionally, using a proven methodology and specialized skills can help derive better weighted attribution, rather than relying on a single technical solution [2].\n\nIn summary, the most common method marketers use to calculate attribution for a transaction is attributing the activity to the most recent touchpoint, or Last Click attribution."}

The line graph from Wikibon, which depicts financial data from 2012 to 2017, shows a significant upward trend in big data revenue over these years. Notable data points include $5.1 billion in 2012, $10.2 billion in 2013, $16.8 billion in 2014, $32.1 billion in 2015, $48.0 billion in 2016, and $53.4 billion in 2017. This indicates a substantial increase in overall big data revenue, with a more than tenfold growth from 2012 to 2017. \n![Overall Big Data Revenue Growth from 2012 to 2017](image1)\n\nNext, let's examine the pure-play vendor revenue. In 2011, the total revenue for all the pure-play vendors listed was $468 million. The bar chart provides a detailed breakdown of the revenue for each vendor, with Vertica leading at $84 million, followed by Opera Solutions at $75 million, and so on.\n![Pure-Play Vendor Revenue in 2011](image7)\n\nComparing these two sets of data, it is evident that the overall big data market experienced a much more dramatic growth compared to the pure-play vendors. While the pure-play vendors had a combined revenue of $468 million in 2011, the overall big data market grew from $5.1 billion in 2012 to $53.4 billion in 2017, as shown in the line graph. This suggests that while the pure-play vendors contributed to the market, the overall growth was driven by a broader range of companies and services.\n\nIn summary, the overall big data market saw a significant and rapid growth from 2011 to 2017, while the pure-play vendors, though important, had a more modest contribution in terms of revenue."}

For example, it is mentioned that PwC has offices in 155 countries and more than 284,000 people [11]. However, the specific details for each department are not explicitly stated in the text. We can infer some details from the images provided.\n\nThe images provide various metrics for different segments or regions within PwC. Let's break down the information:\n\n- **Image1** shows an organization with 20 offices, 1914 employees, and operations in 12 countries. This could represent a specific segment or region within PwC. `![{20 offices, 1914 employees, 12 countries}](image1)`\n\n- **Image3** also provides similar metrics: 20 offices, 1914 employees, and 12 countries. This consistency suggests that these numbers might be for a particular division or region. `![{20 offices, 1914 employees, 12 countries}](image3)`\n\n- **Image8** again confirms the same metrics: 20 offices, 1914 employees, and 12 countries. `![{20 offices, 1914 employees, 12 countries}](image8)`\n\n- **Image2** shows a slightly different set of metrics: 12 offices, 9 countries, and 1816 employees. `![{12 offices, 9 countries, 1816 employees}](image2)`\n\n- **Image5** also indicates 12 offices, 1816 employees, and 9 countries. `![{12 offices, 1816 employees, 9 countries}](image5)`\n\n- **Image7** provides another set of metrics: 17 offices, 11 countries, and 870 employees. `![{17 offices, 11 countries, 870 employees}](image7)`\n\n- **Image4** and **Image6** show smaller segments: 9 offices, 7 countries, and 500 employees. `![{9 offices, 7 countries, 500 employees}](image4)` and `![{9 offices, 7 countries, 500 employees}](image6)`\n\nGiven the consistent metrics across multiple images, it appears that the larger segments (20 offices, 1914 employees, 12 countries) might represent the broader PwC network, while the smaller segments (9 offices, 7 countries, 500 employees) could be specific to smaller regional or specialized units.\n\nHowever, without explicit details for each department, we can infer that the Assurance, Consulting, and Deals departments likely have varying sizes and operational scopes. The larger metrics (20 offices, 1914 employees, 12 countries) suggest a more extensive and possibly global reach, which could be representative of the overall PwC network. The smaller metrics (9 offices, 7 countries, 500 employees) might indicate more specialized or regional operations.\n\nIn summary, the Assurance, Consulting, and Deals departments at PwC differ in terms of the number of offices, employees, and countries they operate in, with the larger segments likely representing broader, more global operations and the smaller segments representing specialized or regional units."}

These stages differ in how chromosomes are separated and the resulting number of chromosomes in the daughter cells.\n\nIn **meiosis I**, homologous chromosomes separate [11]. This is a key event where the chromosome number is reduced by half. The process involves several steps:\n- **Prophase I**: Homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through crossing over, as seen in the diagram with labeled sites of crossing over `![Diagram showing stages of meiosis, including crossing over and tetrad formation](image4)`.\n- **Metaphase I**: Homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate.\n- **Anaphase I**: The homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell, reducing the chromosome number from diploid to haploid [3].\n- **Telophase I and Cytokinesis**: The cell divides, resulting in two haploid cells, each with a single set of chromosomes [4].\n\nIn **meiosis II**, the sister chromatids separate [6], similar to what happens during mitosis. This stage also involves several steps:\n- **Prophase II**: The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the spindle apparatus forms.\n- **Metaphase II**: The chromosomes align at the metaphase plate.\n- **Anaphase II**: The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers, as shown in the image with the cleavage furrow and separation of sister chromatids `![Stages of cell division, specifically meiosis, showing the separation of sister chromatids and the formation of haploid daughter cells](image2)`.\n- **Telophase II and Cytokinesis**: The cell divides again, resulting in four haploid daughter cells, each with a single set of chromosomes [6].\n\nThe key difference is that in meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number, while in meiosis II, sister chromatids separate, maintaining the haploid number of chromosomes [11].\n\nTo summarize, **meiosis I** reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid by separating homologous chromosomes, and **meiosis II** separates sister chromatids, resulting in four genetically diverse haploid cells."}

The horizontal bar chart in image7 displays data from the years 1960 to 2007, with each bar representing a year and labeled with a numerical value to its right, ranging from 5.2 to 16. The numerical values increase over time, indicating growth or an upward trend. This suggests that U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP has been increasing from 1960 to 2007. \n\n![U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased from 5.2% in 1960 to 16% in 2007, showing a steady upward trend.](image7)\n\nNext, let's consider the major events in the Space Race timeline, as depicted in image8. The graphic representation shows the \"Space Race\" between the United States (depicted in blue) and the Soviet Union (depicted in red), covering the period from 1957 to 1975. Key milestones such as \"Sputnik,\" \"Explorer,\" \"Vostok,\" \"Mercury,\" \"Gemini,\" \"Apollo,\" and \"Soyuz\" are marked on the chart, along with broader historical contexts like the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassination of JFK, and the end of the war in Vietnam.\n\n![The Space Race timeline from 1957 to 1975, showing key milestones and historical events for both the U.S. and the Soviet Union.](image8)\n\nThe Space Race timeline provides a context of significant technological and political events during the same period. For example, the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, and the end of the Apollo program in 1972. These events coincide with the period of increasing healthcare spending. \n\nWhile the Space Race and healthcare spending are not directly related, they both reflect the broader economic and political environment of the time. The Space Race required significant government investment and technological advancements, which may have contributed to overall economic growth and, indirectly, to the increasing healthcare spending. Additionally, the political and social changes during this period, such as the expansion of social programs and improvements in medical technology, likely played a role in the rising healthcare expenditures.\n\nIn conclusion, U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased from 5.2% in 1960 to 16% in 2007, showing a steady upward trend. This trend occurred during a period of significant technological and political events, including the Space Race, which reflects the broader economic and social changes of the time."}

The fuel supply system is crucial for delivering fuel from the tank to the engine. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\nThe fuel supply system typically starts with the **fuel tank** [2], which holds the fuel. From there, the fuel is drawn by a **low-pressure pump** and moved to a **surge tank** to ensure a constant supply and prevent fuel starvation [image2]. \n\nNext, an **EFI pump** (Electric Fuel Injection pump) pumps the fuel from the surge tank through the system. The fuel then passes through an **EFI filter** to remove any impurities before it reaches the **fuel rail** [image2].\n\nThe **fuel rail** is a common component that distributes fuel to the **injectors**. In a common rail system, the fuel rail acts as a pressure accumulator, storing fuel at high pressure and supplying it to multiple injectors [2]. This is illustrated in [image6], where the **common rail** (left and right bank) distributes high-pressure fuel to the injectors.\n\nAdditionally, a **fuel pressure regulator** is used to maintain the correct pressure in the fuel rail and return excess fuel back to the fuel supply through the return line [image5].\n\nThe entire process is managed by the **Electronic Control Unit (ECU)**, which processes data from various sensors and sends signals to control the injectors and other components [image1]. The ECU ensures that the fuel is delivered at the right time and in the right amount, based on the engine's needs.\n\nIn summary, the components connected with the fuel supply include the fuel tank, low-pressure pump, surge tank, EFI pump, EFI filter, fuel rail, fuel injectors, and fuel pressure regulator. \n\n![The image shows the flow of fuel from the gasoline tank through the various components to the engine, including the low-pressure pump, surge tank, EFI pump, EFI filter, fuel rail, and fuel injectors.](image2)"}

This phase is primarily descriptive, focusing on what has happened. For example, the image1 shows a flowchart where the \"Data\" (blue cylinder) is used in the \"Reporting\" phase, generating various charts and graphs. This phase provides a backward-looking view, raising questions about the current state of the business. `![Data-driven process from data to value](image1)`\n\nAnalysis, on the other hand, delves deeper into the data to uncover insights and answer the questions raised by reporting. The \"Analysis\" phase in the same flowchart is represented with a magnifying glass over a chart, symbolizing the in-depth examination of the reported data. This phase is prescriptive, forward-looking, and focused on understanding why things are happening. It aims to provide context and storytelling, which helps in making informed decisions. `![Data-driven process from data to value](image1)`\n\nThe transition from reporting to analysis is further illustrated in image4, which compares the two across several dimensions. Reporting is described as descriptive, backward-looking, and focused on raising questions, while analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, and aimed at answering those questions. `![Comparison of Reporting and Analysis](image4)`\n\nIn the progression from business intelligence to business analytics, both reporting and analysis play crucial roles. Business intelligence (BI) typically includes standard reports, ad-hoc reports, query drilldowns, and alerts, which help in understanding what happened, how often, and where. These stages are essential for providing a clear picture of the current and past performance. `![Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image7)`\n\nBusiness analytics (BA), on the other hand, builds on BI by incorporating statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization. These advanced analytical techniques help in understanding why things are happening, predicting future trends, and determining the best possible outcomes. As shown in image7, the progression from BI to BA involves an increase in both business value and the degree of intelligence. `![Progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics](image7)`\n\nIn summary, reporting and analysis are key components of the analytics value chain, with reporting providing the necessary information and analysis delivering the insights needed for decision-making. Together, they drive the progression from business intelligence to business analytics, enhancing business value and intelligence."}

The image that corresponds to this is a diagram illustrating a circular object secured within a timber frame, with wedges positioned around it to hold it securely in place. `![A circular object secured within a timber frame with wedges](image8)`\n\nAnother special form is the **modular and reusable column formwork**. These systems are designed to be modular, allowing for quick assembly and erection on-site while minimizing labor and crane time. They are available in steel, aluminum, and even cardboard (not reusable but recycled) and have a variety of internal face surfaces depending on the concrete finish required. Innovations have led to adjustable, reusable column forms which can be clamped on-site to give different column sizes [10].\n\nAdditionally, there are **engineered or prefabricated form works**. These are built out of prefabricated modules with a metal frame (usually steel or aluminum) and covered on the application side with material having the desired surface structure (steel, aluminum, timber, etc.). The two major advantages of these form work systems, compared to traditional timber form work, are speed of construction and lower life-cycle costs [12]. An example of this is shown in an illustration of a 3D view of formwork assembly for a concrete column, including detailed labeling for components like cement concrete, M.S. bars, 35 mm thick boarding, 50 x 100 batten, 100 x 100 yoke, 20 mm diameter bolt, wedge, and washout hole. `![A 3D view of formwork assembly for a concrete column with detailed labeling](image6)`\n\nFurthermore, there are **adjustable steel clamps** used in column formwork. These are shown in a technical illustration that demonstrates how the parts of the clamp are assembled and interlocked, highlighting components such as a returned end, steel wedge, slotted holes, the interlocking end, and an arm. `![A technical illustration of adjustable steel clamps showing assembly and interlocking parts](image4)`\n\nIn summary, the special forms of column formworks illustrated in the diagrams include circular column formwork, modular and reusable formwork, engineered or prefabricated form works, and adjustable steel clamps."}

However, in some cases, thicker plywood may be necessary. For instance, when the weight of the concrete causes a standard 18mm thickness to bow out and distort the concrete face, a thicker plywood, such as 25mm, is used [5].\n\nFor timber formwork, various sizes of members are used, and beam sides can be made from 18mm plywood or 25mm boards, with studs (cleats) at 500 to 600mm centers [10]. This indicates that 25mm sheeting is a common and appropriate size for timber formwork, especially when additional strength and stability are required.\n\nAdditionally, the table in the provided image lists the dimensions for construction materials, including sheathing for slabs, beam sides, and beam bottoms, with thicknesses ranging from 25mm to 40mm `![Sheeting for slabs, beam, column side and beam bottom: Thickness from 25 mm to 40 mm.](image3)`. This further supports the use of 25mm sheeting as an appropriate size for timber formwork.\n\nIn conclusion, 25mm sheeting is an appropriate size for timber formwork, particularly when additional strength and stability are needed."}

For example, the ECU will determine the quantity of fuel to inject based on parameters such as throttle position and engine temperature. If the throttle pedal is pressed further down, more air is allowed into the engine, and the ECU will inject more fuel accordingly [4]. Additionally, if the engine has not warmed up yet, the ECU will inject more fuel to compensate [4].\n\nFurthermore, the ECU controls other important functions such as ignition timing and idle speed.

The diagram uses a circular format to show the cyclical nature of the cell cycle with arrows indicating progression from one phase to the next.](image1)\n\n**Mitotic Phase (M)** is the stage where the actual cell division occurs. It includes:\n- **Mitosis**: This is the process where the cell divides its chromosomes into two nuclei. Early in the division process, chromosomes duplicate, and each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids joined at the centromere [8].\n- **Cytokinesis**: This is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two daughter cells [4].\n\n![This image depicts the stages of cell division, specifically illustrating the process of mitosis. It shows three main phases: 1. **Interphase**: The cell contains centrosomes (with centriole pairs), a nucleolus, and a nuclear envelope. Chromatin is present in the nucleus. 2. **Prophase/Early Mitotic Spindle Formation**: The centrosomes begin moving to opposite poles. Chromosomes, made of two sister chromatids, start condensing. The mitotic spindle begins to form. 3. **Prometaphase**: The nuclear envelope fragments. Kinetochore microtubules connect to the chromosomes at their centromeres. Spindle microtubules extend across the cell. These stages illustrate how the cell prepares to divide its genetic material into two daughter cells.](image6)\n\nIn summary, the main stages of the cell cycle are Interphase (G₁, S, G₂) and the Mitotic Phase (M), which includes Mitosis and Cytokinesis."}

Let's break down how these modes work and their ideal use cases.\n\n### Metering Modes\nMetering modes determine how the camera measures the light in the scene to set the correct exposure. The three primary metering modes are:\n\n1. **Matrix Metering Mode**:\n   - **Overview**: Measures light across the entire frame.\n   - **Ideal for**: Shooting natural landscapes. This mode is useful when you want to ensure that the overall scene is well-exposed, such as when capturing a wide landscape with varying light conditions [5].\n\n2. **Center Metering Mode**:\n   - **Overview**: Focuses on light near the center of the screen.\n   - **Ideal for**: Shooting portraits. This mode is great for ensuring that the subject in the center of the frame is correctly exposed, making it perfect for portrait photography [5].\n\n3. **Spot Metering Mode**:\n   - **Overview**: Focuses on light from a specific region.\n   - **Ideal for**: Specific focus areas such as a subject's eyes. This mode is useful when you need to ensure that a small, specific area of the scene is perfectly exposed, such as a person's face or a detailed object [5].\n\n![The table provides a comparative overview of three different camera metering modes with descriptions of how each mode functions and its ideal use case: 1. Matrix Metering Mode: Overview: Measures light across the entire frame. Ideal for: Shooting natural landscapes. 2. Center Metering Mode: Overview: Focuses on light near the center of the screen. Ideal for: Shooting portraits. 3. Spot Metering Mode: Overview: Focuses on light from a specific region. Ideal for: Specific focus areas such as a subject's eyes.](image5)\n\n### Focus Modes\nFocus modes determine how the camera focuses on the subject, and they are crucial for capturing sharp and clear images. The main focus modes include:\n\n1. **AF-S (single)**:\n   - **Usage scenario**: Stationary subjects. This mode is best for photographing subjects that are not moving, such as still life or posed portraits [4].\n\n2. **AF-C (continuous)**:\n   - **Usage scenario**: Moving subjects. This mode is ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects, such as sports or wildlife, where the subject is in motion [4].\n\n3. **MF (manual)**:\n   - **Usage scenario**: Touch the subject of interest to focus in on them, such as the subject's face. This mode gives you full control over the focus, allowing you to manually adjust the focus point, which is useful for creative shots or when the camera's autofocus is not sufficient [4].\n\n![The table describes different camera focus modes and their usage scenarios. It has two columns: \"Focus Mode\" and \"Usage scenarios.\" 1. AF-S (single): Usage scenario: Stationary subjects. 2. AF-C (continuous): Usage scenario: Moving subjects. 3. MF (manual): Usage scenario: Touch the subject of interest to focus in on them, such as the subject's face.](image4)\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, you can tailor your camera settings to the specific shooting conditions and achieve the best possible results. For example, using Matrix Metering and AF-C for a dynamic landscape with moving elements, or Center Metering and AF-S for a well-lit portrait, will help you capture the scene as intended.\n\nIn summary, the different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by allowing you to adapt to various shooting scenarios, ensuring that both the exposure and focus are optimized for the specific conditions."}

The low conversion rate of 1.50% suggests that either the criteria for qualifying MQLs are too broad, or there is a misalignment between the marketing and sales teams. This could result in a high number of unqualified leads being passed to sales, leading to inefficiencies and wasted resources. On the other hand, the industry average of 45-75% indicates that with proper alignment and more stringent qualification criteria, the organization can significantly improve its MQL to SAL conversion rate.\n\nIn conclusion, the MQL to SAL conversion rate in the first dataset is 1.50%, which is much lower than the industry average of 45-75%, indicating potential issues in the lead qualification and handoff processes."}
