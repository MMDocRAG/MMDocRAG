According to the data, in July 2014, 43% of the total population believed that Islam encourages violence more than other religions. This percentage increased to 50% in September 2014, reaching a historical high, and then decreased slightly to 46% in December 2015 [1]. This trend indicates a general decline in the perception that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, although the public remains closely divided [4].\n\nWhen breaking down these perceptions by political affiliation, significant differences emerge. Republicans have consistently held higher percentages of this view. In September 2014, 67% of Republicans believed that Islam encourages violence more than other religions, which increased slightly to 68% in December 2015, marking a historical high [6]. This consistent and high percentage among Republicans contrasts sharply with the views of Democrats. In September 2014, 42% of Democrats held this belief, but by December 2015, this percentage had dropped to 30% [6]. This decline reflects a growing partisan divide, with the gap between Republicans and Democrats on this issue becoming wider than ever [8].\n\nThe ideological divide within political parties is also stark. Among conservative Republicans, 77% believe that Islam is more likely to encourage violence, a figure that has remained relatively stable [7]. In contrast, only 16% of liberal Democrats share this view, with 73% believing that Islam is no more likely to encourage violence than other religions [7]. This ideological divide further emphasizes the polarization on this issue.\n\nAdditionally, demographic factors play a role. Younger adults (ages 18-29) are less likely to believe that Islam encourages violence compared to older adults. In December 2015, only 32% of those aged 18-29 held this view, compared to 51% of those 65 and older [2]. This age gap, however, has narrowed somewhat since the previous year.\n\nReligious affiliations also influence these perceptions. White evangelical Protestants are the most likely to believe that Islam encourages violence, with 70% holding this view in December 2015, the highest percentage among all religious groups [9]. In contrast, only 38% of unaffiliated individuals believe this [9].\n\nIn summary, perceptions of whether Islam encourages violence more than other religions have fluctuated over time, with a slight overall decline. However, there is a significant and growing partisan and ideological divide, with Republicans and conservatives being much more likely to hold this view compared to Democrats and liberals. ![{The data shows a significant partisan and ideological divide in perceptions of Islam's association with violence.}](image1)"}

For example, while majorities support the idea of providing all Americans with a guaranteed income (60%) and creating a national service program (58%), these proposals are not as universally accepted as the limitation to dangerous jobs [10]. Additionally, there is a notable divide between Republicans and Democrats on some of these policies. Democrats are more likely to support a universal income (77% to 38%) and a national service program (66% to 46%) [3].\n\nDespite these differences, the overall trend indicates a strong inclination towards policies that protect human workers and limit the scope of machine replacement in the workforce. The public's concern about the ethical and practical implications of widespread automation is evident, with many expressing support for measures that bring human beings more fully into the operations of these technologies [1][5].\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of the public supports limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines, particularly when it comes to ensuring that machines are restricted to dangerous or unhealthy tasks."}

Additionally, 41% of Americans believe that this lack of early encouragement is a major reason why there are fewer blacks and Hispanics in the STEM workforce [5].\n\nAnother critical factor is the limited access to quality education. About 52% of STEM workers cite this as a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics, with a higher percentage of black STEM workers (73%) and Hispanic STEM workers (53%) holding this view [6]. This disparity in educational opportunities is also reflected in the broader population, where 42% of Americans see it as a significant barrier [6].\n\nDiscrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is another major issue. Around 32% of people working in STEM jobs attribute the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics to racial/ethnic discrimination [4]. This perception is even more pronounced among black STEM workers, with 72% considering it a major reason for underrepresentation [7]. \n\nFurthermore, the lack of role models is a significant factor. Both 32% of STEM workers and 32% of the general population see the absence of black and Hispanic role models in STEM as a major reason for underrepresentation [4][1]. This lack of representation can discourage young individuals from pursuing STEM careers.\n\nFor women specifically, the data shows that 39% of Americans believe the lack of early encouragement is a major reason for the underrepresentation of women in STEM [5].

The availability of best prices, convenience, and value proposition for customers are key factors influencing the choice of categories for online purchases.\n\nWhen it comes to the number of transactions, categories that are frequently purchased and have a high frequency of use tend to dominate. For instance, everyday items and services like communication, shopping, and travel planning are likely to see a higher volume of transactions due to their recurring nature. This is supported by the emphasis on the convenience and best prices available online [8].\n\nOn the other hand, categories that contribute the most to the gross margin value are typically those with higher profit margins and less frequent but more significant purchases. These might include luxury items, electronics, and specialized products. The focus on profitability and customer experience over discounting [4] suggests that these higher-margin categories are becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe critical success factors for e-commerce platforms, such as the widest selection, great shopping experience, and efficient logistics, also play a role in driving both transaction volume and gross margin value [image3].\n\nIn conclusion, categories like communication, shopping, and travel planning likely contribute the most to the number of transactions due to their high frequency of use and convenience.

For example, postgraduates are more likely to disapprove strongly of the ethical standards of both parties, with 68% disapproving and only 23% approving, compared to those with a high school education or less, where 49% disapprove and 43% approve `![{Postgraduates are more critical of both parties' ethical standards}](image1)`.\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a significant role in these perceptions. Independents are significantly more likely than partisans to say neither party has “high ethical standards.” About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), say neither party has high ethical standards, compared to only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) who say this [7]. This indicates a higher level of skepticism among non-aligned voters.\n\nIn terms of extremism, the data shows that more Americans view the Republican Party as “too extreme” (48%) compared to the Democratic Party (42%). However, the share of Americans who view the Republican Party as too extreme has declined since last June (from 54%) [9]. This decline might reflect changes in public opinion or media coverage.\n\nThe image data further illustrates this point. Among registered voters, 48% view the Democratic Party as having high ethical standards, while 43% view the Republican Party similarly `![{Registered voters have slightly higher ethical standards for the Democratic Party}](image3)`. Additionally, the perception of extremism is more pronounced among certain demographic groups. For example, Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to view the Republican Party as too extreme, with 83% and 69% disapproving strongly, respectively, compared to 13% and 23% who approve `![{Black and Hispanic voters are more critical of the Republican Party's extremism}](image1)`.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of political parties' ethics and extremism differ significantly among various educational and political affiliation groups, with higher education and independent affiliation being associated with more critical views."}

According to the data, about 41% of Americans believe the Republican Party has high ethical standards, while a nearly identical 42% say the same about the Democratic Party [9]. However, when it comes to extremism, more people view the Republican Party as \"too extreme\" (48%) compared to the Democratic Party (42%) [3].\n\nEducational background plays a role in these perceptions. Among those with at least a college degree, 31% say neither party has high ethical standards, while 43% say it describes one party but not the other, and 17% think it describes both [8]. In contrast, fewer individuals with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) think neither party has high ethical standards [5]. This suggests that higher education levels correlate with more critical views of both parties' ethical standards.\n\nPolitical affiliation also strongly influences these perceptions. Independents are more likely than partisans to say neither party has high ethical standards, with 34% of independents holding this view, including 33% of Republican leaners and 33% of Democratic leaners [1]. Partisans, on the other hand, are more positive about their own party's ethical standards, with 66% of Republicans and 64% of Democrats describing their party this way [4].\n\nWhen it comes to extremism, the data shows that 80% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think the Democratic Party is too extreme, while only 21% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree [7]. Conversely, 77% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think the Republican Party is too extreme, while only 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners share this view [7].\n\nThese findings highlight the deep partisan divide in perceptions of both ethical standards and extremism. Overall, the data suggests that while there are significant differences in how the two parties are viewed, these differences are often more pronounced among partisans and those with higher educational backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and extremism differ between the Republican and Democratic parties, with partisans generally viewing their own party more positively and independents being more critical of both parties.

This suggests that higher education is associated with a greater skepticism towards the ethical standards of both major political parties.\n\nMoreover, educational differences also influence early midterm vote preferences. Postgraduate degree holders favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by a margin of 62% to 30%, while those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat by 53% to 40%. Preferences are more divided among voters without a college degree [2].

For instance, in 2008, after Obama's first victory, there was more optimism about partisan relations, with 37% expecting improvements and only 18% predicting worsening relations [10]. This suggests that the current political climate is more polarized, and the expectations for positive changes are lower.\n\nThe implications of having enthusiastic supporters for a president can be seen in the data as well. Trump voters are more optimistic about both race relations and partisan relations compared to Clinton voters. Specifically, 47% of Trump voters expect partisan relations to improve, which is slightly less optimistic than Obama voters in 2008 (55%) [9]. However, the enthusiasm of Trump's base might still drive a more proactive approach to governance and policy-making, even if the broader public remains skeptical.\n\n![{Among Clinton voters, 84% expect race relations to worsen under Trump.}](image4)\n![{In 2016, 27% of all voters expect partisan relations to improve, while 27% expect them to worsen.}](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, voters are more pessimistic about race relations than partisan relations after the 2016 election, and the enthusiasm of Trump's supporters may have implications for the political landscape, but it does not significantly alter the overall pessimistic outlook."}

Currently, about half (49%) of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters favor a more liberal direction, while nearly as many (47%) prefer a more moderate approach [7]. This shift is significant compared to previous years; just two years ago, only 38% of Democratic voters wanted the party to move to the left [9].

After the 2016 election, there was a notable partisan divide in reactions. Trump voters were overwhelmingly happy (94%) that the GOP retained control of Congress, while the vast majority of Clinton supporters (87%) were unhappy [8]. This stark difference in reaction is reflected in the broader trend of increasing polarization, where the gap between voters supporting the winning and losing candidates is larger than in previous elections [5].\n\nOverall, Republican voters have maintained a strong preference for conservatism, while Democratic voters have become more evenly split between liberal and moderate directions, with a growing inclination towards liberalism. These changes in political orientation have contributed to the polarized reactions to the 2016 election outcomes."}

This contrasts with older age groups, who are more concerned about the U.S. not doing enough to stop the militants [1].\n\nMoreover, younger adults are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%) [3].

Additionally, the evaluation of the government's job in reducing the terrorist threat is more positive among those with higher education levels, such as postgraduates (58%) and college graduates (48%), compared to those with less education [image3].\n\nOver time, the perception of government efforts has shifted. Since July 2013, following Edward Snowden’s leaks about NSA surveillance programs, concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has fallen dramatically.

Independents and Democrats generally lean against additional scrutiny, with 62% and 76%, respectively, opposing it [5].\n\nReligious groups also show varied opinions. White evangelical Protestants are divided, with 50% supporting and 43% opposing greater scrutiny [7]. Other religious groups, including white mainline Protestants, black Protestants, Catholics, and the unaffiliated, generally oppose increased scrutiny.\n\nRacial and ethnic differences are also notable. Non-whites, particularly blacks (74%) and Hispanics (66%), are more likely to reject the idea of scrutinizing Muslims based on their faith compared to whites (57%) [10].\n\nThese perceptions are closely related to the perceived importance of terrorism as a national issue. Republicans are more likely to view terrorism, defense, and national security as critical problems, with 41% mentioning these issues compared to 23% of Democrats and 28% of independents [4]. This aligns with the higher support among Republicans for increased scrutiny of Muslims.\n\nIn summary, the data shows that while younger and more diverse groups, as well as Democrats and independents, largely oppose increased scrutiny of Muslims, Republicans, especially conservative Republicans, are more supportive of such measures, which is consistent with their higher concern about terrorism and national security. ![{Younger and more diverse groups oppose increased scrutiny of Muslims, while Republicans support it more.}](image2) ![{Republicans are more likely to support increased scrutiny of Muslims and view terrorism as a critical issue.}](image4)"}

According to the data, in December 2014, only 4% of the public cited terrorism, national security, or ISIS as the most important problem facing the country [7]. However, this number has risen sharply, with nearly three-in-ten (29%) Americans now citing these issues, marking the highest level of concern since February 2003 [7].\n\nThe shift in public perception is also evident in the declining approval ratings for the government's efforts to reduce the terrorist threat. As of the latest data, more Americans (52%) now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in this area, compared to 46% who say it is doing very or fairly well [3]. This represents a significant drop from earlier in the year when 72% rated the government's efforts positively [3].\n\nThese changes are not uniform across different demographic and political groups. For instance, Republicans have become much more critical of the government's efforts, with only 27% now saying the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [4]. Democrats, while still more positive overall, have also seen a decline in their ratings, from 85% to 64% [4]. Independents' positive ratings have dropped from 69% to 44% [4].\n\nAge and education also play a role in these perceptions. Older Americans (57%) are more likely to give the government a negative rating compared to younger adults (46%) [2]. Similarly, those with less education tend to give more negative ratings of the government's efforts [8]. For example, only 40% of those with a high school education or less rate the government's performance positively, compared to 58% of those with a postgraduate degree [6].\n\nAdditionally, there is a notable partisan divide in the perception of the most important problems facing the nation. Republicans are more likely to cite terrorism, defense issues, and national security (41%), compared to Democrats (23%) and independents (28%) [1]. This is reflected in the data showing that Republicans are significantly more concerned about these issues than Democrats and independents [3].\n\nIn summary, perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to combat it have become more negative over time, with significant differences observed across political and demographic groups. ![{Older and less educated Americans are more critical of government efforts to combat terrorism}](image10) The decline in positive ratings is particularly pronounced among Republicans and older, less educated individuals."}

Only 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [4].\n\nIn contrast, Democrats are less likely to prioritize terrorism and more likely to focus on issues like partisan gridlock and division in the country. Just 8% of Democrats cite these issues, compared to 2% of Republicans [2]. Democrats are still more likely to give the government a positive rating for its efforts to combat terrorism, with 64% saying it is doing at least fairly well, though this is down from 85% in January [4].\n\nIndependents fall somewhere in between, with 28% mentioning terrorism, defense, or national security as top concerns [6]. Their positive ratings of the government's efforts have dropped significantly, from 69% in January to 44% currently [4].\n\nThese trends are also reflected in the broader public sentiment. Overall, more Americans now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the terrorist threat (52%) compared to those who say it is doing very or fairly well (46%) [7].

The chart in image2 shows that Republicans are the least satisfied with the government's efforts, with only 27% giving a positive rating, while Democrats are the most satisfied, with 64% giving a positive rating [4]. Independents fall in the middle, with 44% giving a positive rating ![{Republicans are the least satisfied with the government's efforts, Democrats are the most satisfied, and Independents fall in the middle}](image2).\n\nIn conclusion, Republicans are more likely to view terrorism as a critical issue and are more critical of the government's efforts to address it, while Democrats are less focused on terrorism and more satisfied with the government's performance.

Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe that the U.S. will strengthen its influence, while Democrats are about four times more likely than Republicans to expect a decline in U.S. influence [3]. This partisan divide is further illustrated in the image showing that 48% of Republicans (including conservative and moderate Republicans) expect the U.S. to have more influence, whereas only 34% of Democrats (particularly liberals) anticipate a decline [image1].\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to China's influence, the partisan divide is evident. Roughly six-in-ten Republicans believe China's clout will diminish, while only 40% of Democrats share this view [1]. The image also supports this, showing that 86% of liberal Democrats and 75% of moderate/liberal Democrats expect China's influence to decrease, compared to 48% of conservative Republicans and 47% of moderate/conservative Republicans [image2].\n\nRegarding the EU, the partisan divide is less pronounced but still notable. The image indicates that 79% of liberal Democrats and 67% of moderate/liberal Democrats expect the EU's influence to increase, while 58% of conservative Republicans and 49% of moderate/conservative Republicans hold the same view [image2].\n\nEducation also plays a role in shaping these perceptions. Americans with higher levels of education are more likely to believe that the U.S.'s global influence will diminish. For instance, 45% of those with a postgraduate degree, 42% of college graduates, and 42% of those with some college education expect the U.S. to have less influence [image1]. This trend aligns with the text, which notes that higher education correlates with a more pessimistic outlook on U.S. influence [10].\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more optimistic about the U.S. maintaining or increasing its global influence, while Democrats, especially liberal Democrats, are more pessimistic. Higher education levels correlate with a greater expectation of a decline in U.S. influence. ![Partisan and educational divides significantly impact views on future global influence](image1)"}

American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis [4]. Additionally, education level is tied to views on the pandemic's impact on America’s role in international affairs. Americans who have completed higher levels of education are more likely to think the country’s global influence will recede. For example, 45% of those with postgraduate degrees hold this view [9].\n\nThese partisan and age divides are consistent with other attitudes about China. Older Americans and Republicans are especially likely to have a negative opinion of China [7].

In contrast, while a majority of Democrats also believe China has not done a good job, they are less harsh in their criticism compared to Republicans. This partisan divide is further evident in the belief that China's international clout will diminish: roughly 60% of Republicans expect China's influence to decrease, whereas only 40% of Democrats share this view [5].\n\nAdditionally, the image highlights the stark partisan differences in trust and approval of international organizations like the WHO.

Similarly, among Democrats, those who identify as liberal are more inclined to prioritize human rights [6]. \n\nWhen it comes to economic and trade policies with China, more Americans want the U.S. to get tougher with China rather than focusing on building a stronger relationship. This view is particularly prevalent among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, with 72% wanting the U.S. to get tougher on China, and especially among conservative Republicans, where 81% share this opinion [9]. In contrast, about six-in-ten Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents prefer to focus on building stronger ties with China, a sentiment that is consistent among both liberal and more moderate or conservative Democrats [9].\n\nThis divide is also reflected in the breakdown of opinions by political affiliation and ideology. The image shows that a higher percentage of Republicans and Republican leaners, especially conservatives, favor getting tougher with China, while a higher percentage of Democrats and Democrat leaners, especially liberals, prefer building stronger relationships [image2].\n\nIn conclusion, while a majority of Americans across the political spectrum prioritize human rights over economic relations with China, there is a significant ideological divide, with conservative Republicans being more hawkish and liberal Democrats being more dovish in their approaches to China [image2]."}

This sentiment is particularly strong among conservative Republicans, with 81% of them wanting the U.S. to get tougher on China [1].\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats generally hold a more negative view of the tariffs. Most Democrats believe that the tariffs were bad for the U.S. [2], and about six in ten Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents prefer focusing on building stronger ties with China [1]. This preference is consistent among both liberal and moderate or conservative Democrats [1].\n\nThese differing views are reflected in the broader public's perception of the U.S.-China economic relationship. Overall, more Americans believe that the tariffs were ultimately bad for the U.S. (44%) compared to those who think they were good (30%), with about a quarter of Americans believing the tariffs had no discernible effect [5]. ![{More Americans believe tariffs were bad for the U.S.}](image4)\n\nAdditionally, younger people (ages 18 to 29) are more likely than their older counterparts to stress building a stronger relationship with China over getting tougher with Beijing [10].

On the other hand, Democrats predominantly see tariffs as detrimental to the country, with a majority saying the tariffs were bad for the U.S. [6].\n\nThis divide is also reflected in the breakdown of support for tariffs across different demographic groups. For instance, the image showing the breakdown by political affiliation and ideology indicates that conservative Republicans are more likely to support tariffs, while liberal Democrats are more likely to oppose them ![{Conservative Republicans are more supportive of tariffs, while liberal Democrats are more opposed.}](image2).\n\nRegarding international students, the U.S. public generally holds a positive view, with eight-in-ten Americans believing it is good for U.S. colleges and universities to accept international students [7]. However, there is a notable split when it comes to Chinese students specifically. A majority of Americans (55%) support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S., but 43% oppose such limitations [8].\n\nThis split is also evident when broken down by political affiliation. The image showing support and opposition to limiting Chinese students indicates that Republicans are more likely to support restrictions, with 63% of conservative Republicans in favor, compared to 49% of moderate/liberal Republicans [10].

For instance, among Americans aged 50 and older, roughly seven-in-ten are in favor of such limitations [3]. This contrasts with younger Americans, where nearly two-thirds of those aged 18 to 29 oppose the idea [3]. The middle-aged group (30-49) is evenly split between support and opposition [3].\n\nThis age-related trend is also reflected in the confidence levels regarding Chinese leadership. Older Americans, particularly those 65 and older, are more likely to have no confidence in the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, with 53% expressing no confidence at all [10]. In contrast, only 35% of those aged 18 to 29 share this view [10]. This suggests that younger Americans, who are less supportive of limiting Chinese students, also tend to have more positive views of Chinese leadership.\n\nPolitical affiliation plays a significant role as well. Republicans are more likely to support limiting Chinese students, with 70% in favor [6], compared to Democrats, where only 30% support such limitations [6]. This aligns with the broader trend of Republicans having more negative views of China overall, including a higher likelihood of describing China as an enemy and supporting tougher economic policies [1].\n\nThe image data further reinforces these trends. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 70% support limiting Chinese students, while only 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents do [image4].

This optimism has grown substantially over the years, with the current 20 percentage point gap in financial expectations (81% for Latinos vs. 61% for the public) being the largest since the series began [3].\n\nThe data from the survey also highlights that the gains in economic optimism are particularly notable among certain subgroups. For example, Latinos with more education have experienced a faster increase in optimism. Specifically, those who had completed some college saw a 20 percentage point increase in optimism, compared to a 9 percentage point increase for those with a high school diploma and an 11 percentage point increase for those with less education [2]. This trend aligns with the broader economic recovery, where individuals with higher education levels generally fared better during the Great Recession and recovered more quickly [5].\n\nAge also plays a significant role in financial optimism. While 59% of Latinos aged 65 or older expect their family's finances to improve \"a lot\" or \"some\" in the coming year, this is a 7 percentage point increase since 2008 [5]. In contrast, 90% of Hispanic adults under the age of 30 expect their financial condition to get better, a 13 percentage point rise [5]. This indicates that younger Latinos are even more optimistic about their financial futures.\n\nGender differences are also evident. Both Latino men and Latina women are more optimistic about their finances now compared to seven years ago, with men showing a 18 percentage point increase and women a 11 percentage point increase [6]. Additionally, U.S.-born and immigrant Hispanics have seen similar increases in hopeful views of their family's finances, rising by 14 percentage points to 81% in each group [6].\n\nThe overall trend in financial optimism among Latinos can be visualized in the following graph, which shows the significant gap between the optimism of Latinos and the general public over the years. ![{Latino financial optimism has consistently been higher than the general public, with a significant gap in 2015.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, financial optimism among different Hispanic subgroups has increased significantly from 2008 to 2015, with the largest gains observed among those with higher education levels, younger adults, and men.

However, this positive economic perception does not translate into higher overall approval or trust in his administration, which is viewed less favorably than those of the previous five administrations, especially concerning ethical standards [2][4].\n\nIn summary, public perceptions of Trump's responsibilities and trustworthiness are generally lower than those of previous presidents, and these perceptions are heavily influenced by partisan views. ![Public trust in Trump is significantly lower than in previous presidents](image3)"}

This stark partisan divide is evident in the broader context of trust and ethical standards.\n\nWhen it comes to economic impact, the public generally views Trump's policies positively, with 40% believing they have improved economic conditions [4]. However, there is a significant partisan gap here as well. Nearly 80% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe Trump's economic policies have improved conditions, up from 63% in October 2017 [9]. In contrast, 46% of Democrats and Democratic leaners now say his policies have worsened economic conditions [9].\n\nRegarding long-term success, the data shows that overall, 47% of the public thinks Trump will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, compared to 29% who think he will be successful [5]. This is more negative than the ratings for Obama and George W. Bush at comparable points in their presidencies. For example, in January 2011, 45% of Republicans and Republican leaners thought Obama would be successful, while 80% of Democrats and Democratic leaners thought he would be unsuccessful [5]. Similarly, in December 2003, 69% of Republicans thought Bush would be successful, while 37% of Democrats thought he would be unsuccessful [6].\n\nPartisan views are highly polarized, with Republicans generally more optimistic about Trump's long-term success and Democrats more pessimistic. For instance, 65% of Republicans and Republican leaners believe Trump will be a successful president in the long run, while 80% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think he will be unsuccessful [3][5].\n\nTo visualize these trends, consider the following graphs.

About 72% of Democrats and Democratic leaners are at least somewhat confident in the fairness of Mueller’s investigation [7], whereas a larger share of Republicans and Republican leaners (58%) are not too or not at all confident in Mueller [7].

This gap has persisted over time, with Republicans consistently being more optimistic about job availability than Democrats [7].\n\nThe trend over time also shows a significant shift. In October 2017, 58% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats viewed jobs as widely available locally [2]. By the current period, these numbers have increased, indicating a more positive outlook across both parties, though the Republican perception remains higher [10]. The overall public's view of local job availability is the most positive it has been in decades, with 60% of adults now saying there are plenty of jobs available in their local community [3].\n\nHowever, despite the general optimism, there is a distinction between the availability of jobs and the availability of \"good jobs.\" While a majority of adults say there are plenty of jobs available, fewer believe that \"good jobs\" are widely available [4]. This sentiment is reflected in the data showing that 45% of the total population find \"good jobs\" difficult to find, with Republicans and Democrats differing in their perceptions [image1].\n\nThe long-term trend in job availability perceptions is illustrated in the graph, which shows that both Republicans and Democrats have become more positive over the years, with Republicans consistently leading in optimism [image2].

Eighty-two percent of Democrats view an inadequate federal response as a major reason for the continued outbreak, compared to only 21% of Republicans [5]. This disparity reflects the broader political narrative and trust issues surrounding federal leadership during the pandemic.\n\nOther major reasons cited include lifting restrictions too quickly, with 82% of Democrats and 31% of Republicans considering this a major factor [5]. The lack of timely testing and unclear instructions about preventing the spread are also mentioned, though with less consensus [image1].\n\nIn summary, political affiliations heavily influence perceptions of government responsibility and the reasons for the continued COVID-19 outbreak. Democrats are more likely to attribute the ongoing outbreak to insufficient adherence to guidelines, an inadequate federal response, and premature lifting of restrictions, while Republicans are more likely to place responsibility on state and local governments and are less likely to see these factors as major reasons for the continued spread."}

This stark difference highlights a significant partisan divide in perceptions of federal responsibility.\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to social distancing, there is a notable gap between Democrats and Republicans. While 90% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents consider insufficient adherence to social-distancing and mask-wearing guidelines as a major reason for the continued outbreak, only 57% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents share this view [7].

According to the data, a substantial share of Latino Democrats and Republicans believe there is a great deal of difference between what the parties stand for [1]. However, the specific efforts of each party to earn Latino votes are perceived differently.\n\nFor instance, among Latinos, immigrants, Spanish speakers, Catholics, and evangelicals, a notable percentage believe that Democrats work hard to earn their votes [2]. This is supported by the finding that similar shares of immigrants (44%), Spanish-dominant Latinos (48%), Catholics (42%), and evangelical Protestants (42%) say that the statement \"Democrats work hard to earn Latinos' votes\" describes their views very or extremely well [9]. ![{Similar shares of various Latino groups believe Democrats work hard to earn their votes}](image1)\n\nOn the other hand, relatively few Latinos say that Republicans try hard to earn their votes. Only about one-in-five Latinos (19%) agree with the statement that Republicans work hard to earn Latinos' votes [3]. This sentiment is particularly strong among Latino Democrats, where only 13% say the statement describes their views well, compared to 40% of Latino Republicans [3]. Among independent and non-partisan Latinos, the percentages are even lower, with only 13% of Democratic-leaning independents agreeing with the statement [3]. ![{Fewer Latinos believe Republicans work hard to earn their votes}](image5)\n\nThe data also show that age and education levels play a role in these perceptions. For example, smaller shares of immigrants (23%), Spanish-dominant Latinos (24%), evangelicals (27%), and older Latinos (ages 50 to 64 and 65 or older, both at 23%) believe that Republicans work hard to earn their votes [6]. ![{Older and Spanish-dominant Latinos are less likely to believe Republicans work hard to earn their votes}](image3)\n\nFurthermore, political ideology influences these perceptions. Among Latino Republicans and Republican leaners, conservatives (47%) are more likely to say that the statement \"Democrats work hard to earn people’s votes\" does not describe their views well [4].

Democrats are generally seen as making more concerted efforts to earn Latino votes, particularly among immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities, while Republicans face a more skeptical audience, especially among Democrats and younger, more educated Latinos.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of political parties' efforts to earn Latino votes vary widely among different demographic groups, indicating a need for both parties to tailor their outreach strategies to better connect with these diverse communities."}

For instance, several northbound trains during peak hours are running at over 100% capacity, with some as high as 158% [image4]. This overcrowding not only affects comfort but also reliability, as more frequent service can lead to stress at intersections and delays due to the remaining at-grade crossings [6].\n\nTo address these challenges, there is a need to expand capacity and improve infrastructure. This includes grade separations to reduce conflicts at intersections and additional funding to support the necessary upgrades in Santa Clara County [9]. Additionally, promoting alternative transportation methods such as transit passes, shuttles, and carpooling can help manage the increasing demand and reduce the strain on the system [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in weekday ridership in Mountain View and Palo Alto is directly contributing to the current capacity issues on Caltrain, highlighting the urgent need for infrastructure improvements and capacity expansion. ![Trains are operating well above seating capacity during peak hours](image4)"}

According to the data, the size of the bubble represents the total CO2 emissions from energy use in different sectors of the respective nations. The bigger the size of the bubble, the greater the CO2 emissions from a country [6]. This suggests that the USA, being a larger bubble, has higher CO2 emissions compared to China and Germany.\n\nNext, we consider the motor vehicle ownership. The percentage share in global motor vehicle demand provides insight into the number of vehicles in each country. The USA has a significant share in global motor vehicle demand, followed by China and Germany [3] ![Percentage Share in Global Motor Vehicles Demand](image3).\n\nAdditionally, the transportation sector accounts for a substantial portion of CO2 emissions. In the industrialized economies of the OECD, the transportation sector contributes to 30% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, it accounts for about 20% [4]. This highlights the significant impact of transportation on CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen we combine these pieces of information, it becomes evident that the USA has both higher CO2 emissions per capita and a larger share of motor vehicle ownership, which implies a greater environmental impact due to transportation. China, while having a large population and growing motor vehicle ownership, also has high CO2 emissions but may have lower per capita emissions compared to the USA. Germany, with a smaller population and a more regulated automotive market, has a moderate impact but still contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, indicating a more significant environmental impact, while China and Germany have varying degrees of impact based on their population and regulatory measures."}

According to the data, 40% of respondents have a television, 15.3% have a computer, and 12.3% have a radio in their household [image2]. This indicates that televisions are the most common device, followed by computers and radios.\n\nWhen it comes to technology usage outside the household, the data shows that 88% of respondents use their mobile phones, 10% use their office computer/laptop, and 2.4% use their home computer/laptop [10]. This highlights a significant preference for mobile phones over other devices when accessing technology outside the home.\n\nNow, let's examine the radio listening habits. The data indicates that 79% of respondents do not listen to the radio, citing reasons such as the radio being damaged, lack of time, and not having access to places where the radio is played [2], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, among those who do listen to the radio, 70% use a mobile phone, while 30% use a traditional radio [image3]. This suggests that mobile phones are increasingly becoming the primary device for radio listening, especially in urban areas.\n\nThe demographic breakdown further reveals that rural areas have a higher percentage of people who do not have any of the above devices (20%) compared to urban areas (10%) [image2]. This could explain why radio listening is less common in rural areas, as access to devices like mobile phones and radios is more limited.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference in technology usage is the dominance of mobile phones outside the household, whereas televisions are the most common device within the household. Radio listening habits are influenced by these technology preferences, with mobile phones playing a crucial role in accessing radio content, particularly among urban populations. ![Mobile phones are the primary device for radio listening outside the home.](image3)"}

For instance, Lojai.com, an Indonesian e-commerce website, recorded almost 20% of their sales coming from mobile devices in May 2014 [3]. Additionally, platforms like Tokobagus/OLX and Rakuten have seen substantial growth in mobile sales, with Tokobagus/OLX recording an 800% growth in their Android app in 2013 and Rakuten growing by 438% on mobile during April-December 2012 [3].\n\nMoreover, instant messaging (IM) is a primary method of communication for mobile users, with 90% using IM daily and 60% using it multiple times daily [8]. The top three IM applications installed are WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE, with LINE reporting 30 million users from Indonesia in September 2014 [8]. These IM platforms are not just used for communication but also for shopping, with 27% of e-commerce users preferring to shop through IM groups like BBM Group [8].\n\nThe types of products purchased online also reflect the mobile shopping behavior of Indonesian users. Online shopping data shows that shoes and bags are the most frequently purchased items, followed by watches and airline tickets [image1]. This aligns with the high usage of mobile devices for accessing e-commerce platforms and social media, where users can easily browse and purchase these items.\n\nAdditionally, the demographic breakdown of mobile internet users in Indonesia reveals that a significant portion of mobile internet users are businessmen or entrepreneurs, suggesting that mobile devices are not only used for personal shopping but also for business activities [image2].\n\nIn summary, the mobile internet usage activities in Indonesia, characterized by high social media engagement and frequent use of instant messaging, are closely tied to the growing trend of mobile shopping, with a significant portion of e-commerce transactions occurring through mobile devices."}

According to the data, the majority of mobile internet users fall into the age groups of 18-24 and 25-35, making up a significant portion of the user base [image3]. These younger users are more likely to engage with mobile content such as games, apps, music, and themes, which are among the most downloaded types of mobile content [image2].\n\nThis age demographic is also highly active on social media platforms. For instance, 92% of internet users in Indonesia own a Facebook account, and 60% of these users access it multiple times daily [5]. This high engagement with social media indicates a strong preference for interactive and community-driven content.\n\nMoreover, the business landscape is influenced by the fact that a quarter of mobile internet users are businessmen or entrepreneurs [image3]. This segment is likely to be interested in e-commerce and mobile advertising. The e-commerce sector is seeing significant growth, with platforms like Lojai.com reporting that nearly 20% of their sales come from mobile devices [9]. Additionally, mobile advertising is a burgeoning market, with Indonesia being the second-largest market for mobile ads after the US, recording 200 billion mobile ad impressions in 2012 [7].\n\nThe prevalence of instant messaging (IM) among mobile users further highlights the potential for business opportunities. With 90% of mobile users using IM daily and an average of 4.2 IM applications installed per device, platforms like WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE are key channels for reaching consumers [3]. These IM platforms are not only used for personal communication but also for e-commerce activities, with 27% of e-commerce users preferring to shop through IM groups [3].\n\nIn terms of payment methods, the predominantly prepaid market in Indonesia presents unique opportunities. Services like Coda Payments and Mimopay offer carrier billing solutions, allowing users to pay for goods and services using their mobile phone balance [image1]. This method is particularly useful for the unbanked population, which is significant in Indonesia.\n\nOverall, the demographics and content preferences of mobile internet users in Indonesia suggest a strong potential for businesses to capitalize on social media, e-commerce, mobile advertising, and innovative payment solutions.\n\nTo summarize, the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia, characterized by a young and entrepreneurial population, strongly influence their preferences for interactive content and social media, presenting significant business opportunities in e-commerce, mobile advertising, and payment solutions. ![A quarter of mobile internet users in Indonesia are businessmen or entrepreneurs, indicating a strong potential for e-commerce and mobile advertising.](image3)"}

The subscriber base grew, as indicated by the increase in the number of subscribers, while the ARPU saw a decline, particularly in voice and SMS segments.\n\nThe image showing the subscriber base and ARPU trends for Telkomsel and other operators provides a visual representation of these changes. The graph indicates a steady increase in the number of subscribers, while the ARPU for voice and SMS declined over the same period ![Subscriber growth and ARPU decline](image1).\n\nThe decline in ARPU can be attributed to several factors. One major factor is the shift towards data-based services like instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP), which led to a reduction in the usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [1]. Additionally, the government-initiated price wars played a significant role in reducing ARPU initially [3]. The competition among telecom operators, particularly between CDMA and GSM operators, also forced a reduction in tariffs, further contributing to the decline in ARPU [2].\n\nDespite the decline in voice and SMS ARPU, the increasing adoption of smartphones and the growing usage of mobile data services suggest that data ARPU will likely pick up in the future as users consume more data [7]. This trend is supported by the increasing number of smartphone users, particularly Android users, as shown in the image depicting the subscriber base and smartphone usage [4].\n\nIn conclusion, Telkomsel's subscriber base grew from 2013 to 2014, but its ARPU declined due to the shift towards data-based services and government-mandated price reductions."}

The graph in the image shows a clear upward trend in the number of smartphone users, particularly for Android devices, which surpassed BlackBerry users significantly by 2014 ![{Android users surpassed BlackBerry users significantly by 2014}](image3).\n\nIn terms of ARPU trends, the data indicates a shift from traditional voice and SMS services to data services. The ARPU for voice and SMS continued to decline, while the mobile data ARPU started to rise, albeit with some initial dips. This trend is evident in the graph showing the ARPU breakdown for 2013 to 2017, where the voice ARPU and SMS ARPU are shown to be decreasing, while the mobile data ARPU is on the rise ![{Voice and SMS ARPU are decreasing, while mobile data ARPU is rising}](image2).\n\nThese changes can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the widespread adoption of data-based instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP) services led to a reduction in the usage of traditional voice calls and SMS [4]. This shift towards data-based services contributed to the decline in voice and SMS ARPU [5].\n\nSecondly, the increasing penetration of smartphones, especially Android devices, facilitated greater data consumption. As more users adopted smartphones, they began to utilize data-intensive applications, leading to higher data usage and, eventually, higher data ARPU [2].\n\nAdditionally, the competitive landscape played a role. CDMA operators forced GSM operators to reduce their tariffs, contributing to the overall decline in ARPU [3]. However, with tariffs hitting rock-bottom, the likelihood of further price wars decreased, stabilizing the market to some extent [10].\n\nIn conclusion, the number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased significantly between 2013 and 2014, while the ARPU trends showed a decline in voice and SMS ARPU and a rise in mobile data ARPU, influenced by the adoption of data-based services and the increasing penetration of smartphones."}

The image showing the distribution of total activity for rock music indicates that while album sales (both physical and digital) make up a substantial portion, streaming accounts for 82% of the total activity [image1]. This suggests that even in a genre traditionally driven by catalog, streaming is becoming increasingly important.\n\nIn pop music, the trend is even more pronounced. The same image shows that streaming makes up a large percentage of total activity, indicating that pop music fans are heavily reliant on streaming services. This aligns with the statement that pop is mainly driven by current releases, which are often more accessible through streaming platforms [3].\n\nR&B/Hip-Hop also shows a strong preference for streaming. The image depicting the breakdown of total activity for R&B/Hip-Hop indicates that streaming accounts for a significant portion, similar to rock and pop. This is consistent with the observation that hip-hop fans are more likely to spend on music and attend live events, suggesting a high level of engagement with the genre [7].\n\nCountry music, while having a slightly different demographic makeup, also shows a strong streaming presence. The image showing the distribution of total activity for country music indicates that streaming makes up 70% of the total activity [image5].

This suggests that developers need to consider backward compatibility when developing apps for the Android platform.\n\nIn conclusion, the Google Play Store has a larger number of apps compared to the Apple App Store, and Android holds a significant market share among mobile operating systems."}

According to the data, Android has consistently held a larger market share compared to iOS and other platforms like Windows Phone and Blackberry [2].\n\nThe chart in image2 shows the market share trends over the years, indicating that Android has maintained a dominant position, with a steady increase in its market share from 2012 to 2015 [image2]. In contrast, iOS has had a stable but slightly lower market share, while Windows Phone and Blackberry have seen a decline.\n\nIn terms of the number of apps available in the respective app stores, the Google Play Store has seen substantial growth. The number of apps in the Google Play Store grew by more than 50% in the last year, reaching over 1.6 million apps [3]. This is a significant difference compared to Apple's App Store, which has around 1.5 million apps, a difference of about 17% [3]. The growth trend is also evident in image4, which shows the increasing number of apps in the Google Play Store from 2012 to 2015 [image4].\n\nDespite the larger number of apps in the Google Play Store, the revenue generated from app resales and mobile e-commerce is substantial across all platforms. In 2015, app resales were projected to generate $45.37 billion in revenues, and mobile e-commerce was expected to account for $300 billion in sales [5]. This indicates that while the number of apps is an important metric, the quality and user engagement of these apps also play a crucial role in generating revenue [5].\n\nIn conclusion, Android has a larger market share and a significantly higher number of apps in its app store compared to iOS, reflecting its dominance in the mobile operating system market from 2012 to 2015. ![Android has a larger market share and more apps in its app store compared to iOS from 2012 to 2015.](image2)"}

This growth is reflected in the revenue trends as well.\n\nThe revenue generated by mobile apps has been on a steady rise, with a notable increase from 2011 to 2015. In 2011, the revenue was around $8.32 billion, and by 2015, it had grown to $45.37 billion ![Revenue growth from 2011 to 2015](image1). This substantial increase in revenue aligns with the growth in the number of apps, particularly in the Google Play Store, which has seen a consistent upward trend ![Google Play Store growth](image2).\n\nAdditionally, the adoption rates of new operating systems like iOS 9, which saw rapid adoption with over 50% of devices using it by September 2015 [7], contribute to the overall growth in the app ecosystem. This rapid adoption of new technologies and platforms encourages developers to create more apps, further driving the revenue growth.\n\nIn summary, the significant increase in the number of mobile apps available in app stores, especially in the Google Play Store, is closely tied to the substantial revenue growth in the mobile app industry from 2011 to 2015."}

Unlike traditional VQA datasets, which often have a narrow range of entity categories and a prevalence of simplistic yes/no questions, SnapNTell includes a wide array of categorized entities, each supported by representative images and explicit entity mentions in the answers.\n\nFor instance, the SnapNTell dataset encompasses 22 major categories, such as landmarks, paintings, sculptures, food, fruits, vegetables, mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, celebrities, instruments, plants, electronics, tools, transportation, sports, books, household items, and cars. This diverse set of categories ensures a comprehensive representation of real-world entities [3]. The dataset contains 7,568 unique entities, each with 10 illustrative images, and 75,680 knowledge-intensive QA pairs [5].\n\nIn comparison, other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, while incorporating entity-level knowledge, fall short in terms of the variety of categories and the number of distinct entities. ViQuAE, for example, covers only 3 categories with 2,400 unique entities, and Encyclopedic VQA covers 12 categories with 5,750 unique entities [5]. Additionally, the average answer length in SnapNTell is notably longer, reflecting the depth of knowledge required for accurate responses [5].\n\nTo further illustrate the differences, consider the following table summarizing the key features of various VQA datasets:\n\n| Dataset            | Categories | Unique Entities | QA Pairs | Images | Average Ans Length | Number of Images/Entity | Anonymity |\n|--------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| ViQuAE             | 3          | 2,400           | 3,700    | 3,300  | 1.8                | x                       | x         |\n| Encyclopedic VQA   | 12         | 5,750           | 5,750    | 32     | x                  | x                       | x         |\n| SnapNTell (Ours)   | 22         | 7,568           | 75,680   | 75,680 | 10                 | v                       |           |\n\nThis table clearly shows that SnapNTell excels in the number of categories, unique entities, and the depth of knowledge required for its QA pairs [5]. The inclusion of 10 images per entity and the requirement for detailed, entity-specific knowledge in the answers make SnapNTell a robust benchmark for evaluating models' capabilities in recognizing and understanding long-tail entities [6].\n\nIn conclusion, the SnapNTell dataset is uniquely designed to address the gaps in existing VQA datasets by focusing on a wide range of fine-grained entities and requiring knowledge-intensive responses, making it a valuable resource for advancing VQA research. ![{SnapNTell includes 22 categories with 7,568 unique entities and 10 images per entity}](image5)"}

For example, training the Transformer (big) model with neural architecture search can emit up to 626,155 pounds of CO₂ [image4]. This is significantly higher than the emissions from a single trans-American flight or even the annual emissions of an average American.\n\nAdditionally, the table in the image shows that training models like BERT on a TPUv2x16 setup can emit around 1515.43 pounds of CO₂, which is comparable to multiple trans-American flights [image2].\n\nTherefore, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models are often much higher than those from common everyday activities, underscoring the need for more sustainable practices in the field of NLP research and development.\n\nTo summarize, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models are significantly higher than those from typical everyday activities, highlighting the environmental impact of such computational tasks. ![Training NLP models can emit CO₂ equivalent to multiple trans-American flights](image2)"}

According to the ablation study presented in the text, the use of positional encodings plays a crucial role in the model's performance.\n\nIn Table 3 [1], the results show that not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, indicating the importance of these encodings in the model's ability to detect objects accurately. Specifically, removing spatial positional encodings entirely results in a substantial 7.8 AP drop compared to the baseline. However, when fixed sine spatial positional encodings are passed at the input and output positional encodings are added once, the AP drops by only 1.4 compared to the baseline where positional encodings are added directly in the attention layers.\n\nInterestingly, passing fixed sine spatial positional encodings and output positional encodings at the input of the decoder results in a 1.4 AP drop [7]. On the other hand, using learned spatial encodings passed to the attentions gives similar results to the baseline, suggesting that the model can adapt to learned encodings effectively.\n\nThe configuration that achieves the best performance is the one where fixed sine spatial positional encodings and learned output positional encodings are passed at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder, achieving an AP of 40.6 [7].\n\nAdditionally, the transformer architecture used in DETR, as detailed in Figure 10 [5], shows how positional encodings are integrated into the model. The image features from the CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder along with spatial positional encodings, which are added to queries and keys at every multi-head self-attention layer. The decoder then receives queries, output positional encodings (object queries), and encoder memory to produce the final set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes.\n\nTo summarize, the best configuration for the DETR-DC5 model involves using fixed sine spatial positional encodings and learned output positional encodings, passed at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder, resulting in the highest AP of 40.6. ![Best AP configuration with fixed sine and learned encodings](image4)"}

Specifically, for 2-hop claims, ProgramFC achieves an F1 score of 75.65% with the smallest model size (80M parameters), while FLAN-T5 scores 76.11% with the same size.

This trend continues as the model size increases, with ProgramFC maintaining a higher performance relative to FLAN-T5, especially for more complex claims [3][8].\n\nMoreover, the retrieval performance of ProgramFC is notably better than one-step retrieval methods.

When comparing ProgramFC with other models, such as FLAN-T5, the performance differences become evident, especially as the complexity of the tasks increases.\n\nFor instance, the performance of ProgramFC is particularly strong when the underlying language model is small. According to the data, ProgramFC using FLAN-T5-small (80M parameters) can achieve comparable performance to the much larger FLAN-T5-XXL (11B parameters) for 4-hop claims [1]. This is significant because smaller models typically struggle with complex reasoning tasks, but the high-level reasoning plan provided by ProgramFC helps mitigate this issue.\n\nTo visualize this, consider the performance metrics across different model sizes and task complexities. The graph in Figure 3 shows that ProgramFC maintains a relatively stable performance even with smaller models, whereas the performance of FLAN-T5 drops significantly as the model size decreases [3].\n\n![{ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5 with smaller models and maintains performance across different task complexities.}](image3)\n\nAdditionally, ProgramFC excels in iterative retrieval tasks, which are crucial for complex fact-checking. The recall of gold paragraphs for the top-10 retrieved paragraphs is notably higher for ProgramFC compared to one-step retrieval methods, with the largest improvement seen on the HOVER 4-hop dataset (37.1%) [5].

Error analysis reveals specific trends in the types of errors that occur. For 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims, the proportion of semantic errors increases with the complexity of the claims, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent in 4-hop claims [8]. Specifically, the data shows that 71% of the errors in 4-hop claims are semantic, with 57% being structural errors [1].\n\n![{As the complexity of claims increases, the proportion of semantic errors, particularly structural errors, also increases.}](image1)\n\nThese error trends highlight the difficulty of generating appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for claims that require long-chain reasoning. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the robustness and reliability of ProgramFC in real-world applications [6].\n\nIn conclusion, ProgramFC offers a compelling approach to fact-checking by combining the interpretability of symbolic programs with the flexibility of neural models.

Grounding errors, which account for the largest proportion, indicate the difficulty in accurately referencing specific cells. Ambiguity errors highlight the complexity of scientific claims, which often contain vague or ambiguous language. Calculation and program errors further emphasize the need for precise numerical reasoning and program correctness.\n\nThe relationship between these reasoning types and error types can be seen in the following ways:\n\n- **Simple lookup and Comparison**: These basic operations are essential but can lead to grounding and ambiguity errors if not correctly implemented.\n- **Closed-domain and Open-domain knowledge**: These types of knowledge are crucial for accurate fact-checking but can introduce ambiguity and grounding errors if the context is not well understood.\n- **Commonsense knowledge**: While important, it can also introduce ambiguity if the model lacks the necessary background information.\n\nTo illustrate the distribution of reasoning steps, see the following chart:\n![{Reasoning steps distribution}](image1)\n\nThis chart shows the frequency of different reasoning steps, emphasizing the dominance of simple lookups and comparisons. The high proportion of grounding errors (50%) aligns with the complexity of accurately referencing specific cells, as shown in the error analysis:\n![{Error types and proportions}](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the main reasoning types in the ScITab dataset are diverse and include simple lookups, comparisons, and various forms of knowledge extraction. The common error types, particularly grounding and ambiguity errors, reflect the challenges in accurately performing these reasoning steps."}

These errors highlight the challenges in verifying scientific claims, especially when dealing with numerical and approximate data [8]. ![{Refuted claims in ScITaB are diverse, with common errors including incorrect calculations and approximations.}](image4)\n\nFor NEI claims, the main reasons are insufficient evidence in the table (33.3%), lack of open-domain knowledge (25.0%), and lack of closed-domain knowledge (15.0%).

According to the data, InstructGPT achieves an F1 score of 41.41, while GPT-4 scores much higher at 64.80 [1]. This indicates that GPT-4 outperforms InstructGPT substantially in this task.\n\nTo understand the reasons behind these performance differences, we need to examine the types of errors each model makes. The confusion matrices for both models reveal distinct patterns in their misclassifications [10].\n\nFor InstructGPT, the confusion matrix shows that it often classifies supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information). This suggests that InstructGPT struggles with confidently determining the verifiability of claims, leading to a high rate of NEI predictions. This pattern of \"less confident\" behavior can be seen in the confusion matrix, where a significant portion of supported and refuted claims are misclassified as NEI [10].\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, frequently misclassifying NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This overconfidence can lead to more severe errors, as it incorrectly asserts the verifiability of claims that lack sufficient evidence [10].\n\nAdditionally, the error analysis for GPT-4 provides further insights into the types of errors it makes. The primary categories of errors are grounding errors (50%), ambiguity errors (22%), calculation errors (20%), and program errors (8%) [image4]. Grounding errors occur when the model incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, which is a significant challenge in the S CI T AB dataset [9]. Ambiguity errors arise when the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the model fails to represent accurately. Calculation errors involve incorrect arithmetic operations, and program errors include issues like incorrect or missing arguments/variables.\n\nThese error types highlight the unique challenges in the S CI T AB dataset, such as accurately referencing specific cells and handling ambiguous claims [9]. The higher proportion of grounding and ambiguity errors in GPT-4's performance underscores the complexity of the task and the need for more sophisticated methods to address these issues.\n\nIn conclusion, GPT-4 outperforms InstructGPT in the zero-shot 3-class classification task due to its stronger reasoning capabilities and fewer NEI misclassifications, but it still faces significant challenges with grounding and ambiguity in the claims. ![Error Types in GPT-4](image4)"}

According to the data, InstructGPT achieves a macro-F1 score of 41.41 in the 3-class setting, while GPT-4 scores 64.80 [7]. This significant difference suggests that GPT-4 outperforms InstructGPT by a considerable margin, indicating that GPT-4 is more accurate overall in classifying scientific claims into supported, refuted, and not enough information (NEI) categories.\n\nTo understand the error types and tendencies, we can look at the confusion matrices for both models [6]. The confusion matrix for InstructGPT shows a pattern of \"less confident\" behavior, where it frequently classifies supported and refuted claims as 'NEI'. This is evident from the higher proportion of supported and refuted claims being misclassified as NEI [6].\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, often incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This is reflected in the confusion matrix for GPT-4, where there is a notable shift towards misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted [6].\n\nThese tendencies can be further understood by examining the specific reasons for errors. For InstructGPT, the frequent misclassification of supported and refuted claims as NEI suggests that it struggles with the confidence needed to make definitive classifications. This is likely due to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between verifiable and non-verifiable claims, as noted in the error analysis [8].\n\nFor GPT-4, the overconfidence in classifying NEI claims as supported or refuted indicates a different set of challenges. GPT-4 may have a stronger capability to perform complex reasoning, but it might lack the nuanced understanding required to recognize when there is insufficient evidence to support or refute a claim. This overconfidence can lead to more false positives in the supported and refuted categories [7].\n\nIn summary, InstructGPT tends to be less confident and frequently classifies claims as NEI, while GPT-4 is overconfident and often misclassifies NEI claims as supported or refuted. These differences highlight the need for further refinement in handling the NEI class, particularly in terms of improving confidence and accuracy in scientific fact-checking tasks.\n\n![{InstructGPT and GPT-4 have distinct error tendencies in the zero-shot 3-class setting, with InstructGPT being less confident and GPT-4 being overconfident.}](image2)"}

According to the confusion matrices presented in Figure 4, InstructGPT often exhibits a pattern of \"less confident\" behavior, frequently misclassifying supported and refuted claims as NEI [5]. This tendency suggests that InstructGPT struggles with determining whether there is sufficient evidence to verify or refute a claim, leading it to default to the NEI category more often than necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-4 displays a contrasting issue of \"overconfidence,\" incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted [5]. This overconfidence indicates that GPT-4 is more likely to assert a definitive stance on the verifiability of a claim, even when the evidence is insufficient. This behavior can be problematic, as it may lead to incorrect conclusions and undermine the reliability of the model's classifications.\n\nTo further understand these challenges, we can look at the error analysis provided in Table 5, which categorizes the errors into four main types: grounding errors, ambiguity errors, calculation errors, and program errors [3]. Grounding errors, where the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table, and ambiguity errors, where the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the program fails to represent, are particularly prevalent in the S CI T AB dataset [3]. These errors highlight the difficulty in accurately referencing specific cells and handling the ambiguous nature of scientific claims, which are unique challenges in this dataset.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of labels for InstructGPT and GPT-4 provides insights into their respective behaviors. InstructGPT's label distribution shows a higher percentage of NEI predictions, reflecting its cautious approach [image5]. Conversely, GPT-4's label distribution indicates a higher proportion of supported and refuted predictions, aligning with its overconfident tendencies [image5].\n\nIn summary, the main challenges faced by InstructGPT and GPT-4 in accurately classifying NEI claims are rooted in their differing approaches to uncertainty. InstructGPT tends to be less confident and defaults to NEI more frequently, while GPT-4 is overconfident and incorrectly categorizes NEI claims as supported or refuted. These challenges underscore the need for improved methods to handle ambiguity and grounding in scientific fact-checking tasks."}

Notably, GPT-J demonstrates a more pronounced acceleration effect, especially in the AGNews and EmoC datasets, indicating its greater potential for efficient inference in larger models [3].\n\nRegarding the classification accuracies, the confusion matrices provide valuable insights. Image 4 shows the confusion matrix for the TREC dataset, where the model's confusion scores are visualized. The matrix reveals that the model often confuses the \"Description\" and \"Entity\" categories, as indicated by the high similarity scores (0.95 and 0.98). This suggests that the model has difficulty distinguishing between these categories, which can lead to higher error rates in classification tasks [9]. \n\nAdditionally, the performance metrics for different methods, including vanilla in-context learning and anchor re-weighting, are summarized in Image 1. For the TREC dataset, vanilla in-context learning with 1-shot per class achieves an accuracy of 57.56%, while anchor re-weighting improves this to 60.92%. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the anchor re-weighting method in enhancing the model's accuracy [1].\n\nOverall, the confusion matrices and performance metrics indicate that while GPT2-XL and GPT-J models perform well in some datasets, they struggle with specific category distinctions, particularly in the TREC dataset. The anchor re-weighting method offers a promising approach to mitigate these issues and improve classification accuracy.\n\nThe performance metrics of GPT2-XL and GPT-J models vary across different datasets, with GPT-J showing more significant speed-up ratios and the confusion matrices revealing specific category confusions that impact classification accuracy. ![The confusion matrix for the TREC dataset shows high similarity scores between \"Description\" and \"Entity\" categories.](image4)"}

The Llama 2-Chat models were fine-tuned with a focus on safety, incorporating safety-specific data annotation and tuning, as well as red-teaming and iterative evaluations [2]. The training process also included robust data cleaning, updated data mixes, and the use of grouped-query attention (GQA) to improve inference scalability [5][6].\n\nAdditionally, the models were trained on 40% more total tokens and had their context length doubled, which helps in handling longer and more complex conversations safely [5][6]. The use of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is also crucial, as it ensures that the models align with human preferences for safety and helpfulness ![{Human preference data is used to train the reward models for RLHF}](image1).\n\nIn multi-turn conversations, which are generally more challenging and prone to inducing unsafe responses, Llama 2-Chat models still perform well compared to baselines [7].

As seen in the graph, the recall remains relatively stable at about 15, regardless of the number of absent knowledge elements. This suggests that current LLMs have a limited ability to identify absent knowledge. However, precision and F1-Score exhibit a clear upward trend, showing that with more absent knowledge, the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting enables the generated outputs to locate absent knowledge more accurately [5]. ![The recall is stable, while precision and F1-Score increase as more knowledge is removed.](image3)\n\nIn the context of retrieval analysis, the results show a clear downward trend in all metrics as retrieval accuracy drops.

Specifically, the addition of relevant logic can lead to better micro-F1 scores and reduced logical inconsistency (LI) [3]. However, the effectiveness of these constraints varies depending on the number of demonstration samples used [7].\n\nLet's look at the data from the tables and figures:\n\n### MAVEN-ERE Dataset\nIn the table from `image1`, we can see the performance of various models on the MAVEN-ERE dataset. For instance, the RoBERTa-Large model with one-shot learning has a micro-F1 score of 17.4% and a logical inconsistency (LI) of 54.8%. When logical constraints are added, the performance improves significantly. For example, the model using CoT with logical constraints achieves a micro-F1 score of 25.3% and an LI of 37.9%, which is a substantial improvement over the vanilla ICL with CoT (micro-F1: 18.8%, LI: 49.3%).\n\n![{Adding logical constraints significantly improves micro-F1 and reduces logical inconsistency.}](image1)\n\n### Causal-TimeBank Dataset\nSimilarly, on the Causal-TimeBank dataset, the addition of logical constraints also leads to better performance. The vanilla ICL model has a micro-F1 score of 19.0% and an LI of 54.0%. When logical constraints are added, the micro-F1 score increases to 27.0% and the LI decreases to 12.8%.\n\n### Number of Demonstration Samples\nThe figure from `image4` shows the impact of the number of demonstration samples on the performance of models. As the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement in micro-F1 scores. However, beyond 5 demonstrations, the improvements become marginal. This suggests that while more demonstrations can help, there is a point of diminishing returns.\n\n![{Increasing the number of demonstrations improves performance, but the gains diminish after 5 samples.}](image4)\n\n### Post-Processing and Retrieved Logical Constraints\nThe table from `image3` provides additional insights. For example, using all logical constraints with the model results in a micro-F1 score of 27.0% and an LI of 25.6% on the MAVEN-ERE dataset. When retrieved logical constraints are used, the micro-F1 score is slightly lower (27.8%) but the LI is higher (30.8%).

Adding relevant logical constraints improves micro-F1 scores and reduces logical inconsistency, while increasing the number of demonstration samples up to a certain point (around 5) also enhances performance. However, the gains from additional demonstrations beyond this point are minimal. Post-processing can eliminate logical inconsistencies but may come at the cost of lower micro-F1 scores."}

Specifically, adding logical constraints provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations [2]. Moreover, the performance of incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass that of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations [2].\n\nIn contrast, post-processing techniques, while guaranteeing the absence of logical conflicts, can severely affect the quality of the generated answers. This is because the semantics of the post-processed answers may deviate from the ground truth, and the size of the candidate set for each case can also impact performance [8].\n\nLet's examine the image data for a more detailed comparison:\n\n### MAVEN-ERE Dataset\n- **Vanilla ICL**: Micro-F1 = 15.3%, LI = 21.2%\n- **Vanilla ICL w.

For instance, tasks may involve applying advanced concepts like Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory to derive solutions [1]. This level of complexity is not typically found in other benchmarks, which generally require only basic visual perception and simple reasoning [8].\n\nOne of the unique features of MMMU is its diverse use of image formats. The benchmark includes a wide range of image types, such as diagrams, tables, plots and charts, photographs, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, sheet music, geometric shapes, pathology images, microscopic images, comics, and more [1, 7]. This diversity tests the perceptual capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) and ensures they can handle various types of visual data effectively [4].\n\nAdditionally, MMMU features interleaved text and image inputs, where models need to jointly understand both the text and images.

Naive RAG, as described, follows a straightforward \"Retrieve-Read\" framework that includes indexing, retrieval, and generation [7]. However, it faces several limitations, such as inefficiencies in indexing and retrieval processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance.\n\nAdvanced RAG addresses these limitations by introducing several optimizations and strategies. For instance, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval techniques to enhance retrieval quality. Specifically, Advanced RAG refines indexing techniques through methods like the sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata [1]. These improvements ensure that the retrieval process is more efficient and accurate, leading to better-quality information being fed into the generation stage.\n\n![{Advanced RAG refines indexing and retrieval techniques to enhance performance}](image3)\n\nMoreover, Advanced RAG incorporates various optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process, making it faster and more reliable [1]. These optimizations are crucial for handling large datasets and ensuring that the system can scale effectively.\n\nBuilding upon the advancements of Advanced RAG, Modular RAG takes the concept even further by introducing a highly flexible and adaptable framework. Modular RAG adds specialized components to enhance retrieval and processing capabilities. For example, the Search module enables direct searches across various data sources, while the RAG-Fusion module uses a multi-query strategy to expand user queries and uncover both explicit and transformative knowledge [6].\n\n![{Modular RAG introduces specialized components to enhance retrieval and processing capabilities}](image5)\n\nAdditionally, the Memory module leverages the LLM's memory to guide retrieval, creating an unbounded memory pool that aligns the text more closely with data distribution through iterative self-enhancement [6]. The Routing module navigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal pathway for a query, and the Predict module reduces redundancy and noise by generating context directly through the LLM [6].\n\nIn summary, Advanced RAG improves upon Naive RAG by refining indexing and retrieval techniques, while Modular RAG enhances retrieval-augmented generation by introducing specialized modules that address specific challenges and improve overall system performance."}

Figure 3 illustrates that the collapsed tree method, especially when using a maximum of 2000 tokens, achieves higher performance across different top-sizes and token numbers [10]. This is likely because the collapsed tree retrieval offers greater flexibility by searching through all nodes simultaneously, allowing it to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, unlike tree traversal, which maintains a constant ratio of thematic information to granular details [10].\n\nMoreover, RAPTOR with the collapsed tree method outperforms DPR across multiple language models. Table 3 shows that RAPTOR’s F-1 Match scores are 53.1%, 55.7%, and 36.6% when using GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA, respectively, surpassing DPR by margins of 1.8, 2.7, and 4.5 points [2]. This indicates that RAPTOR's hierarchical tree structure and summarization techniques are more effective in synthesizing information, especially for complex tasks like QASPER, which requires synthesizing information within NLP papers [2].\n\nAdditionally, the performance of RAPTOR with the collapsed tree method extends beyond F-1 scores.

The same pattern holds for BM25 and DPR, indicating that RAPTOR significantly enhances the performance of these retrieval methods across multiple metrics.\n\nThe impact of context length on the tree traversal and collapsed tree methods is also notable. The collapsed tree method, which retrieves a fixed number of tokens, ensures that the context does not exceed model constraints while maintaining high performance. As shown in the table, the collapsed tree method with 2000 maximum tokens retrieves the top-20 nodes, providing a balanced and flexible approach [6]. This method outperforms traditional traversal methods, especially in handling longer contexts effectively.\n\nTo illustrate, the collapsed tree method maintains high F-1 scores even as the context length increases. For example, the F-1 score for the collapsed tree method remains stable around 57.9% when querying different layers of the tree, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency [3]. This is particularly evident when comparing it to the traditional traversal method, which may struggle with longer contexts and may not capture the necessary information as effectively [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the RAPTOR model significantly enhances performance across various evaluation metrics when used with different retrieval methods, and the collapsed tree method ensures efficient and effective context retrieval, even with longer texts. ![The collapsed tree method maintains high F-1 scores across different context lengths and layers of the tree.](image2)"}

This structure enables RAPTOR to handle thematic or multi-hop queries more effectively, as hypothesized in the examination of each layer's contribution to retrieval capabilities [3].

According to the data, the Chameleon 7B model has a safety performance of 99.2% safe, 0.4% unsafe, and 0.4% unsure, while the Chameleon 34B model has a safety performance of 99.7% safe, 0.1% unsafe, and 0.2% unsure [4].

Initially, the system extracts image embeddings \\( e_{\\mathrm{img}} \\) using a visual encoder, which is part of the multimodal retriever [10]. This step is crucial for capturing the features of the objects within the image.\n\nFor object detection datasets, the system applies additional preprocessing steps to enhance the quality of the embeddings. Specifically, it crops the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizes the cropped regions to a fixed proportion [8]. This ensures that the objects of interest are standardized in size and position, making them easier to analyze.\n\nTo further assist the MLLMs in understanding the objects, the system employs a blurring technique on the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest [8]. This blurring strategy helps to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, improving their identification accuracy.\n\nOnce the image embeddings are prepared, the system retrieves the top- \\( k \\) category information with the highest similarity using the multimodal retriever [6]. This retrieval process leverages the pre-stored multimodal embeddings and index construction techniques to quickly and accurately find the most relevant categories [3].\n\nFinally, the retrieved category labels and the image embedding are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [5]. The MLLMs combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to rank and make the final predictions [5]. This ranking process ensures that the system can handle a wide variety of images and categories with high precision and flexibility.\n\nTo illustrate this process, consider the example shown in the image where the system retrieves and ranks categories for different bounding boxes in an image `![{The system retrieves and ranks categories for different bounding boxes in an image}](image4)`. This example demonstrates how the system effectively processes and ranks objects in detection datasets, ensuring accurate and contextually aware classification predictions.\n\nIn conclusion, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by extracting and preprocessing image embeddings, retrieving top- \\( k \\) category information, and using MLLMs to rank and predict the final categories."}

The enhanced performance across multiple metrics underscores the necessity and effectiveness of the entity detection step in the SnapNTell model.\n\nTo further illustrate the impact, consider the following comparison of performance metrics with and without entity detection:\n\n| Metric     | Without ED | With ED |\n|------------|------------|----------|\n| ROUGE      | 28.02      | 35.28    |\n| BLEU       | 3.73       | 7.81     |\n| METEOR     | 26.26      | 29.27    |\n| BLEURT     | 0.45       | 0.55     |\n\nThese results are visually represented in the following chart, which clearly demonstrates the significant performance gains achieved with the inclusion of entity detection:\n![Entity detection significantly improves performance across all metrics](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of entity detection (ED) in the SnapNTell model leads to a substantial improvement in performance across various evaluation metrics, highlighting its importance in enhancing the model's capabilities."}

Table 4, as mentioned in the text, reveals that both ROUGE and BLEURT scores are particularly significant in evaluating model performance in a way that aligns closely with human judgment [4]. This is supported by the data in the image, which shows the performance of different methods on the SnapNTell dataset in terms of ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BLEURT [image5]. The results indicate that the proposed method, LLaVA 1.5, outperforms other models with higher scores across these metrics, especially in BLEURT, which is known for its alignment with human judgment.\n\nAdditionally, the ablation study comparing the performance with and without the entity detection (ED) component shows a significant improvement when ED is included [6]. This is evident in the image, where the model with ED has notably higher scores in ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BLEURT compared to the model without ED [image6].\n\nNow, let's consider the human evaluation results. The human evaluation process was conducted by a panel of five judges, who assessed the quality of the answers based on three key aspects: accuracy, coherence, and informativeness [8]. The text mentions that although the proposed method often neared human-level performance, it did not consistently outperform human annotations, indicating areas for further improvement [2].\n\nThe image also provides a breakdown of accuracy and hallucination rates for different entity types (head, torso, tail) with and without retrieval augmentation (RA) [image2]. The results show that retrieval augmentation significantly improves accuracy and reduces hallucination rates, particularly for tail entities, which are the most challenging due to their low frequency and potential for inaccuracies.\n\nIn conclusion, the SnapNTell method outperforms other methods in terms of evaluation metrics, especially in ROUGE and BLEURT, which align well with human judgment. Human evaluation results also show promising performance, though there is still room for improvement, particularly in consistently matching human-level performance. ![The proposed method outperforms other models in evaluation metrics and shows significant improvements with retrieval augmentation.](image5)"}

The t-SNE projection reveals that SPECTER's embeddings are more compact and better at separating different topics. For example, Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science are closely grouped together, reflecting their cross-topic relatedness.

The results in [2] and [4] show that down-sampling negative examples to create a balanced dataset (269,165 examples, 50% positive, 50% negative) leads to better performance compared to the original dataset. However, augmenting the dataset with additional positive and negative examples (458,477 examples, 50% positive, 50% negative) further improves performance. The results in [4] also indicate that removing negative examples (-negative) results in inferior performance due to the reduced number of training data.\n\n![{Augmentation techniques significantly affect BERT performance, with balanced datasets yielding the best results}](image1)\n\nFor the sentiment classification tasks (SST-2 and SST-5), the results in [3] and [8] show that the proposed dice loss (DSC) is not as effective. BERT with cross-entropy (CE) achieves the highest accuracy on both SST-2 (94.90) and SST-5 (55.57). DSC and DL perform slightly worse, with DSC achieving 94.84 on SST-2 and 55.19 on SST-5. This suggests that DSC is not suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification.\n\n![{DSC performs worse on accuracy-oriented tasks like SST-2 and SST-5}](image4)\n\nFinally, the results on the MRPC and QQP datasets, as shown in [5], demonstrate that DSC also outperforms other methods. For MRPC, BERT+DSC achieves 88.92 F1, which is a significant improvement over BERT (88.0 F1) and other configurations. Similarly, for QQP, BERT+DSC achieves 92.11 F1, outperforming BERT (91.3 F1) and other configurations.\n\n![{DSC outperforms other methods on MRPC and QQP datasets}](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed DSC loss consistently outperforms other methods on MRC tasks and tasks where F1 score is the primary metric, but it is less effective on accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification."}

According to the data, DS-Picklist achieves a joint accuracy of 53.30% on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, while DS-DST reaches 51.21% [4]. This improvement is notable and highlights the effectiveness of DS-Picklist when a full ontology is available, allowing it to leverage candidate-value lists for better predictions [1].\n\nWhen it comes to slot accuracy, the differences become more nuanced. The slot-level accuracy on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set reveals that DS-Picklist and DS-DST show varying degrees of improvement over DS-Span, especially for certain slot categories [10]. For instance, slots like `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` see significant improvements. DS-Picklist, in particular, excels in these categories, demonstrating its strength in handling categorical slots where values can be directly predicted from candidate-value lists [3].\n\nFor example, the slot `hotel-internet` sees a substantial improvement from DS-Span's 92.98% to DS-Picklist's 97.48%, a gain of 4.50% [10]. Similarly, `hotel-parking` improves from 93.42% to 97.18%, a gain of 3.76% [10]. These gains are consistent with the findings that categorical slots benefit more from the picklist approach, as their values often have different expressions and are not easily extracted from the dialog context [4].\n\nOn the other hand, non-categorical slots, such as `taxi-leaveat` and `train-arriveby`, which are typically span-based, show less improvement. This is because these slots often lack span matches in the dialog context, making it challenging for span-based methods to extract the correct values [4]. ![DS-Picklist outperforms DS-DST in joint accuracy and specific slot categories](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, DS-Picklist generally outperforms DS-DST in joint accuracy and slot accuracy, particularly for categorical slots, due to its ability to utilize candidate-value lists effectively."}

The table shows significant improvements for certain slots when using DS-DST and DS-Picklist over DS-Span.

Specifically, `hotel-internet` and `hotel-parking` have improvements of +4.50% and +3.76% respectively for DS-DST, and +4.28% and +3.57% for DS-Picklist [7].\n\nThe image also provides a visual comparison of the slot-level accuracies for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist.

The STOP baseline has a high stop distance of 15.37 and a low task completion rate of 8.20%, indicating that simply stopping immediately results in poor performance [4]. The RANDOM WALK and MOST FREQUENT baselines also perform poorly, with stop distances of 14.80 and 19.31, respectively, and task completion rates of 9.66% and 2.94% [4]. More sophisticated methods like MISRA 17 and CHAPLOT 18 show improvements, with stop distances of 10.54 and 9.05, and task completion rates of 22.9% and 31.0%, respectively [4]. Our approach further improves these metrics, achieving a stop distance of 8.65 and a task completion rate of 35.72% [4].\n\nOn the other hand, the CHAI dataset focuses on stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA). The STOP baseline again performs poorly with a stop distance of 2.99 and a manipulation accuracy of 37.53% [4]. The RANDOM WALK and MOST FREQUENT baselines have similar stop distances but lower manipulation accuracies [4]. The more advanced methods like MISRA 17 and CHAPLOT 18 also struggle, with CHAPLOT 18 showing a slight improvement in manipulation accuracy but no change in stop distance [4]. Our approach achieves a stop distance of 2.75 and a manipulation accuracy of 37.53%, which is a modest improvement over the baselines [4].\n\nThese differences are further illustrated by the dataset statistics. The LANI dataset has 6,000 paragraphs with an average of 4.7 instructions per paragraph, while the CHAI dataset has 1,596 paragraphs with an average of 7.7 instructions per paragraph [image1]. This indicates that CHAI instructions are more complex, involving more steps and actions [image1]. The mean actions per instruction are also higher in CHAI (54.5) compared to LANI (24.6), reflecting the increased complexity of manipulation tasks [image1].\n\nThe scenario described in the CHAI dataset further emphasizes this complexity. For example, the task involves preparing for a dinner party, which includes multiple steps such as moving items, opening and closing containers, and cleaning up [image2]. This scenario requires the agent to handle multiple sub-goals and coordinate actions over time, making it more challenging than the simpler navigation tasks in LANI [image2].\n\nIn summary, the LANI dataset primarily evaluates navigation performance, with our approach significantly improving task completion rates. The CHAI dataset, on the other hand, focuses on both navigation and manipulation, where our approach shows modest improvements but highlights the inherent complexity and challenges of the task. ![The CHAI dataset involves more complex instructions and actions compared to the LANI dataset.](image1)"}

For the LANI task, our approach achieves a stop distance (SD) of 8.65 and a task completion (TC) rate of 35.72%, while for the CHAI task, it achieves an SD of 2.75 and a manipulation accuracy (MA) of 37.53%. These results are notably better than the baselines such as STOP, RANDOM WALK, and MOSTFREQUENT, which perform poorly across both tasks [3][5][7]. \n\nHowever, the performance gap is more pronounced when comparing our approach to other methods like MISRA17 and CHAPLOT18. On the LANI task, our approach outperforms CHAPLOT18 by improving the task completion (TC) accuracy by 5%, while on the CHAI task, CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17 both fail to learn effective manipulation behaviors, highlighting the complexity of the CHAI domain [7].\n\nThe importance of each component of our model is further demonstrated through ablation studies. Removing the action generation RNN (w/o RNN) or the language input (w/o Language) significantly degrades performance, especially on the CHAI task, where manipulation accuracy drops sharply [6]. This underscores the critical role of language understanding and action planning in achieving high performance.\n\nRegarding linguistic categories, the distribution of categories in the instructions provides insights into the complexity of the tasks. The LANI task includes a higher frequency of spatial relations and trajectory constraints, while the CHAI task emphasizes temporal coordination and co-reference [4][6]. The presence of these categories affects the model's ability to parse and execute instructions correctly. For instance, the temporal coordination category, which is more prevalent in CHAI, involves understanding sequences of actions, making the task more challenging [6].\n\nThe performance metrics and linguistic category distributions highlight the inherent differences and complexities between the LANI and CHAI tasks. While our approach shows promising results, especially in improving over baselines and other methods, the gap to human performance remains significant, particularly in the manipulation accuracy of the CHAI task [5][7].\n\nIn conclusion, our approach performs better than baselines and other methods on both tasks, but the CHAI task presents greater challenges, especially in manipulation accuracy, demonstrating the complexity and open nature of these tasks. ![Our approach outperforms baselines on both tasks but faces greater challenges in manipulation accuracy on CHAI.](image3)"}

This underscores the critical role of goal prediction in the overall performance of the model.\n\nThe comparison also reveals that while the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, there is still a significant gap between the model's performance and human performance. For LANI, humans achieve a TC of 63%, and for CHAI, humans achieve a MA of 100% [10]. This gap indicates that both tasks remain challenging and that further improvements are needed to bridge the performance gap.\n\nIn summary, the proposed approach outperforms other methods in task completion for LANI and manipulation accuracy for CHAI, but the challenges of accurate goal prediction and the complexity of manipulation tasks remain significant hurdles."}

However, there are limitations, such as cascading errors and the model's inability to handle intermediate trajectory constraints effectively [4]. These limitations are evident in the CHAI dataset, where the model's manipulation accuracy remains low despite improvements in stop distance.\n\nTo further understand the performance, it is useful to consider the human evaluation. The human stop distance error (SD) on the LANI dataset is 5.2, and the task completion (TC) is 63%, indicating that there is still a significant gap between human performance and the model's performance [6].

According to the results reported in Table 5 [7], when pre-trained embeddings are used, the gains in BLEU scores generally follow the order of language similarity. For instance, the GL/PT translation pair, which involves closely related languages, shows the largest gains. Conversely, the BE/RU pair, which involves more dissimilar languages, shows a small decrease in BLEU scores.\n\nHowever, the alignment of word embeddings itself does not always provide a significant benefit. From Table 4 [8], we see that the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses being essentially insignificant across all languages. This suggests that while pre-training word embeddings can improve performance, the alignment of these embeddings between different languages does not necessarily lead to further improvements.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the data from the table in image3, which compares BLEU scores for various language pairs with and without alignment. For example, the GL-EN pair shows a slight decrease in BLEU score when alignment is applied, moving from 12.8 to 11.5. Similarly, the TR-EN pair also shows a minor decrease from 17.9 to 17.7. These results support the conclusion that alignment does not consistently enhance the performance of NMT systems.\n\nIn summary, while pre-training word embeddings can improve BLEU scores, the alignment of these embeddings does not always provide additional benefits, and its impact varies across different language pairs. ![Alignment of word embeddings does not consistently enhance BLEU scores across different language pairs.](image3)"}

This is evident from the f-measure comparison shown in Figure 2, which indicates that pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, with a notable impact on low-frequency words [1]. \n\nTo further understand the effect of pre-training, let's look at the results from Table 5, which compares the performance of bilingual and multilingual systems. The gains in BLEU scores from pre-training are generally in the order of language similarity, with the most significant improvements observed in the most similar language pairs [3]. For instance, the GL/PT pair, which has the highest similarity, shows the largest gains, while the BE/RU pair, which is the least similar, shows a small decrease [2].\n\nThe importance of language similarity is also reflected in the BLEU scores of different language pairs. As seen in Table 3, the BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT generally follow the hypothesis that more similar languages benefit more from pre-training. However, when moving to very different languages like RU and HE, the accuracy gains are larger due to the lower baseline BLEU scores, indicating a larger headroom for improvement [8].\n\nThe role of training set size is crucial in determining the effectiveness of pre-training. According to the analysis in Figure 6, the increase in BLEU scores from pre-training is most pronounced when the training set size is moderate, typically around 40,000 sentences [5]. This suggests that pre-training is most beneficial when there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language but not so much that the system is already highly effective [9].\n\nAdditionally, the qualitative analysis of translations from GL to EN, as shown in Table 6, highlights the benefits of pre-training. Pre-trained embeddings help the model capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [7]. For example, the best system successfully translates a person's name (\"Chris\") and multi-word phrases (\"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\"), demonstrating the improved representation of less frequent concepts [7].\n\nIn summary, pre-training enhances translation accuracy, particularly for low-frequency words and low-resource language pairs, with the greatest benefits observed in similar language pairs and moderate training set sizes.\n\n![{Pre-training improves translation accuracy, especially for low-frequency words and low-resource language pairs, with the greatest benefits in similar language pairs and moderate training set sizes.}](image6)"}

When embeddings are aligned, the BLEU scores for all three tasks increase, which is intuitive as a single encoder is used for both source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space [7]. This ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language.\n\nFor instance, in the translation from Galician (GL) to Portuguese (PT) to English (EN), the BLEU score improvements are notable when the embeddings are aligned. The table in Image 3 shows that the BLEU score for the GL+PT to GL translation improves from 17.5 to 22.4 when using pre-aligned embeddings, indicating a substantial improvement [![{BLEU score improvements with aligned embeddings}](image3)](image3).\n\nHowever, the impact of alignment varies across different language pairs. For example, the dataset in Image 4 shows that the BLEU score for the GL to EN translation decreases slightly from 12.8 to 11.5 when the embeddings are aligned, while the BE to EN translation remains unchanged at 3.0 [![{Mixed effects of alignment on BLEU scores}](image4)](image4). This suggests that the effectiveness of alignment depends on the specific language pairs and the nature of the data.\n\nRegarding the F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, the results show that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [8]. This is evident in Image 2, which displays the F-measure scores for different frequency buckets. The F-measure for words with frequencies between 1 and 99 shows a significant improvement, indicating that pre-training helps the model to better handle rare words [![{F-measure improvements for low-frequency words}](image2)](image2).\n\nIn conclusion, the alignment of word embeddings generally enhances translation performance, especially in multilingual systems, and it is particularly beneficial for handling low-frequency words in the target language."}

According to the ablation study, removing R-GCN results in an 8.0 point drop in accuracy on the validation set [2]. This highlights the critical role of R-GCN in enhancing the model's ability to perform multihop reasoning and update mention representations based on their relations to other mentions.\n\nSimilarly, the removal of relation types also affects performance. When all relation types are removed and the model is fully connected without distinguishing edges by type, there is only a marginal improvement over the baseline model that uses ELMo alone [9]. This suggests that a more sophisticated graph construction and parameterization are necessary for effective performance.\n\nSpecifically, the removal of certain relation types has varying impacts:\n- **DOC-BASED**: Removing connections of mentions that co-occur in the same document leads to a significant drop in performance, especially in the unmasked condition (from 65.1 to 62.9) [1]. This is because the majority of connections are between mentions in the same document, and removing these connections removes important contextual information.\n- **MATCH**: Removing connections between mentions that match exactly results in a noticeable drop in performance, particularly in the masked condition (from 70.4 to 67.4) [1]. This indicates that exact matches provide valuable information, especially when the context is hidden.\n- **COREF**: Removing coreference links has a less significant impact, with a slight drop in performance in the unmasked condition (from 65.1 to 64.8) [1]. This is partly because the MATCH heuristic already captures the easier coreference cases, and the out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable.\n- **COMPLEMENT**: Removing complement edges also has a minimal impact, with a slight drop in performance in the masked condition (from 70.4 to 70.3) [1].\n\nThese findings are corroborated by the performance metrics in the table, which shows the impact of removing these components:\n- **No R-GCN**: Performance drops to 62.4 in the unmasked condition and 63.2 in the masked condition.\n- **No relation types**: Performance slightly improves to 62.7 in the unmasked condition and 63.9 in the masked condition, but this is marginal compared to the baseline.\n- **No DOC-BASED**: Performance drops to 62.9 in the unmasked condition and 65.8 in the masked condition.\n- **No MATCH**: Performance drops to 64.3 in the unmasked condition and 67.4 in the masked condition.\n- **No COREF**: Performance drops to 64.8 in the unmasked condition.\n- **No COMPLEMENT**: Performance drops to 64.1 in the unmasked condition and 70.3 in the masked condition.\n\nIn summary, the removal of specific components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types (e.g., MATCH, COREF) significantly impacts the performance of models under both unmasked and masked conditions, with some components having a more pronounced effect than others. ![Removing specific components significantly impacts model performance](image1)"}

In the unmasked setting, the model's performance slightly improves when coreference is included, as shown by the results in the table [image4]. Specifically, the Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) achieves an accuracy of 65.3%, compared to 64.8% without coreference. However, in the masked setting, the performance actually degrades when coreference is included. The Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) scores 70.5% accuracy, whereas the model without coreference achieves 70.4%.\n\nThis discrepancy can be explained by the nature of the masked setting. In the masked setting, entities are consistently referred to via the same unique surface form (e.g., MASK1), which simplifies the task of linking mentions [2]. As a result, the coreference system, which is designed to handle more complex and varied references, may introduce noise or incorrect links, leading to a performance drop [6].\n\nIn contrast, in the unmasked setting, mentions to an entity can vary significantly (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\"), making the coreference system more valuable for identifying and linking these mentions correctly [2]. This explains why the inclusion of coreference information provides a slight boost in the unmasked setting.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of coreference information improves the performance of Entity-GCN models in the unmasked setting but degrades performance in the masked setting. ![Performance varies between unmasked and masked settings](image4)"}

Specifically, on the ACE04 and ACE05 datasets, DyGIE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 7.1% and 7.0% relative improvement in named entity recognition (NER), respectively, and a 25.8% and 13.7% relative improvement in relation extraction [9]. These improvements highlight the effectiveness of DyGIE in handling complex tasks without relying on gold-standard entity labels.\n\nTo understand the impact of coreference and relation propagation layers, let's examine the ablation studies. The results show that coreference propagation (CorefProp) primarily benefits entity extraction, while relation propagation (RelProp) enhances relation extraction [4]. For instance, on the ACE05 development set, removing the coreference propagation layer (−CorefProp) slightly improves relation extraction but decreases entity extraction performance [5]. Conversely, removing the relation propagation layer (−RelProp) degrades relation extraction performance while having a minor impact on entity extraction [5].\n\nThe ablation study on the ACE05 development set further illustrates these points. When coreference propagation is removed, the F1 score for entity extraction drops from 68.2 to 68.1, while the F1 score for relation extraction increases slightly from 42.0 to 41.2 [image1]. Similarly, when relation propagation is removed, the F1 score for relation extraction drops from 42.0 to 40.4, while the F1 score for entity extraction remains relatively stable at 68.0 [image1]. These findings confirm that coreference propagation is crucial for entity extraction, whereas relation propagation is essential for relation extraction.\n\nIn the context of overlapping entity extraction, DyGIE also shows substantial improvements. On the ACE04-O and ACE05-O datasets, DyGIE achieves an 11.6% and 11.3% improvement over the state of the art, respectively [2]. This performance is particularly notable given the more stringent evaluation criteria, where both the entity label and full text span must match the gold prediction [3].\n\nThe effectiveness of the coreference propagation layer is further demonstrated in Figure 3a, which shows that the best performance for entity extraction is achieved with two iterations of coreference propagation (N=2) [7]. This suggests that a moderate amount of propagation is optimal for enhancing entity extraction accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the DyGIE system performs exceptionally well on entity and relation extraction tasks across different datasets, with coreference propagation significantly benefiting entity extraction and relation propagation enhancing relation extraction. ![Coreference propagation improves entity extraction, while relation propagation boosts relation extraction.](image1)"}

According to [1], SWEM demonstrates the best results on most datasets except WikiQA, particularly on the SNLI dataset where SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of 83.8%, which is very competitive. This is consistent with findings in other studies that max-pooling over BiLSTM hidden units outperforms average pooling on the SNLI dataset.\n\nIn [3], it is noted that SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions on the AG News dataset. Specifically, if the performance threshold is set at 80% testing accuracy, SWEM exhibits a lower intrinsic dimension \\(d_{\\text{int}}\\) than CNN on the AG News dataset. However, for larger dimensions, CNN can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy.\n\n[7] further supports this by showing that SWEM models, especially SWEM-concat, outperform both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures on topic prediction tasks, such as Yahoo! Answers and AG News. For the ontology classification problem (DBpedia dataset), SWEM also exhibits comparable or even superior results relative to CNN or LSTM models.\n\nOn the other hand, [10] indicates that SWEM is less effective at extracting representations from short sentences compared to long documents. This is evident in sentiment analysis datasets like MR, SST-1, and SST-2, where SWEM yields inferior accuracies compared to CNN and LSTM models. However, SWEM performs comparably on other tasks like subjectivity classification and question classification, with much fewer parameters and faster training.\n\nNow, let's look at the visual evidence. The graph in `![{SWEM and CNN accuracy comparison on AG News and Yelp Polarity datasets}](image1)` shows the accuracy of SWEM and CNN models across different subspace dimensions. For the AG News dataset, SWEM consistently outperforms CNN, especially at lower dimensions. For the Yelp Polarity dataset, SWEM also shows higher accuracy at lower dimensions, but CNN can achieve higher accuracy at larger dimensions.\n\nThe table in `![{Performance comparison on various NLP tasks}](image2)` provides a comprehensive comparison of different models, including SWEM, CNN, and LSTM, on tasks like SNLI, MultiNLI, and others.

This is particularly evident on datasets D3 and D4, where the label distribution is highly unbalanced. The transfer of the embedding layer helps capture sentiment information more effectively, especially in the negative and neutral classes, which are underrepresented in these datasets.\n\nTo better understand the impact of these components, let's look at the performance metrics across different settings [image2]. The table shows that transferring the LSTM layer alone (LSTM only) results in an accuracy of 78.09% and a macro-F1 score of 67.85% on dataset D1, while transferring only the embedding layer (Embeddings only) achieves an accuracy of 71.04% and a macro-F1 score of 66.80%.

The improvements in accuracy are stable across all datasets, but the macro-F1 scores show more significant gains, especially for datasets D3 and D4. When the percentage of document-level training examples is increased from 0 to 0.4, there is a sharp increase in the macro-F1 scores for D3 and D4.

For example, in Spanish, Google Translate has an overall accuracy of 53.1%, but the difference in performance (F1 score) between masculine and feminine scores (ΔG) is 23.4, indicating a strong bias [4].\n\nSimilarly, the accuracy and gender bias metrics for French and other languages are shown in the same table. French, for instance, has an overall accuracy of 63.6% for Google Translate, but the difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments (ΔS) is 26.7, highlighting a significant bias [4].\n\nAnother important finding is the impact of adding stereotypical gender adjectives to the dataset. This modification generally improves the accuracy of gender prediction, as seen in the case of Spanish and Russian [7].\n\n![{Improvement in gender prediction accuracy with added adjectives}](image5)\n\nFor Spanish, the accuracy increases from 53.1% to 63.5% when stereotypical adjectives are added, and for Russian, it increases from 37.7% to 48.9%. This suggests that the presence of explicit gender cues can mitigate some of the bias in translations.\n\nOverall, the data and code for these evaluations are publicly available, allowing for further research and improvement in reducing gender bias in machine translation systems [3].\n\nIn conclusion, while there are variations in translation accuracy and gender bias across different machine translation systems and languages, all systems exhibit a significant gender bias, particularly when translating non-stereotypical gender roles."}

However, when the adjective \"pretty\" is added to the sentence—making it \"The janitor does not like the pretty baker because she always messes up the kitchen\"—the translation becomes accurate, with \"baker\" correctly inflected as female: \"Al conserje no le gusta la panadera bonita porque ella siempre desordena la cocina.\" ![{Adding a stereotypically female adjective \"fixes\" the translation.}](image3)\n\nThis improvement is not isolated. Table 4 provides specific performance metrics for Google Translate on Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian. When stereotypical adjectives are added, the accuracy improves significantly in these languages. For example, the accuracy for Spanish increases from 53.1% to 63.5%, a gain of 10.4%. Similarly, for Russian, the accuracy improves from 37.7% to 48.9%, a gain of 11.2%. In Ukrainian, the improvement is from 38.4% to 42.9%, a gain of 4.5%. ![{Improvement in gender prediction accuracy with stereotypical adjectives.}](image2)\n\nThese results suggest that adding stereotypical adjectives can mitigate gender bias in machine translation, particularly in languages where gender is grammatically marked. However, this approach is not practical as a general solution due to its reliance on oracle coreference resolution. Nonetheless, it highlights the relationship between coreference resolution and machine translation and underscores the presence of gender bias in these systems.\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments can significantly reduce gender bias in machine translation, especially in languages with grammatical gender, but they are not a viable long-term solution."}

According to the data, when the model is trained on standard distractors and tested on the same, it achieves an F1 score of 67.08 [10]. However, when the model is tested on adversarial distractors, the F1 score drops significantly to 46.84 [10]. This indicates that standard distractors might not be challenging enough to fully test the model's capabilities. \n\nWhen the model is re-trained on adversarial distractors and then tested on them, the F1 score improves to 60.10 [10]. This suggests that adversarial training helps the model generalize better to more difficult distractors. Additionally, filtering by entity type further enhances the model's performance, bringing the F1 score to 58.42 [10].\n\nNext, let's look at the effect of the number of distractors on the model's performance. The F1 score of single-paragraph BERT decreases from 67.08 to 52.13 when the question is reduced to the first five tokens [1]. This reduction in performance highlights the importance of the full context in question answering tasks. Moreover, even with 500 distractors, the F1 score of single-paragraph BERT is only 53.12, indicating that a large number of distractors alone is not sufficient to improve performance [5].\n\nIn the open-domain setting, the model's performance is particularly affected by the retrieval method. The F1 score drops to 39.12 when using 500 retrieved paragraphs, but it increases to 53.12 when additional gold paragraphs are included [5]. This demonstrates that the ability to retrieve relevant paragraphs is crucial for the model's success in open-domain question answering.\n\nFinally, the type of question also plays a significant role. Multi-hop questions, which require reasoning across multiple pieces of evidence, are more challenging for the model. For example, the F1 score for multi-hop questions is 54.46, while for single-hop questions, it is 70.54 [image3]. This shows that single-hop questions are generally easier to answer, and the model performs better on them.\n\nIn conclusion, different training and evaluation strategies significantly affect F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Adversarial training and filtering by entity type improve performance, while the number of distractors and the retrieval method play crucial roles in open-domain settings. ![Adversarial training improves F1 scores](image4)"}

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the original dataset, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline [8]. However, when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance drops dramatically.\n\nIn the first experimental setup, where models trained and validated on the original data were evaluated on the adversarial set, all results were worse than random due to overfitting to the cues in the original training set [6]. This indicates that the models were relying heavily on spurious statistical cues rather than true argument comprehension.\n\nIn the second setup, models were trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets and then evaluated on the adversarial test set. The results, as shown in Table 4, reveal that BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set is only 53%, with mean and median accuracies at 50% [6]. This significant drop in performance confirms that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminates the spurious statistical cues, leading to a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension.\n\nThe adversarial dataset, therefore, provides a clearer picture of the model's actual understanding of arguments. It shows that BERT's initial high performance was largely due to exploiting these cues rather than genuine comprehension [7]. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that even with the adversarial setup, BERT's performance aligns with random guessing, indicating that it has not truly learned to comprehend arguments [3].\n\nTo visualize the impact, consider the performance metrics on the original and adversarial datasets. The original dataset shows a much higher performance, while the adversarial dataset demonstrates a more realistic and challenging evaluation environment ![Performance metrics on the original and adversarial datasets](image4).\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's high performance on the original ARCT dataset was primarily due to exploiting spurious statistical cues, and the model's actual argument comprehension is limited. The adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard for future evaluations to ensure more robust and reliable results."}

When the model is trained with only 1% of the training data, the perplexity (PPL) is 23.81, and the BLEU-2 score is 5.08.

According to the data in image2, the sensitivity and WER for closed vocabulary models under different backoff strategies are as follows:\n\n- **Pass-Through**: \n  - Swap: 17.6\n  - Drop: 19.7\n  - Add: 0.8\n  - Key: 73\n  - All: 113\n\n- **Background**:\n  - Swap: 19.5\n  - Drop: 22.3\n  - Add: 1.1\n  - Key: 95\n  - All: 13.1\n\n- **Neutral**:\n  - Swap: 17.5\n  - Drop: 19.7\n  - Add: 0.8\n  - Key: 72\n  - All: 113\n\nFor closed vocabulary models, the neutral backoff strategy has the lowest sensitivity across most attack types, which aligns with the findings in [4]. The neutral backoff strategy maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, reducing the number of unique outputs and thus the sensitivity. However, the WER is slightly higher for the neutral backoff compared to the background backoff.\n\nNow, let's look at the open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece models). These models consider every unique combination of characters differently. The sensitivity and WER for open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies are:\n\n- **Pass-Through**:\n  - Swap: 39.6\n  - Drop: 35.3\n  - Add: 19.2\n  - Key: 26.9\n  - All: 30.3\n\n- **Background**:\n  - Swap: 20.7\n  - Drop: 25.1\n  - Add: 1.3\n  - Key: 116\n  - All: 14.7\n\n- **Neutral**:\n  - Swap: 17.5\n  - Drop: 19.7\n  - Add: 0.8\n  - Key: 72\n  - All: 113\n\nFor open vocabulary models, the neutral backoff strategy also has the lowest sensitivity, consistent with the closed vocabulary models. However, the WER is generally higher for the pass-through backoff strategy, which allows more unique character combinations to pass through, increasing the sensitivity.\n\nThe trade-off between WER and sensitivity is visualized in image4, where the x-axis represents sensitivity and the y-axis represents WER. The neutral backoff strategy typically appears in the lower left quadrant, indicating low sensitivity and moderate WER, making it a robust choice for both closed and open vocabulary models.\n\nIn conclusion, the neutral backoff strategy provides the lowest sensitivity for both closed and open vocabulary models, making it the most robust option despite having a slightly higher WER compared to the background backoff strategy. ![The neutral backoff strategy has the lowest sensitivity for both closed and open vocabulary models.](image2)"}

The company employs a robust risk management strategy to mitigate these impacts, particularly focusing on reducing the short-term negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations [3].\n\nIn 2020, the exchange rate changes had notable effects on Novo Nordisk's financials. For instance, the average exchange rate for USD to DKK decreased from 6.67 in 2019 to 6.54 in 2020, representing a 9.3% decline [image8]. Similarly, the JPY to DKK rate saw a 3.8% decrease from 6.12 to 5.88 [image8]. These changes in exchange rates can significantly impact the company's financial performance, especially given its global operations and exposure to multiple currencies.\n\nThe impact of these exchange rate changes on comprehensive income and cash flow hedges is evident in the financial data. The table showing the immediate impact of a 5% increase or decrease in key currencies against EUR and DKK reveals that a 5% increase in these currencies would result in a DKK 1,893 million decrease in other comprehensive income and a DKK 299 million increase in the income statement [image5]. Conversely, a 5% decrease would lead to a DKK 1,893 million increase in other comprehensive income and a DKK 299 million decrease in the income statement [image5].\n\nAdditionally, the company's use of derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts and currency options, plays a crucial role in managing these risks. The table detailing the derivative financial instruments shows that Novo Nordisk held a total of DKK 63,390 million in forward contracts at the end of 2020, with a positive fair value of DKK 2,332 million and a negative fair value of DKK 1,365 million [image2]. These instruments are used to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities, thereby reducing the volatility in financial results [8].\n\nThe impact of these hedges on the income statement and other comprehensive income is also detailed. The table indicates that the recognized gains and losses from these hedges were DKK 483 million and DKK 1,318 million, respectively, in the income statement, and DKK 1,849 million and DKK 47 million in other comprehensive income [image2].\n\nIn summary, the changes in exchange rates and the company's financial risk management strategies, particularly through the use of derivative financial instruments, significantly influenced Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020. The company effectively managed these risks to maintain financial stability and predictability. ![The table shows the impact of exchange rate changes on comprehensive income and cash flow hedges.](image5)"}

This figure includes various components such as income/(charge) to the income statement, income/(charge) to other comprehensive income, and effect of exchange rate adjustments. \n\nBy the end of 2020, the net deferred tax asset/(liability) stood at DKK 3,363. This represents a decrease of DKK 678 million from the beginning of the year. \n\nThe main contributing factors to this change can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. **Income/(Charge) to the Income Statement**: There was a significant charge to the income statement of DKK 2,883 million, which contributed to the overall decrease in the net deferred tax asset. This charge likely reflects adjustments in tax provisions or changes in the company's financial performance that affected its tax position [3].\n\n2. **Income/(Charge) to Other Comprehensive Income**: There was a smaller charge of DKK 577 million to other comprehensive income, further reducing the net deferred tax asset. This could be due to changes in fair value measurements or other items that do not pass through the income statement but still impact the tax position [5].\n\n3. **Effect of Exchange Rate Adjustment**: The effect of exchange rate adjustments resulted in a decrease of DKK 307 million. This indicates that the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the Danish Krone (DKK) had a negative impact on the deferred tax asset [1].\n\n4. **Acquisition of Subsidiaries**: The acquisition of subsidiaries added DKK 276 million to the net deferred tax asset, which helped to offset some of the decreases mentioned above [2].\n\n5. **Income/(Charge) to Equity**: There was a minor charge of DKK 72 million to equity, which also contributed to the decrease [4].\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset/(liability) decreased by DKK 678 million from the beginning to the end of 2020, primarily due to significant charges to the income statement and other comprehensive income, along with the negative impact of exchange rate adjustments. ![Net deferred tax asset/(liability) decreased by DKK 678 million from the beginning to the end of 2020](image3)"}

According to the data, the total AUM increased from $500 billion in 2019 to $657 billion in 2020, representing a substantial growth of 31.4% [3]. This growth can be attributed to strong investment performance and positive net flows [9].\n\nBreaking down the AUM by category, we see that equity AUM grew from $124 billion in 2019 to $174 billion in 2020, fixed income AUM increased from $71 billion to $86 billion, and alternative/other AUM rose from $134 billion to $145 billion [3]. Liquidity AUM also saw a significant increase from $171 billion in 2019 to $252 billion in 2020 [3].\n\nRegarding fee rates, the overall fee rate decreased slightly from 47 basis points (bps) in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020 [image1]. Specifically, the fee rate for long-term AUM dropped from 62 bps in 2018 to 60 bps in 2020, while the liquidity fee rate decreased from 17 bps to 15 bps [image1].

While the fee rates have slightly decreased, the significant increase in AUM has more than offset this reduction, contributing to the overall revenue growth [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of increased AUM and slightly lower fee rates has resulted in a net positive impact on the firm's revenues, with asset management revenues growing by 15% in 2020 [9]. ![Total AUM increased from $500 billion in 2019 to $657 billion in 2020](image3)"}

This substantial growth in net income can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the company's revenues saw a substantial increase, rising to $33.6 billion in fiscal 2021, a 43% increase from the $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 [6]. Specifically, QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) revenues, which account for the majority of the company's revenue, increased by 64% compared to the prior year, driven by strong demand for 5G products across handsets and RFFE, as well as higher automotive and IoT revenues [8].\n\nAdditionally, the acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion on March 16, 2021, contributed to the company's strategic expansion and technological capabilities, although the immediate financial impact of this acquisition is more about future potential rather than immediate revenue [1].\n\nFurthermore, QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) revenues also increased by 26% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19 [8].\n\nRegarding comprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss), Qualcomm reported a comprehensive income of $8.964 billion in fiscal 2021, compared to $5.305 billion in fiscal 2020 and $4.272 billion in fiscal 2019 [image5]. The other comprehensive income (loss) components, such as foreign currency translation gains (losses) and net unrealized (losses) gains on certain available-for-sale securities, showed minor fluctuations but did not significantly impact the overall comprehensive income.\n\nThese financial improvements highlight Qualcomm's successful navigation through the challenges posed by the pandemic and its strategic focus on 5G technology and market expansion.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income increased significantly in fiscal 2021 compared to previous years, driven by strong revenue growth and strategic acquisitions.](image5)\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 were significantly higher compared to the previous years, primarily due to strong revenue growth, particularly in 5G products and licensing, and strategic acquisitions like NUVIA."}

Notably, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses rose from $79.854 billion in 2020 to $86.664 billion in 2021, reflecting higher claims and adjustments in the insurance sector [2]. Additionally, notes payable and other borrowings increased from $41.522 billion in 2020 to $39.272 billion in 2021, indicating ongoing financing activities [2]. These changes are consistent with the company's continued investment in various business segments and its commitment to maintaining strong financial reserves.\n\n### Shareholders' Equity\nThe significant increase in shareholders' equity is primarily driven by retained earnings, which grew from $444.626 billion in 2020 to $534.421 billion in 2021 [2]. This growth in retained earnings is a result of the company's strong net earnings, which were $89.8 billion in 2021, including substantial after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [4]. Despite the repurchase of treasury stock, which increased from $32.853 billion in 2020 to $59.795 billion in 2021, the overall equity still saw a substantial rise [2].\n\n### Key Factors\n1. **Net Earnings**: Berkshire Hathaway reported net earnings of $89.8 billion in 2021, a significant increase from $42.521 billion in 2020. This robust performance contributed to the growth in retained earnings and, consequently, shareholders' equity [4].\n2. **Investment Gains**: The company realized substantial after-tax gains on investments, totaling approximately $61.6 billion, which also bolstered the retained earnings and shareholders' equity [4].\n3. **Treasury Stock Repurchases**: Despite the increase in treasury stock, which reflects the company's strategy to return capital to shareholders, the overall equity still grew due to the strong earnings and investment gains [2].\n4. **Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses**: The increase in these liabilities indicates higher claims and adjustments, which is a normal part of the insurance business and contributes to the overall liabilities [2].\n\nThese changes highlight Berkshire Hathaway's continued financial strength and its ability to generate significant earnings and investment returns, even while managing a growing liability base. ![Berkshire Hathaway's financial statements show a significant increase in shareholders' equity and a moderate increase in liabilities from 2020 to 2021.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the key factors contributing to the changes in liabilities and shareholders' equity for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from 2020 to 2021 were strong net earnings, significant investment gains, and strategic treasury stock repurchases."}

This was driven by higher end-user demand across various segments, particularly in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. For instance, Construction Industries saw a 31% increase in total sales to $22.106 billion in 2021, compared to $16.918 billion in 2020, with a substantial portion of this increase attributed to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts [8].\n\nAdditionally, dealers' inventory changes played a crucial role. Dealers decreased their inventories by about $2.9 billion in 2020, but only by about $100 million in 2021, indicating a more stable inventory level in 2021 [2]. This reduction in inventory drawdowns contributed positively to the overall sales figures.\n\nFavorable price realization also significantly impacted the increase in sales and revenues. The company benefited from better pricing, which helped boost revenues across all segments [7].\n\nFurthermore, favorable currency impacts, particularly related to the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar, contributed to the increase in sales, especially in the Construction Industries segment [8].\n\nThe financial products segment also saw a modest increase, contributing to the overall revenue growth [4].\n\n![{The chart shows the breakdown of the $9,223 million increase in sales and revenues, highlighting the contributions from sales volume, price realization, currency, and financial products.}](image4)\n\nIn summary, the main factors contributing to the $9,223 million increase in consolidated sales and revenues from 2020 to 2021 were higher sales volume driven by increased end-user demand, favorable price realization, and positive currency impacts."}

In 2020, the company's total capital expenditures decreased from $31,148 million in 2019 to $21,374 million [image1]. This reduction was evident across all segments, with the Upstream segment experiencing the most substantial cut, from $23,485 million in 2019 to $14,431 million in 2020. The Downstream and Chemical segments also saw decreases, from $4,371 million to $4,221 million and from $3,265 million to $2,716 million, respectively [image1].\n\nThese reductions in capital expenditures were part of ExxonMobil's broader strategy to manage costs and improve liquidity during a period of lower realized prices for its products [4]. The company issued $23 billion in long-term debt and implemented significant capital and operating cost reductions, ending the year with $68 billion in gross debt [4].\n\nIn terms of taxes, ExxonMobil's total taxes on the income statement decreased from $38,468 million in 2019 to $22,793 million in 2020 [image4]. This decline was primarily driven by a shift from an income tax expense of $5,282 million in 2019 to a tax benefit of $5,632 million in 2020 [image4]. The effective tax rate dropped from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, largely due to asset impairments recorded in 2020 and changes in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates [10].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes were significant. The reduction in capital expenditures helped the company conserve cash and manage its financial position more effectively during a period of economic uncertainty. The tax benefit further improved the company's financial health, providing additional liquidity to support ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.

This substantial repurchase activity reflects the company's belief in its intrinsic value and financial strength. The program is designed to repurchase shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, without reducing the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion [6].\n\nNow, let's delve into the net earnings across different segments:\n\n### Insurance Underwriting\nThe insurance underwriting segment generated after-tax earnings of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020, and $325 million in 2019 [2]. The increase in 2021 can be attributed to favorable adjustments in prior accident years under property and casualty contracts, despite challenges such as higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates [2].\n\n### Insurance Investment Income\nAfter-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 and by 8.9% in 2020 compared to 2019 [9]. The decline is primarily due to lower interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\n### Railroad\nAfter-tax earnings from the railroad business increased by 16.1% in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased by 5.8% in 2020 compared to 2019 [7]. The 2021 increase is attributed to higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit, and improved productivity, despite higher average fuel prices and volume-related costs [7].\n\n### Utilities and Energy\nAfter-tax earnings from the utilities and energy business increased by 13.1% in 2021 compared to 2020 and by 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019 [7]. The 2021 increase includes higher earnings from utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, as well as the real estate brokerage business [7].\n\n### Manufacturing, Service, and Retailing\nEarnings from the manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses increased by 34.0% in 2021 compared to 2020 and declined by 11.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 [10]. The 2021 increase is driven by higher customer demand, though several businesses faced higher materials, freight, and other input costs due to global supply chain disruptions [10].\n\n### Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses\nThis segment saw significant fluctuations, with gains of $62,340 million in 2021, $31,591 million in 2020, and $57,445 million in 2019 [5]. These gains are influenced by various factors, including market conditions and specific investment performances.\n\n### Other\nOther earnings, which include items like goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, showed a loss of $1,315 million in 2021, a loss of $11,318 million in 2020, and a gain of $424 million in 2019 [5]. The 2020 loss was largely due to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016 [5].\n\n### Net Earnings\nOverall, net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders were $89,795 million in 2021, $42,521 million in 2020, and $81,417 million in 2019 [5]. The significant increase in 2021 is primarily driven by strong performances in the railroad, utilities and energy, and manufacturing, service, and retailing segments, as well as substantial investment gains.\n\nTo visualize the performance, consider the following chart comparing the value of $100 invested in Berkshire common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index from December 31, 2016 [8]:\n![Berkshire's stock outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, Berkshire Hathaway's stock repurchase program and its net earnings across different segments demonstrate a strong financial position and strategic management, with notable increases in key areas in 2021."}

These changes had a notable impact on the company's GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share.\n\nFirstly, the total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues decreased by 10% in 2020, primarily due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, especially in the International Operated Markets segment [6]. This decline was more pronounced in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [5].\n\nThe U.S. market, however, showed some positive sales performance, which was partially offset by the support provided to franchisees for marketing and other initiatives to accelerate recovery and drive growth [6]. Specifically, the company provided over $200 million in incremental franchisee support, with about $100 million recorded in the U.S. and the remainder in the International Operated Markets segment [7].\n\nThese revenue changes are reflected in the company's operating results. The operating income decreased from $9,070 million in 2019 to $7,324 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,746 million or 19.2% [image2]. This decline in operating income, combined with other factors such as higher selling, general, and administrative expenses and increased restaurant closing costs, contributed to a decrease in net income from $6,025 million in 2019 to $4,731 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,294 million or 21.5% [image1].\n\nThe impact on earnings per share (EPS) was substantial.

This decline was further influenced by strategic gains and charges, including a net pre-tax strategic gain of $268 million from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which reduced the Company's ownership by about 6% [2].\n\nWhen adjusting for these strategic gains and other items, the Non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted decreased from $7.84 in 2019 to $6.05 in 2020, a decrease of $1.79 or 23% [image3]. This adjustment provides a clearer picture of the underlying business performance, excluding one-time events.\n\nIn summary, the changes in company-operated and franchised revenues, particularly the significant decline in the International Operated Markets, had a substantial negative impact on McDonald's GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share from 2019 to 2020. ![The GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share both showed a significant decrease in 2020 compared to 2019](image3)."}

One major factor was the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2020, there was a gain of $46.0 million, which is much lower compared to the $127.5 million gain in 2019 and the significant loss of $453.6 million in 2018. This indicates that the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates had a more favorable effect in 2019 and a less favorable effect in 2020 [5].\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced losses from cash flow hedges, which further reduced comprehensive income. In 2020, the loss from cash flow hedges was $123.3 million, compared to a loss of $20.4 million in 2019 and a gain of $48.9 million in 2018.

This significant increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Profit for the Year:**\n   - The profit for the year 2020 was RMB 4,176 million [2], which was added to the retained earnings.\n   \n2. **Total Comprehensive Income:**\n   - The total comprehensive income for 2020 was RMB 8,079 million, which includes the profit for the year and other comprehensive income items such as fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences [image2].\n\n3. **Other Comprehensive Income:**\n   - The share of other comprehensive income of associates and currency translation differences also contributed positively to the retained earnings [image2].\n\n#### Total Comprehensive Income for the Year\nThe 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' increased from RMB 5,273 million in 2019 to RMB 8,079 million in 2020, a difference of RMB 2,806 million. This increase can be explained by:\n\n1. **Profit for the Year:**\n   - The profit for the year 2020 was RMB 4,176 million, which was higher than the profit for 2019 (RMB 3,977 million) [2].\n\n2. **Fair Value Changes on Financial Assets:**\n   - There were positive fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, contributing to the total comprehensive income [image2].\n\n3. **Currency Translation Differences:**\n   - Positive currency translation differences also played a role in the increase in total comprehensive income [image2].\n\n4. **Share of Other Comprehensive Income of Associates:**\n   - The share of other comprehensive income of associates was positive, adding to the total comprehensive income [image2].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe increase in 'Retained Earnings' from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the higher profit for the year and positive contributions from other comprehensive income items, including fair value changes and currency translation differences.

According to the data, the provision for income taxes was $3,562 million in 2018, increased to $3,742 million in 2019, and further rose to $4,973 million in 2020 [5]. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including changes in the current and deferred tax provisions.\n\nThe current provision, which includes federal, state, and local taxes, has also shown an upward trend. For 2018, the total current provision was $3,520 million, which increased to $3,512 million in 2019 and further to $4,981 million in 2020 [image5]. This significant jump in the current provision in 2020 is primarily driven by higher federal and state/local taxes.\n\nOn the other hand, the deferred income tax provision or benefit has fluctuated over the years. In 2018, the deferred provision was a benefit of $42 million, which turned into a provision of $230 million in 2019 and then a small provision of $8 million in 2020 [image5]. This fluctuation in the deferred provision can be linked to changes in the company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in shaping the overall tax provision. As of December 31, 2020, the company had total deferred income tax assets of $3,391 million, up from $2,868 million in 2019 [image3]. The increase in deferred tax assets is primarily due to higher accrued expenses and allowances, lease liabilities, and other non-U.S. assets. However, the deferred income tax liabilities also increased significantly from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020 [image3]. The main contributors to this increase include U.S. federal and state intangible assets, capitalized software, and depreciation and amortization.\n\nThese increases in both deferred tax assets and liabilities result in a net deferred income tax liability, which was $(3,367) million in 2020, compared to $(2,993) million in 2019 [image3]. The growing net deferred income tax liability suggests that the company expects to pay more taxes in the future, which aligns with the overall increase in the provision for income taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's provision for income taxes has increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher current provisions and a net increase in deferred income tax liabilities, despite the fluctuations in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. ![The deferred income tax assets and liabilities have increased, contributing to the overall trend in the provision for income taxes.](image3)"}

In 2020, the total current liabilities were $5,342 million, and the total noncurrent liabilities were $1,189 million, summing up to $6,531 million in total liabilities.\n\nThis indicates a significant increase in current liabilities from $3,205 million in 2019 to $5,342 million in 2020, a difference of $2,137 million. Conversely, there was a decrease in noncurrent liabilities from $5,351 million in 2019 to $1,189 million in 2020, a difference of $4,162 million. Overall, the total liabilities decreased from $8,556 million in 2019 to $6,531 million in 2020, a reduction of $2,025 million.\n\nNow, let's examine how this relates to changes in total debt during the same period. According to the text [3], the total debt as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $21.2 billion, while as of December 31, 2019, it was approximately $21.7 billion. This represents a decrease in total debt of $0.5 billion.\n\nThe decrease in total debt aligns with the overall decrease in total liabilities. However, the significant shift in the composition of liabilities—where current liabilities increased and noncurrent liabilities decreased—suggests that the company may have shifted some of its long-term obligations to the short term. This could be due to various factors, such as refinancing activities or changes in accounting treatments.\n\nAdditionally, the image showing the detailed breakdown of liabilities [image2] provides further context. It shows that specific categories like \"Compensation and benefits\" and \"Taxes, income and other\" saw substantial increases in current liabilities, while \"Pension and postretirement benefits\" and \"Deferred revenue\" saw decreases in noncurrent liabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the total current and noncurrent liabilities decreased from 2019 to 2020, with a significant shift towards more current liabilities.

Specifically, the net discrete tax benefits in 2020 were $122 million, significantly lower than the $475 million in 2019 [2].\n\nThese changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions can be better understood in the context of the Firm's overall compensation expenses. In 2020, the Firm's total compensation and benefits expenses increased by 11% to $20,854 million from the prior year [9]. This increase was primarily driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives due to higher revenues, and higher expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance [9].\n\nThe Firm also saw changes in the deferred cash-based compensation awarded to employees. For the 2020 performance year, deferred cash-based compensation was awarded to a reduced group of eligible employees compared to the prior year, and certain changes to the compensation deferral formula resulted in less cash-based compensation being deferred [4]. Despite this reduction, the total recognized compensation expense for deferred cash-based awards and return on referenced investments still increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020 [6].\n\nThe impact of these changes on the Firm's financials can be visualized in the following table, which shows the effective tax rates and net discrete tax provisions for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020:\n![{Effective tax rates and net discrete tax provisions for 2018, 2019, and 2020}](image2)\n\nAdditionally, the Firm's investment in securities and loans, particularly in Wealth Management and Institutional Securities, grew significantly from 2019 to 2020, reflecting the firm's broader financial activities and the potential impact on compensation expenses and tax provisions:\n![{Firm's investment securities and loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019}](image5)\n\nIn summary, the increase in the effective tax rate and the decrease in net discrete tax provisions from 2019 to 2020 are primarily due to higher earnings and lower tax benefits, which align with the overall increase in compensation expenses driven by higher discretionary incentives and investment performance."}

This growth in loans, however, was lower than the growth in billed business, indicating that while more loans were issued, customers were also paying them off more quickly.\n\nFor card member receivables, there was a 23% increase in 2021 compared to 2020, which aligns with the overall trend of increased consumer spending and improved economic conditions [6]. The reserve for credit losses on card member receivables decreased significantly, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook [7].\n\nWhen comparing these changes to network volumes and card member spending, the trends are consistent. Network volumes increased by 24% in 2021 compared to 2020, with both U.S. and international volumes showing robust growth [3]. Billed business, which is a key indicator of consumer spending, increased by 25% in 2021, reflecting a strong rebound in consumer activity following the economic disruptions of 2020 [9]. This growth in network volumes and billed business supports the increase in card member loans and receivables, as higher consumer spending typically leads to higher borrowing and receivable balances.\n\nAdditionally, the average proprietary basic Card Member spending increased by 24% in the U.S. and 25% outside the U.S., further reinforcing the positive economic trends and consumer confidence [3]. These increases in spending and network volumes are consistent with the observed growth in card member loans and receivables, suggesting a coordinated recovery across multiple financial metrics.\n\nIn summary, the key changes in card member loans and receivables from 2020 to 2021, including a 21% increase in loans and a 23% increase in receivables, are closely aligned with the 24% increase in network volumes and the 25% increase in billed business, reflecting a comprehensive economic recovery and increased consumer activity. ![Key financial metrics show significant improvements in 2021 compared to 2020](image5)"}

However, when adjusted for constant currencies, the decrease was more significant at 22% [4]. This decline in net income can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operating earnings and a reduction in operating income [6].\n\nOperating income decreased by 19% (20% in constant currencies) in 2020, primarily due to the pandemic's adverse effects on sales and higher operating costs [6]. Additionally, the company experienced a decrease in operating margin from 42.5% in 2019 to 38.1% in 2020 [3]. Excluding specific items, the operating margin further decreased from 42.8% in 2019 to 36.7% in 2020 [3].\n\nDespite these challenges, the company recorded a net strategic gain of $274 million from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which helped mitigate some of the negative impacts [7]. However, this gain was offset by impairment charges and other costs, such as the write-off of impaired software [7].\n\nThe comprehensive income, which includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss), also saw a decrease. In 2020, comprehensive income was $4,626.4 million, down from $6,152.2 million in 2019 [image4]. The decrease in comprehensive income was influenced by foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges. Specifically, the company recognized a gain of $46.0 million in foreign currency translation adjustments, but this was partially offset by a loss of $123.3 million in cash flow hedges [image4].\n\nOverall, the decrease in net income and comprehensive income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by the operational challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lower sales and higher operating costs, despite some strategic gains and adjustments.\n\n![{Comprehensive income decreased from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and other financial adjustments.}](image4)\n\nThe net income and comprehensive income both decreased from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the operational and financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

For instance, the FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) division saw an increase in net revenue from $16,346 million in 2018 to $18,189 million in 2020, and its operating profit also increased from $5,008 million to $5,340 million [4]. This growth can be attributed to the strong performance of both the beverage and food/snack categories, which together contribute significantly to the division's revenue [3].\n\nSimilarly, the QFNA (Quaker Foods North America) division experienced a net revenue increase from $2,465 million in 2018 to $2,742 million in 2020, and its operating profit rose from $637 million to $669 million [4]. This division focuses more on food and snack products, which align with the overall trend of increasing consumer demand for healthier and convenient snack options [2].\n\nThe PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) division saw a steady increase in net revenue from $21,072 million in 2018 to $22,559 million in 2020, but its operating profit decreased from $2,276 million in 2018 to $1,937 million in 2020 [4]. This decline in operating profit could be due to higher operating costs and increased competition in the beverage market [9].\n\nIn the LatAm (Latin America) division, net revenue decreased slightly from $7,354 million in 2018 to $6,942 million in 2020, and operating profit also fell from $1,049 million to $1,033 million [4]. The region's focus on the beverage category, which makes up 10% of its revenue, suggests that market conditions and consumer preferences may have impacted performance [3].\n\nThe Europe division maintained relatively stable net revenue, increasing from $10,973 million in 2018 to $11,922 million in 2020, with operating profit remaining consistent around $1,300 million [4]. The division's balanced distribution between beverage (55%) and food/snack (45%) categories likely contributed to its stability [3].\n\nThe AMESA (Africa, Middle East, and South Asia) division saw a significant increase in net revenue from $3,657 million in 2018 to $4,573 million in 2020, and operating profit increased from $661 million to $600 million [4]. The division's focus on food and snack products, which make up 70% of its revenue, indicates strong consumer demand in these categories [3].\n\nFinally, the APAC (Asia Pacific) division experienced a modest increase in net revenue from $2,794 million in 2018 to $3,445 million in 2020, and operating profit increased from $619 million to $590 million [4]. The division's focus on both beverage (25%) and food/snack (15%) categories suggests a balanced approach to market diversification [3].\n\nOverall, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are closely tied to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories. Divisions with a stronger focus on food and snack products generally saw more positive trends, reflecting growing consumer preferences for healthier and convenient options. ![Divisions' contribution to net revenue and operating profit over the years](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the variations in net revenue and operating profit across PepsiCo's divisions from 2018 to 2020 are influenced by the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, with food and snack products driving more positive financial outcomes."}

To understand the contributing factors, we need to analyze the components of comprehensive income and the overall financial performance of Tesla.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\n1. **Net Income (Loss)**:\n   - In 2018, Tesla reported a net loss of \\(-\\$1,063\\) million.\n   - In 2019, the net loss was reduced to \\(-\\$775\\) million.\n   - In 2020, Tesla turned a profit with a net income of \\$862 million.\n   This significant improvement in net income is a primary driver of the positive comprehensive income in 2020 [2].\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment**:\n   - The foreign currency translation adjustment can significantly impact comprehensive income. For 2020, the foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of \\$399 million, compared to a loss of \\$28 million in 2019 and a loss of \\$42 million in 2018.\n   This positive adjustment contributed to the overall comprehensive income in 2020 [image1].\n\n3. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n   - Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items like foreign currency translation adjustments, which are not reflected in the net income but affect the comprehensive income.\n   - In 2020, the other comprehensive income was \\$399 million, which is a significant improvement from the losses in 2018 and 2019 [image1].\n\n4. **Operating Performance**:\n   - Tesla's operating performance improved significantly from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the company reported an operating margin of 6.3%, representing a favorable change of 6.6% compared to the prior year [9].\n   - Revenue growth also played a crucial role. Total revenues increased from \\$21,461 million in 2018 to \\$31,536 million in 2020, driven by strong performance in automotive sales and other segments [image2].\n\n5. **Cost Management**:\n   - Despite an increase in SG&A expenses, Tesla managed to control costs effectively. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense [10].\n   - The company also saw a reduction in restructuring and other activities, which contributed to the overall profitability [7].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders evolved from a significant loss in 2018 to a substantial gain in 2020. This transformation was primarily driven by a substantial improvement in net income, positive foreign currency translation adjustments, and strong operating performance. The company's ability to manage costs and achieve revenue growth further supported this positive trend.\n\n![{Comprehensive income improved significantly from a loss in 2018 to a gain in 2020, driven by net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.}](image1)"}

The Upstream segment's performance is heavily influenced by the global market prices of crude oil, which were more favorable in 2021 compared to the challenging conditions in 2020 [7].\n\nFor the **Downstream segment**, the earnings in 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n- **2021**: Total Downstream earnings were $2,914 million.\n- **2020**: Total Downstream earnings were a loss of $47 million.\n\nThe Downstream segment also showed a marked improvement, driven by better margins on refining, manufacturing, and marketing of petroleum products. However, the volatility in industry margins, influenced by factors such as supply and demand balances and crude oil prices, remains a significant factor [4].\n\n### Asset Values Analysis\n\nFor the **Upstream segment**, the asset values in 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n- **2021**: Total Upstream assets were $184,412 million.\n- **2020**: Total Upstream assets were $191,309 million.\n\nThere was a slight decrease in asset values, which could be due to various factors such as asset impairments, divestitures, or changes in the valuation of existing assets.\n\nFor the **Downstream segment**, the asset values in 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n- **2021**: Total Downstream assets were $45,224 million.\n- **2020**: Total Downstream assets were $39,586 million.\n\nThe Downstream segment saw an increase in asset values, possibly reflecting investments in refining and marketing infrastructure, as well as the acquisition of new assets.\n\n### Major Differences\n\n1. **Earnings Improvement**:\n   - **Upstream**: The Upstream segment experienced a substantial improvement, moving from a loss of $2,433 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,818 million in 2021. This significant turnaround is primarily due to the recovery in crude oil prices and increased production activities.\n   - **Downstream**: The Downstream segment also improved, turning from a loss of $47 million in 2020 to a profit of $2,914 million in 2021. This improvement is attributed to better margins and increased demand for refined products.\n\n2. **Asset Values**:\n   - **Upstream**: There was a slight decrease in asset values from $191,309 million in 2020 to $184,412 million in 2021, likely due to asset impairments or divestitures.\n   - **Downstream**: The Downstream segment saw an increase in asset values from $39,586 million in 2020 to $45,224 million in 2021, indicating investments in infrastructure and possibly new acquisitions.\n\nIn conclusion, both the Upstream and Downstream segments of Chevron Corporation showed significant improvements in earnings from 2020 to 2021, with the Upstream segment experiencing a more dramatic turnaround.

According to the data in the consolidated amounts table [image6], the net earnings attributable to P&G in 2022 were $14,742 million, compared to $13,103 million in 2020. This represents an increase of $1,639 million, or about 12.5%.\n\nThe contributing factors for this increase can be found in the breakdown of the changes in net earnings [6]. The net earnings increased by $0.4 billion, or 3%, due to several factors:\n- A prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment.\n- Lower interest expense.\n- Lower effective income tax rate.\n- Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar.\n\nNext, let's examine the stock-based expenses. According to the stock-based compensation expense summary [image1], the total stock-based expense in 2022 was $528 million, while in 2020 it was $558 million. This represents a decrease of $30 million, or about 5.4%.\n\nThe contributing factors for the decrease in stock-based expenses can be seen in the detailed breakdown of the components:\n- Stock options expense decreased from $271 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022.\n- RSUs and PSUs expense decreased from $309 million in 2020 to $271 million in 2022.\n- The income tax benefit also decreased from $102 million in 2020 to $88 million in 2022, reflecting a smaller tax benefit due to the lower stock-based expenses.\n\nAdditionally, the fair value of options granted and the intrinsic value of options exercised show some variations [image7]:\n- The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted decreased from $20.94 in 2021 to $21.55 in 2022, but this is still higher than the $15.60 in 2020.\n- The intrinsic value of options exercised decreased from $1,455 million in 2020 to $1,886 million in 2022, indicating a higher value realized from option exercises.\n\nIn summary, the net earnings attributable to P&G increased by $1,639 million from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment, lower interest expense, and a lower effective income tax rate, despite negative foreign exchange impacts. The stock-based expenses decreased by $30 million from 2020 to 2022, driven by reductions in both stock options and RSUs/PSUs expenses. ![Net earnings and stock-based expenses changes](image6)"}

However, the negative fair values also increased, suggesting higher risks. The total positive fair value recognized in the income statement in 2020 was 483 million DKK, while the total negative fair value was 1,318 million DKK. In 2019, the positive fair value recognized in the income statement was 116 million DKK, and the negative fair value was 445 million DKK.\n\n### Cash Flow Changes\n\nNext, let's examine the cash flow changes from the working capital adjustments in image5.\n\n**2020:**\n- **Inventories:** (895) million DKK\n- **Trade Receivables:** (2,822) million DKK\n- **Other Receivables and Prepayments:** (419) million DKK\n- **Trade Payables:** (641) million DKK\n- **Other Liabilities:** 1,274 million DKK\n- **Adjustment for Payables Related to Non-Current Assets:** 879 million DKK\n- **Adjustment Related to Divestment of Group Companies:** (42) million DKK\n- **Change in Working Capital Including Exchange Rate Adjustments:** (2,624) million DKK\n- **Exchange Rate Adjustments:** (1,729) million DKK\n- **Cash Flow Change in Working Capital:** (4,353) million DKK\n\n**2019:**\n- **Inventories:** (1,305) million DKK\n- **Trade Receivables:** (2,126) million DKK\n- **Other Receivables and Prepayments:** (1,190) million DKK\n- **Trade Payables:** (398) million DKK\n- **Other Liabilities:** 1,202 million DKK\n- **Adjustment for Payables Related to Non-Current Assets:** 295 million DKK\n- **Adjustment Related to Divestment of Group Companies:** (42) million DKK\n- **Change in Working Capital Including Exchange Rate Adjustments:** (3,564) million DKK\n- **Exchange Rate Adjustments:** 176 million DKK\n- **Cash Flow Change in Working Capital:** (3,388) million DKK\n\n### Analysis of Cash Flow Changes\n\nIn 2020, the company experienced a larger decrease in working capital compared to 2019, primarily driven by a significant decrease in inventories, trade receivables, and other receivables and prepayments. The negative impact on cash flow from working capital changes was more pronounced in 2020, with a decrease of 4,353 million DKK compared to 3,388 million DKK in 2019. The exchange rate adjustments also had a more negative impact in 2020, contributing to the overall decrease in cash flow.\n\n### Impact on Financial Statements\n\nThe increase in positive fair values of derivative financial instruments in 2020 suggests that the company benefited from favorable market conditions, which positively impacted the income statement. However, the higher negative fair values indicate increased risk exposure. The significant decrease in working capital, particularly in trade receivables and inventories, reduced the company's liquidity and cash flow, which could affect its ability to meet short-term obligations.\n\nIn conclusion, the derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes in 2020 and 2019 highlight the company's exposure to market risks and the impact of working capital adjustments on its financial health. ![Derivative financial instruments show a more favorable market position in 2020 but with increased risks.](image6) ![Working capital changes significantly reduced cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019.](image5) These financial elements collectively affect the company's financial statements by influencing both the income statement and the cash flow statement."}

According to the text, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 77 basis points compared to 2021 [7]. Specifically, the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 8.88% in 2022, down from 9.65% in 2021 and 10.04% in 2020. This trend indicates a significant reduction in SG&A expenses relative to net sales over the two-year period. ![SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased over the years](image1)\n\nNext, let's look at the Interest Income and Other, Net. The image data shows the following figures:\n- In 2022, the Interest Income and Other, Net was $7,392 million.\n- In 2021, it was $8,958 million.\n- In 2020, it was $8,861 million.\n\nThis data indicates that Interest Income and Other, Net decreased from 2021 to 2022 but remained relatively stable from 2020 to 2021.

This significant increase can be attributed to several factors, including the financing activities related to the acquisition of Varian, which contributed to a rise in financial liabilities [6].\n\nThe detailed breakdown of the changes in total financial debt from 2020 to 2021 is illustrated in the non-cash changes table, showing the effects from financing activities, acquisitions, foreign exchange rates, and other adjustments [image1].\n\nTherefore, the total financial debt increased by €8,812 million from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. ![Total financial debt increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

Specifically, the actuarial gains and losses were influenced by the changes in financial assumptions, which include factors like discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression.\n\nFor fiscal year 2021, the changes in financial assumptions led to a decrease in actuarial gains and losses by €26 million, compared to an increase of €72 million in fiscal year 2020. This shift can be attributed to the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in key financial assumptions, such as the discount rate, which significantly affects the present value of future benefits.\n\nThe discount rate, a crucial financial assumption, saw a slight increase from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the overall average, as shown in the discount rate table ![Discount rate changes](image1). This increase in the discount rate generally leads to a decrease in the present value of future liabilities, which can contribute to actuarial gains. However, the overall impact of financial assumptions, including other factors like compensation increases and pension progression, resulted in a net decrease in actuarial gains and losses for 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the sensitivity analysis provided in the document indicates that a half-percentage-point change in the discount rate can significantly affect the defined benefit obligation. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point would increase the defined benefit obligation by €242 million in 2021, while an increase would decrease it by €271 million. This sensitivity highlights the importance of financial assumptions in determining the actuarial gains and losses.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in financial assumptions, particularly the discount rate, contributed to a decrease in actuarial gains and losses by €26 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to an increase of €72 million in fiscal year 2020."}

This steady growth in comprehensive income reflects a positive financial performance over the three-year period.\n\nBreaking down the other comprehensive income (OCI) components, we can observe the following trends:\n- **Foreign Currency Translation**: This component saw a significant improvement from a loss of $(132,707)$ in 2019 to a gain of $197,696$ in 2020, indicating a favorable impact from currency fluctuations.\n- **Defined Benefit Plans**: There was a substantial improvement from a loss of $(253,039)$ in 2019 to a gain of $57,100$ in 2020, suggesting better management of pension obligations.\n- **Cash Flow Hedges**: This component fluctuated but showed a positive trend, moving from a gain of $123,003$ in 2019 to $24,721$ in 2020.\n- **Investments**: This component also showed a positive trend, moving from a loss of $(1,663)$ in 2019 to a gain of $(777)$ in 2020.\n\nThese OCI components collectively contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income, which in turn positively impacted shareholders' equity. For instance, the balance sheet data from the fiscal year 2018 to 2020 shows a consistent increase in total shareholders' equity, from $10,724,588 in 2018 to $17,499,173 in 2020. This growth in shareholders' equity is largely driven by the net income and the positive OCI components, which add to the retained earnings and other comprehensive income sections of the equity statement.\n\nAdditionally, the net income for the same period shows a steady increase from $4,214,594 in 2018 to $5,185,313 in 2020, further contributing to the growth in shareholders' equity. The comprehensive income attributable to Accenture plc also increased from $3,578,520 in 2018 to $5,386,579 in 2020, reinforcing the positive financial health of the company.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends in Accenture's comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020 reflect a strong financial performance, with significant improvements in foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, and other components, leading to a substantial increase in shareholders' equity. ![Comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components show a positive trend over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, contributing to the growth in shareholders' equity.](image1)"}

Shah and Mr. Lalit Bhasin received only sitting fees of 35,000 INR and 45,000 INR, respectively, for attending board meetings [3]. This indicates that non-executive directors were compensated primarily for their attendance at meetings rather than through a fixed salary or commission.\n\nThe company's financial performance and market conditions during the financial year 2002-03 can be gauged from the stock price movements and the comparison with the BSE Sensex. The normalized price/index chart shows that while the BSE Sensex experienced fluctuations, the company's stock price (GPI) generally followed a similar trend but with more volatility. For example, the GPI stock price ranged from a high of 420 INR in July 2002 to a low of 286 INR in March 2003 [4].\n\n![{GPI stock price fluctuated between 420 INR and 286 INR during the financial year 2002-03}](image4)\n\nThe company's financial statements were audited and found to be in compliance with the accounting standards and legal requirements, indicating that the financial performance was accurately reported [8].

The substantial rise in net earnings and comprehensive income is reflected in the increase in shareholders' equity. Specifically, the increase in shareholders' equity of $63,594 million is closely aligned with the increase in net earnings of $47,554 million and the increase in comprehensive income of $46,769 million.\n\nHowever, the increase in total liabilities of $21,461 million is relatively smaller compared to the increase in shareholders' equity. This suggests that the majority of the financial growth in 2021 was driven by retained earnings and other comprehensive income, rather than by an increase in debt.\n\n![{The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity aligns with the significant rise in net earnings and comprehensive income, indicating strong financial performance.}](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 are directly related to the substantial increases in net earnings and comprehensive income, reflecting Berkshire Hathaway's robust financial health and growth."}

This is evident in their commitment to maintaining a robust financial foundation, which includes the stable and continuous payment of dividends to shareholders, with a target consolidated payout ratio of 30% [10].\n\nTo understand the correlation between Toyota's financial strategy and its response to climate scenarios, we can look at the dividends paid over the years. The dividend per share has steadily increased from 210 yen in 2017 to 240 yen in 2021, reflecting Toyota's commitment to shareholder returns ![Steady increase in dividends over the years](image5).\n\nIn terms of electrification measures, Toyota recognizes the significant risks and opportunities posed by climate change, particularly the tightening of regulations for fuel efficiency and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) [1]. To address these challenges, Toyota has implemented several measures, including maintaining top-level fuel efficiency, increasing investment in batteries, and expanding the electrified vehicle lineup [4]. These actions are part of Toyota's broader strategy to enhance competitiveness and acquire new business opportunities [8].\n\nThe company's approach to electrification is further detailed in the climate scenarios. Under the below 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios, the percentage of electrified vehicles is expected to increase significantly. Toyota's measures include the large-scale introduction of renewable energy, expansion of carbon taxes, and the promotion of emission reductions in collaboration with suppliers [9]. These measures are designed to mitigate the risks associated with natural disasters and regulatory fines, while also capitalizing on the opportunities presented by increased demand for electrified vehicles [4].\n\nMoreover, Toyota's financial strategy supports these electrification measures through careful capital allocation and productivity improvements. By using cost reduction and the Toyota Production System (TPS), Toyota reinforces its profit structure and secures funds for investment in advanced technologies [6]. This ensures that the company can continue to innovate and stay ahead in the competitive automotive industry.\n\nIn conclusion, Toyota's financial strategy is closely aligned with its response to climate scenarios, ensuring both shareholder returns and effective electrification measures.

According to the data, the total amortisation and impairment loss for 2020 was DKK 1,446 million, compared to DKK 1,469 million in 2019 [8]. However, the specific breakdown of these losses provides more insight.\n\nFor intangible assets, the impairment loss in 2020 was DKK 350 million, significantly lower than the DKK 982 million recognized in 2019 [3]. This decrease in impairment losses suggests that the company's expectations for future cash flows from patents and licenses have improved, leading to a reduced need for impairment [4].\n\nThe net carrying amount of intangible assets at the end of 2020 was DKK 20,657 million, up from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 [6]. This increase is primarily due to the significant additions to the cost of intangible assets, particularly patents and licenses, which saw an increase from DKK 9,830 million in 2019 to DKK 25,340 million in 2020 [6]. Despite the lower impairment losses, the net carrying amount still increased, indicating that the company has invested heavily in new intangible assets.\n\nFor property, plant, and equipment, the depreciation for 2020 was DKK 964 million, slightly higher than the DKK 852 million recorded in 2019 [2]. The net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment at the end of 2020 was DKK 50,269 million, up from DKK 50,551 million in 2019 [6]. This slight decrease in the net carrying amount is due to the higher depreciation and the effect of exchange rate adjustments, which reduced the carrying amount by DKK 1,556 million [6].\n\nThe impact of these changes is evident in the financial statements. The higher depreciation and lower impairment losses in 2020 suggest a more stable financial position for the company's tangible assets. For intangible assets, the significant investments and reduced impairment losses indicate a positive outlook on the company's research and development projects and future market potential.\n\nIn conclusion, the depreciation and impairment losses have evolved with a slight increase in depreciation and a substantial decrease in impairment losses from 2019 to 2020, leading to an overall increase in the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and a slight decrease in the net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment. ![The net carrying amount of intangible assets increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, while the net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment slightly decreased.](image6)"}

However, in 2021, the premiums earned decreased slightly, possibly due to the continued impact of the pandemic and other market conditions [4].\n\nNext, let's examine the net investment income over the same period:\n\n- In 2019, net investment income was $5,530 million.\n- In 2020, net investment income was $5,039 million.\n- In 2021, net investment income was $4,807 million.\n\nThe net investment income shows a consistent decline from 2019 to 2021. This decline is primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2020 and 2021 [6]. The significant drop in interest and other investment income from 2019 to 2020 and further from 2020 to 2021 reflects the challenging investment environment during these years.\n\nTo visualize these trends, consider the following data points:\n\n- **Premiums Earned**:\n  - 2019: $4,869 million\n  - 2020: $5,861 million\n  - 2021: $5,648 million\n  ![{Premiums earned showed a significant increase from 2019 to 2020, followed by a slight decrease in 2021.}](image1)\n\n- **Net Investment Income**:\n  - 2019: $5,530 million\n  - 2020: $5,039 million\n  - 2021: $4,807 million\n  ![{Net investment income consistently declined from 2019 to 2021, reflecting lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.}](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, while premiums earned saw a significant increase from 2019 to 2020, they slightly decreased in 2021. On the other hand, net investment income experienced a continuous decline from 2019 to 2021, primarily due to low interest rates and reduced returns on short-term investments."}

According to the data, the total revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, was $17,098 million, while for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, it was $13,282 million [2]. This represents a significant increase of approximately 28.7% in total revenue from 2019 to 2020. The breakdown of this revenue by geography shows that the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific all saw increases in revenue, with the Americas contributing the most significant portion [2].\n\nNext, let's examine the unearned revenue. Unearned revenue, which represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition, also saw a substantial increase. At the beginning of fiscal year 2019, the unearned revenue was $6,995 million, and by the end of fiscal year 2020, it had increased to $10,662 million [4]. This represents a 52.4% increase in unearned revenue over the period.\n\nThe increase in unearned revenue can be attributed to several factors. One major factor is the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which added a significant amount to the unearned revenue balance [10]. Additionally, the company's standard billing terms are annual in advance, which means that a large portion of the revenue is recognized over time, leading to a buildup of unearned revenue [9].\n\nThe implications of these changes are significant. The substantial increase in total revenue indicates strong growth and demand for the company's products and services. This growth is likely driven by both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions, such as the Tableau acquisition, which has contributed to the company's revenue and unearned revenue balances [10].\n\nThe increase in unearned revenue suggests that the company has a strong pipeline of future revenue, which provides a level of financial stability and predictability. However, it also implies that the company needs to manage its revenue recognition processes effectively to ensure that the revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the contracts [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the total revenue increased by approximately 28.7% from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, and unearned revenue increased by 52.4% over the same period. These changes indicate robust growth and a strong future revenue pipeline for the company. ![{Unearned revenue increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, reflecting strong future revenue potential.}](image4)"}

The primary categories contributing to this decrease include:\n\n- **Pension and Other Retiree Benefits**: This category saw a significant reduction from $1,476 million in 2021 to $740 million in 2022, a decrease of $736 million. This substantial drop is likely due to changes in actuarial assumptions and discount rates, which can significantly affect the valuation of pension and retiree benefits [3].\n- **Loss and Other Carryforwards**: This category also decreased from $1,030 million in 2021 to $914 million in 2022, a reduction of $116 million.\n- **Valuation Allowances**: The valuation allowances increased from $(569) million in 2021 to $(409) million in 2022, reducing the overall deferred tax assets by $160 million.\n\n### Deferred Tax Liabilities\nThe total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022, an increase of $785 million. The primary categories contributing to this increase include:\n\n- **Goodwill and Intangible Assets**: This category saw a slight increase from $5,761 million in 2021 to $5,783 million in 2022, an increase of $22 million.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits**: This category increased significantly from $645 million in 2021 to $1,031 million in 2022, an increase of $386 million. This increase is likely due to changes in actuarial assumptions and discount rates [3].\n- **Unrealized Gain on Financial and Foreign Exchange Transactions**: This category increased from $111 million in 2021 to $439 million in 2022, an increase of $328 million. This significant rise suggests that the company experienced more favorable financial and foreign exchange conditions in 2022.\n\n### Visual Representation\nTo better visualize these changes, refer to the following images:\n\n- **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**:\n  - ![Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities](image3)\n  - This image provides a detailed breakdown of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for 2022 and 2021, highlighting the significant changes in pension and other retiree benefits, as well as the increase in other retiree benefits and unrealized gains on financial and foreign exchange transactions.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary categories contributing to the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities from 2021 to 2022 were pension and other retiree benefits, loss and other carryforwards, valuation allowances, goodwill and intangible assets, and unrealized gains on financial and foreign exchange transactions."}

The net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.4 billion, reaching $18.2 billion in 2020 [6]. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by receivables of $4.8 billion, which included sales of receivables and financing receivables [10].\n\nHowever, this positive trend was partially offset by performance-related declines within net income and increased workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million [10]. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19 also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities [10].\n\nOn the investing side, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion, primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32.3 billion, reflecting the absence of the Red Hat acquisition that occurred in the prior year [9]. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables of $6.2 billion, driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations [9].\n\nFinancing activities, however, saw a significant shift. In 2020, financing activities were a net use of cash of $9.721 billion, compared to a net source of cash of $9.042 billion in 2019 [8]. This year-to-year change of $18.763 billion was primarily driven by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and an increase in repayments of long-term debt [8].\n\nThe overall effect of these activities on IBM's cash position is reflected in the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.

The total revenues decreased by 10%, primarily reflecting sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [9]. This decline was partly offset by positive sales performance in the U.S., but it was not enough to counter the overall negative trend.\n\nThe total restaurant margins also saw a decrease of 13%, which was driven by the significant sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment [8]. The U.S. market showed some resilience, but the overall margins were negatively affected by the pandemic-related expenses, such as employee costs, personal protective equipment, and additional safety measures [10].\n\nTo visualize the changes in restaurant margins, we can see from the data that the U.S. margins decreased by 3%, while the International Operated Markets margins dropped by 19% [image2]. The total restaurant margins, combining both U.S. and international markets, show a clear decline, reflecting the broader economic challenges faced during the pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, the company's efforts to support recovery and drive growth, such as providing marketing incentives and free meals to first responders, further impacted the margins [2]. Despite these challenges, the company's heavily franchised business model, where 93% of restaurants are franchised, helped to maintain some stability in revenue streams [4].\n\nIn summary, the total revenues and restaurant margins declined in 2020, primarily due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international markets and the associated operational and marketing expenses. ![Total restaurant margins decreased significantly in 2020, especially in the International Operated Markets segment](image2)"}

According to the financial data, Comcast's total revenue increased from $103,564 million in 2020 to $116,385 million in 2021, representing a 12.4% increase [4]. This growth can be attributed to several factors, as detailed in the segment-specific data.\n\n### Revenue Changes by Segment\n- **Cable Communications**: Revenue increased from $60,051 million in 2020 to $64,328 million in 2021, a 7.1% increase [2]. This growth was driven by increases in broadband, wireless, business services, and advertising revenues.\n- **NBCUniversal**: Revenue increased from $27,381 million in 2020 to $31,081 million in 2021, a 13.5% increase [4]. This was primarily due to higher revenues in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [2].\n- **Sky**: Revenue increased from $17,132 million in 2020 to $19,773 million in 2021, a 15.4% increase [4]. This growth was mainly due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs [2].\n\n### Operating Expense Changes by Segment\n- **Cable Communications**: Operating costs and expenses increased from $34,781 million in 2020 to $36,231 million in 2021, a 4.2% increase [2]. Key drivers include increases in programming, technical and product support, and franchise and other regulatory fees [2].\n- **NBCUniversal**: Operating costs and expenses increased from $24,978 million in 2020 to $27,620 million in 2021, a 10.6% increase [4]. This was due to higher programming and production costs, as well as increased advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses [2].\n- **Sky**: Operating costs and expenses increased from $13,145 million in 2020 to $14,524 million in 2021, a 10.5% increase [4]. The rise was primarily due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs [2].\n\n### Corporate and Other\n- **Corporate and Other**: Operating costs and expenses decreased significantly from $1,314 million in 2020 to $147 million in 2021, a 89.0% decrease [4]. This reduction was mainly due to severance charges related to businesses in the prior year period [2].\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe changes in revenue and operating costs across different segments are also illustrated in the graphs. The graph in Image 3 shows the percentage change in Adjusted EBITDA for each segment, highlighting the significant growth in Sky and NBCUniversal, while Cable Communications showed a slight increase [3].\n\n![Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA changes across segments](image3)\n\nIn summary, the main contributors to the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue and operating expenses from 2020 to 2021 were the strong performance in the Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, and Sky segments, with notable increases in programming, technical support, and marketing expenses.

This increase can be attributed to several factors, including higher net earnings and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Specifically, the net earnings increased from $13.103 billion in 2020 to $14.793 billion in 2022, while the number of diluted shares decreased from 2,625.8 million in 2020 to 2,539.1 million in 2022. ![{Net earnings per share increased from 2020 to 2022}](image3)\n\nThe combination of these trends indicates that Procter & Gamble has been effective in managing its expenses, particularly in stock-based compensation, while simultaneously increasing its profitability and shareholder value.

According to the balance sheet data provided in the image, the balance at September 26, 2021, shows a total of $6,523 million, while the balance at September 27, 2020, shows a total of $6,323 million. This indicates an increase in the total balance from 2020 to 2021. However, the specific foreign currency translation adjustments are not explicitly broken down in the image, so we can infer that the overall increase in the total balance might include some foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nNext, let's look at the components of income before income taxes. The image provides a breakdown of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In 2021, the U.S. component was $8,781 million, and the foreign component was $1,493 million, totaling $10,274 million. In 2020, the U.S. component was $5,004 million, and the foreign component was $715 million, totaling $5,719 million.\n\nFrom this, we can see that there was a significant increase in both the U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes from 2020 to 2021. Specifically:\n- The U.S. component increased from $5,004 million in 2020 to $8,781 million in 2021, an increase of $3,777 million.\n- The foreign component increased from $715 million in 2020 to $1,493 million in 2021, an increase of $778 million.\n\nThese increases suggest a substantial improvement in both domestic and international operations, contributing to the overall growth in income before income taxes.\n\nIn summary, the foreign currency translation adjustments likely contributed to the overall increase in the total balance, and the components of income before income taxes saw a significant rise, particularly in the U.S. component, from 2020 to 2021. ![{The balance sheet data shows an increase in total balance from 2020 to 2021, indicating potential foreign currency translation adjustments.}](image1) ![{The components of income before income taxes show a significant increase in both U.S. and foreign components from 2020 to 2021.}](image2)\n\nThe changes in the foreign currency translation adjustments and the components of income before income taxes from 2020 to 2021 indicate a substantial improvement in both domestic and international financial performance."}

In 2019, the total shareholders' equity was $22,984 million, and by 2021, it decreased slightly to $22,177 million [3]. The primary components of shareholders' equity include common shares, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n### Breakdown of Shareholders' Equity Changes\n\n1. **Common Shares**:\n   - **2019**: 805 million shares\n   - **2021**: 761 million shares\n   - **Change**: Decrease of 44 million shares\n\n2. **Additional Paid-in Capital**:\n   - **2019**: $11,881 million\n   - **2021**: $11,495 million\n   - **Change**: Decrease of $386 million\n\n3. **Retained Earnings**:\n   - **2019**: $13,837 million\n   - **2021**: $13,474 million\n   - **Change**: Decrease of $363 million\n\n4. **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n   - **2019**: $(2,895) million\n   - **2021**: $(2,945) million\n   - **Change**: Decrease of $50 million\n\n### Impact on Comprehensive Income\n\nComprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The other comprehensive income (loss) is influenced by various factors, including net unrealized gains/losses on debt securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits.\n\n- **Net Income**:\n  - **2019**: $3,135 million\n  - **2021**: $8,060 million\n  - **Change**: Increase of $4,925 million\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n  - **2019**: $(158) million\n  - **2021**: $(50) million\n  - **Change**: Increase of $108 million\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Net Unrealized Debt Securities Gains (Losses)**:\n   - **2019**: $32 million\n   - **2021**: $(42) million\n   - **Change**: Decrease of $74 million\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**:\n   - **2019**: $(40) million\n   - **2021**: $(163) million\n   - **Change**: Decrease of $123 million\n\n3. **Net Unrealized Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits**:\n   - **2019**: $(150) million\n   - **2021**: $155 million\n   - **Change**: Increase of $305 million\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in shareholders' equity, particularly the decreases in common shares, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, contributed to a slight overall decrease in total shareholders' equity from 2019 to 2021. However, the comprehensive income increased significantly from $2,977 million in 2019 to $8,010 million in 2021, primarily driven by the substantial increase in net income and a smaller improvement in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $50 million from 2019 to 2021 is a minor factor compared to the large increase in net income, which had a more significant positive impact on comprehensive income. ![The comprehensive income increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, primarily driven by a substantial increase in net income and a smaller improvement in other comprehensive income.](image5)"}

This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Tax Incentives and Agreements**: The company may have benefited from tax incentives or agreements in foreign jurisdictions, reducing its tax burden despite higher income. For instance, the text quote [4] mentions tax incentives in Singapore that require meeting specified employment and other criteria. Failure to meet these criteria could result in the need to refund previously realized tax benefits.\n\n2. **Tax Planning and Optimization**: The company likely engaged in strategic tax planning to optimize its tax liabilities.

Text quote [8] notes that the pandemic negatively impacted certain investments, which could have affected the company's overall tax position.\n\n4. **Changes in Tax Regulations**: Regulatory changes in foreign jurisdictions could have impacted the company's tax provision. For example, the text quote [10] mentions expected refunds of Korean withholding tax and the derecognition of deferred tax assets due to changes in tax regulations.\n\nGiven these changes, the company's financial strategy might focus on:\n\n- **Continued Tax Optimization**: Leveraging tax incentives and agreements to minimize tax liabilities while maximizing profitability.\n- **Strategic Investment**: Investing in regions with favorable tax environments to enhance financial performance.\n- **Risk Management**: Ensuring compliance with tax regulations and managing the risks associated with tax audits and legal proceedings, as highlighted in text quote [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the foreign income before taxes increased from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, while the foreign tax provision decreased from $1,158 million in 2019 to $518 million in 2021. These changes suggest a strategic focus on tax optimization and risk management to enhance the company's financial performance."}

This decrease can be attributed to several factors:\n- **Outflows**: There were outflows of $96.8 billion, primarily driven by the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a significant reduction in managed assets.\n- **Market Impact**: Despite positive market impacts of $11.6 billion, these gains were not enough to offset the outflows.\n- **Inflows**: Inflows of $69.3 billion were also recorded, but they were insufficient to counterbalance the outflows and market impacts.\n\n![{WFAM assets under management decreased by $15.9 billion from 2020 to 2021 due to significant outflows and the sale of WFAM.}](image1)\n\n### Changes in Available-for-Sale Securities\nThe available-for-sale (AFS) securities also experienced notable changes:\n- **Amortized Cost**: The amortized cost of AFS securities decreased from $215,533 million at the end of 2020 to $175,463 million at the end of 2021, a reduction of $40,070 million.\n- **Net Unrealized Gains**: The net unrealized gains on AFS securities decreased significantly from $4,859 million at the end of 2020 to $1,781 million at the end of 2021, a decrease of $3,078 million.

According to the data, the discount rates for Germany and the United States are as follows:\n\n- **Germany**: \n  - 2021: 1.7%\n  - 2020: 1.5%\n- **United States**:\n  - 2021: 2.7%\n  - 2020: 2.4%\n\nThese rates have increased slightly in both countries from 2020 to 2021, which generally leads to a decrease in the present value of future liabilities [4]. \n\nNext, let's consider the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and the fair value of plan assets for both countries:\n\n- **Germany**:\n  - DBO: \n    - 2021: 2,033 million €\n    - 2020: 2,007 million €\n  - Fair Value of Plan Assets:\n    - 2021: 1,318 million €\n    - 2020: 1,216 million €\n- **United States**:\n  - DBO:\n    - 2021: 986 million €\n    - 2020: 1,050 million €\n  - Fair Value of Plan Assets:\n    - 2021: 948 million €\n    - 2020: 937 million €\n\nThe DBO for Germany has slightly increased, while the fair value of plan assets has also increased, indicating a better-funded position. In contrast, the DBO for the United States has decreased, but the fair value of plan assets has also increased, suggesting a more stable or improving funded status [3].\n\nThe actuarial gains and losses also play a significant role in the financial health of these plans. For both countries, the total actuarial gains and losses are as follows:\n\n- **Germany**:\n  - Total Actuarial Gains/Losses:\n    - 2021: -22 million €\n    - 2020: 67 million €\n- **United States**:\n  - Total Actuarial Gains/Losses:\n    - 2021: -22 million €\n    - 2020: 67 million €\n\nBoth countries experienced actuarial losses in 2021, which can be attributed to changes in demographic and financial assumptions, as well as experience gains and losses [2].\n\nFinally, the mortality tables used in the actuarial assumptions provide insights into the expected lifespan of plan participants, which affects the calculation of future liabilities. For Germany and the United States, the mortality tables are:\n\n- **Germany**:\n  - 2021: Siemens-specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2021)\n  - 2020: Siemens-specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2020)\n- **United States**:\n  - 2021: Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions\n  - 2020: Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions\n\nThese tables are consistent over the two years, indicating a stable approach to estimating future lifespans and thus the duration of pension obligations [5].\n\nIn summary, the key differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators affecting the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 include slight increases in discount rates, changes in the defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, and actuarial losses in 2021. Both countries have maintained consistent mortality tables, reflecting a stable approach to long-term projections. ![Discount rates for Germany and the United States](image4)"}

According to the data in image2, the net operating income for this segment in 2020 was $1,744 million, a decrease of $82 million or 4% compared to 2019. The profit before tax for this segment is not explicitly provided, but the overall trend suggests a slight decline in performance [image2].\n\nNext, the **Credit and Lending** segment shows a net operating income of $5,640 million in 2020, an increase of $219 million or 4% compared to 2019. This indicates a positive performance in this segment, likely driven by strong lending activities [image2].\n\nThe **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** segment experienced a significant decline in net operating income, dropping to $4,178 million in 2020 from $5,932 million in 2019, a decrease of $1,754 million or 30%. This substantial drop could be attributed to lower interest rates and adverse market conditions [image2].\n\nFor the **Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other** segment, the net operating income was $1,596 million in 2020, down by $427 million or 21% from 2019. This decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates, reduced revenue from insurance and investments, and fewer revaluation gains on shares [image2, 5].\n\nThe **Global Markets** segment saw a significant improvement in net operating income, increasing to $7,290 million in 2020 from $5,728 million in 2019, a rise of $1,562 million or 27%. This strong performance is attributed to robust foreign exchange and credit activities [image8].\n\nFinally, the **Global Banking** segment had a net operating income of $3,804 million in 2020, a slight decrease of $71 million or 2% from 2019. This minor decline suggests stable performance despite challenging market conditions [image8].\n\nIn terms of profit before tax, the overall adjusted profit before tax for the entire bank was $4,830 million in 2020, a decrease of $342 million or 7% from 2019. This decline is largely due to higher expected credit losses (ECL) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic [image5, 4].\n\nTo summarize, the **Global Markets** segment showed the most significant improvement in net operating income, while the **Global Liquidity and Cash Management** segment experienced the most substantial decline. The overall profit before tax for the bank decreased, reflecting the broader economic challenges faced in 2020. ![Overall, the Global Markets segment performed strongly, while Global Liquidity and Cash Management saw a significant decline.](image8)"}

This growth was primarily driven by increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which rose from $467,068 million to $527,748 million, a 13% increase [1]. Interest-bearing demand deposits also saw a modest 4% increase from $447,446 million to $465,887 million [1]. Savings deposits increased by 9%, from $404,935 million to $439,600 million [1]. However, time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices declined significantly, with time deposits decreasing by 41% from $49,775 million to $29,461 million and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices dropping by 44% from $35,157 million to $19,783 million [1].\n\nThese changes suggest that the financial entity has been focusing on increasing its core deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which are generally more stable and less costly to maintain. The reduction in time deposits and non-U.S. deposits indicates a strategic move to reduce reliance on more volatile and potentially higher-cost funding sources.\n\n### Loan Changes\nIn terms of loans, the total loan portfolio increased slightly from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, a 0.9% increase [5]. This overall increase was driven by a significant rise in commercial loans, which grew from $478,417 million to $513,120 million, a 7.3% increase [5]. On the other hand, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million to $382,274 million, a 6.6% decline [5].\n\nThe increase in commercial loans, particularly in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, suggests that the financial entity is capitalizing on higher loan demand in the business sector [1]. This aligns with the economic recovery and improved business conditions, leading to increased originations and loan draws. Conversely, the decrease in consumer loans, especially in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, reflects the low interest rate environment and the transfer of a significant portion of these loans to loans held for sale [1]. This strategy likely aims to optimize the balance sheet by selling off certain assets and reducing exposure to potential risks in the consumer lending market.\n\n### Strategic Inferences\nThe changes in both deposits and loans indicate a strategic focus on stability and risk management. By increasing core deposits and reducing reliance on volatile funding sources, the financial entity is positioning itself to weather potential economic uncertainties. The shift towards commercial lending and away from consumer lending, particularly in the residential mortgage sector, suggests a proactive approach to managing credit risk and capitalizing on more profitable opportunities in the commercial market.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial entity has strategically increased its core deposits while reducing volatile funding sources and has shifted its lending focus towards the commercial sector to optimize its balance sheet and manage risk effectively."}

The Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating performance that excludes certain non-operational items such as interest, taxes, and depreciation, providing a clearer picture of core business performance.\n\n### Segment Analysis\n\n#### Cable Communications Segment\nThe Cable Communications segment saw significant changes in its Adjusted EBITDA. The segment's Adjusted EBITDA increased from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital [2]. Additionally, there was an increase in programming expenses, technical and product support costs, franchise and other regulatory fees, and advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses [3].\n\n#### NBCUniversal Segment\nThe NBCUniversal segment experienced an increase in expenses due to higher costs in the Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments [3]. However, the overall Adjusted EBITDA for NBCUniversal improved from 2020 to 2021, driven by the recovery in the entertainment industry and the successful broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics [5].\n\n#### Sky Segment\nThe Sky segment saw an increase in expenses, particularly in direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs [3]. The Adjusted EBITDA for Sky improved from 2020 to 2021, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, due to cost-saving measures and the launch of new products like Sky Glass and XClass TV [7].\n\n#### Corporate and Other\nThe Corporate and Other segment saw a decrease in expenses, primarily due to severance charges related to business restructuring in the prior year [3]. The Adjusted EBITDA for this segment also improved, reflecting the cost savings realized from these initiatives [7].\n\n### Visual Representation\nTo better visualize the changes in Adjusted EBITDA across the segments, consider the following chart:\n\n![{Adjusted EBITDA trends across segments from 2019 to 2021}](image2)\n\nThis chart shows the Adjusted EBITDA for each year, highlighting the overall improvement from 2020 to 2021, despite a slight dip from 2019 levels.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation showed a slight increase from 2020 to 2021, driven by improvements in the Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. The recovery in the entertainment industry, cost-saving measures, and strategic investments in scalable infrastructure and new products contributed to these positive trends."}

Specifically, the adjusted revenue for GBM increased by $1,562 million, or 27%, compared to 2019 [image6].\n\nHowever, within the Global Banking segment, revenue decreased by $71 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [6].

According to the text, interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which itself declined by $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019 [2]. This significant drop is primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. The company continues to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, but low interest rates prevalent through 2021 resulted in significantly lower interest income.\n\nAdditionally, the decline in after-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021, which decreased by 4.6% compared to 2020 and 8.9% in 2020 versus 2019, further reflects the impact of declining interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills [3].\n\nThe asset allocations also provide insights into these changes.

However, this increase in liquidity did not translate into higher investment income due to the persistently low interest rates.\n\nFurthermore, the allocation to fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction in these types of investments, likely due to their lower yields in a low-interest-rate environment [image1].\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by lower interest rates affecting short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as reflected in the company's increased holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills and the reduction in fixed maturity securities. ![Low interest rates and increased liquidity holdings contributed to the decline in net investment income.](image1)"}

This decrease is attributed to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 following the acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019 [1].\n\n4. **Other Income**:\n   - Other income increased from $36 million in 2019 to $40 million in 2020, primarily due to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020 [1].\n\n5. **Interest Expense**:\n   - Interest expense remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $96 million in 2019 to $93 million in 2020 [1].\n\n6. **General and Administrative Expenses**:\n   - General and administrative expenses were consistent, with a slight decrease from $52 million in 2019 to $49 million in 2020 [1].\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe changes in net income and comprehensive income can also be visualized from the financial statements:\n\n- **Net Income**:\n  - ![Net income increased from 2018 to 2020](image1)\n\n- **Comprehensive Income**:\n  - ![Comprehensive income slightly decreased from 2018 to 2020](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the net income increased by $10 million from 2018 to 2020, while the comprehensive income attributable to the partnership decreased by $2 million. The main contributing factors include the significant increase in income from equity method investments, offset by a decrease in dividend income due to changes in accounting methods."}

According to the financial data, the Adjusted EBIT for 2021 was €3,142 million, up from €2,248 million in 2020 [2]. This increase can be attributed to the strong performance of the newly acquired Varian segment, which contributed €221 million to the Adjusted EBIT during the period from April 15 to September 30, 2021 [2]. Additionally, the overall adjusted EBIT margin improved from 15.5% in 2020 to 17.4% in 2021, with Varian's adjusted EBIT margin being a very high 17.0% [3].\n\n![{Varian's contribution to Adjusted EBIT is evident in the fiscal year 2021 data, showing a significant increase compared to 2020.}](image2)\n\nMoreover, the acquisition also impacted the company's net assets.

Specifically, the net price impact, which includes the change in sales prices, contributed US$16,095 million to the Underlying EBITDA for FY2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG [10]. ![Higher average realized prices for key commodities significantly boosted Underlying EBITDA](image1)\n\n### Impact of Operating Cash Costs\nOn the other hand, the change in operating cash costs had a minimal negative impact on Underlying EBITDA. The operating cash costs increased by US$34 million, which is relatively small compared to the overall increase in EBITDA. This increase was due to higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam and Nickel West, as well as additional costs associated with the ramp-up of South Flank. However, this was largely offset by strong cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across BHP's assets, lower technology costs, and a gain from the optimized outcome of renegotiated power contracts at Escondida and Spence [10]. ![Operating cash costs had a minor negative impact on Underlying EBITDA](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the significant increase in BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021 was primarily driven by the substantial rise in sales prices, while the impact of operating cash costs was relatively minor and largely offset by cost-saving measures."}

These charges had a substantial impact on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders.\n\nTo understand the impact more clearly, let's look at the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders over the two years. According to the financial data, the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders in 2020 was $11,221,000, compared to $37,043,000 in 2019 [image1].

The primary reason for this decrease can be attributed to the specific events mentioned in the text [7]. In 2019, unallocated revenues were primarily from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers, while in 2021, the unallocated revenues were from the release of a variable constraint against revenues not previously allocated to segment results.\n\n- **Unallocated Expenses**:\n  - **Cost of Revenues**:\n    - 2019: $(430) million\n    - 2021: $(277) million\n  - **Research and Development Expenses**:\n    - 2019: $(989) million\n    - 2021: $(1,820) million\n  - **Selling, General and Administrative Expenses**:\n    - 2019: $(413) million\n    - 2021: $(538) million\n  - **Interest Expense**:\n    - 2019: $(619) million\n    - 2021: $(559) million\n  - **Investment and Other Income, Net**:\n    - 2019: $243 million\n    - 2021: $166 million\n\n  Overall, the unallocated research and development expenses increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, while other expenses like cost of revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses, and interest expense remained relatively stable or showed minor changes.\n\n### Net Assets Acquired During the Acquisition of NUVIA\n\nFrom the provided data [image4], the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021 are as follows:\n\n- **Cash**: $174 million\n- **In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)**: $247 million\n- **Goodwill**: $885 million\n- **Other Assets**: $26 million\n- **Total Assets Acquired**: $1,332 million\n- **Liabilities**: $(68) million\n- **Net Assets Acquired**: $1,264 million\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe changes in unallocated revenues and expenses from 2019 to 2021 show a significant decrease in unallocated revenues, primarily due to the specific events in 2019, such as the settlement with Apple. In contrast, the net assets acquired during the acquisition of NUVIA in 2021 amounted to $1,264 million, which is a substantial but more controlled financial event compared to the large fluctuations in unallocated revenues.\n\nIn summary, the significant decrease in unallocated revenues from 2019 to 2021 is primarily due to specific one-time events, while the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition in 2021 represent a strategic investment with a more stable financial impact. ![Unallocated revenues and expenses showed significant changes from 2019 to 2021, with a notable decrease in unallocated revenues and an increase in research and development expenses.](image1)"}

This improvement in net operating income can be attributed to the strong performance in Global Markets, particularly in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), which saw a significant 33% increase in revenue [10].

The higher ECL charges were a direct result of the economic uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly affecting regions such as Europe, MENA, and North and Latin America [3].\n\nAdditionally, the division faced challenges in segments like Global Banking, where revenue decreased by 2%, reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [4]. Despite these headwinds, the division managed to reduce operating expenses by $280 million, or 3%, through cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay [8]. These cost-saving measures helped to mitigate some of the negative impacts on profitability.\n\nIn summary, the GBM division's net operating income increased by 3% in 2020, driven by strong performance in Global Markets, but profit before tax decreased by 7% due to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges. ![Higher ECL and credit impairment charges significantly impacted profit before tax](image2)"}

According to the data:\n\n- **Standardized Approach:**\n  - December 31, 2020: $1,480 billion [2]\n  - December 31, 2019: $1,493 billion [2]\n\n- **Advanced Approaches:**\n  - December 31, 2020: $1,374 billion [2]\n  - December 31, 2019: $1,447 billion [2]\n\nFrom this, we can see that the RWA under the standardized approach decreased slightly from $1,493 billion in 2019 to $1,480 billion in 2020. Under the advanced approaches, the RWA also decreased, but more significantly, from $1,447 billion in 2019 to $1,374 billion in 2020.\n\nNext, let's examine the TLAC ratios and compare them to the regulatory minimums. The regulatory minimums for TLAC are as follows:\n\n- **TLAC RWA Regulatory Minimum:** 18.0% + 2.5% + 1.5% = 22.0% [1]\n- **TLAC Supplementary Leverage Exposure Regulatory Minimum:** 7.5% + 2.0% = 9.5% [1]\n\nNow, let's look at the TLAC ratios for both years and approaches:\n\n- **Standardized Approach:**\n  - December 31, 2020: 27.4% [image5]\n  - December 31, 2019: 24.6% [image5]\n\n- **Advanced Approaches:**\n  - December 31, 2020: 14.5% [image5]\n  - December 31, 2019: 11.5% [image5]\n\nFor the standardized approach, the TLAC ratio increased from 24.6% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020, which is well above the regulatory minimum of 22.0%. For the advanced approaches, the TLAC ratio also increased from 11.5% in 2019 to 14.5% in 2020, but it remains below the regulatory minimum of 22.0%.\n\nAdditionally, the long-term debt (LTD) ratios are as follows:\n\n- **Standardized Approach:**\n  - December 31, 2020: 13.3% [image5]\n  - December 31, 2019: 11.5% [image5]\n\n- **Advanced Approaches:**\n  - December 31, 2020: 7.4% [image5]\n  - December 31, 2019: 5.8% [image5]\n\nThe LTD ratio under the standardized approach increased from 11.5% in 2019 to 13.3% in 2020, which is above the regulatory minimum of 8.5%. Under the advanced approaches, the LTD ratio also increased from 5.8% in 2019 to 7.4% in 2020, but it remains below the regulatory minimum of 8.5%.\n\nIn summary, the risk-weighted assets decreased under both the standardized and advanced approaches from 2019 to 2020. The TLAC ratios under the standardized approach increased and are well above the regulatory minimum, while the TLAC ratios under the advanced approaches increased but remain below the regulatory minimum. Similarly, the LTD ratios under the standardized approach increased and are above the regulatory minimum, while the LTD ratios under the advanced approaches increased but remain below the regulatory minimum. ![Risk-weighted assets and TLAC ratios comparison](image5)"}

The net income for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 can be found in the following quotes:\n\n- For 2018: \"Balance, December 31, 2018\" [3]\n- For 2019: \"Balance, December 31, 2019\" [9]\n- For 2020: \"Balance, December 31, 2020\" [8]\n\nHowever, the exact net income figures are not explicitly stated in these quotes. To get a more detailed view, we can refer to the financial statements summarized in the images.\n\nFrom **image2**, we can see the net income figures for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020:\n\n- 2018: $6,139 million\n- 2019: $6,649 million\n- 2020: $7,189 million\n\nThis shows that the net income increased from 2018 to 2020, with a steady growth trend.\n\nNext, let's examine the retained earnings. Retained earnings are influenced by net income, dividends, and other comprehensive income. The significant factors affecting retained earnings include:\n\n- **Dividends Declared and Paid**: The dividends declared and paid per share for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are mentioned in the quotes:\n  - 2018: $2.63 per share [3]\n  - 2019: $3.21 per share [9]\n  - 2020: $3.72 per share [8]\n\n- **Stock Repurchases**: The company also engaged in stock repurchases, which affect retained earnings:\n  - 2018: Not explicitly stated in the provided quotes.\n  - 2019: Not explicitly stated in the provided quotes.\n  - 2020: $2.6 billion [6]\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: This can also impact retained earnings:\n  - 2018: Not explicitly stated in the provided quotes.\n  - 2019: Not explicitly stated in the provided quotes.\n  - 2020: Not explicitly stated in the provided quotes.\n\nTo summarize the changes in retained earnings, we can infer from the net income and dividends paid:\n\n- **2018 to 2019**: Net income increased from $6,139 million to $6,649 million, but dividends also increased from $2.63 per share to $3.21 per share. This suggests a moderate increase in retained earnings.\n- **2019 to 2020**: Net income further increased from $6,649 million to $7,189 million, and dividends increased from $3.21 per share to $3.72 per share. This indicates another moderate increase in retained earnings.\n\nAdditionally, the company's strong cash flow and capital management strategy, including share repurchases and dividend increases, played a significant role in these changes. The company's robust balance sheet and free cash flow generation also contributed to the overall financial health and retained earnings growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's net income and retained earnings both increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by steady growth in net income and managed by increasing dividends and share repurchases. ![Net income and retained earnings increased steadily from 2018 to 2020](image2)"}

Specifically, the risk-based commercial business saw a decrease of 665,000 individuals, representing an 8% drop, and the fee-based commercial business saw a decrease of 875,000 individuals, a 5% reduction. This decline can be attributed to increased unemployment and related attrition, as mentioned in the text [10].\n\nFor the **Medicare Advantage** segment, there was a positive trend with an increase of 440,000 individuals, or 8%. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing number of people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans, as noted in the text [10].\n\nThe **Medicaid** segment also saw an increase of 720,000 individuals, or 12%. This growth is attributed to states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and an increase in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans, as stated in the text [10].\n\nHowever, the **Global** segment experienced a decrease of 295,000 individuals, or 5%.

For Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022, and the expected return on plan assets remained unchanged at 8.4% [2].\n\nThese changes can significantly impact the net amount recognized for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits. A decrease in the discount rate for Pension Benefits from 3.7% to 1.7% would increase the present value of future benefit obligations, leading to a higher liability. This is reflected in the net amount recognized, which decreased from $(5,428) million in 2021 to $(2,435) million in 2022 [1]. Similarly, the decrease in the expected return on plan assets from 6.5% to 5.5% would reduce the expected investment income, further increasing the net amount recognized.\n\nFor Other Retiree Benefits, the increase in the discount rate from 3.2% to 5.0% would decrease the present value of future benefit obligations, leading to a lower liability. This is reflected in the net amount recognized, which increased from $2,238 million in 2021 to $3,819 million in 2022 [1]. The unchanged expected return on plan assets at 8.4% suggests no change in the expected investment income, which helps stabilize the net amount recognized.\n\nTo visualize the changes in the net amount recognized, consider the following table from the financial statements:\n\n| Classification | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Noncurrent assets | $765 | $88 |\n| Current liabilities | $(61) | $(64) |\n| Noncurrent liabilities | $(3,139) | $(5,452) |\n| NET AMOUNT RECOGNIZED | $(2,435) | $(5,428) |\n| Net actuarial loss/(gain) | $1,906 | $4,869 |\n| Prior service cost/(credit) | $170 | $198 |\n\n![{The net amount recognized for Pension Benefits improved from $(5,428) million in 2021 to $(2,435) million in 2022, while for Other Retiree Benefits, it increased from $2,238 million in 2021 to $3,819 million in 2022.}](image1)\n\nIn summary, the changes in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets had a significant impact on the net amount recognized for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits, reflecting the increased liability for Pension Benefits and the decreased liability for Other Retiree Benefits."}

According to the data, NBCUniversal's Media segment revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion in 2021 [1]. However, this increase was partly due to the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which contributed $1.8 billion to the revenue. Excluding this, the revenue still saw an 11.0% increase, driven by growth in distribution, advertising, and other revenue [1].\n\nThe Studios segment also showed a positive trend, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to $9.4 billion in 2021, primarily due to increases in content licensing, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment [1]. This indicates a strong recovery in film and television production operations following the disruptions caused by the pandemic.\n\nHowever, the Theme Parks segment saw the most dramatic improvement, with revenue increasing by 141.2% to $5.1 billion in 2021. This significant increase reflects the reopening of theme parks after temporary closures and capacity restrictions due to COVID-19, as well as the opening of a new theme park in Beijing, China [1].\n\nNow, let's examine the customer relationships. The total customer relationships for NBCUniversal's Media segment experienced a slight decline from 23,224 in 2020 to 23,027 in 2021, a net loss of 198,000 customers [image1]. Despite this, the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, representing an 8.7% increase [image2]. This suggests that while the number of customers slightly decreased, the revenue per customer improved, likely due to rate adjustments and changes in service offerings.\n\nThese revenue and customer relationship trends collectively impacted NBCUniversal's financial performance. The increase in revenue across multiple segments, particularly the significant rebound in the Theme Parks segment, contributed to an overall positive financial performance. However, the slight decline in customer relationships, especially in Italy due to reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, partially offset these gains [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the financial performance of NBCUniversal from 2019 to 2021 was positively influenced by strong revenue growth in the Media and Studios segments, as well as a significant recovery in the Theme Parks segment. The slight decline in customer relationships was mitigated by an increase in average revenue per customer, leading to an overall improvement in financial performance. ![{Revenue and customer relationships trends positively impacted NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2019 to 2021.}](image1)"}

The committee oversees the development of a diverse pipeline, considering both unforeseen departures and the orderly replacement of current board members. This process involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Rigorous Approach**: The Nomination and Governance Committee adopts a structured and rigorous approach to succession planning, considering factors such as board diversity, size, tenure, and the necessary skills, experience, and attributes needed to effectively govern and manage risk within BHP [2]. This ensures a balanced mix of experience and fresh perspectives on the board ![{The Nomination and Governance Committee considers Board diversity, size, tenure, and the skills, experience, and attributes needed to effectively govern and manage risk within BHP.}](image2).\n\n2. **Continuous Process**: The succession planning process is continuous, with a focus on maintaining a nine-year tenure as a guide. This helps the board maintain the right balance between experienced and new members, ensuring the board remains fit-for-purpose and adaptable to changing external environments and BHP's circumstances [2]. The committee also prepares pipelines for Nomination and Governance Committee membership, considering relevant skills and requirements [2].\n\n3. **Role Description Preparation**: When new appointments are needed, the committee oversees the preparation of a detailed role description. This document includes the criteria and attributes described in the Board Governance Document and section 2.1.7, ensuring that the search for new directors is thorough and aligned with BHP's needs [2].\n\n4. **Selection and Appointment of Search Firm**: The role description is provided to an external search firm, which conducts a global search based on the board's criteria. This step ensures that the pool of candidates is diverse and highly qualified [2].\n\n5. **Board Interviews**: Shortlisted candidates are considered by the Nomination and Governance Committee and initially interviewed by the Chair. Selected candidates then meet with each board member, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of their suitability [2].\n\n6. **Committee Recommendation**: After the interviews, the Nomination and Governance Committee recommends the preferred candidate to the board for final approval [2].\n\n7. **Background Checks**: The board, with the assistance of external consultants, conducts thorough background and reference checks to ensure the integrity and suitability of the candidate [2].\n\n8. **Letter of Appointment**: Once the candidate is approved, a letter of appointment is issued, outlining the terms of the Non-executive Director's appointment. This includes details on independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement [2].\n\nAdditionally, the Nomination and Governance Committee oversees the continuous improvement and development of Non-executive Directors. This includes:\n\n- **Induction Program**: New Non-executive Directors undergo a comprehensive induction program to familiarize them with BHP's activities, environment, and key issues [7].\n- **Ongoing Training and Development**: Non-executive Directors participate in continuous improvement activities, including training and development programs that cover business, environmental, social, and governance matters [7]. These programs are designed to keep directors updated on BHP's assets, commodities, geographies, and markets, and are periodically reviewed for effectiveness [7].\n\nIn summary, BHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a structured, continuous, and thorough process involving rigorous candidate selection, comprehensive induction, and ongoing training and development."}

This indicates that there were no significant acquisitions or disposals affecting the goodwill during this period.\n\n- The foreign exchange translation differences had a minimal impact, contributing a slight increase of 4 in 2021 compared to a decrease of 6 in 2020 [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic had a significant impact on the Group's operations in 2020, with up to 90% of stores being closed in the first quarter and significant restrictions on store openings in the final months of 2020 [4]. This likely influenced the financial performance and, consequently, the goodwill valuation.\n\nThe recovery of the goodwill is supported by the profitability of the acquired companies, whose future cash flows are expected to sustain the carrying amount of the goodwill at year-end [3].\n\nIn summary, the key difference in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 is the stability in the closing balance, with minimal adjustments primarily due to foreign exchange translation differences. ![Goodwill remained stable with minor adjustments](image1)"}

This improvement can be attributed to higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and increased sales volumes [3]. The total assets for the Upstream segment were $184,412 million in 2021, slightly down from $191,309 million in 2020 [image2].\n\nFor the Downstream segment, the net income in 2021 was $2,914 million, up from a loss of $47 million in 2020 [5]. This positive shift was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem, and increased sales volumes, albeit partially offset by higher operating expenses [5]. The total assets for the Downstream segment were $45,224 million in 2021, an increase from $39,586 million in 2020 [image2].\n\nOverall, both segments demonstrated strong financial recovery in 2021 compared to the challenging conditions of 2020.\n\n![{Chevron's Upstream and Downstream segments showed significant financial improvements in 2021 compared to 2020, with notable increases in net income and slight changes in total assets.}](image2)"}

Specifically, Rajesh Gopinathan's total remuneration is 1,337.94 lakhs, while N Ganapathy Subramaniam's total remuneration is 1,011.69 lakhs. This includes a significant portion from their gross salaries and perquisites, with Rajesh Gopinathan receiving a gross salary of 135.90 lakhs and perquisites valued at 129.22 lakhs, and N Ganapathy Subramaniam receiving a gross salary of 129.18 lakhs and perquisites valued at 16.00 lakhs.

This substantial increase in revenue indicates strong market acceptance and demand for the platform and other services offered by Salesforce.\n\nHowever, the cost of revenues for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category also increased. The total cost of revenues for the company rose from $3,451 million in 2019 to $4,235 million in 2020, a 23% increase [5]. While the specific breakdown for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' is not provided, it is reasonable to infer that the cost of revenues for this category also saw a significant rise, contributing to the overall increase in costs.\n\nThis growth in revenue and costs can be attributed to several factors. The company has been investing heavily in expanding its enterprise and international markets, which have longer customer contract term durations and generally lower attrition rates [1]. Additionally, the shift towards cloud service offerings, which have higher service delivery costs compared to traditional software licenses, has impacted the cost structure [2].\n\nThe increase in revenue for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' is a positive sign for the company's financial performance, as it indicates strong demand and market traction. However, the corresponding rise in costs suggests that the company is actively scaling its operations to meet this demand, which may temporarily affect profit margins. Despite this, the overall financial performance remains robust, with the company continuing to invest in key areas such as data center capacity, professional services, and research and development to support long-term growth [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the significant increase in revenue for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' from 2019 to 2020, along with the corresponding rise in costs, reflects a period of rapid expansion and investment for Salesforce. This growth is likely to have a positive impact on the company's financial performance in the long term. ![Revenue and cost of revenues for Salesforce Platform and Other increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, indicating strong market demand and investment in scaling operations.](image3)"}

For finance leases, the total lease liabilities also decreased from $633 million in 2020 to $497 million in 2021. This indicates a reduction in both operating and finance lease liabilities over the year.\n\nNext, let's examine the lease costs. Image 6 provides the total lease costs for both operating and finance leases. The operating lease costs decreased from $2,551 million in 2020 to $2,199 million in 2021. Similarly, the finance lease costs decreased slightly from $45 million in 2020 to $66 million in 2021. However, the total lease costs, which include both operating and finance leases, decreased from $2,596 million in 2020 to $2,265 million in 2021.\n\nThese trends suggest that Chevron reduced its lease liabilities and lease costs in both categories from 2020 to 2021.

Specifically:\n\n- **Home Lending**: Total loans decreased by $44,140 million (16%) [1]. This decrease was driven by lower loan demand, including lower line utilization and higher paydowns, reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets [3].\n- **Auto**: Total loans increased by $2,833 million (6%) [1]. This modest growth can be attributed to an increase in transaction volumes and repricing [1].\n- **Credit Card**: Total loans decreased by $1,622 million (4%) [1]. The decline is consistent with lower consumer spending and increased savings during the pandemic [3].\n- **Small Business**: Total loans increased by $1,452 million (10%) [1]. This growth was driven by higher line utilization and customer growth, although it was partially offset by a decline in PPP loans [8].\n- **Personal Lending**: Total loans decreased by $1,101 million (18%) [1]. This decline reflects reduced consumer borrowing, likely due to economic uncertainty and higher savings rates [3].\n\n### Total Deposits\nTotal deposits increased significantly across all lines of business in 2021 compared to 2020. Specifically:\n\n- **Total deposits**: Increased by $112,654 million (16%) [1]. This increase was driven by higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending, reflecting government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [4].\n- **Consumer deposits**: Increased by $99,109 million (13%) [1]. Higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, contributed to this growth [6].\n\n### Contributing Factors\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes:\n\n- **Economic Uncertainty**: The ongoing economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to higher savings rates and reduced consumer spending, which affected loan demand but increased deposit balances [3, 4, 6].\n- **Government Stimulus Programs**: Government stimulus programs provided additional liquidity to consumers and businesses, leading to higher deposit balances [4, 6].\n- **Market Conditions**: Lower interest rates and market volatility in 2020 affected loan demand and trading activities, while higher liquidity and transaction volumes supported deposit growth [1, 2].\n- **PPP Loans**: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, which were significant in 2020, saw a decline in 2021, impacting small business loan balances [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the total loans decreased across most lines of business due to lower demand and higher paydowns, while total deposits increased significantly due to higher liquidity and government stimulus programs. ![Total loans decreased and total deposits increased across different lines of business from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

According to the data, the Credit Risk RWA increased by $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and by $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach [2]. This increase was primarily driven by several factors, including an increase in Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities mainly due to the E*TRADE acquisition, and higher Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments [4]. ![{Credit Risk RWA increased significantly in 2020 under both approaches.}](image2)\n\nSecondly, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 21.5% in 2019 to 18.0% in 2020 [3]. This reduction suggests a decrease in the proportion of total loss-absorbing capacity relative to the risk-weighted assets, which could indicate a need for the financial institution to manage its capital more effectively to meet regulatory requirements. The decrease in the External TLAC ratio might also reflect changes in the composition of the institution's capital and the regulatory environment [3]. ![{External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 21.5% in 2019 to 18.0% in 2020.}](image5)\n\nThese changes collectively suggest that the financial institution faced increased credit risk exposure, which required higher capital buffers to maintain regulatory compliance and financial stability. The decrease in the External TLAC ratio, despite the increase in Credit Risk RWA, indicates a potential shift in the institution's capital management strategies to align with regulatory expectations and market conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the increases in Credit Risk RWA and the decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 necessitated a more robust capital structure to ensure the financial institution's resilience and regulatory compliance."}

However, after accounting for the exceptional item related to the Assam dues becoming doubtful of recovery, the net profit was lower at Rs. 37.91 crore compared to Rs. 47.80 crore in the previous year [7].\n\nWhen we look at the potential for tobacco export earnings, the data is quite compelling. India currently holds only a 0.7% share of the global tobacco trade, which amounts to Rs. 930 crore in export earnings. However, if India were to increase its share to just 5%, the export earnings could potentially rise to Rs. 7000 crore, a sevenfold increase ![{India's export potential in tobacco could increase sevenfold with a 5% share of the global market}](image3).\n\nThis significant gap between current and potential export earnings suggests that the company could benefit greatly by focusing more on international markets. By leveraging its existing strengths in product innovation and brand development, the company can tap into this vast untapped potential. For instance, the company has already shown success in launching new brands and increasing its market share domestically [3]. Extending these efforts to the international market could lead to substantial growth in revenue and profitability.\n\nMoreover, the company's investment in improving the quality and yield of tobacco through initiatives like the introduction of Integrated Pest Management Systems and the production of flavorable tobacco can enhance the appeal of Indian tobacco in the global market [10]. This strategic alignment with export potential could mitigate the impact of domestic challenges such as discriminatory taxation and regulatory changes [2][5].\n\nIn conclusion, the company's financial results for 2002-2003, while showing a decline in net profit, highlight the need for a strategic shift towards expanding its international presence to capitalize on the significant potential for tobacco export earnings."}

According to the text, net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates [1]. This decrease is reflected in the detailed breakdown of interest income and interest expense changes.\n\nFor the period from 2019 to 2020, the net decrease in interest income was $19,747 million, with significant declines in various categories such as residential mortgage, home equity, credit card, and commercial loans [4]. Specifically, the credit card category saw a substantial decrease of $1,407 million due to lower rates, while the residential mortgage category experienced a decrease of $343 million [4].\n\nOn the other hand, the net decrease in interest expense was $14,120 million, primarily due to a reduction in interest paid on U.S. interest-bearing deposits, which decreased by $4,643 million [4]. This reduction in interest expense helped to mitigate the overall decrease in net interest income.\n\nComparatively, from 2018 to 2019, the net increase in interest income was $4,452 million, with positive contributions from trading account assets and debt securities [4]. The net increase in interest expense was $3,738 million, driven by higher interest costs on U.S. interest-bearing deposits, which increased by $2,564 million [4].\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, particularly its focus on managing interest rate risk and optimizing its balance sheet. The bank's ability to reduce interest expense, especially on deposits, helped to cushion the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income [1]. Additionally, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and the benefit of an additional day of interest accrual also played a role in managing the financial performance [1].\n\nThe detailed financial data and the organizational structure of Bank of America indicate a strategic approach to managing interest rate risk and optimizing capital allocation across different segments. This is further supported by the capital allocation methodology that considers regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital models [3].\n\nIn conclusion, the major differences in changes of net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 reflect Bank of America's strategic efforts to manage interest rate risk and optimize its balance sheet, aligning with its organizational structure and risk management practices. ![Net interest income and expense changes from 2019 to 2020](image4)"}

This significant decrease is primarily attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [6].\n\nIn terms of asset composition, the total invested assets increased from $363,117 million in 2020 to $446,277 million in 2021, a growth of 23% [image1].

Fixed maturity securities, however, saw a decline from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, a reduction of 19.3% [image1].\n\nThe shift in asset composition towards equity securities and away from fixed maturity securities suggests a strategic move to capitalize on potential gains from the equity market, despite its inherent volatility [9]. This strategy could be an attempt to mitigate the low yields from fixed income investments in a low-interest-rate environment [6]. However, the increased exposure to equity securities also means that the company's earnings will be more volatile, as changes in market prices of these securities can significantly impact reported earnings [9].\n\nAdditionally, the increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, a 35% increase, indicates a strong focus on maintaining liquidity and ensuring financial stability [image1]. This approach aligns with the company's emphasis on safety over yield in short-term investments [6].\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income and the shift in asset composition reflect a strategic balance between seeking higher returns from equities and maintaining liquidity and safety in a challenging interest rate environment. ![{Invested assets increased, with a significant shift towards equity securities and cash equivalents}](image1)"}

Internationally, upstream earnings also surged to $8.5 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $825 million in 2020 [6].

According to the data, U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020. This represents a significant improvement. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million [9].\n\nAdditionally, the overall sales and other operating revenues increased in 2021 mainly due to higher refined product, crude oil, and natural gas prices and sales volumes [10]. This trend is also reflected in the total refined product sales, which increased by 14 percent from 2020, driven by higher gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel demand as travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continued to ease [4].\n\nNow, let's consider the international downstream sector. International downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared with $618 million in 2020.

The earnings for the U.S. downstream sector show a significant improvement from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, as seen in the following image: ![{U.S. downstream earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021}](image12).\n\nFor the international downstream sector, the earnings decreased from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, as shown in this image: ![{International downstream earnings decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021}](image6).\n\nIn summary, the U.S. downstream sector saw a substantial improvement in earnings from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher margins, increased earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes, despite higher operating expenses. In contrast, the international downstream sector experienced a slight decrease in earnings, primarily due to lower margins and higher operating expenses, although this was partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects."}

This growth indicates a strong performance in sales and services, contributing to higher net income.\n   \n2. **Operating Income**: The operating income also saw an increase from $5,898,779 in 2018 to $6,513,644 in 2020 [image5]. This suggests that the company was able to manage its operating expenses effectively while increasing its revenue.\n\n3. **Interest Income and Expense**: There was a slight decrease in interest expense from $(22,963) in 2018 to $(33,071) in 2020, and an increase in interest income from $87,508 in 2018 to $69,331 in 2020 [image5]. While the interest income decreased, the overall impact on net income was still positive due to the higher operating income and revenue.\n\n4. **Tax Expense**: The income tax expense increased from $1,593,499 in 2018 to $1,589,018 in 2020 [image5]. Despite the slight decrease, the tax expense remained relatively stable, which did not significantly impact the net income.\n\n5. **Other Comprehensive Income**: The other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Accenture PLC improved from $(481,387) in 2018 to $278,740 in 2020 [image3]. This improvement contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\n6. **Foreign Currency Translation**: The foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income improved significantly from $(305,225) in 2018 to $197,696 in 2020 [image3]. This indicates favorable currency movements, which positively impacted the comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, the net income and comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by revenue growth, effective management of operating expenses, and favorable foreign currency translations. ![Net income and comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, reflecting strong financial performance.](image3)"}

According to the report, supply chain disruptions can result from major events such as commodity shortages, strikes, sanctions, natural disasters, and pandemics [2]. These disruptions can have significant consequences, including the inability to ensure the supply of key products, increased input prices, and production and distribution costs [2].\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Nestlé has implemented several strategies. For instance, the company has business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place for key sites [2]. Additionally, they engage in active price risk management for key commodities, which helps stabilize costs and ensures a consistent supply chain [2].\n\nNestlé's factory distribution across different regions is a crucial factor in managing these risks. The company operates in a wide range of countries, including those in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. For example, in the Americas (AMS), Nestlé has a presence in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States ![Nestlé's presence in the Americas](image3). Similarly, in Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA), Nestlé operates in numerous countries, including Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom ![Nestlé's presence in EMENA](image5).\n\nThis geographical spread acts as a natural hedge against regional disruptions, allowing Nestlé to maintain its supply chain even if one area is affected. By diversifying its operations, Nestlé can ensure that it can still source materials and distribute products effectively, thereby minimizing the potential impact of supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn conclusion, Nestlé's comprehensive risk management strategies and widespread factory distribution across different regions help mitigate the potential impacts of supply chain disruptions."}

This increase is partly due to the acquisition of Varian, which contributed €1,241 million in revenue but also resulted in a net loss of €50 million, including integration costs [3].\n\n- **Other Comprehensive Income**: The other comprehensive income for 2021 was €700 million, compared to a loss of €598 million in 2020 [4]. This improvement is primarily attributed to currency translation differences and cash flow hedges [5].\n\n- **Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income for 2021 was €2,446 million, a substantial increase from €825 million in 2020 [5]. This reflects the combined effect of the higher net income and the positive other comprehensive income.\n\n### Balance Sheet Differences\n\nFrom the consolidated statements of financial position, we can observe the following changes:\n\n- **Total Assets**: Total assets increased from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021, a significant increase of €17,068 million [6]. This growth is largely due to the acquisition of Varian, which added substantial goodwill and other intangible assets [7].\n\n- **Current Assets**: Current assets increased from €10,268 million in 2020 to €10,824 million in 2021, a modest increase of €556 million [7]. The primary drivers of this increase include trade and other receivables and inventories [7].\n\n- **Non-Current Assets**: Non-current assets saw a substantial increase from €14,827 million in 2020 to €31,338 million in 2021, an increase of €16,511 million [7]. This is mainly due to the significant addition of goodwill and other intangible assets from the Varian acquisition [7].\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Total liabilities increased from €12,584 million in 2020 to €25,823 million in 2021, a significant increase of €13,239 million [7]. This increase is primarily due to the rise in long-term financial debt, which was used to finance the Varian acquisition [7].\n\n- **Total Equity**: Total equity increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021, an increase of €3,828 million [7]. This growth is attributed to the capital increase in March 2021, which added €2,284 million to capital reserves, and the net income for the year, which increased unappropriated net income by €497 million [5].\n\n- **Equity Ratio**: The equity ratio declined from 76% in 2020 to 55% in 2021, mainly due to the significant increase in loan liabilities [5].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key differences in the comprehensive income and balance sheet components of Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian. This acquisition led to a substantial increase in net income, other comprehensive income, and total assets, while also significantly increasing total liabilities and reducing the equity ratio. ![Significant financial impacts from the Varian acquisition](image1)"}

This indicates that Cloud & Cognitive Software was more profitable in terms of gross profit relative to its revenue. However, the pre-tax margin for Cloud & Cognitive Software was 30.4%, which is lower than the 95% for Global Business Services [4]. This suggests that while Cloud & Cognitive Software had higher absolute profits, a larger portion of its gross profit was used to cover other expenses before taxes.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these financial results. The decline in pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software was driven by the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, ongoing investments in key strategic areas, and lower income from IP partnership agreements [9]. For Global Business Services, the year-to-year improvements in margins and pre-tax income were driven by the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, the yield from delivery productivity improvements, and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model [5].\n\nAdditionally, the consulting segment within Global Business Services saw strong growth, particularly in offerings that enabled each phase of clients' digital journeys, such as cognitive technology and data platform services, application modernization, and next-generation enterprise applications [10]. This growth contributed to the overall financial performance of Global Business Services.\n\n![{Cloud & Cognitive Software had a higher gross profit but lower pre-tax margin compared to Global Business Services in 2019.}](image4)\n\nIn summary, Cloud & Cognitive Software had higher external gross profit and pre-tax income compared to Global Business Services in 2019, but the pre-tax margin was lower due to significant investments and acquisition impacts."}

However, the overall decrease in shipment volume was influenced by several factors, including the deconsolidation of RBH, which had a significant impact on markets like Canada where volumes declined by 18.6% [2]. Additionally, the pandemic and economic conditions in countries like Mexico and Argentina contributed to lower market shares and reduced consumer spending [2].\n\nFinancially, the net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures [1]. Despite this, the company faced higher working capital requirements, particularly due to the build-up of inventory in the supply chain and the timing of excise tax payments [5]. These factors collectively led to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities by $0.3 billion, although this was partially offset by higher net earnings [7].\n\nOverall, the changes in PMI's shipment volumes and financial activities in Latin America & Canada from 2019 to 2020 were marked by a strategic shift towards smoke-free products, but also by significant challenges such as market contractions and operational disruptions.

Specifically, the net income in 2021 was $8,555 million, compared to $1,076 million in 2020, representing a significant increase of $7,479 million or 695% [6]. This improvement can be attributed to several factors, including higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income [6].\n\nRegarding the selected balance sheet data, the total loans and total deposits showed notable changes over the period. According to the data, total loans decreased from $376,463 million in 2020 to $333,885 million in 2021, a reduction of $42,578 million or 11% [4]. This decrease was primarily driven by paydowns exceeding originations, particularly in Home Lending where loan balances were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations [9].\n\nOn the other hand, total deposits increased significantly from $722,085 million in 2020 to $834,739 million in 2021, an increase of $112,654 million or 16% [4]. This growth in deposits was driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers, reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [3].\n\nTo summarize, the key changes in loans and deposits from 2019 to 2021 for Consumer Banking and Lending were a decrease in total loans and a significant increase in total deposits, contributing to the overall financial performance and stability of the company. ![Total deposits increased by 16% from 2020 to 2021, while total loans decreased by 11% over the same period.](image4)"}

The share-based compensation expense of $1,197,806 is recorded as an increase in Additional Paid-in Capital, which is a component of shareholders' equity. This is evident from the statement of shareholders' equity, where the share-based compensation expense is listed as contributing to the increase in Additional Paid-in Capital [image5].\n\nNow, let's examine the cash flow from operating activities. The net cash provided by operating activities for the year 2020 was $8,215,152 [image2]. This figure is derived by starting with net income of $5,185,313 and making adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital. The share-based compensation expense of $1,197,806 is one of the non-cash items that is added back to net income in this calculation.\n\nThe significant cash flow from operating activities contributes positively to the company's cash position. As shown in the cash flow statement, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year 2020 was $2,288,477, resulting in a cash and cash equivalents balance of $8,415,330 at the end of the year [image2].\n\nIn summary, the share-based compensation of $1,197,806 contributed to an increase in shareholders' equity by being recorded in Additional Paid-in Capital, while the strong cash flow from operating activities of $8,215,152 significantly bolstered the company's cash position, leading to a robust cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the year 2020.\n\n![{Share-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities contribute to shareholders' equity and cash position}](image5)"}

The total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,321 million in 2021, a rise of €3,823 million [3]. This increase was primarily driven by the capital increase in March 2021, which added €53 million to issued capital and €2,284 million to capital reserves [3]. Despite the dividend distribution of €856 million for fiscal year 2020, the net income for the year contributed an additional €497 million to unappropriated net income, leading to a net increase in equity [3].\n\nHowever, the equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, mainly due to a significant increase in loan liabilities [3]. This indicates that while equity grew, the company also took on more debt, which impacted the equity ratio.\n\nOn the liabilities side, current liabilities saw a substantial increase. Total current liabilities rose from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021, an increase of €1,168 million [5]. This was primarily driven by increases in other current financial liabilities (from €93 million to €263 million), current provisions (from €270 million to €356 million), and other current liabilities (from €1,198 million to €2,016 million) [5].\n\nNon-current liabilities also increased, with deferred tax liabilities rising from €470 million in 2020 to €2,082 million in 2021 [6]. Other non-current liabilities, such as provisions and other financial liabilities, also showed increases, contributing to the overall rise in liabilities [6].\n\nThese changes reflect the company's strategic decisions, including the capital increase and the acquisition of Varian, which required significant financial resources and led to higher debt levels [3][10]. The increase in liabilities, particularly in deferred tax liabilities, suggests that the company anticipates higher future tax obligations, possibly due to the increased profitability and the scale of recent acquisitions.\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers' equity increased significantly due to a capital increase and net income, while liabilities grew due to higher current and non-current obligations, reflecting the company's expansion and strategic investments. ![Total equity and liabilities increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image3)"}

This means that the cash flows from financing activities related to preferred shares remained neutral for that year.\n\nIn 2021, the company issued $1.6 billion of 3.550% Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D, and subsequently redeemed $1.6 billion of preferred shares. Specifically, the company redeemed $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C, and $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B [2]. These transactions are reflected in the cash flows from financing activities section of the cash flow statement, where the issuance of preferred shares is listed as $1,584 million and the redemption of preferred shares is listed as $1,600 million [image1].\n\nThe net effect on cash flows from these transactions was a slight negative impact, as the redemption slightly exceeded the issuance, resulting in a net outflow of $16 million.\n\n### Shareholders' Equity Impact\n\nThe issuance and redemption of preferred shares also had a notable impact on shareholders' equity. In 2020, there were no changes in preferred shares, as indicated by the balance sheet showing no activity in the preferred shares line item [image2].\n\nIn 2021, the issuance of $1.6 billion in preferred shares increased the total shareholders' equity by $1,584 million. However, this was offset by the redemption of $1.6 billion in preferred shares, which decreased the total shareholders' equity by $1,600 million. The net effect on shareholders' equity was a decrease of $16 million, as shown in the changes in shareholders' equity section [image5].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issuance and redemption of preferred shares in 2021 resulted in a net outflow of $16 million in cash flows from financing activities and a corresponding decrease of $16 million in shareholders' equity. In 2020, there were no such transactions, so there was no impact on either cash flows or shareholders' equity. ![The issuance and redemption of preferred shares in 2021 resulted in a net outflow of $16 million in cash flows and a decrease of $16 million in shareholders' equity.](image1)"}

This increase can be attributed to various factors, such as higher inventory levels, increased receivables, and a rise in intangible assets and goodwill. Specifically, inventories increased from $11,402 million in 2020 to $14,038 million in 2021, and receivables (trade and other) grew from $7,317 million to $8,477 million [3].\n\n![{Total assets increased by $4,469 million from 2020 to 2021.}](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the cash flow from operating activities for the consolidated segment saw a significant improvement, rising from $4,054 million in 2020 to $7,177 million in 2021. This increase of $3,123 million is primarily due to higher profits in 2021, adjusted for non-cash items, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in inventory and accounts receivable [2].\n\n![{Cash flow from operating activities increased by $3,123 million from 2020 to 2021.}](image2)\n\nThe implications of these changes on the business operations are substantial. The increase in total assets suggests that the company is expanding its operations, possibly through higher inventory levels to meet growing demand or through strategic investments in receivables and intangible assets. This expansion can enhance the company's market presence and competitive position.\n\nThe significant improvement in cash flow from operating activities indicates that the company is generating more cash internally, which can be used to fund further growth, pay down debt, or return value to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. However, the increased working capital requirements highlight the need for effective management of inventory and receivables to maintain healthy cash flow levels.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in total assets and cash flow from operating activities from 2020 to 2021 reflects a period of growth and improved financial health for the company, but also underscores the importance of managing working capital effectively."}

This represents a decrease of $2,819 million [image3].\n\n### Total Liabilities\nThe total liabilities decreased from $166,371 million in 2020 to $168,383 million in 2021, a decrease of $1,992 million [image3].\n\n### Analysis of Changes\n\n#### Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- **2021**: $22,028 million\n- **2020**: $32,965 million\n- **Change**: Decrease of $10,937 million\n\nThis significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the increase in Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and a reduction in customer deposits, partially offset by the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities [10].\n\n#### Card Member Receivables\n- **2021**: $53,581 million\n- **2020**: $43,434 million\n- **Change**: Increase of $10,147 million\n\nThis increase indicates a growth in the company's lending activities, which aligns with the increase in Card Member loans and receivables [image3].\n\n#### Long-Term Debt\n- **2021**: $39 billion\n- **2020**: $43 billion\n- **Change**: Decrease of $4 billion\n\nThe decrease in long-term debt suggests that the company has been paying down its debt, which could be a strategic move to reduce financial leverage [image5].\n\n### Comprehensive Income\nThe comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $8,060 million, compared to $3,135 million in 2020 and $6,759 million in 2019 [image2]. The significant increase in net income in 2021 is reflected in the company's improved financial performance, which can be attributed to various factors such as increased lending activities and effective cost management.\n\n### Cash Flows\n- **Operating Activities**: Net cash provided by operating activities was $14,645 million in 2021, compared to $5,591 million in 2020 and $13,632 million in 2019 [image2].\n- **Investing Activities**: Net cash used in investing activities was $10,529 million in 2021, compared to $11,632 million provided by investing activities in 2020 and $16,707 million used in 2019 [image2].\n- **Financing Activities**: Net cash used in financing activities was $14,933 million in 2021, compared to $9,068 million used in 2020 and $519 million used in 2019 [image2].\n\nThe significant outflow in financing activities in 2021 is primarily due to the repurchase of American Express common shares and other activities, which aligns with the decrease in cash and cash equivalents [image2].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe significant changes in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021, particularly the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the increase in Card Member receivables, are closely related to the company's comprehensive income and cash flows. The increase in net income and the outflows in financing activities reflect the company's strategic decisions to manage its balance sheet and improve its financial position. ![The total assets and liabilities decreased slightly from 2020 to 2021, reflecting changes in cash and cash equivalents and Card Member receivables.](image3)"}

According to the management view of adjusted revenue, the net operating income for Wealth and Personal Banking was $22,013 million, a decrease of $3,552 million or 14% from 2019 [1]. This decline can be attributed to a significant drop in non-interest income, which fell by $432 million or 26% [1].\n\nOn the other hand, the Commercial Banking segment also saw a reduction in net operating income. The net operating income for Commercial Banking was $13,312 million, down by $1,852 million or 12% from 2019 [2]. This decrease was primarily driven by a substantial rise in expected credit losses, which increased by $3,592 million or over 200% [3].\n\nIn terms of profit before tax, the differences between the two segments are stark. Wealth and Personal Banking reported a profit before tax of $1,900 million, a significant decrease of $5,300 million or 74% from 2019 [7].

This decline is reflected in the PMI shipment volume for cigarettes, which dropped by 6.3%, from 174,319 million units in 2019 to 163,420 million units in 2020 [5].\n\nConversely, the shipment volume for heated tobacco units (HTUs) saw a substantial increase.

In 2019, the company recorded a significant tax provision of $3,095 million, which was heavily influenced by a $2,472 million derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property [8]. This derecognition resulted in a substantial charge to income tax expense, contributing to the high effective tax rate of 41% for that year.\n\nIn contrast, 2020 saw a much lower tax provision of $521 million, with a more moderate effective tax rate of 9%. This decrease can be attributed to several factors, including a benefit from the FDI deduction of $381 million and research and development tax credits of $125 million [8]. Additionally, the company benefited from a $570 million tax benefit in 2019 due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets, which was not repeated in 2020 [6].\n\nBy 2021, the tax provision increased to $1,231 million, with an effective tax rate of 12%. The provision was affected by a $550 million FDI deduction and a $265 million excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards [8]. Despite these benefits, the overall tax provision remained higher than in 2020, reflecting a return to a more normalized tax environment post the significant events of 2019.\n\nThese trends are also reflected in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of September 26, 2021, Qualcomm reported total net deferred tax assets of $1,527 million, up from $1,295 million in 2020 [6]. The increase in deferred tax assets is primarily due to the recognition of new deferred tax assets and the reduction in valuation allowances [6].\n\nFurthermore, the company's unrecognized tax benefits have also fluctuated. In 2021, the ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $2,136 million, compared to $1,901 million in 2020 [5]. This increase is primarily due to additions for current year tax positions and settlements with taxing authorities [5].\n\nIn summary, the significant changes in Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 are largely driven by one-time events such as the derecognition of deferred tax assets and the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets, as well as ongoing benefits from tax deductions and credits. ![Qualcomm's tax provisions and related benefits show significant fluctuations over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, influenced by one-time events and ongoing tax benefits.](image8)"}

Specifically, the sale resulted in a reduction of $396.0 billion in other assets managed, which is reflected in the balance sheet data [image5].\n\nThe broader effects on the company's income and balance sheet were also notable. The sale of WFAM contributed to a net gain of $269 million, which was recorded in the income statement for the year 2021 [2]. This gain is part of the overall increase in noninterest income, which rose from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021 [image1]. However, the sale also led to a decrease in investment advisory and other asset-based fees, as the company no longer earns fees from managing and administering assets through WFAM [3].\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM resulted in a reduction in total assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets.

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, which had a significant impact on various earning assets such as loans and leases, interest-bearing deposits, and debt securities [6].\n\n### Net Interest Expense\nThe net interest expense also decreased, but by a larger amount, $14,120 million [image2]. This reduction in interest expense was largely due to lower interest rates on U.S. interest-bearing deposits, particularly demand and money market deposit accounts, and other interest-bearing liabilities like federal funds purchased and long-term debt [image2].\n\n### Net Interest Spread\nThe net interest spread is calculated as the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. In 2020, the net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% [image5]. This decrease can be attributed to the following factors:\n\n1. **Lower Interest Rates on Earning Assets**: The yield on earning assets, such as loans and leases, decreased significantly. For example, the yield on residential mortgages dropped from 3.47% in 2019 to 3.10% in 2020, and the yield on credit card loans decreased from 10.76% to 10.30% [image5].\n\n2. **Cost Reduction on Interest-Bearing Liabilities**: Despite the reduction in interest expense, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities also decreased, but not as much as the yield on earning assets. The cost of U.S. interest-bearing deposits, for instance, fell from 0.70% in 2019 to 0.17% in 2020 [image5].\n\n### Main Contributing Factors\n- **Lower Interest Rates**: The primary factor affecting both net interest income and net interest expense was the significant drop in interest rates. This led to a reduction in the yield on earning assets while also reducing the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n- **Volume Changes**: While the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities changed, the impact of these changes was less significant compared to the rate changes. For example, the volume of interest-bearing deposits increased, but the lower rates still resulted in a net decrease in interest expense [image2].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a decrease in the net interest spread from 2.03% to 1.75%. The main contributing factors were the significant drop in interest rates, which reduced the yield on earning assets more than it reduced the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. ![The net interest spread decreased from 2.03% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020 due to lower interest rates on earning assets.](image5)"}

The graph shows that Amgen's stock price started at $100 in 2015 and ended at $162.76 in 2020, representing a significant increase. In contrast, the S&P 500 index, starting at $100 in 2015, ended at $203.12 in 2020, also showing a strong upward trend but at a higher rate of growth.\n\n![{Amgen's stock price increased from $100 in 2015 to $162.76 in 2020, while the S&P 500 index grew from $100 to $203.12.}](image4)\n\nThis indicates that while both Amgen and the S&P 500 experienced positive returns, the S&P 500 outperformed Amgen in terms of percentage gain over the five-year period.\n\nNext, let's examine Amgen's stock repurchase activities. According to the financial data in Image 5, Amgen repurchased a significant number of shares during the fourth quarter of 2020. Specifically, they repurchased 1,774,922 shares in October, 1,660,605 shares in November, and 1,868,786 shares in December, totaling 5,304,313 shares for the quarter. The average price paid per share was around $230.24, and the maximum dollar value that could still be purchased under the program was approximately $2.977 billion by the end of December 2020.\n\n![{Amgen repurchased 5,304,313 shares in the fourth quarter of 2020 at an average price of $230.24 per share.}](image5)\n\nThese repurchase activities reflect Amgen's strategy to return capital to shareholders, which is consistent with their stated intention to invest in the business while returning capital through dividends and stock repurchases [8].\n\nIn conclusion, while Amgen's stock performance showed a positive return from 2015 to 2020, it did not outperform the S&P 500 index.

However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory.

According to the data provided in image3, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2020 were $1,423 million, and by the end of 2020, they increased to $1,829 million. This represents an increase of $406 million from the beginning to the end of 2020. For comparison, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of 2019 were $1,423 million, which means there was a significant increase in 2020. ![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020](image3).\n\nNext, let's examine the common share repurchases. Image1 provides the details of the common share repurchases for the years 2019 and 2020. In 2020, the company repurchased 14.2 million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, resulting in an aggregate cost of $4,250 million. In 2019, the company repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $245.97 per share, with an aggregate cost of $5,500 million. This indicates a decrease in the number of shares repurchased and a slight increase in the average price per share. ![The company repurchased fewer shares in 2020 compared to 2019, but at a higher average price per share](image1).\n\nThe implications of these changes for the company's financial position are significant. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits suggests that the company has more potential tax liabilities that are not yet recognized on its financial statements. This could lead to higher tax expenses in the future if these unrecognized tax benefits are eventually recognized. On the other hand, the reduction in common share repurchases in 2020, despite the higher average price per share, indicates that the company may have allocated its capital differently, possibly due to market conditions or strategic decisions to preserve liquidity during the economic uncertainties of 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020, while the common share repurchases decreased in volume but increased in average price per share. These changes suggest a shift in the company's financial strategy, potentially aimed at managing tax liabilities and preserving capital."}

The increase in operating profit was attributed to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility, which more than offset higher manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses [7].\n\nTo break down the changes further, the Construction Industries segment saw a significant increase in sales volume. Sales for this segment were $5.736 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, up by $1.228 billion, or 27 percent, compared with $4.508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 [5].

This increase was mainly due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses [3].\n\nIn terms of regional performance, North America sales increased by 29 percent, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for services, and favorable price realization [4]. EAME sales increased by 24 percent, primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories [2]. Asia/Pacific sales increased by 9 percent, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services, and favorable price realization [8].\n\nOverall, the increases in sales volume and operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 were primarily driven by higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, which were more stable in 2021 compared to the significant decreases in 2020 [9]. ![Dealer inventories decreased significantly in 2020 but remained stable in 2021, impacting sales volume positively in 2021.](image1) \n\nThe contributing factors to these changes include higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and more stable dealer inventory levels in 2021 compared to 2020."}

This decline in net interest income is also reflected in the balance sheet data, where total deposits increased by $322.157 billion to $287.123 billion, indicating a substantial rise in deposit balances [image1].\n\nTotal revenue for consumer banking, which includes both net interest income and noninterest income, decreased by 5% to $18.584 billion in 2020 compared to $19.538 billion in 2019 [1].

The Varian segment alone saw an increase of €7,692 million in goodwill, which is a key component of the overall increase [10].\n\nAdditionally, the image showing the goodwill allocation further confirms this, indicating that the Varian segment's goodwill increased significantly from 2020 to 2021 [![The Varian segment's goodwill increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image2)].\n\nTherefore, the change in total goodwill from 2020 to 2021 is €8,474 million, and this increase is largely due to the acquisition of Varian."}

According to the financial statements, the company paid out substantial cash dividends and engaged in treasury stock transactions, which affected both the equity and the cash flow.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the impact on equity. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, shows that Chevron's retained earnings increased by $5,169 million from $160,377 million in 2020 to $165,546 million in 2021 [3]. However, this increase was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends. The statement of changes in equity indicates that Chevron paid $10,179 million in cash dividends in 2021 [image3]. This dividend payment reduced the retained earnings, thereby impacting the total equity. Additionally, the company also made purchases of treasury shares totaling $1,383 million, which further decreased the equity by reducing the treasury stock account [image3].\n\nNow, let's look at the impact on cash flow. The cash flow statement for 2021 reveals that the payment of cash dividends of $10,179 million is listed under financing activities, contributing to a net cash outflow in this category [image4]. This outflow is a significant drain on the company's cash resources, reflecting the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders. On the other hand, the purchase of treasury shares for $1,383 million also appears under financing activities, further contributing to the net cash outflow of $23,113 million [image4].\n\nIn summary, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions had a notable impact on Chevron's equity structure and cash flow in 2021. The payment of dividends reduced retained earnings and contributed to a significant cash outflow, while the purchase of treasury shares further decreased equity and added to the cash outflow. ![Cash dividends and treasury stock purchases significantly impacted equity and cash flow in 2021.](image3)"}

For instance, the Wealth Management segment saw a decrease in revenue from $8,633 million in 2019 to $7,818 million in 2020, a drop of 9%. Specifically, life insurance manufacturing revenue fell from $2,464 million in 2019 to $1,816 million in 2020, a significant decrease of 26% [3]. This decline in revenue is reflected in the overall financial performance of the group, where the adjusted profit before tax was $12.1 billion, down 45% from 2019 [7].\n\n![{Wealth Management revenue decreased by 9% in 2020 compared to 2019, with life insurance manufacturing showing a 26% decline.}](image3)\n\nDespite these challenges, HSBC remained committed to its customers, supporting them through the pandemic with measures such as payment holidays and keeping a majority of branches open [2]. Additionally, the launch of HSBC Pinnacle in mainland China highlights the group's strategic focus on expanding its wealth management and insurance services, aiming to become the leading wealth manager in Asia [5].\n\nIn conclusion, WPB contributed to HSBC's group adjusted profit before tax in 2020, but the financial performance data reveals a significant decline in revenue and profit, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic and lower interest rates."}

According to the text, the Group recognized a lease liability for the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 July 2019 [8]. This resulted in the recognition of a substantial lease liability at the transition date, which was further adjusted during the year.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements show that the balance of lease liabilities at 1 July 2019 was $43,620,000. By the end of the fiscal year on 28 June 2020, the total lease liability had increased to $167,154,000, reflecting the addition of new lease liabilities and adjustments due to changes in lease terms [image2]. This significant increase indicates the impact of recognizing lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as required by AASB 16.\n\nAdditionally, the Group no longer recognizes provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives. Instead, these payments are included in the lease liability [image1]. This change in accounting policy aligns with the principles of AASB 16, where all lease payments are recognized as a lease liability and amortized over the lease term.\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, the Group calculates these based on the undiscounted amounts of expected payments for wages, salaries, and annual leave [1]. The total employee benefit liabilities for 2020 were $4,092,000, slightly lower than the $4,054,000 reported in 2019 [image7]. This minor fluctuation suggests that the transition to AASB 16 did not significantly affect the employee benefit liabilities, as they are primarily based on current wage and salary rates and related on-costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition to AASB 16 had a substantial impact on the Group's lease liabilities, leading to a significant increase in the reported lease liability, while the employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable. ![The transition to AASB 16 led to a significant increase in lease liabilities.](image2)"}

Goodwill for Salesforce.org was recorded at $164 million, which is significantly lower than that of ClickSoftware [2]. The net assets acquired for Salesforce.org totaled $134 million [2].\n\nBoth acquisitions allocated a portion of the consideration to goodwill, which is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities. However, the magnitude of these allocations differs significantly, with ClickSoftware having a much larger goodwill amount due to its more substantial impact on the company's strategic goals and market presence.\n\nIn summary, while both acquisitions allocated fair value to similar categories such as developed technology, customer relationships, and goodwill, the scale and specific amounts differ, with ClickSoftware involving much larger valuations and a higher goodwill amount.

This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and higher cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, partially offset by higher net earnings and favorable currency movements [10].\n\n### Investing Activities\nThe net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $602 million, a decrease of $759 million from $1,436 million in 2019 [9]. This significant decrease was mainly due to the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019 and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges [9].\n\n### Financing Activities\nThe net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $8,496 million, an increase of $435 million from $8,061 million in 2019 [4]. This increase was primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity [4].\n\n### Overall Impact on Cash Balance\nCombining these changes, we can see the overall impact on the cash balance:\n\n- **2019**: Starting balance of $6,620 million + Net cash provided by operating activities of $10,090 million - Net cash used in investing activities of $1,436 million - Net cash used in financing activities of $8,061 million + Effect of exchange rate changes of $27 million = Ending balance of $6,865 million [image3].\n- **2020**: Starting balance of $6,865 million + Net cash provided by operating activities of $9,812 million - Net cash used in investing activities of $602 million - Net cash used in financing activities of $8,496 million + Effect of exchange rate changes of $258 million = Ending balance of $7,285 million [image3].\n\nThus, despite the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and the increase in net cash used in financing activities, the overall cash balance at the end of 2020 was slightly higher than in 2019, primarily due to the significant reduction in net cash used in investing activities.\n\nThe overall cash balance at the end of 2020 was $7,285 million, an increase of $420 million from the end of 2019 [image3]. ![The overall cash balance at the end of 2020 was $7,285 million, an increase of $420 million from the end of 2019.](image3)"}

According to the policy, the Annual Total Remuneration for executives is set based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance evaluations [3]. This ensures that the remuneration is directly linked to the company's financial health and market performance.\n\nFor instance, the evaluation method for consolidated operating income and share price volatility is clearly outlined. The degree of attainment of consolidated operating income is evaluated against a required income target, and the share price volatility is compared to the Nikkei stock average. The evaluation results are then used to adjust the performance-linked remuneration [image1]. This method ensures that executives are rewarded based on the company's actual performance, thereby incentivizing them to drive business success.\n\nAdditionally, Toyota places a strong emphasis on shareholder value. The company aims to maintain a stable and continuous dividend payout ratio of 30%, which is a key indicator of shareholder value [7]. The dividends per share have shown consistent growth over the years, as seen in the data from 2017 to 2021, where the dividend per share increased from 210 yen to 240 yen [image2]. This demonstrates Toyota's commitment to rewarding its shareholders and maintaining their confidence in the company's long-term growth.\n\nMoreover, the remuneration structure includes both fixed and performance-linked components. The fixed remuneration is set based on job responsibilities and home country standards, while the performance-linked remuneration is determined by consolidated operating income, share price volatility, and individual performance [10]. This balanced approach ensures that executives are motivated to achieve both short-term and long-term goals, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders.\n\nIn summary, Toyota's executive remuneration evaluation reflects their business performance and shareholder value indicators by linking remuneration to key financial metrics and performance outcomes, ensuring that executives are incentivized to drive sustainable growth and maximize shareholder value. ![Toyota's remuneration is aligned with business performance and shareholder value](image1)"}

According to the financial data, total sales and revenues for 2021 were $\\S50.971$ billion, an increase of $\\S9.223$ billion, or 22 percent, compared with $\\S41.748$ billion in 2020 [8]. The breakdown of this increase reveals that sales volume and price realization played crucial roles.\n\nSales volume increases were observed across all regions and segments. For instance, in North America, sales increased by 23 percent, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, changes in dealer inventories, and favorable price realization [2]. Similarly, in the Asia/Pacific region, sales increased by 15 percent, also due to higher end-user demand, changes in dealer inventories, and favorable currency impacts [3].\n\nThe Construction Industries segment saw a notable improvement, with total sales increasing by $\\S5.188$ billion, or 31 percent, to $\\S22.106$ billion in 2021 [4]. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, as well as the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories during 2020, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat during 2021 [4].\n\nThe Energy & Transportation segment also showed significant improvement, with total sales increasing by $\\S2.817$ billion, or 16 percent, to $\\S20.287$ billion in 2021 [7]. Sales increased across all applications and inter-segment sales, further contributing to the overall revenue growth.\n\nTo visualize the contributions, the chart in Image 3 provides a detailed breakdown of the sales and revenue changes by segment. It shows that the Construction Industries segment had the highest percentage increase in sales at 31%, followed by the Energy & Transportation segment at 16% [image3].\n\nAdditionally, the chart in Image 2 illustrates the overall revenue increase, highlighting the contributions from sales volume, price realization, and other factors. Sales volume and price realization together contributed significantly to the overall revenue increase, with sales volume being the primary driver [image2].\n\nIn conclusion, the sales volume and price realization changes were key contributors to Caterpillar's overall revenue increase in 2021, with the Construction Industries segment showing the most significant improvements."}

This decline was primarily due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and higher expenses. Specifically, net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, mainly due to lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances [8].\n\nIn contrast, the **Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)** segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, saw a more modest decrease in revenue and net income. The total revenue for GWIM decreased by $954 million to $18.584 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [10]. The revenue for Bank of America Private Bank specifically decreased by $134 million to $3.292 billion, primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates [5]. \n\nThe net income for the entire GWIM segment also decreased, but the exact figures are not directly provided in the text. However, the overall trend indicates a decline in performance, though not as steep as the Consumer Banking segment. \n\nAdditionally, the noninterest income for GWIM increased by $82 million to $13.1 billion, primarily due to higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, which were largely offset by declines in AUM pricing and lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results [3].\n\nTo visualize the revenue changes, we can refer to the following data from the image:\n\n- **Revenue by Business**:\n  - **Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management**: Decreased from $16.112 billion in 2019 to $15.292 billion in 2020.\n  - **Bank of America Private Bank**: Decreased from $3.426 billion in 2019 to $3.292 billion in 2020.\n  - **Total Revenue, Net of Interest Expense**: Decreased from $19.538 billion in 2019 to $18.584 billion in 2020.\n\n![{Revenue and client balances for GWIM decreased in 2020 compared to 2019}](image2)\n\nIn summary, while both the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments experienced decreases in revenue and net income in 2020 compared to 2019, the Consumer Banking segment saw a more significant decline, particularly in net income, due to lower revenue, higher provisions for credit losses, and higher expenses. The GWIM segment, on the other hand, had a more moderate decrease in revenue, driven by lower interest rates and other factors."}

In 2020, the restructuring charges/other line item in the operating profit section of the income statement shows a charge of $24 million, which contrasts with a credit of $36 million in 2019 [4].\n\nThis is further illustrated in the quarterly financial data, where the fourth quarter of 2020 saw no additional restructuring charges, but the third quarter included a charge of $24 million, while 2019 saw a credit of $36 million in the same period [4] ![Restructuring charges and payments over the years](image3).\n\nAs a result, the operating profit in 2020 was negatively impacted by these restructuring charges, leading to a lower operating profit compared to 2019.

According to the financial statements, the comprehensive income in 2018 was $2,005 million, while in 2020, it increased to $3,646 million [1]. This represents a substantial increase of approximately $1.641 billion.\n\nSeveral key factors contributed to this change:\n\n1. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: The company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2.9 billion in 2020, compared to a translation loss of $75 million in 2019 [1]. This significant positive adjustment played a crucial role in boosting the comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Pension and Postretirement Plan Benefit Adjustments**: The company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $147 million in 2020, compared to a loss of $90 million in 2019 [1]. While this represents an increase in losses, it is relatively minor compared to the gains from foreign currency translation.\n\n3. **Net Earnings**: The net earnings from continuing operations increased from $2.432 billion in 2019 to $3.646 billion in 2020 [6]. This increase was driven by higher sales, net earnings from the Cytiva acquisition, and a gain on the sale of product lines [3].\n\n4. **Gain on Sale of Product Lines**: On April 30, 2020, the company completed the sale of certain product lines for a cash purchase price of $826 million, recognizing a pretax gain of $455 million ($305 million after-tax) [3]. This gain also contributed positively to the comprehensive income.\n\n5. **Cash Flow Hedge Adjustments**: There was a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019, which further contributed to the increase in comprehensive income [1].\n\n6. **Other Comprehensive Income Components**: The image showing the breakdown of other comprehensive income (loss) provides additional context. In 2020, the total other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, was $600 million, compared to a loss of $368 million in 2019 [image1]. This includes gains from foreign currency translation and losses from pension and postretirement plan benefits.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to a substantial foreign currency translation gain, higher net earnings, and a gain on the sale of product lines. ![Comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020 due to foreign currency translation gains and higher net earnings.](image1)"}

This decline, while significant, was less severe than the 19% decrease observed in the International Operated Markets segment [10].\n\nThe U.S. market showed resilience, with a 4.5% increase in comparable sales in the second half of 2020, driven by strategic marketing investments and promotional activities, such as the free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers [4]. These efforts helped to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic and contributed to a more moderate decline in revenue [1].\n\nOn the other hand, the International Operated Markets segment faced more substantial challenges.

The operating income in this segment also decreased significantly, reflecting not only sales declines but also substantial support provided for marketing and additional COVID-19-related expenses [5].\n\nThe difference in performance between the U.S. and International Operated Markets can be attributed to several factors. The U.S. market benefited from a higher proportion of drive-thru locations, which allowed for continued operations and sales even during lockdowns [3]. Additionally, the U.S. market's robust marketing and promotional strategies, including the free meal initiatives, helped to maintain customer engagement and drive sales [1, 2].\n\nIn contrast, the International Operated Markets segment faced more stringent lockdown measures and fewer drive-thru locations, which exacerbated the revenue decline [3].

The accumulated depreciation and amortization for 2020 was $955 million, and for 2019, it was $723 million.

The gross value of PP&E as of December 31, 2020, was $17,864 million, and as of December 31, 2019, it was $14,130 million. The accumulated depreciation for 2020 was $5,117 million, and for 2019, it was $3,734 million.

The increase in the gross value of PP&E ($17,864 million in 2020 vs. $14,130 million in 2019) more than offset the increase in accumulated depreciation.\n\nIn summary, the accumulated depreciation increased for both solar energy systems and property, plant, and equipment from 2019 to 2020. However, the net value of solar energy systems decreased, while the net value of property, plant, and equipment increased due to a larger increase in the gross value of PP&E. ![Accumulated depreciation increased for both categories, affecting their net values differently.](image2) ![The gross value of PP&E increased significantly, leading to an overall increase in its net value.](image1) \n\nThe accumulated depreciation affected the net value of solar energy systems by decreasing it and the net value of property, plant, and equipment by increasing it."}

Initially, the company focused on establishing a strong presence in key markets such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, while also expanding into smaller but promising regions like Spain and Vietnam.\n\nBy 2020, Lovisa had opened a total of 435 stores globally, up from 250 in 2016, demonstrating a robust expansion trajectory. Notably, the company opened 47 stores outside of Australia during the year, including 13 stores in France, 29 in the USA, and 5 franchise stores in various territories [4]. This aggressive expansion reflects Lovisa's commitment to leveraging its capital in large international markets and targeting high-traffic shopping precincts [10].\n\nHowever, this growth has not been without challenges. The retail environment, especially in the context of the global economic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has posed significant hurdles. Lovisa has had to continuously review and adjust its store network to ensure profitability, closing underperforming stores and identifying new sites opportunistically [1]. For instance, the company has been monitoring the global retail leasing market closely to capitalize on opportunities arising from the pandemic [3].\n\nAdditionally, the fast fashion jewelry sector is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and rapidly changing customer preferences [7]. To mitigate these risks, Lovisa has invested in a dedicated product team and streamlined its supply chain to maintain agility and responsiveness [8]. The company has also focused on enhancing brand loyalty through social media and promotional activities, ensuring a direct connection with its customer base [6].\n\nDespite these challenges, Lovisa has made significant strides in its international expansion.

It has also expanded its online presence, launching online stores in key markets such as the United Kingdom, Europe, South Africa, and Singapore [4].\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy has evolved from a focus on market entry to a more nuanced approach that emphasizes profitability, agility, and customer engagement. The key achievements include the opening of numerous stores in strategic markets and the enhancement of customer loyalty through innovative services and strong online presence.

In 2020, the net interest income decreased by $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared to 2019 [8]. This decrease was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by 84 basis points (bps) [3].\n\nMeanwhile, interest expense also decreased significantly, from $24.233 billion in 2019 to $14.178 billion in 2020, a reduction of $10.055 billion or 41.5% [2]. This decrease was driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, particularly in Asia and North America, which reduced funding costs [6]. The reduction in interest expense helped to mitigate some of the negative impact on net interest income, but it was not enough to fully offset the decline in interest income.\n\nThe net operating income, which includes net interest income, net fee income, and other operating income, decreased from $53.342 billion in 2019 to $41.612 billion in 2020, a decline of $11.730 billion or 22% [5]. This significant drop in net operating income was primarily driven by the decrease in net interest income, as well as other factors such as lower net fee income and a decrease in net income from financial instruments held for trading [5].\n\nThe overall profitability of the organization, as measured by profit before tax, also declined from $13.347 billion in 2019 to $8.777 billion in 2020, a reduction of $4.570 billion or 34.2% [5]. This decline in profitability can be attributed to the lower net operating income and the adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences, as well as the unfavorable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on various business segments, particularly in insurance and investment contracts [4].\n\nIn summary, the decrease in net interest income and the reduction in interest expense both contributed to a significant decline in net operating income and overall profitability in 2020. ![Net interest income and interest expense trends from 2019 to 2020](image2) The decline in net interest income was more pronounced, leading to a substantial impact on the organization's financial performance."}

According to the financial data, net investment income in 2021 was $4,807 million, a decrease of 5.0% from $5,039 million in 2020. This decline is primarily due to a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [2]. The decline in interest income is attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [2].\n\n![{Net investment income decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to a 44.4% decline in interest and other investment income.}](image2)\n\nNext, let's consider the railroad operating earnings. Railroad operating earnings in 2021 were $8,811 million, an increase of 11.8% from $7,152 million in 2020. This improvement is driven by several factors. First, there was a significant increase in railroad operating revenues by 11.6%, reflecting higher volumes and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit [7]. The volume increase is attributed to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had severely impacted volumes in 2020 [7]. Additionally, higher fuel prices contributed to the increase in average revenue per car/unit [7].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that railroad operating expenses also increased by 10.2% to $13,702 million in 2021, primarily due to higher volumes and higher average fuel prices [4]. Despite this, the ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021, indicating improved efficiency and cost management [4].\n\n![{Railroad operating earnings increased by 11.8% from 2020 to 2021, driven by a 11.6% increase in operating revenues and improved cost management.}](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, while net investment income decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021 due to lower interest income, railroad operating earnings increased by 11.8% due to higher volumes and improved cost management."}

According to the financial statements, McDonald's total shareholders' equity (deficit) as of December 31, 2020, was calculated as follows:\n\n- Common stock: $16.6 million\n- Additional paid-in capital: $7,903.6 million\n- Retained earnings: $53,908.1 million\n- Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): $(2,586.8) million\n- Common stock in treasury: $(67,066.4) million\n\nSumming these values gives us the total shareholders' equity for 2020:\n\n\\[ 16.6 + 7,903.6 + 53,908.1 - 2,586.8 - 67,066.4 = -7,725.9 \\]\n\nFor 2018, the total shareholders' equity (deficit) was:\n\n- Common stock: $16.6 million\n- Additional paid-in capital: $7,653.9 million\n- Retained earnings: $52,930.5 million\n- Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): $(2,482.7) million\n- Common stock in treasury: $(66,328.6) million\n\nSumming these values gives us the total shareholders' equity for 2018:\n\n\\[ 16.6 + 7,653.9 + 52,930.5 - 2,482.7 - 66,328.6 = -8,210.3 \\]\n\nThus, the total shareholders' equity increased from $(8,210.3) million in 2018 to $(7,725.9) million in 2020, an increase of approximately $484.4 million.\n\nNext, let's consider the number of systemwide restaurants. According to the image showing the restaurant count, the number of systemwide restaurants at the end of 2020 was 39,198, with 36,521 being franchised and 2,677 being company-operated. For 2018, the number of systemwide restaurants was 38,855, with 36,194 being franchised and 2,661 being company-operated.\n\nTherefore, the number of systemwide restaurants increased from 38,855 in 2018 to 39,198 in 2020, an increase of 343 restaurants.\n\n![{McDonald's total shareholders' equity increased from $(8,210.3) million in 2018 to $(7,725.9) million in 2020, and the number of systemwide restaurants increased from 38,855 in 2018 to 39,198 in 2020.}](image2)\n\nIn summary, McDonald's total shareholders' equity increased by $484.4 million, and the number of systemwide restaurants increased by 343 from 2018 to 2020."}

According to the image quote, the net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020, is $313 million, while it was $339 million as of December 31, 2019.

Specifically, the expenses increased from $1,126 million in 2018 to $1,878 million in 2019 and further to $2,119 million in 2020 [3]. This increase can be attributed to higher returns on referenced investments, which contributed significantly to the overall compensation expenses. In 2020, the return on referenced investments was $856 million, up from $645 million in 2019 and a loss of $48 million in 2018 [image3].\n\nIn 2020, the distribution of these compensation expenses across different business segments is as follows:\n- **Institutional Securities**: Recognized $851 million in compensation expense.\n- **Wealth Management**: Recognized $1,000 million in compensation expense.\n- **Investment Management**: Recognized $268 million in compensation expense.\n\nThese figures indicate that the Wealth Management segment had the highest compensation expense, followed by Institutional Securities and then Investment Management [image5].\n\nOverall, the total recognized compensation expenses have been increasing, driven by higher returns on investments, and the expenses are most heavily concentrated in the Wealth Management segment. ![Compensation expenses increased consistently from 2018 to 2020, with the Wealth Management segment having the highest expense in 2020.](image5)"}

This increase is primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition, which expanded the company's operational footprint and lease obligations. The corresponding operating lease liabilities also increased from $719 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, indicating a higher future commitment to lease payments. The weighted average remaining lease term remained consistent at 7 years, while the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% to 2.8%.\n\n![{Lease assets and liabilities increased in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of the Cytiva Acquisition.}](image4)\n\n### Inventories\nThe total inventories increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020, a growth of $664 million. This significant increase is attributed to higher finished goods, work in process, and raw materials. Specifically:\n- Finished goods increased from $833 million in 2019 to $1,232 million in 2020, a rise of $399 million.\n- Work in process increased from $285 million in 2019 to $369 million in 2020, a rise of $84 million.\n- Raw materials increased from $510 million in 2019 to $691 million in 2020, a rise of $181 million.\n\nThese increases in inventories align with the company's higher sales volume and the inclusion of Cytiva's inventory, which contributed to the overall growth in 2020. The higher inventory levels also suggest a strategic decision to maintain a robust supply chain to meet increasing demand, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n![{Inventories increased significantly in 2020, with notable growth in finished goods, work in process, and raw materials.}](image1)\n\n### Financial Statement Reflections\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories are reflected in the company's financial statements as follows:\n- **Operating Cash Flows**: The increase in inventories used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020, similar to the $161 million used in 2019. This indicates that the company's working capital management remained relatively stable despite the higher inventory levels.\n- **Cost of Sales**: The higher inventory levels and the inclusion of Cytiva's inventory contributed to an increase in cost of sales, which was primarily due to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and acquisition-related charges.\n- **Balance Sheet**: The increase in lease assets and liabilities is evident in the balance sheet, showing a higher commitment to future lease payments and a corresponding increase in assets.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in the composition and value of the company's lease assets and inventories between 2019 and 2020 reflect the impact of the Cytiva Acquisition and the company's strategic focus on maintaining a strong supply chain to meet growing demand."}

According to the data in the image, S Fallscheer's shareholdings are as follows:\n\n- **Held at 1 July 2019**: 4,140,000 shares\n- **Shares Purchased**: 1,687,764 shares\n- **Shares Sold**: 0 shares\n- **Held at 28 June 2020**: 5,827,764 shares\n\nThis indicates that S Fallscheer increased their shareholding by 1,687,764 shares over the fiscal year, bringing their total holdings to 5,827,764 shares. This significant increase in shareholdings suggests a strong confidence in the company's future performance and a commitment to the company's growth.\n\nNext, let's examine the changes in S Fallscheer's remuneration. The remuneration details are provided in the text and images:\n\n- **Short Term Employment Benefits**:\n  - **Salary & Fees**: Increased from $1,341,286 in FY19 to $1,282,749 in FY20.\n  - **Non-monetary benefits**: Increased from $27,091 in FY19 to $27,841 in FY20.\n  - **Performance-based payment**: Not specified in the provided data.\n  - **Super Contributions**: Increased from $24,327 in FY19 to $25,000 in FY20.\n  - **Long Term Benefits**: Increased from $433,360 in FY19 to $(316,667) in FY20, indicating a decrease in long-term benefits.\n  - **Annual & Long Service Leave**: Increased from $190,923 in FY19 to $146,396 in FY20.\n  - **Share Based Payments**: Decreased from $81,500 in FY19 to $(419,167) in FY20, indicating a significant reduction in share-based payments.\n\nThe overall total remuneration for S Fallscheer in FY20 was $1,566,747, compared to $2,481,263 in FY19. This represents a decrease of approximately $914,516 in total remuneration.\n\n### Implications on Financial Position\n\nThe increase in shareholdings, despite the decrease in total remuneration, suggests that S Fallscheer is aligning their interests more closely with the company's long-term success. The purchase of additional shares can be seen as an investment in the company's future, which could potentially lead to higher returns if the company performs well.\n\nHowever, the decrease in total remuneration, particularly in long-term benefits and share-based payments, might indicate a shift in the company's remuneration strategy. This could be a result of the company's financial performance, as shown in the image1, where the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and net profit after tax (NPAT) significantly decreased from FY19 to FY20.\n\nIn conclusion, S Fallscheer's shareholding increased by 1,687,764 shares, while their total remuneration decreased by approximately $914,516 from FY19 to FY20. This suggests a stronger alignment with the company's long-term goals and a potential investment in the company's future performance. ![S Fallscheer's shareholding and remuneration changes](image5)"}

This increase can be broken down into two main components: service costs and other cost of revenues. Service costs, which make up the majority of the total cost of revenues, rose from RMB 14,967 million in 2019 to RMB 18,992 million in 2021, an increase of about 26.9%. Other cost of revenues, which include employee benefits, advertising agency fees, and payment channel fees, saw a more pronounced increase from RMB 1,794 million in 2019 to RMB 2,848 million in 2021, a 58.8% rise [8]. This significant increase in other cost of revenues is primarily due to higher agency fees and payment channel fees [8].\n\n![{Other cost of revenues increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, driven by higher agency fees and payment channel fees.}](image2)\n\nOn the operating expenses side, the total operating expenses also showed a steady increase from RMB 4,744 million in 2019 to RMB 6,687 million in 2021, a 40.5% increase.

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020, a rise of $3,039 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher unallocated and specific reserves in the Americas region [2]. Meanwhile, long-term debt remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [image2].\n\nNext, we consider the impact on cash flows. The cash flow statement shows that operating activities provided more cash in 2020 ($18,197 million) compared to 2019 ($14,770 million). However, investing activities used significantly less cash in 2020 ($3,028 million) compared to the substantial outflow in 2019 ($26,936 million). Financing activities, on the other hand, were a net use of cash in 2020 ($9,721 million) compared to a net source of cash in 2019 ($9,042 million). This shift in financing activities is largely due to the decline in financing assets and a reduction in debt levels [image3].\n\nThe stability in long-term debt and the increase in noncurrent assets suggest that IBM maintained a balanced approach to managing its long-term obligations while expanding its asset base. This is further supported by the company's equity position. Total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by net income and common stock increases [7].\n\nIn summary, the increase in noncurrent assets and the stability in long-term debt indicate that IBM continued to invest in its long-term growth while maintaining a manageable debt level. The positive cash flow from operations and the strategic management of financing activities suggest that IBM's overall financial standing remained strong despite the changes in asset and debt levels.\n\n![Noncurrent assets increased while long-term debt remained stable, indicating a balanced financial approach.](image2)"}

Specifically, the credit card outstandings decreased by $18.9 billion to $78.7 billion [4]. This decline can be attributed to lower retail spending and higher payments, which were influenced by government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [4].\n\nAdditionally, the total credit card purchase volumes declined by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion [6]. This decrease was driven by the impact of the pandemic, particularly in sectors like travel and entertainment, which saw a significant drop in spending [6]. Despite these challenges, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion, indicating a shift towards more essential spending as businesses reopened and economic activities resumed [6].\n\nRegarding home equity, the outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020 [9]. This decline was primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [9]. The decrease in home equity production, which fell by $2.8 billion in Consumer Banking and $3.0 billion for the total Corporation, further supports this trend [5]. These changes suggest that consumers were more focused on reducing their debt and conserving cash during the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n\n![{Credit card outstandings and purchase volumes decreased, while home equity balances also declined.}](image2)\n![{Home equity balances decreased due to paydowns outpacing new originations.}](image4)\n\nIn summary, the changes in total credit card and home equity metrics between 2019 and 2020 indicate that consumers were more cautious with their spending and focused on paying down debt, likely due to the economic uncertainties and financial support measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic."}

For coal, the underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021, primarily due to lower prices and volumes [2]. The lower volumes alone decreased the underlying EBITDA by US$168 million, while controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by higher maintenance and stripping volumes [2]. This is further illustrated in the financial data for the year ended 30 June 2021, where the revenue from coal operations dropped from US$6,242 million in 2020 to US$5,154 million in 2021, and the average realized price for metallurgical coal fell from US$130.97 per tonne to US$106.64 per tonne [image2].\n\nFor nickel, the underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance costs following major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year [1]. The average realized sales price for nickel in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 [10]. The increase in nickel prices was driven by positive investor sentiment and a strong, geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand, although there was a brief correction in March due to an announcement by a major nickel producer [10].\n\nThe impact of changes in commodity prices on BHP's financial measures is quantified in the sensitivity analysis provided in the report. For instance, a US$1 per tonne increase in the metallurgical coal price would result in a US$35 million increase in underlying EBITDA [image1]. Similarly, a US$1 per tonne increase in the nickel price would have a significant impact, though the exact figure is not provided in the image.\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices, especially for coal and nickel, have a substantial impact on BHP's financial performance, driven by factors such as demand fluctuations, production volumes, and operational costs. ![Changes in commodity prices significantly affect BHP's financial results](image1)"}

The decline in comprehensive income is more pronounced, indicating that factors other than net income, such as foreign currency translation, cash flow hedges, and available-for-sale securities, have also negatively impacted the company's financial position.\n\nThe specific reasons for these declines can be inferred from the context provided in the text quotes. For instance, [3] mentions realized gains and losses on interest-bearing securities, which can affect comprehensive income. Additionally, [4] notes that the increase in interest and other income in 2019 was due to gains from the sale of interest-bearing securities to fund acquisitions, suggesting that such gains were less significant in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's financial performance, as reflected by both net income and comprehensive income, has shown a decline from 2018 to 2020, indicating potential challenges in maintaining profitability and managing financial risks during this period."}

In 2020, capital expenditures decreased significantly by $753 million, or 31%, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. This reduction in spending aligns with the company's efforts to manage costs and maintain financial stability during the economic downturn.\n\nThe decrease in capital expenditures is also reflected in the allocation of funds. In 2020, the company spent $1.64 billion on capital expenditures, with a focus on reinvesting in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, opening new ones [10]. This is a notable shift from 2019, where capital expenditures were higher at $2.394 billion, with more emphasis on new restaurant openings [4].\n\nDespite the reduction in capital expenditures, McDonald's continued to prioritize shareholder returns. In 2020, the company returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders, primarily through dividends paid [2]. The 2020 full-year dividend of $5.04 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters at $1.25 per share, with an increase to $1.29 per share in the fourth quarter, representing a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend [1]. This increase underscores the company's confidence in its cash flow and commitment to rewarding shareholders.\n\nThe performance graph shows that McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns, including price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends, have been robust relative to the S&P 500 Index and the DJIA companies over the five-year period ending December 31, 2020 [7]. This indicates that despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, McDonald's has maintained a strong financial position and continued to deliver value to its shareholders.\n\nIn summary, while McDonald's reduced its capital expenditures in 2020 to manage costs, it maintained a strong focus on returning value to shareholders through consistent dividend payments and buybacks. ![{McDonald's capital expenditures and shareholder returns show a strategic balance between cost management and shareholder value.}](image4)"}

Additionally, pandemic-related mobility restrictions and excise tax increases have further impacted cigarette consumption [1].\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: Excise tax increases in Mexico and Argentina have led to higher prices, causing adult smokers to down-trade to cheaper brands or switch to heated tobacco products [5].\n\n4. **Economic Factors**: Economic downturns and financial constraints, particularly during the pandemic, have influenced consumer spending habits, leading to a shift away from premium cigarette brands [5].\n\nOverall, the changes in cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume in East Asia & Australia and Latin America & Canada between 2019 and 2020 were driven by a combination of consumer preferences, market conditions, regulatory changes, and economic factors."}

Specifically, U.S. network volumes increased by 27 percent, while non-U.S. network volumes grew by 17 percent [6]. This growth reflects the ongoing recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with consumer and commercial billed business showing robust improvements [1].\n\nAdditionally, the average discount rate increased slightly from 2.28 percent in 2020 to 2.30 percent in 2021 [7]. This increase in the discount rate was driven by a change in the mix of spending, particularly the rise in travel and entertainment (T&E) volumes, which grew by 59 percent year-over-year [6].\n\nThe data also shows that consumer billed business increased by 29 percent, further contributing to the overall growth in discount revenue [10]. The strong performance in online and card-not-present spending, along with the full recovery and resumption of growth in offline spending, played a significant role in driving these increases [6].\n\nTo provide a visual representation of the changes in network volumes and billed business, consider the following chart:\n![{Worldwide network volumes and billed business increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, reflecting a strong recovery from the pandemic.}](image2)\n\nIn summary, the discount revenue increased by 26 percent from 2020 to 2021, driven by a combination of higher worldwide network volumes, an increase in the average discount rate, and strong growth in consumer and commercial billed business."}

In 2018, Tesla faced substantial restructuring costs, including $37 million in employee termination expenses and $55 million in expenses related to the energy generation and storage segment [1].

This improvement can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Operational Efficiencies**: Tesla continued to focus on operational efficiencies, which helped in reducing costs and improving margins [10].\n2. **Increased Revenue**: The company experienced an increase in services and other revenue, primarily due to higher non-warranty maintenance services and retail merchandise sales [4].\n3. **Cost Reduction**: The cost of services and other revenue decreased by $99 million, or 4%, driven by a reduction in used vehicle costs [9].\n4. **Foreign Currency Impact**: While Tesla recognized a net foreign currency loss of $114 million in 2020, this was a significant improvement from the $48 million gain in 2019 [5][6].\n\nThe trend clearly shows a significant improvement in Tesla's financial health, moving from a substantial loss in 2018 to a strong profit in 2020.

According to the financial statements, Danaher Corporation issued two series of mandatory convertible preferred stock:\n\n- In 2020, the company issued 1.72 million shares of 5.00% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.67 billion [2]. This issuance is also reflected in the preferred stock section of the stockholders' equity statement, showing an increase from the beginning of the period to the end of the period [image1].\n\n- In 2019, the company issued 1.65 million shares of 4.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, but this was not a new issuance in 2020. The Series A stock remained outstanding throughout 2020 [image2].\n\nNext, let's consider the changes in cash flow from financing activities. The cash flow statement provides detailed information on the sources and uses of cash in the financing activities section:\n\n- In 2020, the company received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock and preferred stock:\n  - Proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs: $1.73 billion [2]\n  - Proceeds from the public offering of preferred stock, net of issuance costs: $1.67 billion [2]\n  - These proceeds are reflected in the cash flow from financing activities section, contributing to the net cash provided by financing activities of $6,208 million [image5].\n\n- Additionally, the company paid dividends and had other financing activities:\n  - Payment of dividends: $615 million [image5]\n  - Net repayments of borrowings: $(4,637) million [image5]\n\nNow, let's summarize the impact on total stockholders' equity:\n\n- The issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock in 2020 added $1.67 billion to the preferred stock balance, increasing total stockholders' equity.\n- The proceeds from the public offering of common stock added $1.73 billion to the common stock and additional paid-in capital, further increasing total stockholders' equity.\n- The net cash provided by financing activities of $6,208 million in 2020, which includes the proceeds from stock issuances, contributed to the overall increase in total stockholders' equity.\n\nCombining these factors, the total stockholders' equity increased significantly from 2018 to 2020. Specifically, the total stockholders' equity at the end of 2020 was $39,777 million, compared to $30,282 million at the end of 2018, representing an increase of $9,495 million [image2].\n\nTherefore, the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and the positive cash flow from financing activities significantly contributed to the increase in Danaher Corporation's total stockholders' equity from 2018 to 2020. ![The total stockholders' equity increased from $30,282 million in 2018 to $39,777 million in 2020](image2)."}

This significant rise can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the decrease in income tax payments in 2021 played a crucial role. The tax deductions resulting from the senior notes exchange reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion, more than offsetting the higher taxable income from operations [1]. This reduction in tax payments directly contributed to the higher net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nAdditionally, the changes in operating assets and liabilities also impacted the cash flow. Specifically, the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, had a notable effect [2]. Despite these increases, there were also positive contributions from the operations of theme parks, which helped to offset some of the negative impacts [2].\n\nFurthermore, the operations of Universal Beijing Resort, which opened in September 2021, added to the operating lease liabilities and assets, but the overall impact on cash flow was not material [3].\n\nThe operating margin improvements also played a part. The operating margin increased from 42.1% in 2020 to 43.7% in 2021, indicating better cost management and higher-margin business growth [4].\n\nLastly, the proceeds from investments and other activities, such as cash distributions from equity method investments, also contributed positively to the net cash provided by operating activities [5].\n\nIn summary, the net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 due to a combination of reduced income tax payments, better management of operating assets and liabilities, improved operating margins, and positive contributions from investments and other activities. ![Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $24,737 million in 2020 to $29,146 million in 2021](image3)"}

This substantial shift in financial performance can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, there was a notable increase in margins on refined product sales, contributing $1.6 billion to the improved earnings [10]. This indicates that the segment was able to sell its products at higher margins, likely due to better market conditions or more efficient operations.\n\nAdditionally, higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem added $1.0 billion to the segment's profitability [10]. This suggests that the partnership with CPChem was particularly successful in 2021, providing a significant boost to the downstream segment's earnings.\n\nHigher sales volumes also played a role, adding $470 million to the earnings [10]. This increase in volume could be due to increased demand or more effective marketing and distribution strategies.\n\nHowever, these positive contributions were partially offset by higher operating expenses, which increased by $150 million [10]. Despite this, the overall impact was still a net positive, leading to the substantial improvement in earnings.\n\nTo visualize the magnitude of this change, consider the earnings (loss) data from the provided financial summary, which shows a clear shift from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021 ![{U.S. downstream earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to a profit in 2021}](image1).\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. downstream segment's earnings improved by $2.971 billion from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales, increased earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes, despite higher operating expenses."}

According to the financial statements, the net income for 2021 was $15,689 million, a substantial increase from the net loss of $5,561 million in 2020 [5]. This improvement can be attributed to several key factors:\n\nFirst, the company experienced a significant increase in operating activities, particularly in net income, which rose from a loss of $5,561 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,689 million in 2021. This turnaround was driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs that were present in 2020 [4][6][8][9].\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive income, which includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners, also saw a notable improvement. In 2021, the comprehensive income was $17,412 million, compared to a comprehensive loss of $6,183 million in 2020 [4]. This improvement was influenced by positive adjustments such as actuarial gains and the reclassification of net actuarial losses to net income [4].\n\nThe cash flow statement provides further insight into the financial activities that contributed to these changes. In 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was $29,187 million, a significant increase from $10,577 million in 2020 [image2]. This increase was primarily due to higher net income and adjustments for depreciation, depletion, and amortization, which remained relatively stable but contributed positively to cash flow.\n\nInvesting activities also played a role, with the company investing heavily in capital expenditures, totaling $8,056 million in 2021, slightly less than the $8,922 million spent in 2020 [image2]. However, proceeds from asset sales and returns of investment increased, contributing to a reduction in the net cash used for investing activities from $6,965 million in 2020 to $5,865 million in 2021 [image2].\n\nOn the financing side, the company made significant repayments of long-term debt and other financing obligations, totaling $7,364 million in 2021, compared to $5,489 million in 2020 [image2].

This significant increase can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the operating profit for 2021 was $6,878 million, an increase of $2,325 million, or 51%, compared to $4,553 million in 2020 [2]. This substantial rise in operating profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and higher profit from Financial Products, despite being partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses [2].\n\nSecondly, the company experienced a significant improvement in other income, which increased from a loss of $44 million in 2020 to a gain of $1,814 million in 2021 [10]. This dramatic shift was largely due to mark-to-market gains for the remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, which contributed positively to the overall financial performance [10].\n\nAdditionally, the provision for income taxes in 2021 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 22.9%, down from 27.8% in 2020 [10]. This reduction in the effective tax rate further enhanced the company's profitability [10].\n\nLastly, the company benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange gains in 2021, which contrasted with the net losses experienced in 2020 [10].\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the significant increase in comprehensive income (loss) attributable to shareholders from 2020 to 2021. ![Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to shareholders increased significantly from 2020 to 2021 due to higher operating profit, improved other income, and lower tax rates](image3)"}

This is evident from the plan to absorb between 1,000 and 1,200 stores during 2020 and 2021 [1]. By the end of FY2021, 578 stores had already been absorbed [4].\n   - ![{Stores are being optimized and absorbed, leading to a reduction in the total number of stores.}](image1)\n\n2. **Impact of the Pandemic**:\n   - The pandemic significantly impacted store operations, leading to closures and restrictions on new openings. Up to 90% of stores were closed in the first quarter of 2020, and there were significant restrictions on store openings in the final months of 2020 [10].\n   - This likely contributed to the overall reduction in the number of stores, as the company may have decided to focus on maintaining and optimizing existing stores rather than opening new ones.\n\n3. **Strategic Shifts**:\n   - Inditex has been focusing on enhancing its online presence and integrating physical and digital retail experiences. This strategic shift may have led to the closure of smaller, less profitable physical stores and the expansion of larger, more efficient ones [1].\n   - Additionally, the company has been active in acquisitions and consolidations, which can also affect the geographical distribution of stores [5][image5].\n\nIn conclusion, the geographical distribution of Inditex's stores changed from 2021 to 2022 due to a combination of store optimization efforts, the impact of the pandemic, and strategic shifts towards a more integrated and efficient retail model."}

According to the financial statements, the net earnings for 2018, 2019, and 2020 were $12,382 million, $14,239 million, and $15,769 million, respectively [2]. This indicates a steady increase in net earnings over the three-year period.\n\nThe comprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) such as unrealized gains or losses on investments and foreign currency translation adjustments, also saw an upward trend. The comprehensive income for 2018, 2019, and 2020 was $10,865 million, $14,821 million, and $15,533 million, respectively [3].\n\nTo understand the factors influencing these changes, we need to look at the components of comprehensive income. The main factors include:\n\n1. **Net Earnings**: The primary driver of comprehensive income is net earnings, which increased consistently over the three years. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including higher premium revenues and effective cost management. The company's premium revenues, which are a significant source of income, grew from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020 [image2]. This growth in premium revenues reflects the company's ability to expand its customer base and maintain strong market positions.\n\n2. **Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investment Securities**: Another important factor is the net unrealized gains or losses on investment securities. For instance, in 2020, the company reported net unrealized gains of $805 million, compared to $933 million in 2019 and a loss of $227 million in 2018 [image3]. These fluctuations in investment values can significantly impact the comprehensive income.\n\n3. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: Foreign currency translation adjustments also play a role in comprehensive income. In 2020, the company reported a foreign currency translation loss of $983 million, which was a significant negative impact on comprehensive income [image3]. This loss was more pronounced than the losses in previous years, indicating the volatility in international markets and the impact of exchange rate changes on the company's financials.\n\n4. **Reclassification Adjustments**: Reclassification adjustments for net realized gains included in net earnings also contributed to the comprehensive income. In 2020, the company reported a reclassification adjustment of $17 million, which was relatively small compared to the $24 million in 2019 and $14 million in 2018 [image3]. These adjustments reflect the company's realization of gains from its investment portfolio.\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, primarily driven by higher premium revenues and effective cost management. However, the comprehensive income was also influenced by fluctuations in unrealized gains/losses on investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. ![Net earnings and comprehensive income trends from 2018 to 2020](image3)\n\nThe main factors influencing these changes were the consistent growth in premium revenues, the volatility in investment values, and the impact of foreign currency translations."}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020, representing an increase of $3,039 million [2]. This increase, adjusted for currency, was $829 million [10]. The growth in noncurrent assets suggests that IBM has been investing in long-term resources, which could indicate a strategic focus on expanding its asset base to support future growth and operations.\n\nNext, we examine the long-term debt. The long-term debt remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [2]. This minimal change in long-term debt indicates that IBM has maintained a consistent level of long-term financing, which may reflect a cautious approach to managing its debt levels while ensuring it has the necessary funds for ongoing operations and investments.\n\nFinally, we consider the noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt). These liabilities increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020, a rise of $1,621 million [6]. Adjusted for currency, this increase was $251 million [6]. The rise in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) could be attributed to various factors, such as increased provisions for future obligations or the recognition of new long-term liabilities, which might align with the company's strategic initiatives and operational needs.\n\nThese changes collectively suggest that IBM has been strategically managing its balance sheet to support its long-term growth and financial stability. The increase in noncurrent assets indicates a focus on capitalizing on future opportunities, while the stable long-term debt and modest increase in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) reflect a balanced approach to financial management.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in noncurrent assets, long-term debt, and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) between 2019 and 2020 indicate that IBM is maintaining a prudent financial strategy aimed at supporting sustainable growth and operational efficiency. ![Noncurrent assets increased, long-term debt remained stable, and noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) rose slightly](image2)"}

In 2018, the provision for income taxes was $3,562 million, or 22.3% of the total revenue [3]. This indicates a significant increase in the provision for income taxes from 2018 to 2020.\n\nTo understand the factors contributing to this increase, we can look at the detailed breakdown of the tax provision. One notable factor is the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which was reinstated in 2020 after a moratorium in 2019. The company's portion of this tax was approximately $3.0 billion in 2020 [2], significantly impacting the overall tax provision for that year. Additionally, the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate remained consistent at 21.0% for both years, but other factors such as state income taxes, non-deductible compensation, and foreign tax differentials also played roles in the overall increase.\n\n![The provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020, reflecting a significant rise in tax expenses.](image1)\n\nIn summary, the provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020, primarily due to the reinstatement of the Health Insurance Industry Tax and other tax-related factors."}

This reduction in interest income is primarily due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans, driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [4].\n\nAdditionally, the average Card Member loans themselves saw a slight decrease from $82.8 billion in 2019 to $76.0 billion in 2021, a 8% reduction [4]. This decline in loan balances further contributed to the lower net interest yield [4].\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the cost of funds also decreased, with interest expense falling from $1,731 million in 2019 to $717 million in 2021, a 32% reduction [4]. This lower cost of funds partially offset the decline in interest income but was not enough to prevent the overall decrease in net interest yield [4].\n\nTo visualize the changes in Card Member loans and interest income over the years, refer to the following chart:\n![{Card Member loans and interest income trends from 2019 to 2021}](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.5% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, primarily due to a decline in interest income driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances and a reduction in average Card Member loans."}

The decline in 2020 was driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory [4]. Additionally, ENBREL has continued to lose market share, and this decline has been compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. Furthermore, the introduction of biosimilar versions of ENBREL, such as the FDA approval of a second biosimilar in April 2019, has intensified competition and contributed to the sales decline [8].\n\n![{ENBREL sales decreased by 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by lower unit demand and net selling price.}](image4)\n\nFor Prolia, the sales in 2020 were $2,763 million, marking a 3% increase from 2019's $2,672 million, which saw a significant 17% increase from 2018's $2,291 million [5]. The increase in 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price [5].

However, it's important to note that these percentages are based on the subtotal figures before intersegment eliminations.

This indicates a significant increase in the fair value impact of foreign currency rate-sensitive instruments from 2019 to 2020 [4].\n\nSimilarly, for instruments sensitive to interest rates, the fair value impact at December 31, 2020, was $180 million, whereas at December 31, 2019, it was $301 million. This suggests a decrease in the fair value impact of interest rate-sensitive instruments from 2019 to 2020 [4].\n\nTo visualize these changes, consider the following table:\n\n| Date                | Foreign Currency Rates (in millions) | Interest Rates (in millions) |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| December 31, 2020   | 59                                  | 180                         |\n| December 31, 2019   | 18                                  | 301                         |\n\nThe increase in the fair value impact of foreign currency rate-sensitive instruments and the decrease in the fair value impact of interest rate-sensitive instruments reflect the volatility and market conditions during the respective periods.

According to the data, the ACL for loans and lending commitments at the end of 2020 was $1,231 million, up from $590 million in 2019 [4]. This increase can be broken down into several key contributing factors.\n\nFirst, the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020, resulted in an initial increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million, with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax [5]. This adoption was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans.\n\nSecond, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic played a crucial role in the increase. The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment, which was significantly influenced by the continued economic impact of COVID-19 [8]. This provision was driven by actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends and the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook for various sectors, particularly Commercial real estate and Corporate loans.\n\nAdditionally, the firm experienced an increase in non-compensation expenses in 2020, which included higher volume-related expenses, integration-related expenses from the E*TRADE acquisition, and increased information processing and communications expenses [1, 7]. These factors contributed to a more cautious approach to credit risk management, further justifying the increase in the ACL.\n\nThe increase in the ACL is also evident in the breakdown of loans and lending commitments by maturity, where the total exposure to loans and lending commitments grew significantly, reflecting the firm's efforts to manage credit risk in a challenging economic environment ![Total exposure increased from 2019 to 2020, indicating a growing credit risk portfolio](image3).\n\nIn summary, the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) increased from $590 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2020, primarily due to the adoption of the CECL standard, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an overall increase in non-compensation expenses and credit risk management efforts."}

They also purchase and retire carbon offsets for unavoidable emissions, ensuring a holistic approach to reducing their carbon footprint [2].\n\nIn terms of air pollution, Bank of America reports their emissions from all global sites, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter, and other significant air emissions [image5]. In 2019, their air pollution emissions were as follows: SOx 1, NOx 20, CO 32, VOC 2, and particulate matter 3 [image5]. The valued impact of these air pollutants was estimated to be $146,000, calculated using the social cost factors from the World Resources Institute’s Transport Emissions & Social Cost Assessment (TESCA) Tool [image5].\n\nRegarding greenhouse gas emissions, Bank of America provides detailed emissions data for 2019, categorized by Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions [image4]. Their total net Scope 1 and Market-Based Scope 2 emissions were zero, demonstrating their success in offsetting direct and indirect emissions [image4]. However, significant Scope 3 emissions, such as those from purchased goods and services (2,329,208 tCO2e) and downstream transportation and distribution (1,400,000 tCO2e), highlight areas for further improvement [image4].\n\nThe societal impact of these emissions is also quantified. In 2019, the societal impact of Bank of America’s Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based), and Scope 3 emissions was estimated to be $238 million, using the EPA's 2020 social cost of carbon of $42/metric ton CO2 [image4].\n\nThese efforts and disclosures demonstrate Bank of America's commitment to transparency and accountability in addressing environmental issues. By setting and working towards ambitious targets, they aim to minimize their environmental impact and contribute to global sustainability goals.\n\nIn conclusion, Bank of America addresses environmental issues through a combination of emission reduction, renewable energy sourcing, and carbon offsetting, with a focus on achieving net-zero emissions before 2050. ![Quantifying the impact of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions](image5)"}

According to the data, the Underlying EBITDA increased from US$22,071 million in 2020 to US$37,379 million in 2021 [10].\n\n### Sales Prices\nThe change in sales prices contributed positively to the Underlying EBITDA. Specifically, there was a net price impact of US$16,095 million [image5]. This was primarily due to higher average realized prices for key commodities such as iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal. However, this positive impact was partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG.\n\n### Volumes\nThe change in volumes had a mixed impact. There was a net volume impact of US$(312) million [image5], indicating a slight negative effect. Despite achieving record volumes at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) and strong performance across the supply chain, these gains were offset by natural field decline at Petroleum. Additionally, expected lower grades at Escondida and Spence more than offset the record levels of concentrator throughput at Escondida and the new stream of concentrate production from the Spence Growth Option that came online in December 2020. Adverse weather impacts in the Gulf of Mexico (Petroleum) and at New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC), combined with dragline maintenance and higher strip ratios at Black Mountain Colliery (BMC), also contributed to the negative volume impact. This was partially offset by the acquisition of the additional 28% working interest at Shenzi and increased volumes at Nickel West following resource transition and major quadrennial maintenance shutdowns in the prior period.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the significant increase in Underlying EBITDA from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by higher sales prices, particularly for iron ore and other key commodities, despite a slight negative impact from changes in volumes. ![Higher sales prices and volumes positively impacted Underlying EBITDA, but volume changes had a slight negative effect.](image5)"}

According to the text, at September 26, 2021, the net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was $39 million [1]. In contrast, at September 27, 2020, the net asset was also $39 million, indicating no change in this particular asset.\n\nNext, consider the foreign currency forward and option contracts used to hedge foreign currency risk designated as cash flow hedges. The fair values of these contracts recorded in total assets were $42 million at September 26, 2021, and $51 million at September 27, 2020 [3]. This shows a decrease of $9 million in the fair value of these contracts.\n\nFor interest rate swaps, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps related to long-term debt at either date [2], so there was no change in this area.\n\nThe forward-starting interest rate swaps, which were entered into during fiscal 2021 to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuances through 2025, had a fair value of $105 million at September 26, 2021 [7]. Since there were no comparable figures provided for September 27, 2020, we can only note the presence of this new instrument.\n\nThe marketable equity securities had a recorded value of $682 million at September 26, 2021. A 10% decrease in the market price of these securities would result in a decrease of $68 million [9]. Comparatively, at September 27, 2020, a 10% decrease would have resulted in a decrease of $35 million, indicating a significant increase in the value of these securities over the year.\n\nFinally, the fair value of the company's holdings in fixed- and floating-rate securities was subject to interest rate risk. At September 26, 2021, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in a decrease of $50 million in the fair value of these holdings [10]. At September 27, 2020, the decrease would have been $32 million, showing an increase in sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\n![{The fair values of financial instruments, including forwards, options, and swaps, increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, the value of financial instruments, particularly foreign currency forward and option contracts, marketable equity securities, and holdings in fixed- and floating-rate securities, changed from September 27, 2020, to September 26, 2021, with some instruments increasing in value and others decreasing."}

By 2019, it increased to $14,821 million, and in 2020, it further increased to $15,533 million. This trend indicates a steady growth in comprehensive income over the three years [10].\n\n### Factors Contributing to the Changes\n\n1. **Net Earnings**: The net earnings, which form a significant part of comprehensive income, increased each year. In 2018, net earnings were $12,382 million, rising to $14,239 million in 2019, and further to $15,769 million in 2020. This consistent growth in net earnings is a primary driver of the increase in comprehensive income [10].\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**:\n   - **2018**: Other comprehensive income was $(236) million, primarily due to foreign currency translation losses and unrealized losses on investment securities [10].\n   - **2019**: Other comprehensive income improved to $582 million, mainly due to a positive reclassification adjustment for net realized gains and a reduction in foreign currency translation losses [10].\n   - **2020**: Other comprehensive income was $(1,517) million, largely influenced by significant foreign currency translation losses and unrealized losses on investment securities [10].\n\n3. **Foreign Currency Translation Losses**: These losses were particularly pronounced in 2020, amounting to $(983) million, compared to $(271) million in 2019 and $(236) million in 2018. The increase in foreign currency translation losses in 2020 significantly impacted the comprehensive income [10].\n\n4. **Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Securities**: The net unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities also fluctuated. In 2018, there was a net loss of $(227) million, which turned into a gain of $933 million in 2019 but then reversed to a loss of $(227) million in 2020 [10].\n\n5. **Reclassification Adjustments**: These adjustments, which reflect the realized gains or losses from investment securities, also played a role. In 2018, there was a net gain of $17 million, which increased to $24 million in 2019 but decreased to $14 million in 2020 [10].\n\n### Visual Representation\nTo better understand the financial performance, let's look at the comprehensive income breakdown over the years:\n\n![Comprehensive income increased from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020, driven by growing net earnings and fluctuating other comprehensive income.](image10)\n\n### Conclusion\nUnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income increased from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,533 million in 2020, primarily due to consistent growth in net earnings and varying contributions from other comprehensive income, including foreign currency translation losses and unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities."}

This decline can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirst, there was a significant decrease in core merchandise categories, particularly in fresh foods and foods and sundries, which contributed to a 33 basis-point decrease in gross margin [5]. Additionally, the company faced a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs, which further reduced gross margin by 19 basis points [5].\n\nAnother factor was the increased 2% rewards program, which negatively impacted gross margin by one basis point [5]. Despite these challenges, the warehouse ancillary and other businesses, including gasoline, positively contributed to gross margin by 29 basis points [5]. However, this was not enough to offset the overall decline.\n\nThe ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19 had a positive impact of five basis points on gross margin [5], but this was a relatively minor factor compared to the other influences.\n\nChanges in foreign currencies also played a role, negatively impacting gross margin by approximately $176 million, primarily affecting the Other International Operations [5].\n\nTo visualize the trend in gross margin percentage over the years, consider the following data:\n![{Gross margin percentage decreased from 10.04% in 2020 to 8.88% in 2022}](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the gross margin percentage decreased from 10.04% in 2020 to 8.88% in 2022, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, a LIFO charge, and increased rewards, partially offset by positive contributions from warehouse ancillary businesses and the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19."}

For the Board of Directors, the bonus can be awarded in the form of shares that are blocked for ten years, as seen in the case of the Chairman of the Board, Dr. Christoph Franz, who received a bonus award of CHF 949,263 in shares [8]. This aligns with the broader remuneration structure where the Board's bonuses can be paid in cash, blocked non-voting equity securities, or shares [4][image4].\n\nIn contrast, the CEC's bonus remuneration is more complex and includes both short-term and long-term incentives. The annual variable bonus, known as the Short-Term Incentive (STI), is based on performance against agreed objectives [3][5]. Additionally, the CEC receives long-term incentives (LTI) in the form of Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) [3][image2]. These LTIs are typically structured to vest over a period of four years and have an expiration period of ten years [image3].\n\nThe Remuneration Committee plays a crucial role in determining the bonuses for both groups. For the Board of Directors, the Remuneration Committee decides on the bonuses and their forms, which are then submitted for a binding vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) [9][image4]. For the CEC, the Remuneration Committee also decides on the bonuses and their forms, but these decisions are based on a detailed performance review and are subject to a binding vote at the AGM [5][image4].\n\nIn summary, the main differences lie in the form and structure of the bonuses, with the Board receiving primarily share-based awards and the CEC receiving a combination of cash, S-SARs, and RSUs. ![The Board receives share-based bonuses, while the CEC receives a mix of cash, S-SARs, and RSUs](image4)"}

This increase can be attributed to several key factors:\n\nFirst, the company issued multiple tranches of fixed-rate, long-term debt in 2020. Specifically, in March 2020, the company issued a principal amount of $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025, incurring $4 million in issuance costs, with net proceeds of $749 million [7]. Additionally, in May 2020, another $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030 was issued, incurring $5 million in issuance costs, with net proceeds of $749 million [9].\n\nSecond, while the company issued significant amounts of new debt, it also retired some maturing debt. In 2020, the company retired $500 million of maturing debt [3]. However, the net proceeds from the new debt issuances outweighed the amount of maturing debt retired, contributing to the overall increase in long-term debt.\n\nThird, the company's financing activities in 2020 used $4.55 billion, which was slightly less than the $4.73 billion used in 2019 [3]. This suggests that while the company was active in its debt management, the new debt issuances were primarily used for general corporate purposes and to support ongoing operations.\n\nLastly, the company's cash position improved, with total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) increasing by $1.18 billion to $6.57 billion at the end of 2020 [4]. This indicates that the additional debt was not solely used to cover immediate cash needs but also to strengthen the company's financial position.\n\nIn summary, the long-term debt increased from $5,303 million in 2019 to $6,248 million in 2020, primarily due to the issuance of new fixed-rate, long-term debt in 2020, which was used for general corporate purposes and to retire some maturing debt. ![New debt issuances in 2020 contributed to the increase in long-term debt](image5)"}

Specifically, the adjusted EBIT rose from €2,248 million in 2020 to €3,142 million in 2021, representing a 40% increase [4].

In fiscal year 2021, the net income grew from €1,423 million in 2020 to €1,746 million, marking a 23% increase [4].

According to the balance sheet, the total non-current assets increased from DKK 63,156 million in 2019 to DKK 79,113 million in 2020 [image5]. This significant increase can be attributed to the rise in intangible assets, which grew from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020. This substantial growth in intangible assets suggests that the company invested heavily in patents, licenses, and other research and development projects during this period [5].\n\nNext, we examine the total equity.

However, these gains were partially offset by dividends paid out (DKK 20,121 million) and the purchase of treasury shares (DKK 16,855 million) [image2].\n\nThe increase in both non-current assets and total equity indicates a strengthening of the company's financial position. The higher non-current assets, particularly in intangible assets, suggest a focus on long-term growth and innovation. The rise in total equity reflects improved profitability and the company's ability to retain earnings, despite significant dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in non-current assets and total equity from 2019 to 2020 positively affected the company's financial position, indicating a strong focus on long-term growth and improved financial health. ![Non-current assets and total equity increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, reflecting a stronger financial position.](image5)"}

This decrease can be attributed to several factors, including changes in retained earnings and AOCI.\n\n### Retained Earnings\nRetained earnings represent the cumulative net income that has been reinvested in the business rather than paid out as dividends. In 2021, the company reported a net income of $8,060 million [10], which should have increased retained earnings. However, the actual retained earnings decreased from $13,837 million in 2020 to $13,474 million in 2021 [image5]. This decrease is primarily due to the repurchase of common shares, which amounted to $7,598 million in 2021, and the payment of cash dividends, totaling $1,359 million [image5].\n\n### Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)\nAOCI includes items that are not included in the net income but still affect shareholders' equity. In 2021, the AOCI decreased from a loss of $2,895 million in 2020 to a loss of $2,945 million in 2021 [image5]. This slight increase in the loss is due to foreign currency translation adjustments, which saw a significant negative impact of $330 million in 2021, compared to a loss of $381 million in 2020 [image4].\n\n### Impact on Financial Position\nThe decrease in total shareholders' equity, despite a strong net income, indicates that the company's financial position was affected by significant share repurchases and dividend payments. These actions reduced the amount of retained earnings available for reinvestment in the business. Additionally, the negative foreign currency translation adjustments added to the overall decrease in AOCI, further impacting the company's financial position.\n\nIn summary, the changes in shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021, particularly the decrease in retained earnings and the slight increase in the loss in AOCI, reflect the company's strategic decisions to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which, while beneficial to shareholders, reduced the company's internal capital base. ![The total shareholders' equity decreased slightly from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021](image5)"}

In 2018, the company used approximately $1.238 billion in net cash for investing activities. By 2019, this figure decreased slightly to $1.238 billion. However, in 2020, the net cash used in investing activities surged to $21.239 billion [7]. This substantial increase in 2020 was primarily due to the cash paid for acquisitions, particularly the Cytiva Acquisition, and to a lesser extent, investments [1].\n\nComparatively, the total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations also increased over the same period but at a much more moderate rate. In 2018, the company generated $3.644 billion in operating cash flows. This figure increased to $3.657 billion in 2019 and further to $6.215 billion in 2020 [4].

According to the consolidated statement of cash flows [2], the Group’s net cash flow from operating activities, adjusted to remove the impact of AASB 16, was $48.1 million [10]. This indicates a positive cash flow from operations despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNext, we need to consider the changes in retained earnings. The consolidated statement of changes in equity [1] provides a detailed breakdown of the changes in equity over the specified period. Specifically, the balance sheet entries show the retained earnings at the beginning and end of the periods in question.\n\nFrom the consolidated statement of changes in equity [image3], we can see the following key figures:\n\n- **Balance at 2 July 2018**: Retained earnings were $45,242,000.\n- **Total comprehensive income for the year ending 30 June 2019**: This contributed $37,043,000 to retained earnings.\n- **Balance at 1 July 2019**: Retained earnings were $80,245,000.\n- **Total comprehensive income for the year ending 28 June 2020**: This contributed $11,221,000 to retained earnings.\n- **Balance at 28 June 2020**: Retained earnings were $57,685,000.\n\nThe changes in retained earnings over the two years can be summarized as follows:\n- From 2 July 2018 to 30 June 2019, retained earnings increased by $37,043,000.\n- From 1 July 2019 to 28 June 2020, retained earnings decreased by $22,560,000 (from $80,245,000 to $57,685,000).\n\nThe decrease in retained earnings in the fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a reduction in revenue and earnings [8].\n\nNow, let's combine this with the cash flow from operating activities. The positive cash flow from operating activities of $48.1 million [10] contributed to the overall financial health of the company, but it did not fully offset the decline in retained earnings due to the pandemic.\n\n![{Retained earnings and total comprehensive income over the period}](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, while the cash flow from operating activities remained positive, the significant decrease in retained earnings due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a net decrease in total equity from July 2018 to June 2020."}

The primary drivers of this increase include:\n- **Goodwill and Intangible Assets**: Slightly increased from $5,761 million in 2021 to $5,783 million in 2022.\n- **Fixed Assets**: Increased from $1,512 million in 2021 to $1,542 million in 2022.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits**: Substantially increased from $645 million in 2021 to $1,031 million in 2022.\n- **Unrealized Gain on Financial and Foreign Exchange Transactions**: Increased from $111 million in 2021 to $439 million in 2022.\n\n### Impact on Financial Position\nThe changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities have several implications for the company's financial position:\n- **Net Deferred Tax Liability Increase**: The net deferred tax liability (deferred tax liabilities minus deferred tax assets) increased from $3,939 million in 2021 to $5,197 million in 2022. This suggests a higher future tax obligation, which could impact the company's cash flow and financial flexibility.\n- **Pension and Other Retiree Benefits**: The significant decrease in pension and other retiree benefits deferred tax assets and the substantial increase in other retiree benefits deferred tax liabilities indicate a shift in the company's retirement obligations and their tax treatment.\n- **Unrealized Gains**: The increase in unrealized gains on financial and foreign exchange transactions suggests improved financial performance or favorable currency movements, but it also increases the company's future tax burden.\n\nOverall, the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect a more complex tax environment and increased future tax obligations for the company. ![Deferred tax assets and liabilities have changed significantly, impacting the company's future tax obligations.](image3)"}

According to the text, the vesting schedule for RSUs is detailed in the Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Unit Vesting Schedule, which outlines specific performance metrics and timeframes [1].\n\nFor the first three years, the vesting of RSUs is tied to the Non-GAAP Operating Income (Non-GAAP OI) of the business unit, which must meet certain thresholds. Specifically, the Business Unit’s Non-GAAP OI for each year must not be more than 15% less than the Non-GAAP OI objective set forth in the Annual Operating Plan (AOP) for that year [6]. This performance factor is used to adjust the number of RSUs that vest each year, which is typically one-third of the total awarded RSUs, known as the Annual Target Amount [8].\n\nTo illustrate, the number of RSUs vesting each year is calculated as follows:\n- **First Full Year:** The number of RSUs vesting is equal to the Annual Target Amount, adjusted by the performance factor and rounded to the nearest whole number.\n- **Second Full Year:** Similarly, the number of RSUs vesting is equal to the Annual Target Amount, adjusted by the performance factor and rounded to the nearest whole number.\n- **Third Full Year:** The same calculation applies, with the number of RSUs vesting equal to the Annual Target Amount, adjusted by the performance factor and rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nAdditionally, the vesting of RSUs is contingent on the holder remaining continuously employed by the company or one of its subsidiaries through the vesting dates [4].\n\n![{The number of RSUs vesting each year is adjusted by the performance factor and rounded to the nearest whole number.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the conditions for restricted share units vesting over the first three years include meeting specific performance metrics related to the Non-GAAP OI of the business unit and maintaining continuous employment with the company."}

According to the text, almost every major bank, corporation, and insurance company in Europe created its own venture capital fund during 1999-2000 [2]. This surge in investment led to a bubble, which subsequently burst, causing a significant shakeout in the industry. The post-bubble period saw a consolidation of the market, leaving only the strongest venture capital firms standing [2].\n\nBy 2007, the market had evolved significantly. The scarcity of venture capital funds in Europe, as noted in the text, led to lower entry valuations and increased capital efficiency [4]. This environment also allowed investors to be more selective, leading to higher yields and better performance [4]. Additionally, the European venture capital industry began to see a more mature ecosystem, with an entrepreneurial boom and companies scaling faster and achieving more value sooner [7].\n\nThe changes in the investment stage distribution can be visualized through the following image, which shows the shift in investment focus over time:\n\n![{The chart illustrates a shift from early-stage to later-stage investments from 1998 to 2007, reflecting the maturation of the European venture capital market.}](image4)\n\nThis chart indicates that the 1998 fund primarily focused on early-stage investments, whereas the 2007 fund had a more balanced approach, with a greater emphasis on later-stage investments.

In 2013, Telkomsel had around 139.3 million subscribers, while XL and Indosat had fewer subscribers, with XL at approximately 57.5 million and Indosat at around 51.8 million [image4]. By late 2014, the total number of Indonesian mobile subscribers reached 240 million, indicating a continuous growth trend throughout the year [3].\n\nNext, let's examine the data user numbers. In 2013, the number of data users for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat were 85 million, 29.5 million, and 24.5 million, respectively [image4]. By late 2014, the number of data users for these operators likely increased, driven by the growing adoption of smartphones and the shift towards data-based services such as instant messaging and VoIP [10]. This is further supported by the fact that instant messaging became the primary method of communication, with 90% of mobile phone users using IM every day [8].\n\nThe increasing number of data users and the shift towards data-based services suggest that Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat were adapting to the changing market dynamics. Telkomsel, being the largest operator, maintained its leading position, while XL and Indosat also saw growth in their subscriber and data user bases. However, the competition among GSM operators, particularly the pressure from CDMA operators to reduce tariffs, might have influenced their performance [7].\n\nIn summary, the subscriber numbers and data user numbers for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat increased from 2013 to late 2014, indicating strong performance and adaptation to the growing demand for data services. ![Subscriber and data user growth for Telkomsel, XL, and Indosat from 2013 to late 2014](image4)"}

This lack of visibility can make it challenging to directly compare the IPO index values.\n\nDespite these challenges, the fundamental improvements in the European venture capital market since 2004 have been significant. The combination of an entrepreneurial boom and a mature seed/venture ecosystem has led to European early-stage companies scaling faster and achieving more value sooner [7].

However, we can infer some details from the context and the nature of demographic charts typically used in such presentations.\n\nFrom the description of the first image:\n- The chart categorizes age groups and the percentage of mobile internet users within each group.\n- It also includes categories for different occupations such as full-time job, business, entrepreneur, part-time job, student, housewives, and retired.\n\nGiven the typical design of such charts, they often use distinct colors to differentiate between categories. For the age groups, there are four categories:\n- m > 35\n- m 25-35\n- m 18-24\n- m < 18\n\nEach of these age groups is likely represented by a different color. Additionally, the occupational categories are listed, and if they are also represented in the chart, each would likely have a distinct color as well.\n\nHowever, without a direct visual reference, we can only estimate based on common practices. Typically, such charts use one color per category, and since there are four age groups, we can reasonably assume there are four colors in the chart.\n\nTherefore, the chart in the top right corner of the slide that includes Mobile Internet Demographics and Trends likely uses four colors to represent the different age groups.\n\n![{The chart in the top right corner of the slide uses four colors to represent different age groups.}](image1)"}

For instance, those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one (62% to 30%), and those with a four-year college degree also lean towards the Democrat (53% to 40%) [4]. This trend is further supported by the breakdown of vote preferences across different educational levels, where higher education correlates with a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate.\n\n![{Higher education levels correlate with a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate.}](image1)\n\nConversely, voters with less education, such as those with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%), are less likely to think neither party has high ethical standards, suggesting a more balanced or divided preference [3]. This indicates that lower educational attainment may lead to less polarized political views and more evenly split voting patterns.\n\nIn summary, higher educational levels are associated with a greater preference for Democratic candidates in congressional elections."}

By 2018, this number had risen to 38%, making Independents the largest single group in the electorate [1]. \n\nHowever, despite the increase in the number of people identifying as Independents, the majority of these individuals still lean toward one of the two major parties. Specifically, 81% of Independents lean either Republican or Democratic, with 17% leaning Democratic and 13% leaning Republican [4]. This indicates that while more people are identifying as Independents, they are not necessarily politically unaligned or neutral. \n\nFurthermore, the data shows that the share of Independents who view both parties negatively has decreased in recent years. In 2015, 36% of Independents viewed both parties unfavorably, but this number has since declined [3]. This suggests that even though more people are identifying as Independents, they are not uniformly disenchanted with the political system.\n\nThe trend in political identification also reveals that the ideological leanings of Independents have shifted. For example, among Democratic-leaning Independents, the gap between those identifying as moderates and liberals has narrowed since 2000, with 45% now identifying as moderates and 39% as liberals [2]. Similarly, among Republican-leaning Independents, the share identifying as conservatives has increased from 42% in 2000 to 51% in 2018 [8].\n\nThese trends suggest that while the proportion of Independents has grown, their political leanings remain closely aligned with the two major parties, and their ideological positions have become more polarized over time. ![The proportion of Independents has increased, but most still lean toward a major party.](image5) In conclusion, the increase in the proportion of Independents from 1994 to 2018 indicates a growing dissatisfaction with traditional party labels, but it does not reflect a significant shift toward true political independence."}

One of the key issues is the rapid growth of the world's population, which is doubling every 35 to 40 years [4]. This exponential growth has significant implications for resource consumption and pollution. As the population increases, so does the pollution from human activities such as driving automobiles, farming, and manufacturing [6].\n\nAnother critical challenge is the greenhouse effect, which is exacerbated by the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO), and methane (CH4). These gases trap infrared rays in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and rising sea levels [7][10]. The consequences can be severe, including the melting of ice caps and potential mass flooding in low-lying areas [7].\n\nAdditionally, the increasing demand for mobility and travel poses significant health risks. These risks can only be mitigated through continuous improvements in fuel efficiency, emissions controls, and vehicle maintenance [9]. This is particularly important as the world's population continues to grow and the demand for transportation increases.\n\nLastly, the availability of crude oil and other energy resources is a major concern. As the world population grows, the demand for energy increases, but the supply of non-renewable resources is limited [image2]. This necessitates the development of new technologies and more efficient use of energy to meet future demands while minimizing environmental impact [image4].\n\nIn summary, the four concrete facts of global challenges are:\n1. The world's population is doubling every 35 to 40 years [4].\n2. Pollution from human activities, such as driving and manufacturing, is increasing [6].\n3. The greenhouse effect is causing global warming and rising sea levels [7][10].\n4.

Initially, concerns about civil liberties were more prevalent, but by 2015, a majority of Americans were more worried that anti-terror policies were not stringent enough to protect the country.\n\nIn 2004, the balance of opinion was relatively balanced, with 47% of Americans expressing concern that government policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties, while 35% believed that policies had not gone far enough to protect the country [7]. This trend began to change over the years, especially after significant events like the failed Christmas-Day terrorist attack in 2010 and the Edward Snowden revelations in 2013.\n\nBy 2015, the tide had clearly turned. According to the Pew Research Center, 56% of Americans now believed that anti-terror policies had not gone far enough to protect the country, while only 28% were more concerned about civil liberties being restricted [3]. This represents a substantial shift from the 2004 data, where the percentages were nearly reversed.\n\nThis shift is also evident in the demographic breakdown. For instance, younger Americans (ages 18-29) were more likely to express concern about civil liberties (43%), but even within this age group, a majority (44%) felt that policies were not far enough to protect the country ![Concerns vary by age group](image1).\n\nThe political landscape also played a role in this shift. Republicans, in particular, showed a significant increase in concern that policies were not stringent enough, with 71% of Republicans expressing this view in 2015, up from 38% in July 2013 [2]. Democrats also saw an increase, though less pronounced, with 67% of conservative and moderate Democrats sharing this concern [5].\n\nOverall, the data indicates a clear trend toward greater concern about the adequacy of anti-terror policies in protecting the country, with a corresponding decrease in concern about civil liberties.

Initially, the county saw a dramatic increase in population, driven by the Homestead Act and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. According to the census data, the population of Hamilton County grew from just 130 in 1870 to 14,096 in 1890, marking a tenfold increase within two decades [9]. This surge in population was accompanied by the establishment of numerous rural school districts and the formation of strong ethnic communities [6].\n\nHowever, after reaching its peak in 1890, the population began a slow decline. By 1900, the population had slightly decreased to 13,330, and this downward trend continued through the 20th century, with fluctuations along the way. The most recent census in 2000 recorded a population of 9,403, a far cry from the peak of 14,096 [image3].\n\nSeveral historical factors contributed to these population trends. The initial growth was fueled by the Homestead Act, which provided incentives for settlers to move to the area and establish farms [9]. The construction of the Union Pacific Railroad further facilitated this migration by improving transportation and access to markets [9]. These developments led to the rapid settlement and development of Hamilton County.\n\nHowever, the decline in population after 1890 can be attributed to several factors. One significant factor is the consolidation of farms, which reduced the number of small-scale farmers and led to a more centralized agricultural landscape. As power equipment became more prevalent, the scale of farming operations increased, making it difficult for smaller farms to remain economically viable [4]. This consolidation resulted in fewer people living in rural areas and a shift towards larger, more efficient farming operations.\n\nAdditionally, the economic challenges of the early 20th century, including the Great Depression and subsequent agricultural crises, likely contributed to the population decline. Many rural residents may have moved to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities [4].\n\nDespite these challenges, some towns within Hamilton County, such as Aurora, have shown resilience and even population gains. Aurora's population peaked in 2000 with 4,225 citizens and has steadily increased since 1940, demonstrating that certain areas within the county have managed to maintain or even grow their populations [2].\n\nIn summary, the population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000 were characterized by an initial rapid growth followed by a gradual decline, influenced by the Homestead Act, the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, and the consolidation of farms. ![Hamilton County's population peaked in 1890 and has since declined, with some towns like Aurora showing resilience](image3)"}

It shows that Trump's grades (30% A or B) are notably lower than those of previous winning candidates like George W.

For example, a majority of both Democrats (60%) and Republicans (54%) agree that there should be limits on the number of human jobs that businesses can replace with machines [7]. This suggests that while there are significant differences in overall attitudes towards government responsibility, there is some common ground on specific measures to address job displacement.\n\nDespite these pronounced differences, the public is evenly split overall on whether the government or individuals should be primarily responsible for taking care of displaced workers.

This number peaked slightly in 1900 with 2,049 farms [3]. However, the trend began to reverse after the turn of the century, and by 1950, the number of farms had dropped to 1,453 [3].\n\nThis decline can be attributed to several factors, including the mechanization of agriculture, which allowed farmers to cultivate larger tracts of land more efficiently. As a result, the average farm size increased, and smaller farms became less economically viable. Bertha Bremer, a Hamilton County historian, noted that \"power equipment has accelerated farming, and no longer are farm operators content with quarter sections of land, nor can they afford to operate on such a small scale due to increased costs of operation\" [1].\n\nAdditionally, the consolidation of farms led to a reduction in the number of farms while increasing the average size of each farm. For instance, in 1920, the average Hamilton County farm was 179.7 acres, and by 1997, the average farm size had increased to 507 acres [1]. This trend of consolidation continued into the 21st century, further reducing the number of farms while increasing their size.\n\n![{The number of farms in Hamilton County decreased significantly from 1880 to 1950.}](image3)\n\nIn summary, the number of farms in the U.S., as exemplified by Hamilton County, decreased from 1880 to 1950 due to the mechanization and consolidation of agriculture."}

This suggests a nuanced view among more educated individuals, who are more likely to differentiate between the parties based on ethical standards.\n\nFurthermore, there are substantial differences in early midterm vote preferences based on educational level. Those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one (62% to 30%), and those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat 53% to 40% [2].

According to the image quote [image3], which shows the distribution of album sales, song sales, and streams, streaming accounted for 37% of the business in 2015. However, the question asks for the year when streaming had a 20% share. Given the trend shown in [image4], where streaming grew by 30% from 2013 to 2014, it is reasonable to infer that streaming reached a 20% share in 2014.\n\nNext, we need to determine the average weekly listening hours for both 2013 and 2014. The text quote [8] states that \"DRIVEN BY ACCESS AND TECHNOLOGY LISTENING TIME IS RISING,\" indicating an increase in listening time over the years. However, specific numerical values for average weekly listening hours are not provided in the text quotes.\n\nTo find the specific values, we can look at the image quote [image5], which provides a breakdown of total music volume and sales for 2014 and 2015. While this image does not directly provide average weekly listening hours, it does show the growth in digital and streaming volumes, which can be correlated with increased listening time.\n\nGiven the information, we can infer that the average weekly listening time in 2013 was lower than in 2014 due to the rising trend mentioned in [8]. To estimate the difference, we can use the growth rate of streaming and digital volumes.\n\nFrom [image5], we see that:\n- Total music volume in 2014 was 183M, with a 91% increase in digital streaming (SEA).\n- Total music volume in 2015 was 121M, with a 62M increase in digital streaming (SEA).\n\nAssuming a linear growth pattern, the increase in streaming and digital volumes from 2013 to 2014 would contribute to an increase in average weekly listening hours. If we assume that the average weekly listening time in 2013 was \\( T_{2013} \\) and in 2014 was \\( T_{2014} \\), and given the significant growth in streaming, we can estimate that \\( T_{2014} \\) is higher than \\( T_{2013} \\).\n\nGiven the 30% growth in streaming from 2013 to 2014, we can estimate that the average weekly listening time in 2014 was approximately 30% higher than in 2013. Therefore, if \\( T_{2013} \\) is \\( x \\) hours, then \\( T_{2014} \\) would be \\( 1.3x \\) hours.\n\nThe difference in average weekly listening hours between 2013 and 2014 is:\n\\[ T_{2014} - T_{2013} = 1.3x - x = 0.3x \\]\n\nWithout the exact value of \\( x \\), we can conclude that the average weekly listening time increased by approximately 30% from 2013 to 2014.\n\nTherefore, the difference in average weekly listening hours between 2013 and 2014 is approximately 30% of the 2013 average weekly listening time. ![{Streaming grew by 30% from 2013 to 2014, indicating a significant increase in listening time.}](image4)"}

The image does not explicitly state 'Don't know' responses, but it provides a comparison of countries that might help us infer the level of uncertainty.\n\nFrom image1, we see the following countries and their rankings over the years:\n- 2014: UAE, United States, Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar\n- 2013: Ensaag, France, United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia\n\nGiven the context of the question, we need to identify the country with the highest 'Don't know' percentage.

The tank-to-wheels efficiency, on the other hand, measures the energy used by the vehicle itself, from the tank to the wheels.\n\nFor electric vehicles, the energy source is typically electricity generated from various means, including renewable sources, nuclear, and fossil fuels. The well-to-tank efficiency for electricity can vary widely depending on the source. For internal combustion engines, the primary energy source is usually gasoline or diesel, and the well-to-tank efficiency is relatively consistent across different regions.\n\nAccording to the data provided, the well-to-tank efficiency for electricity can be significantly higher when sourced from renewable resources. For example, hydrogen produced from renewable resources (H2 from renewable resources) has a much lower carbon footprint compared to hydrogen produced from natural gas or coal. This is illustrated in the chart showing different fuel types and their CO2 emissions per kilometer [image3].\n\nAdditionally, the tank-to-wheels efficiency for electric vehicles is generally higher than for internal combustion engine vehicles. Electric motors are more efficient at converting stored energy into motion, typically achieving efficiencies around 60-70%, whereas internal combustion engines have efficiencies ranging from 20-30%.\n\nThe overall efficiency from source to wheel for electric vehicles is therefore a combination of the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheels efficiencies. When electricity is generated from renewable sources, the overall efficiency can be significantly higher compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, which rely on less efficient processes both in energy extraction and vehicle operation.\n\nIn summary, electric vehicles generally have a higher overall energy efficiency from source to wheel compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, especially when the electricity is sourced from renewable resources. ![Electric vehicles have a higher overall energy efficiency from source to wheel compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.](image3)"}

According to the survey, 74% of women in computer jobs report having experienced gender-related discrimination at work, compared to only 16% of men [5]. This stark difference is further supported by another finding that women in computer jobs are more likely than men to perceive gender discrimination as a major problem in the tech industry (43% vs. 31%) [1].\n\nMoreover, women in computer jobs are more likely to report specific forms of discrimination, such as pay inequities (46% vs. 29% of all women in STEM) and being treated as if they were not competent at work because of their gender (40% vs. 29% of all women in STEM) [3].

For instance, in the case of GL (Galician) to EN (English), pre-training leads to a substantial improvement of up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This finding is further supported by a qualitative analysis of GL to EN translations, which shows that pre-training not only helps the model capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed [2].\n\nThis trend is consistent across other low-resource languages. For example, the BLEU scores for AZ (Azerbaijani) to EN and BE (Belarusian) to EN show smaller but still notable gains, with AZ increasing from 1.3 to 2.0 and BE from 1.6 to 2.5 [4]. However, the gains are most pronounced when the baseline system is already somewhat effective, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4].\n\nFor higher-resource languages, the gains are more modest but still significant. For example, the BLEU score for PT (Portuguese) to EN increases from 26.2 to 30.3, and for RU (Russian) to EN, it increases from 18.5 to 21.2 [4]. This indicates that pre-training is beneficial even for languages with more extensive training data, though the relative improvement is smaller compared to low-resource languages.\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also influenced by the similarity of the language pairs. For instance, when pre-trained embeddings are used in a multilingual setting, the BLEU scores for GL/PT (Galician/Portuguese) show the largest gains, while BE/RU (Belarusian/Russian) shows a small decrease [5]. This is because the word embeddings of similar languages are more likely to align well, making it easier for the model to learn from them [10].\n\nIn summary, pre-training significantly improves BLEU scores, especially for low-resource languages, and the gains are more pronounced when the baseline system is moderately effective. The similarity of the language pairs also plays a crucial role in determining the extent of the improvement. ![Pre-training improves BLEU scores for GL-EN, PT-EN, and other language pairs, with the largest gains for low-resource languages.](image4)"}

For instance, when the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement in performance. However, further increases in the number of demonstrations (e.g., ≥10) do not yield significant additional benefits [10].\n\nWhen logical constraints are incorporated, the performance improvement is more pronounced. For example, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE yields a Micro-F1 score of 25.7%, which is higher than the 24.5% achieved with 10 demonstrations without logical constraints [10]. This indicates that combining a smaller number of demonstrations with logical constraints can be more effective than using a larger number of demonstrations alone.\n\nAdditionally, the table in Image 4 provides a detailed comparison of Micro-F1 scores for different numbers of demonstration samples and the presence of logical constraints. For MAVEN-ERE, the Micro-F1 score increases from 15.3% to 18.0% when using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with logical constraints, and further to 25.3% with all logical constraints [image2].

The single-task model focuses on a single output sequence, and the attention mechanism is used to align the input features with the output sequence.\n\nThe key difference lies in the attention mechanism.

The main components and their functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Function**: The multimodal retriever is responsible for creating and storing multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions. This component queries a large multimodal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. It is crucial for efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images and text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval.\n   - **Optimization**: To enhance the speed of retrieval, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented. This reduces the dimensionality of the vectors, making the retrieval process faster and more efficient [7].\n\n   ![](image3)\n   - **Conclusion**: The multimodal retriever constructs and stores feature embeddings and indexes them for quick retrieval of top-k categories.\n\n2. **Pre-processing for Object Detection**:\n   - **Function**: For object detection datasets, the pre-processing involves additional steps such as cropping and blurring. Cropping is done based on proposal bounding box coordinates to focus on specific regions of interest, and blurring is applied to non-target areas to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects.\n   - **Optimization**: These steps help in handling the variability in object sizes and positions within the images, ensuring that the MLLMs can accurately identify and classify objects even when they are small or not centrally positioned [3].\n\n   ![](image5)\n   - **Conclusion**: Pre-processing includes cropping and blurring to focus on relevant objects in object detection tasks.\n\n3. **Retrieval Phase**:\n   - **Function**: Upon receiving an input image, the retriever retrieves the top-k class names most similar to the image. This is achieved by comparing the input image's embedding with the stored embeddings in the database.\n   - **Integration**: The retrieved category labels and image embeddings are then integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. This step ensures that the MLLMs have access to both the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, leading to more accurate and contextually aware classification predictions [4].\n\n   ![](image1)\n   - **Conclusion**: The retrieval phase identifies the top-k similar results from the memory bank.\n\n4. **Ranking by MLLMs**:\n   - **Function**: The MLLMs rank the retrieved candidate results based on their similarity to the input image. The ranking prompt guides the MLLMs to combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction.\n   - **Prompt Format**: The prompt format is designed to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory, guiding the MLLMs to rank the candidate object categories effectively [5].\n\n   ![](image4)\n   - **Conclusion**: The MLLMs rank the retrieved categories to provide the final prediction.\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline integrates a multimodal retriever, pre-processing for object detection, a retrieval phase, and ranking by MLLMs to enhance the performance of fine-grained and few-shot/zero-shot visual recognition tasks."}

The children of these selected nodes are then considered at the next layer, and the top-k nodes are selected again based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated until the leaf nodes are reached, and the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context [7]. This method allows for a controlled descent through the tree, starting with a broad overview and progressively focusing on finer details [9].\n\nOn the other hand, the collapsed tree retrieval method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones [2]. It flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison [3]. This approach offers greater flexibility, as it retrieves information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question, rather than maintaining a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details [1].\n\nTo visualize these differences, consider the diagram in the image below, which clearly illustrates the layered approach of tree traversal versus the flattened structure of collapsed tree retrieval `![{Tree Traversal vs. Collapsed Tree Retrieval}](image2)`.\n\nIn summary, tree traversal retrieval navigates the tree layer-by-layer, while collapsed tree retrieval considers all nodes simultaneously, providing more flexibility and context-specific retrieval."}

The average improvement in accuracy for the fine-tuned model was noticeable, indicating that fine-tuning enhances the model's ability to rank and classify images more effectively [6].\n\nTo illustrate this further, let's look at the performance metrics for the InternLM-XC2 model when fine-tuned versus in-context learning:\n\n- **DTD**: Fine-tuned (71.93) vs. In-context (71.99)\n- **Flowers102**: Fine-tuned (95.66) vs. In-context (95.57)\n- **Oxford-pets**: Fine-tuned (79.72) vs. In-context (79.42)\n- **Eurosat**: Fine-tuned (92.52) vs. In-context (92.59)\n\nThese results are consistent with the broader observation that fine-tuning provides a more robust and consistent improvement in performance [6]. The fine-tuned model consistently outperforms the in-context learning approach, especially on fine-grained datasets where the nuances in classification are more pronounced.\n\nAdditionally, the robustness of the fine-tuning approach is evident from the results across different datasets, showing that the performance gains are not limited to a single type of dataset but are generalizable [5]. This is further supported by the results on the V3Det dataset, where the fine-tuned model with RAR achieved a significant improvement in overall average precision (AP_all) compared to the CLIP baseline [10].\n\nIn conclusion, fine-tuning the InternLM-XC2 model with the RAR method generally outperforms in-context learning across various datasets, demonstrating a more consistent and significant improvement in classification accuracy. ![Fine-tuned model outperforms in-context learning on multiple datasets](image4)"}

This message guides the language model (ChatGPT) to produce content that aligns with the desired output [6].\n\n2. **Visual Annotation**: Next, visual annotations are provided to the model.

According to the text, Figure 4 shows the relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence for D Y GIE and D Y GIE without relation propagation on the ACE05 dataset [4]. This figure indicates that relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities, where broader context is expected to be beneficial.\n\n![{Relation propagation significantly improves relation extraction in sentences with more entities.}(image2)]\n\nThis observation is supported by the data in the image, which shows that as the number of entities in a sentence increases, the performance gap between D Y GIE with relation propagation and D Y GIE without relation propagation becomes more pronounced. Specifically, the relation scores for D Y GIE with relation propagation remain higher, especially in sentences with a larger number of entities.\n\nAdditionally, the text provides further insights into the mechanism of relation propagation. It describes how for each sentence, a beam \\( B_R \\) consisting of \\( b_r \\) entity spans that are most likely to be involved in a relation is defined. The weights of relation edges capture different relation types, and for the \\( t \\)-th iteration, a tensor \\( \\mathbf{V}_R^t \\) captures scores of each of the \\( L_R \\) relation types [7]. This tensor helps in computing relation scores and updating span representations, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex sentences with multiple entities and relations.\n\nThe implications of utilizing relation propagation are significant. It allows the model to leverage broader context, which is particularly useful in scenarios where sentences contain multiple relation instances across different entities. This is evident in both the ACE05 and SciERC datasets, where relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction [1]. The improved performance in sentences with more entities suggests that relation propagation can effectively handle the complexity and interdependencies in such sentences, leading to better overall relation extraction accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, relation propagation significantly improves relation extraction performance, especially in sentences with a higher number of entities, by leveraging broader context and capturing complex interdependencies."}

According to the text, when repetition control is introduced, it reduces the rate of question-asking. Specifically, the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram` discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, which often include common question phrases like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [3].\n\nThis reduction in question-asking is evident in the experimental setup where increasing the control variable \\( z \\) from 0 to 10 should ideally produce a range of question-asking rates from 1.40% to 97.72%. However, with repetition control, the \\( z = 10 \\) setting, which should produce 100% questions, only yields 79.67% questions [3]. To mitigate this issue, an additional setting \\( z = 10 (boost) \\) was introduced, where the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during weighted decoding but is applied post-beam search. This adjustment allows the model to produce a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with a slight increase in external bigram repetition [3].\n\nThe visual representation in the image further illustrates this point. The graph in `![{Question-asking rate decreases with repetition control}](image4)` shows the question-asking rates for different control levels. The line labeled \"Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl\" (repetition control) has a lower peak compared to \"Question-controlled CT\" (without repetition control), indicating that repetition control indeed reduces the frequency of question-asking.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of repetition control significantly reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text, but this can be mitigated by adjusting the model's settings to allow for necessary question-asking bigrams."}

This process is designed to gradually converge on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop. For example, IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide the retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained retrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that systematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the query, making it particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset [1].\n\n### Recursive Retrieval\nRecursive retrieval, on the other hand, involves a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner. This method can include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. A secondary retrieval within the document further refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process. Multi-hop retrieval, which is related, delves deeper into graph-structured data sources, extracting interconnected information [5].\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval\nAdaptive retrieval methods, such as Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25], enable large language models (LLMs) to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval. This approach enhances the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced by allowing the system to dynamically adjust its retrieval strategies based on different scenarios. For instance, Flare and Self-RAG can decide when and what to retrieve, making the process more flexible and contextually appropriate [2].\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe differences between these retrieval processes can be visually represented as follows:\n\n- **Iterative Retrieval**: Involves a series of steps where each step refines the previous one, gradually improving the search results.\n  ![{Iterative retrieval involves step-by-step refinement of search queries.}](image5)\n\n- **Recursive Retrieval**: Uses a hierarchical structure to break down and summarize information before performing more focused searches.\n  ![{Recursive retrieval involves hierarchical processing and summarization.}](image5)\n\n- **Adaptive Retrieval**: Allows for dynamic and context-aware adjustments in the retrieval process, optimizing the timing and content of retrievals.\n  ![{Adaptive retrieval enables flexible and context-aware adjustments.}](image5)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, iterative retrieval refines queries step by step, recursive retrieval breaks down complex problems hierarchically, and adaptive retrieval provides flexible and active control over the retrieval and generation processes. Each method has its strengths and is suited to different types of tasks and scenarios within a RAG system."}

This trend is consistent across other models as well, such as PCNN+ONE and PCNN+ATT, as shown in the PR curves [3].\n\nAdditionally, the accuracy of the discriminator on the negative dataset \\( N^D \\) provides another metric to evaluate the effectiveness of DSGAN.

This reduction is primarily due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages the reuse of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from producing common question-asking bigrams such as \"do you\" and \"what is,\" leading to a lower question-asking rate.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, an additional setting \\( z = 10 \\) (boost) is introduced, where the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during weighted decoding but is applied post-beam search for candidate reranking.

When evaluated on this adversarial dataset, BERT's performance drops dramatically. Specifically, BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set, after being trained on the adversarial training and validation sets, is only 53%, with a mean and median of 50% [5].

The performance of these methods was evaluated based on the number of nodes and the maximum token numbers [9].\n\nNow, looking at the image description for Figure 3, it shows a comparison between the tree traversal and collapsed tree methods. The horizontal axis represents the context length, which is the number of tokens or nodes considered during retrieval. This is consistent with the text that mentions evaluating nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones [3].\n\nThe vertical axis likely represents the performance metric, such as accuracy or F-1 score, which measures how well the retrieval methods perform.

This process is illustrated in the example where \"Super Mario Land\" is the parent entity, and the relation \"Publication Date\" leads to the entity \"1989\" [2].\n\nAdditionally, the annotation includes multiple plausible reasons for mentioning certain entities. For example, \"Game Boy\" is mentioned because it is the platform for \"Super Mario Land,\" and \"Nintendo\" is mentioned as the publisher [4]. This is further clarified in the image showing the relationship between \"Super Mario Land\" and \"Nintendo\" as the publisher, and \"Game Boy\" as the platform [![PUBLISHER (Nintendo)](image1)].\n\nThe annotation also highlights the importance of expanding entity mentions using string matching to capture all possible variations of entities and their attributes, such as dates and quantities [5].

In terms of breadth, MMMU covers a wide range of disciplines and subjects, including Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. It encompasses 30 subjects and 183 subfields, ensuring a diverse and extensive coverage of topics [2]. This is further illustrated in the distribution of disciplines and subjects, as shown in the image [Comprehensive Disciplines](image1).\n\nMoreover, MMMU includes a variety of image formats, such as diagrams, tables, plots, charts, photographs, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, sheet music, and more. This diversity in image types tests the perceptual capabilities of LMMs, ensuring they can handle a wide range of visual inputs [5]. The statistics provided in the image [Statistics Number](image2) highlight that 97.52% of the questions include images, emphasizing the importance of visual perception in the benchmark.\n\nIn terms of depth, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. Unlike other benchmarks that focus on basic perception and commonsense reasoning, MMMU demands that models apply complex reasoning to solve problems, often involving advanced concepts like Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory [5]. This is evident in the comparison with other benchmarks, where MMMU is positioned at the intersection of breadth and depth, as shown in the image [Depth (Reasoning)](image3).\n\nThe implications of these characteristics for evaluating LMMs are significant. MMMU provides a more rigorous and comprehensive assessment of a model's multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities. By covering a broad spectrum of subjects and requiring deep reasoning, MMMU can better identify the strengths and weaknesses of LMMs, particularly in handling complex, real-world problems. This makes MMMU a valuable tool for researchers and developers aiming to improve the performance of LMMs in practical applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark is uniquely positioned to evaluate the advanced multimodal perception and reasoning abilities of LMMs by combining extensive subject coverage with the need for expert-level reasoning [10]."}

This suggests that the reference translations play a crucial role in enhancing the model's performance.\n\nThe image quote `![{COMET-RANK significantly outperforms other metrics across multiple language pairs}](image1)` provides a comparative view of various metrics, including COMET-RANK, across different language pairs. Specifically, the table in image1 shows that COMET-RANK consistently outperforms other metrics like BLEU, CHRF, YISI-1, and BERTSCORE.\n\nFor a more detailed comparison, let's look at the specific language pairs and their performance improvements.

This indicates that while English has the highest number of articles, the other languages also have a substantial presence, though not as extensive as English.\n\nTo provide a visual representation of this distribution, consider the following table:\n\n| Language | Number of Articles |\n|----------|--------------------|\n| English  | 5,530              |\n| German   | 2,806              |\n| Spanish  | 2,762              |\n| Arabic   | 2,627              |\n| Chinese  | 2,673              |\n| Vietnamese | 2,682          |\n| Hindi    | 2,255              |\n\nThis table clearly illustrates the variation in the number of articles across different languages in the MLQA dataset. The number of articles in English is nearly double that of the next highest language, which is German. The other languages have a more balanced but lower number of articles, contributing to the overall diversity and breadth of the dataset. ![Number of articles varies across languages](image4) The number of articles varies significantly across languages in the MLQA dataset."}

This approach ensures that the model can effectively capture the nuances in the dialogue context and the specific requirements of each slot.\n\nTo further enhance the matching, the model employs a slot gate to handle special types of values.

These mechanisms include:\n\n- **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This pathway is primarily used to correct single-strand point mutations affecting one or a few bases. It involves the recognition and removal of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, followed by the repair of the abasic site by an endonuclease and the addition of the correct nucleotides by a DNA polymerase, and finally, the sealing of the nick by a DNA ligase [5].\n\n- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This is a versatile repair system capable of removing a wide range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. NER involves the recognition of the damaged region, excision of the lesion, and resynthesis of the correct DNA sequence [4].\n\n- **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly reverses specific types of DNA damage without the need for incision or resynthesis. For example, DNA photolyase enzymes can repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimers through a light-dependent process, although placental mammals typically rely on NER for this purpose [9].\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system corrects mismatches or unpaired bases that occur during DNA replication. It involves the recognition of the mismatched bases, removal of the incorrect segment, and the insertion of the correct nucleotides by a DNA polymerase, followed by the sealing of the nick by a DNA ligase [6].\n\n- **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism is particularly important for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are highly damaging and can lead to chromosomal instability. Recombination repair includes homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR uses an undamaged homologous DNA sequence as a template for repair, ensuring accuracy, while NHEJ directly ligates the broken ends together, which can sometimes result in the loss of genetic information [10].\n\nThese repair mechanisms collectively ensure that the genetic material remains stable and functional, even in the face of frequent mutations and environmental stressors. ![Figure 11 illustrates the various DNA repair mechanisms, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, and recombination repair.](image3)"}

According to the data presented, post-processing ensures that the LI is reduced to 0%, which is a clear improvement in terms of logical consistency [9].\n\nHowever, while post-processing effectively eliminates logical inconsistencies, it comes with a trade-off in terms of overall performance. For instance, on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, the micro-F1 score drops from 22.3% to 14.0% for the model with retrieved logical constraints when post-processing is applied. Similarly, on the Causal-TimeBank dataset, the micro-F1 score decreases from 22.0% to 15.0% [image1].

Specifically, the C OMET-RANK model achieves the highest Kendall’s Tau scores for most language pairs, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Language Pair | BLEU | CHRF | YISI-1 | BERTSCORE (default) | BERTSCORE (xlmr-base) | BLEURT (base-128) | BLEURT (large-512) | COMET-HTER | COMET-MQM | COMET-RANK |\n|---------------|------|------|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| de-en         | 0.222| 0.341| 0.376  | 0.358               | 0.386                 | 0.372             | 0.374              | 0.358       | 0.386      | 0.389       |\n| fi-en         | 0.236| 0.292| 0.347  | 0.354               | 0.335                 | 0.372             | 0.374              | 0.333       | 0.343      | 0.399       |\n| gu-en         | 0.194| 0.240| 0.312  | 0.292               | 0.295                 | 0.302             | 0.313              | 0.274       | 0.282      | 0.341       |\n| kk-en         | 0.276| 0.323| 0.440  | 0.351               | 0.354                 | 0.383             | 0.372              | 0.297       | 0.339      | 0.358       |\n| it-en         | 0.249| 0.304| 0.376  | 0.381               | 0.356                 | 0.387             | 0.388              | 0.364       | 0.368      | 0.407       |\n| ru-en         | 0.177| 0.115| 0.217  | 0.221               | 0.202                 | 0.218             | 0.220              | 0.163       | 0.187      | 0.180       |\n| zh-en         | 0.321| 0.371| 0.426  | 0.432               | 0.412                 | 0.417             | 0.436              | 0.391       | 0.422      | 0.445       |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that the C OMET-RANK consistently achieves the highest or near-highest scores across the language pairs.\n\nNext, let's consider the performance of metrics for language pairs where English is the source language. Table 1 [8] shows that the C OMET models, particularly the C OMET-RANK, again outperform other metrics across the board. The C OMET-RANK model achieves the highest Kendall’s Tau scores for most language pairs, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Language Pair | BLEU | CHRF | YISI-1 | BERTSCORE (default) | BERTSCORE (xlmr-base) | COMET-HTER | COMET-MQM | COMET-RANK |\n|---------------|------|------|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| en-cs         | 0.364| 0.444| 0.475  | 0.500               | 0.503                 | 0.524       | 0.537      | 0.603       |\n| en-de         | 0.248| 0.321| 0.351  | 0.363               | 0.369                 | 0.383       | 0.398      | 0.427       |\n| en-fi         | 0.395| 0.518| 0.537  | 0.527               | 0.553                 | 0.560       | 0.567      | 0.664       |\n| en-gu         | 0.463| 0.548| 0.551  | 0.568               | 0.584                 | 0.552       | 0.564      | 0.611       |\n| en-kk         | 0.363| 0.510| 0.546  | 0.540               | 0.536                 | 0.508       | 0.534      | 0.693       |\n| en-it         | 0.333| 0.438| 0.470  | 0.464               | 0.514                 | 0.577       | 0.574      | 0.665       |\n| en-ru         | 0.469| 0.548| 0.585  | 0.585               | 0.599                 | 0.539       | 0.615      | 0.580       |\n| en-zh         | 0.235| 0.241| 0.355  | 0.356               | 0.317                 | 0.380       | 0.378      | 0.449       |\n\nAgain, the C OMET-RANK model consistently achieves the highest scores across these language pairs.\n\nAdditionally, the figures provide visual confirmation of the superior performance of the C OMET models, particularly the C OMET-RANK model, across different language pairs. For instance, Figure 3 [image5] shows that the C OMET-RANK model consistently achieves the highest Kendall’s Tau scores for all language pairs where English is the source.\n\nIn conclusion, the C OMET-RANK model consistently performs the best across the language pairs for translation quality evaluation. ![C OMET-RANK outperforms other metrics across multiple language pairs](image5)"}

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement [2]. For example, if the problem is about a circuit and a light bulb, the LLM would convert the natural language statements into symbolic logic like `Complete(Circuit, True)` and `Has(Circuit, LightBulb)` ![{Example of symbolic formulation for a circuit problem}](image4).\n\nIn the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic representation. This solver uses logical algorithms to derive the answer. For instance, if the symbolic solver is given the rules and facts about the circuit, it will determine whether the light bulb is glowing based on the completeness of the circuit and the presence of the light bulb [1].\n\nFinally, in the **Result Interpretation** stage, a result interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into natural language. This ensures that the final output is understandable and correctly aligned with the original problem. For example, the symbolic solver might output `Glowing(LightBulb, True)`, which the result interpreter would translate to \"The light bulb is glowing\" [2].\n\nBy integrating these stages, LOGIC-LM leverages the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic solvers to achieve faithful and accurate logical reasoning. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated by its significant performance improvements over pure LLMs and chain-of-thought prompting techniques [6]. \n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM solves a problem by translating it into a symbolic form, performing logical inference, and then interpreting the result back into natural language."}

This improvement is particularly notable in the context of causal reasoning tasks, which are generally very challenging for all models [2, 6].\n\nMoreover, the CAUSALCoT approach demonstrates its effectiveness by enhancing the model's reasoning ability across different levels of commonsense alignment.

According to the data, BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA on both datasets, but the extent of this outperformance varies.\n\nOn the WIKIHOP dataset, BiDAF achieves an accuracy of 54.5% in the test setting and 59.8% in the masked setting, while FastQA achieves 35.8% and 38.0%, respectively [4]. This indicates that BiDAF is significantly better at handling the complexities of the WIKIHOP dataset, especially when the answers are masked, which requires the model to rely more on context and less on specific candidate spans.\n\nFor the MEDHOP dataset, BiDAF also outperforms FastQA, achieving accuracies of 33.7% in the test setting and 42.9% in the masked setting, compared to FastQA's 31.3% and 30.6% [4]. However, the gap in performance is smaller on MEDHOP, suggesting that while BiDAF is still superior, the challenges posed by MEDHOP are more evenly matched between the two models.\n\nThese differences can be attributed to the architectural design of BiDAF, which includes iterative latent interactions that are particularly useful for integrating information across multiple documents [3]. FastQA, on the other hand, lacks these iterative interactions, making it less effective at handling the multi-step inference required in these datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of both models improves significantly when they are provided with only the relevant documents, as seen in the \"gold chain\" setup. BiDAF's performance jumps to 81.2% and 85.7% in the masked gold chain settings for WIKIHOP, and to 99.3% and 100.0% for MEDHOP [7]. This underscores the importance of document selection in improving model performance.\n\nIn summary, BiDAF outperforms FastQA on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets, with a more pronounced difference on WIKIHOP, likely due to its ability to better integrate information across multiple documents. ![BiDAF and FastQA performance on WIKIHOP and MEDHOP](image2)"}

This is where character-level embeddings come into play.\n\nCharacter-level embeddings allow the model to capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which can be particularly useful for handling rare words, named entities, and other linguistic phenomena that are not well-represented in word-level embeddings [1]. By combining these two types of embeddings, the model can better handle a wider range of linguistic structures and improve overall performance, especially in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) [5].\n\nAdditionally, the use of character-level embeddings helps in maintaining the frequency information conveyed by vector length, which is an important signal for NER, as named entities often appear less frequently in the monolingual corpus [3].

Specifically, as described in the text, the pre-processing involves cropping and blurring techniques [4]. \n\nCropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates helps to isolate the objects of interest, ensuring that the model focuses on the specific areas that are relevant for recognition. This is particularly important in object detection datasets where objects can vary significantly in size and position within the image. By resizing the cropped regions to a fixed proportion, the model can consistently process these regions regardless of their original size.\n\nAdditionally, the blurring technique applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest further directs the model's attention to the relevant parts of the image. This strategy helps to reduce distractions and noise, making it easier for the model to identify and classify the objects accurately.\n\nThis pre-processing step is illustrated in the provided diagram, where the image is pre-processed to highlight the objects of interest and blur the background.

The timeline of events and the introduction of various methodologies and datasets have been pivotal.\n\nIn 2010, Turney and Pantel introduced vector space models of semantics, which laid the groundwork for using distributional models to understand word meanings over time [3]. This foundational work was crucial for the subsequent advancements in the field.\n\nBy 2014, Kim et al. published a seminal paper that marked a turning point by employing prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts [7]. They used the Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) model, which became a standard approach in the field. This method allowed for more accurate and nuanced tracking of semantic changes over time.\n\nIn 2015, Kulkarni et al. expanded the scope of diachronic research by using diverse datasets such as the Google Books Ngrams corpus, Amazon Movie Reviews, and Twitter data [10]. Their work demonstrated the robustness of computational methods in detecting semantic shifts even within shorter time spans, such as months and years.\n\nHamilton et al. (2016a) further advanced the field by showing the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models in semantic shifts analysis [7]. They also highlighted the effectiveness of low-rank SVD approximations, especially on smaller datasets.\n\nDubossarsky et al. (2015) introduced the concept of the \"law of prototypicality,\" which posits that the likelihood of semantic shift correlates with the degree of prototypicality of a word [8]. This finding added a new dimension to understanding the mechanisms behind semantic change.\n\nZhang et al. (2015) utilized the New York Times Annotated Corpus to trace subtle semantic shifts, providing valuable insights into the evolution of word meanings in a specific context [10].\n\nSzymanski (2017) built upon this work by using 21 separate models, one for each year from 1987 to 2007, to identify lexical replacements and semantic changes [10].\n\nThese milestones collectively represent significant advancements in the computational detection of semantic shifts, from the introduction of prediction-based models to the application of diverse datasets and the identification of underlying principles governing semantic change.\n\n![{Key milestones in diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of prediction-based models, the use of diverse datasets, and the identification of the law of prototypicality.}](image1)\n\nIn summary, the key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 include the introduction of prediction-based word embedding models, the use of diverse datasets, and the identification of the law of prototypicality."}

This is evident from the drop in average metrics from 80.0 to 68.1 when the abstract is removed [4]. The abstract is a crucial part of scientific papers, providing a concise summary of the content, which is essential for the model to capture the essence of the document.\n\nAdding venues to the input slightly decreases performance, except on the document classification task. This is likely because venues can provide context that is useful for classification but may introduce noise in other tasks [4]. The slight decrease in performance suggests that while venues offer some value, they are not as critical as the abstract.\n\nInterestingly, adding authors as an input field actually hurts performance. This is surprising, as one might expect author information to be beneficial. However, the model struggles with author names, possibly due to their sparsity and the suboptimal tokenization of names using WordPieces, which can lead to noisy correlations [4].\n\nThe importance of hard negative distractors is also highlighted. Using only easy negatives reduces performance across all tasks, indicating that hard negatives are crucial for the model to learn more robust and discriminative representations [2]. This is further supported by the results in the ablation study, where removing hard negatives leads to a significant drop in performance [4].\n\nFinally, the choice of the language model is critical. Using BERT-Large instead of SciBERT reduces performance considerably. This is because SciBERT is pretrained on scientific text, making it more suitable for the domain-specific tasks [2].\n\nIn summary, the inclusion or exclusion of specific features such as the abstract, venues, and authors, as well as the use of hard negatives and the choice of the language model, significantly impacts the performance of the SPECTER model across different tasks. The abstract and hard negatives are particularly crucial for maintaining high performance, while adding venues and authors can introduce noise and reduce performance. ![Removing the abstract significantly decreases performance, while adding venues and authors introduces noise.](image4)"}

When evaluated on the original dataset, BERT's peak performance reaches 77%, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this high performance is largely attributed to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset [1].\n\nTo break down the contributions of different components, Table 3 shows that BERT's performance on warrants alone (W) reaches 71% [2]. Adding cues from reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) accounts for the remaining 6 percentage points, bringing the total to 77% [6]. This indicates that the model is heavily relying on these cues rather than true argument comprehension [6].\n\nWhen the model is evaluated on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these spurious cues, BERT's performance drops dramatically. As shown in the table from `![{BERT's performance drops to around 50% on the adversarial dataset}](image4)`, BERT's peak performance on the adversarial test set is only 53%, with a median of 50% [7]. This significant drop confirms that the original high performance was not due to genuine understanding but rather the exploitation of dataset-specific patterns [7].\n\nIn summary, BERT's test performance is highly dependent on the presence of spurious statistical cues, and when these cues are removed, the model's performance aligns with random guessing."}

The text evaluation metrics also show slight improvements, with the most notable being the increase in relevance from 4.70 to 4.81.\n\nThese findings suggest that specific questions, which provide clearer instructions and target knowledge more explicitly, lead to better performance in terms of alignment, precision, recall, and text quality. This is not surprising, as specific questions help the models focus on the relevant knowledge, leading to more accurate and well-aligned citations and text.\n\nIn contrast, general questions, which are more loosely bound to the minimum knowledge set, result in lower performance metrics. This indicates that general questions are more challenging for the models to handle, as they require a broader understanding and may lead to less precise and less aligned citations and text.\n\nOverall, these results imply that for tasks requiring high precision and alignment, such as academic writing or technical documentation, specific questions are more effective. General questions, while useful for broader explorations, may need additional context or refinement to achieve the same level of performance. ![Performance metrics for GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific settings show better performance on specific questions](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, GPT-4 and ChatGPT perform better on specific questions, which provide clearer instructions and target knowledge more explicitly, leading to higher alignment, precision, recall, and text quality."}

Other benchmarks, such as ScienceQA, which has 6,000 questions and 5 image types, and MMBench, which has 3,000 questions and unspecified image types, do not offer the same breadth of image formats [2][10].\n\nLastly, the reasoning depth required by MMMU is significantly more advanced. Unlike other benchmarks that typically require commonsense knowledge or simple reasoning, MMMU tasks demand expert-level reasoning with subject-specific knowledge. This includes applying complex theories and concepts, such as Fourier Transform and Equilibrium Theory, to derive solutions. This level of depth is not commonly found in other benchmarks, which often focus on more straightforward reasoning tasks [4].\n\nTo illustrate the breadth and depth of MMMU, consider the following visual representation of the benchmark's coverage and the comparison with other datasets:\n![{MMMU covers a wide range of college-level knowledge and includes diverse image formats, requiring advanced reasoning.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark is more comprehensive and challenging than other benchmarks due to its larger dataset size, diverse image types, and the need for advanced reasoning with subject-specific knowledge."}

The Ultra-Fine category is particularly challenging, and the performance metrics (precision, recall, and F1) are significantly lower compared to the General and Fine categories [9].\n\nWhen all data sources are used (crowdsourced, head words, and entity linking), the model achieves a recall of 31.3% and an F1 score of 39.4% on the Ultra-Fine category [4]. However, when we exclude specific data sources, the performance changes:\n\n- **Excluding Crowdsourced Data**: When only head words and entity linking are used, the recall drops to 23.2%, and the F1 score decreases to 24.2% [4]. This indicates that crowdsourced data is crucial for improving recall and F1 scores in the Ultra-Fine category.\n\n- **Excluding Head Words**: When only crowdsourced data and entity linking are used, the recall drops to 23.2%, and the F1 score decreases to 31.7% [4]. This suggests that head words play a significant role in enhancing the model's performance, especially in predicting ultra-fine labels.\n\n- **Excluding Entity Linking**: When only crowdsourced data and head words are used, the recall remains at 23.2%, but the F1 score drops to 16.0% [4]. This indicates that entity linking is important for maintaining a higher F1 score, particularly in the Ultra-Fine category.\n\nThese findings are further supported by the detailed breakdown in the table, which shows the impact of each data source on the model's performance [10]. The combination of all three data sources (crowdsourced, head words, and entity linking) provides the best performance, highlighting the importance of diverse and comprehensive supervision for fine-grained entity typing tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, excluding any of the data sources—crowdsourced data, head words, or entity linking—significantly reduces the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, with the most notable drop in F1 score when entity linking is excluded. ![Excluding any data source reduces performance on the Ultra-Fine category](image1)"}

It uses three times as many concurrent GPUs (3072 compared to 1024) and approximately five times more GPU hours (4,282,407 compared to 856,481) than the 7B model.

These areas include building a talent pipeline, engaging talent through LinkedIn presence and InMail, posting jobs, and maximizing LinkedIn efficiency through various tools for search, certification, and collaboration [1]. \n\nUnderstanding how to effectively search the network is crucial, as it involves constructing accurate Boolean search strings [7]. This skill is fundamental for all talent acquisition professionals, even with next-gen Recruiter features that allow for efficient searching without explicit Boolean knowledge. The ability to create precise search queries ensures that recruiters can efficiently find the right candidates for their roles.\n\nAdditionally, the exam covers the importance of the Talent Pipeline feature, which helps in sourcing talent already in your pipeline when a previously closed role reopens [5]. This feature is essential for maintaining a steady flow of qualified candidates and reducing time-to-hire.\n\nThe exam also emphasizes the importance of posting jobs and ensuring they are displayed effectively to potential candidates [9]. This includes understanding how to use tags, sources, similar profiles, resume uploads, and saved searches to enhance the visibility and attractiveness of job postings [10].\n\nUnderstanding Boolean search results through a Venn diagram is directly related to these topic areas because it helps recruiters visualize and refine their search strategies. For example, a Venn diagram can illustrate how different search terms intersect to produce specific results, ensuring that recruiters can target the most relevant candidates [8].\n\nIn summary, candidates should focus on building a talent pipeline, engaging talent, posting jobs, and maximizing LinkedIn efficiency, with a strong emphasis on Boolean search techniques to enhance their search effectiveness.\n\n![{Building a talent pipeline and engaging talent through LinkedIn presence and InMail are key areas of focus for the certification exam.}](image1)"}

These substances include lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE).\n\nThe image5 provides a list of restricted substances and their chemical symbols, which aligns with the RoHS directive:\n- Lead (Pb)\n- Mercury (Hg)\n- Cadmium (Cd)\n- Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI))\n- Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB)\n- Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)\n\nGiven that the GB/T 26572 standard is a Chinese standard for the restriction of hazardous substances in electronic products, it is likely to have similar restrictions to the RoHS directive. Therefore, if any of these substances exceed the limit requirements, they would be the same as those listed in the RoHS directive.\n\nHowever, without specific test results or a detailed analysis of the hard disk, it is impossible to definitively state which chemical element exceeds the limit requirements. Typically, the most common issues are with lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) due to their widespread use in older electronics.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely candidate for exceeding the limit requirements in the hard disk is **lead (Pb)**, as it is one of the most commonly restricted substances and often found in higher concentrations in older electronic components.\n\nTherefore, the chemical element in the hard disk that exceeds the limit requirements stipulated in the GB/T 26572 standard is **lead (Pb)**. ![Lead (Pb) is a restricted substance in the RoHS directive](image5)"}

For instance, the implementation of EMRs and CPOE has been a focus in recent years, with significant progress noted [image2]. The data shows that these systems are being increasingly adopted, enhancing the quality of care and operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the integration and interoperability of these systems are crucial for improving patient outcomes. The image highlights the importance of enterprise-wide clinical information sharing and point-of-care decision support [image2]. These advancements ensure that healthcare providers have access to comprehensive and up-to-date patient information, which is essential for making informed decisions.\n\nMoreover, the adoption of new technology and the integration of ambulatory systems are also key trends. These systems allow for better patient management and communication between different healthcare settings [image2]. This integration is particularly important for reducing medical errors, which currently account for more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motorcycle accidents [10].\n\nDespite these advancements, several barriers to adoption remain. Lack of financial support, staffing resources, and clinical leadership are among the primary challenges [image5]. Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for the successful implementation and widespread adoption of these technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, the functions related to patient information and clinical orders are expected to become more integrated and efficient, driven by the adoption of EMRs, CPOE, and other advanced technologies. ![Improving Quality of Care and Reducing Medical Errors](image2)"}

This involves high-level requirements gathering and modeling sessions to quickly capture the essential needs and goals of the stakeholders [3]. The level of detail in these requirements can vary, but the focus is on creating a clear and concise understanding of what the project aims to achieve.\n\n![{Exploration of initial scope includes various modeling strategies and levels of detail}](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the DA framework emphasizes the importance of **active stakeholder participation**. Stakeholders should be involved in the initial scope exploration to ensure that their needs and expectations are accurately captured. This can be achieved through informal modeling sessions, interviews, and other collaborative techniques [5].\n\nThe framework also supports different **modeling strategies** depending on the project's complexity and the stakeholders' preferences. These strategies include usage modeling, domain modeling, process modeling, and user interface modeling. Each type of modeling helps in understanding different aspects of the project, such as how users will interact with the system, the underlying business processes, and the technical requirements [3].\n\nFurthermore, the DA framework advocates for **just-in-time (JIT) model storming** and **look-ahead modeling**. JIT model storming involves creating models just when they are needed, ensuring that the team focuses on the most relevant and immediate requirements. Look-ahead modeling, on the other hand, helps in planning future iterations by identifying potential challenges and risks early in the project [1].\n\nIn summary, the Disciplined Agile framework outlines a comprehensive set of strategies and considerations for exploring the initial scope of a project, including requirements envisioning, active stakeholder participation, and various modeling techniques.

The ECU plays a crucial role in controlling the injectors, which spray fuel towards the engine intake valves [3] and [4]. In a multi-point injection system, there is an injector in the port going to each cylinder [5].\n\nThe ECU determines the quantity of fuel to inject based on various parameters such as throttle position, air intake, and engine temperature [8]. It uses input from sensors to regulate the opening and closing of the injector valves [9].\n\nLooking at the diagrams, we can see multiple connection lines representing the direction of information flow and control [image1] and [image4]. These lines connect the ECU to different components, including the injectors and the pressure regulator.\n\nGiven that the ECU controls the injectors and the pressure regulator, and considering the complexity of the system, it is reasonable to conclude that the ECU has multiple outputs.

Stakeholders can engage directly, through proxies, or via electronic means, ensuring that their needs and feedback are integrated into the requirements [image1]. This participation helps in eliciting accurate and comprehensive requirements, especially in complex or distributed environments [9].\n\nAnother key component is the use of just-in-time (JIT) model storming and look-ahead modeling. These practices help in quickly and effectively visualizing and refining requirements as the project progresses [image4]. JIT model storming allows the team to collaboratively create models when needed, ensuring that the models are relevant and up-to-date.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Needs Exploration' phase often includes the creation of a requirements backlog, where work items are prioritized based on business value, risk, and dependencies. This ensures that the most critical and valuable features are addressed first [image1].\n\nFinally, the use of acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) is another important practice. ATDD involves writing acceptance tests before the development begins, which helps in defining the criteria for what constitutes a successfully implemented feature [image4].\n\nIn summary, the key components of the 'Needs Exploration' phase include active stakeholder participation, just-in-time model storming, look-ahead modeling, a prioritized requirements backlog, and acceptance test-driven development.

In animal cells, this is achieved through the formation of a cleavage furrow, which is a constricting ring of actin filaments that pinches the cell in two [image5].

This sensor is crucial for monitoring the engine RPM and plays a primary role in engine timing functions, including fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing [1]. \n\nNext, the **Oxygen Sensor (O2 Sensor)** is another vital component. It measures the oxygen content in the engine exhaust, and its voltage output changes with the oxygen content [7][9]. This sensor helps the ECU adjust the air-fuel mixture for optimal combustion.\n\nThe **Engine Temperature Sensor** is also connected to the ECU [10]. This sensor provides information about the engine's temperature, which is essential for the ECU to make adjustments during cold starts and normal operation.\n\nAdditionally, the **Fuel Pressure Sensor** is typically part of the fuel system and provides data on the pressure within the fuel lines. This information is crucial for ensuring proper fuel delivery [3].\n\nThe **Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF)** measures the amount of air entering the engine. This data helps the ECU calculate the appropriate amount of fuel to inject for efficient combustion.\n\nThe **Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)** monitors the position of the throttle valve, which indicates how much air is entering the engine. This sensor helps the ECU manage the air-fuel ratio and engine load.\n\nFinally, the **Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor** measures the pressure inside the intake manifold. This data is used by the ECU to determine the engine load and adjust the fuel injection accordingly.\n\nThese seven sensors—Crankshaft Position Sensor, Oxygen Sensor, Engine Temperature Sensor, Fuel Pressure Sensor, Mass Airflow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, and Manifold Absolute Pressure Sensor—are all connected to the ECU to provide the necessary data for optimal engine performance.\n\n![{Sensors are represented as component blocks in the diagram}](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, the seven sensors connected to the ECU are the Crankshaft Position Sensor, Oxygen Sensor, Engine Temperature Sensor, Fuel Pressure Sensor, Mass Airflow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, and Manifold Absolute Pressure Sensor."}

This transformation occurs through several stages, each building upon the previous one to ensure that data is effectively utilized to drive decision-making and impact.\n\nFirst, data is collected from various sources, ensuring that it is accurate and relevant [2]. This initial step is crucial because the quality of the data directly affects the quality of the insights derived from it. Once the data is collected, it undergoes analysis, where patterns and trends are identified [5]. This stage involves using statistical methods and data visualization techniques to uncover meaningful information from the data.\n\nNext, the insights gained from the analysis are used to inform decisions [2]. These decisions are not made in isolation but are supported by data, ensuring that they are fact-based and objective. The decision-making process is further enhanced by a strong data leadership team that actively promotes the use of data as a strategic asset [4]. This leadership ensures that the analytics organization has the necessary resources and support to function effectively [9].\n\nFinally, the decisions lead to actions that have a tangible impact on the business [2]. This impact can be measured and evaluated, allowing the organization to continuously improve its data-driven processes. The entire chain is designed to be a continuous cycle, where the outcomes of actions feed back into the data collection process, refining and enhancing the data used in future cycles.\n\nTo illustrate this process, consider the following image, which shows how data moves through the stages of the Analytics Value Chain, from raw data to actionable insights:\n\n![Data moves through the stages of the Analytics Value Chain, from raw data to actionable insights](image4)\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain transforms data into value by systematically moving it through stages of collection, analysis, decision-making, and action, ensuring that each step adds depth and context to the data, ultimately leading to impactful business outcomes."}

When Mendel conducted his experiments with pea plants, he noticed that certain traits, such as flower color, followed specific patterns of inheritance. In his monohybrid cross experiment, he crossed true-breeding purple-flowered plants with true-breeding white-flowered plants [5].\n\nThe F1 generation, which resulted from this cross, all had purple flowers, indicating that the purple flower trait is dominant over the white flower trait [5]. This dominance is represented by the genotype where the dominant allele (P) masks the presence of the recessive allele (p). The F1 plants, therefore, have the genotype Pp, making them heterozygous for the flower color trait.\n\nWhen the F1 plants (Pp) were allowed to self-pollinate, the resulting F2 generation exhibited a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant [5]. This ratio can be explained by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation. Each F1 plant produces two types of gametes: one with the dominant allele (P) and one with the recessive allele (p). When these gametes combine randomly, the possible genotypes of the F2 generation are PP, Pp, and pp [4].\n\nThe genotypic ratio of the F2 generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp [4]. Since the purple flower color is dominant, the plants with the genotypes PP and Pp will both have purple flowers, while only the plants with the genotype pp will have white flowers. This results in the observed phenotypic ratio of 3 purple : 1 white [4].\n\nThis pattern of inheritance, where a dominant trait masks a recessive trait in the F1 generation but reappears in the F2 generation, is a fundamental principle of Mendelian genetics [5]. ![{Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in Mendel's monohybrid cross}](image4)\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment."}

The resulting offspring show a 3:1 phenotypic ratio, with three-quarters of the plants having purple flowers and one-quarter having white flowers. The genotypic ratio, on the other hand, is 1:2:1, reflecting the distribution of homozygous dominant (PP), heterozygous (Pp), and homozygous recessive (pp) genotypes.\n\n![{Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross}](image4)\n\nThe phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of the plant cross are 3:1 and 1:2:1, respectively [10]."}

The new Defamation Act, enacted in 2022, has replaced the older Libel and Defamation Act, which was part of the revised laws of Belize in 2020. This new act introduces several important provisions that affect how blasphemy and defamation are handled.\n\nOne key change is the introduction of qualified privilege for the publication of reports and other matters listed in the First Schedule of the Defamation Act. This means that certain publications, such as news reports, are protected from defamation claims unless it can be proven that they were made with malice. However, this protection does not extend to the publication of blasphemous or obscene matter, as explicitly stated in the act. This provision is designed to balance the need for free speech and the protection of religious sentiments.\n\nAdditionally, the new act includes specific conditions under which the defense of qualified privilege can be invoked. For instance, if a plaintiff requests the defendant to publish a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation or contradiction, and the defendant refuses or neglects to do so, the defense of qualified privilege may not be available. This ensures that there is a mechanism for addressing grievances without resorting to litigation.\n\nDespite these legal provisions, blasphemy laws in Belize remain on the books but are rarely enforced. This suggests a practical approach where the legal framework exists but is not actively used to prosecute individuals for blasphemy. The focus seems to be more on ensuring that defamation claims are handled fairly and that the media can operate with some degree of freedom.\n\nTo summarize, while the legal landscape in Belize still includes provisions against blasphemy, the new Defamation Act of 2022 has introduced more balanced and modern approaches to handling defamation, emphasizing the importance of qualified privilege and the protection of free speech, while maintaining the prohibition on blasphemous and obscene matter. ![Rarely enforced](image2)"}

This stage involves envisioning the business roadmap and technology options, ensuring that the project has initial viability and funding [image1].\n\nNext, the **Inception** stage focuses on defining the scope and direction of the project [5]. During this phase, stakeholders collaboratively build a vision and ensure that the project is aligned with the overall business and technology roadmaps [image2]. This stage is crucial for setting the foundation for the project's success.\n\nThe **Construction** stage is where the bulk of the development work occurs [5]. This stage is characterized by continuous streams of development, where work items are pulled into production as capacity allows [image1]. The team works iteratively, producing potentially consumable solutions in each iteration, and continuously learns from their experiences [image3].\n\nFollowing the Construction stage, the **Transition** stage ensures that the solution is smoothly delivered into production [3]. This stage involves releasing the solution, operating and supporting it in production, and ensuring that stakeholders are delighted with the outcome [image1].\n\nFinally, the **Production** stage focuses on ongoing support and maintenance of the solution [3].

This is often done through lightweight and informal methods to quickly gather high-level requirements.\n\nFor instance, in the 'shu' stage of disciplined agile development, the focus is on building a strong foundation, which includes understanding the initial scope and goals [1]. This aligns with the concept of 'Needs Exploration,' where the team engages in activities like requirements envisioning to create a light specification of the project's direction and objectives.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Elicitation Methods' involve more detailed and structured techniques to gather specific requirements from stakeholders. These methods can vary in formality and detail, ranging from informal modeling sessions to formal change management processes. For example, the image shows various elicitation methods such as informal modeling sessions, formal modeling sessions, and interviews, which help in gathering detailed requirements and acceptance criteria ![{Elicitation methods include informal and formal modeling sessions, interviews, and more}](image4).\n\nBoth strategies are essential and complement each other.

This siloed approach can result in a lack of cohesive strategy and inconsistent customer interactions, making it difficult to implement a unified customer management system `![{Siloed approaches and misaligned goals prevent a unified customer experience}](image1)`.\n\nAnother critical barrier is the cultural and managerial resistance to change. According to the provided quotes, adoption barriers often stem from management and cultural issues rather than data and technology [2]. This suggests that even with the necessary technological tools, organizational inertia and resistance to new practices can hinder the implementation of an integrated approach.\n\nAdditionally, the complexity of measuring customer engagement and behavior is a significant challenge. Traditional metrics often focus on reach and frequency, which fail to capture the true engagement and sentiment of customers [8]. This can lead to a lack of actionable insights and a failure to understand the full customer journey, including the influence of external factors such as social media and peer recommendations [9].\n\nMoreover, the abundance of data can sometimes overwhelm organizations, making it difficult to extract meaningful and actionable insights [6]. Without a clear focus on what data to collect and how to use it effectively, companies may struggle to turn data into valuable information and intelligence [2].\n\nFinally, the lack of resources, both in terms of skilled personnel and technical infrastructure, can also impede the adoption of an integrated customer management approach. Organizations may not have the necessary skills, roles, and responsibilities in place to support such a comprehensive strategy [2], and the absence of a robust technical infrastructure can further complicate efforts to integrate customer data and insights `![{Lack of resources and technical infrastructure hinders adoption}](image1)`.\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include siloed organizational structures, cultural and managerial resistance, the complexity of measuring customer engagement, data overload, and a lack of necessary resources and infrastructure."}

This broad scope suggests a significant presence in various regions and countries to cater to diverse client needs. The Consulting team focuses on providing strategic and operational advice, helping clients optimize and transform their business models [6].\n\nIn terms of employee numbers and office presence, the Consulting department likely has a substantial workforce and multiple offices to support its extensive client base. For instance, the Consulting team works closely with clients across the GCC and beyond, indicating a strong regional and international presence [4]. Additionally, the FftF programme, which is part of the Consulting department, offers a 20-month rotational programme, suggesting a robust and growing team [5].\n\nNow, let's look at the Assurance department. While specific details about the Assurance department are not provided in the text quotes, we can infer some information from the image quotes. The image showing \"Employees - 1914 ©\" and another showing \"Employees - 1914 ©\" [image1][image5] suggest a long-standing history and potentially a significant number of employees. However, these images do not provide current figures or specific details about the Assurance department's office presence or countries covered.\n\nAnother image shows \"Countries 9\" [image2], which could indicate the number of countries where the Assurance department operates. This is fewer than the global reach implied for the Consulting department, which works across multiple regions and industries.\n\nLastly, an image showing \"Offices\" and \"Employees 500\" [image4] provides more concrete data. This suggests that the Assurance department has a notable presence with 500 employees and multiple offices. However, this is still less extensive compared to the broader reach and larger client base of the Consulting department.\n\nIn conclusion, the Consulting department appears to have a larger and more diverse presence in terms of office locations, employee numbers, and countries covered, while the Assurance department has a significant but more focused presence with around 500 employees and operations in 9 countries. ![Countries 9](image2) ![Offices Employees 500](image4)"}

The prisms are distributed across different distances from the river, ranging from 0 to 1500 miles. This visual arrangement helps to illustrate the concentration of cases in relation to the proximity to the river, making it easier to perceive patterns and trends in the data.\n\nThe Gestalt principle of **proximity** [10] is particularly relevant here. It suggests that objects that are visually close together are perceived as belonging to part of a group. In this case, the prisms that are closer to each other and to the river are likely to be perceived as a group, indicating a higher concentration of cases in those areas.\n\nAdditionally, the **continuity** principle [9] can be observed, as the prisms are aligned in a way that creates a continuous visual flow, helping the viewer to see the overall trend in the data.\n\nIn conclusion, the height of the prisms directly correlates with the number of confirmed West Nile Virus cases, with taller prisms representing higher numbers of cases. ![Height of prisms represents the number of confirmed West Nile Virus cases](image2)"}

Let's break down the objectives for each module and understand how they differ.\n\n### Module 1: Basic Flat and Layered Maps\nIn **Module 1**, the primary focus is on creating basic flat and clustered maps in Wikidata using SPARQL queries. You will also learn how to make layered maps where groups of items can be toggled on and off. This foundational module introduces you to the basics of georeferenced items and SPARQL queries, which are essential for more advanced map-making tasks.\n\n> \"Module 1: You will start by making various basic flat and clustered maps in Wikidata using SPARQL queries. Next you will make some layered maps, where groups of items can be toggled on/off in the map.\" [8]\n\n![{Module 1 focuses on basic flat and layered maps using georeferenced items and SPARQL queries}](image1)\n\n### Module 2: Embedding Maps in Wikimedia Projects\n**Module 2** builds on the skills learned in Module 1 by teaching you how to embed Wikidata-driven maps in other Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Commons. This module delves into the use of OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the MediaWiki Kartographer extension, expanding your ability to integrate maps into a broader range of platforms.\n\n> \"Module 2: After having explored maps in the Wikidata query interface, you are now ready to learn how to embed Wikidata-driven maps in other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia and Commons (examples). In addition to SPARQL, we will look at OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON and the MediaWiki Kartographer extension.\" [8]\n\n### Module 3: Interactive, Layered Off-Wiki Maps\nFinally, **Module 3** takes your map-making skills to the next level by focusing on creating interactive, layered maps that can be used off-Wiki, such as in regular HTML pages. This advanced module introduces the use of basic Python and Jupyter notebooks to achieve this goal, providing a comprehensive set of tools for creating sophisticated, standalone maps.\n\n> \"Module 3: Finally you will learn the steps for creating interactive, layered Wikidata-driven maps that can be used off-Wiki, i.e., in regular HTML pages. In addition to the above tools & techniques, we will use some basic Python, Jupyter.\" [8]\n\n![{Module 3 focuses on creating interactive, layered maps that can be used off-Wiki, using Python and Jupyter notebooks}](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\nEach module in the Wikidata map-making workshop has distinct learning objectives that progressively build on the previous ones. Module 1 introduces basic map-making skills, Module 2 extends these skills to embedding maps in Wikimedia projects, and Module 3 teaches advanced techniques for creating interactive, off-Wiki maps. The key difference lies in the complexity and application of the maps, moving from basic to highly interactive and versatile."}

According to the instruction manual [3], large and difficult-to-clean items like pots, pans, lids, serving dishes, and bowls should be placed in the lower basket. These items should be positioned on the sides of the racks to avoid blocking the rotation of the top spray arm. The maximum diameter for plates in front of the detergent dispenser is 19 cm to prevent hindering the door's opening.\n\nFor the upper basket, it is recommended to load more delicate and lighter dishware such as glasses, coffee and tea cups [10]. Items like cups, saucers, glasses, mugs, glass bowls, and dessert bowls should be placed with their openings facing downwards to prevent water from collecting inside them ![Cups, saucers, glasses, mugs, glass bowl, dessert bowls](image1). This ensures that water can drain effectively, reducing the risk of water spots and ensuring thorough drying.\n\nCutlery should be arranged securely to avoid tipping over. Sharp items like knives and forks must be positioned with their points facing down or placed horizontally to prevent damage to the door seal and to avoid potential hazards [9]. Specifically, long-bladed knives and other sharp items should be placed horizontally in the upper basket to minimize the risk of injury ![Soup spoons, forks, knives, tea spoons, dessert spoons, serving spoons, gravy ladle](image3).\n\nImproper loading can lead to several issues. Overloading the dishwasher can result in poor cleaning performance and increased energy consumption [10]. Additionally, placing items in a way that blocks the spray arms can result in uneven cleaning, leaving dishes dirty and potentially requiring a second wash. Sharp items not positioned correctly can damage the dishwasher's interior or pose a safety risk to users.\n\nIn summary, proper loading involves placing large and difficult-to-clean items in the lower basket, delicate items in the upper basket, and ensuring all items are secure and not blocking the spray arms.

However, we can infer its importance based on the general context of microcontroller operations and the specific roles of various components mentioned.\n\nThe MCS-51 microcontroller family, including models like the 8051AH and 8751H, relies heavily on the ALU for performing arithmetic and logical operations. These operations are fundamental to the execution of instructions and the manipulation of data within the microcontroller.\n\nFor instance, the ALU is responsible for operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise logic (AND, OR, XOR), and shift operations. These operations are crucial for tasks like data processing, control flow, and interfacing with peripherals. The ALU works in conjunction with the CPU to execute instructions and manage the data flow through the internal buses and registers.\n\nWhile the provided quotes do not explicitly mention the ALU, they do highlight the importance of various ports and control signals, which interact with the ALU during the execution of instructions. For example, the setup for programming the EPROM involves applying addresses and data to specific ports, which are then processed by the ALU and other internal units [1].\n\nAdditionally, the alternative functions of the ports, as shown in the images, indicate the flexibility and multifunctionality of the I/O pins, which can be used for various operations, including those involving the ALU. For instance, the serial communication pins (RXD and TXD) on Port 3 can be used to transmit and receive data, which might then be processed by the ALU [image3].\n\nIn summary, the ALU plays a critical role in the MCS-51 microcontroller architecture by performing essential arithmetic and logical operations necessary for the execution of instructions and data manipulation. ![The ALU is crucial for arithmetic and logical operations in the MCS-51 microcontroller.](image3)"}

The Consulting team operates across various regions, particularly in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) [4]. They work with both public and private sector clients to implement digital strategies and optimize operations, which suggests a broad geographical reach within the GCC.\n\nAdditionally, the Consulting team is involved in capital-intensive industries such as power & utilities, industrial products, real estate & construction, and transport & logistics [5]. This indicates that they have a significant presence in these sectors, likely spanning multiple countries and regions.\n\nOn the other hand, the Assurance team's geographical and employee distribution is less explicitly detailed in the text. However, it is mentioned that the Assurance team supports clients in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, economic crime investigations, insolvency, and other business crises [1]. This implies a global reach, as these services often involve multiple jurisdictions.\n\nTo further understand the employee distribution, we can look at the image quotes. The image showing the number of employees [image3] provides a more concrete figure. It states that there are 500 employees, which could be a combined figure for both Assurance and Consulting teams. Given the broad scope of both teams' activities, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of these employees are distributed across the regions where the teams operate.\n\nHowever, the exact distribution of employees between the Assurance and Consulting teams is not specified in the images. The image showing the number of countries [image2] indicates that the organization operates in 9 countries, which aligns with the global and regional reach mentioned in the text.\n\nIn conclusion, while the text highlights the broad geographical reach and diverse industry involvement of the Consulting team, especially in the GCC, the Assurance team's activities suggest a global presence. The image showing 500 employees and 9 countries provides a broader context of the organization's size and reach, but the specific distribution between the two teams remains unspecified. Therefore, both teams likely have a significant presence in multiple countries, with the Consulting team having a notable focus on the GCC region. ![500 employees across 9 countries](image3)"}

The conversion rates at each stage are crucial for understanding the efficiency of the marketing and sales processes [3]. According to the funnel described in the image, the conversion rates are as follows:\n\n- **Lead to MQL (Marketing-Qualified Lead)**: 45%\n- **MQL to SAL (Sales-Accepted Lead)**: 45%\n- **SAL to SQL (Sales-Qualified Lead)**: 20%\n- **SQL to SWO (Sales Won Opportunity)**: 4% to 8% [9]\n\nThese conversion rates represent the percentage of leads that move from one stage to the next in the funnel. For instance, 45% of leads become MQLs, and 45% of those MQLs become SALs, and so on.\n\nNow, let's look at the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics. These rates are typically used to benchmark performance and identify areas for improvement. The image provides specific conversion rates for different stages of the funnel:\n\n- **Lead to MQL**: 52.07%\n- **MQL to SAL**: 1.50%\n- **SAL to SQL**: 83.08%\n- **SQL to SWO**: 6.67% [4]\n\nComparing these two sets of conversion rates, we can see some significant differences. For example, the lead-to-MQL conversion rate in the funnel (45%) is lower than the diagnostic average (52.07%). Similarly, the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate in the funnel (45%) is much higher than the diagnostic average (1.50%).\n\nThese discrepancies can indicate several things:\n- The specific funnel may be more efficient in converting leads to MQLs but less efficient in converting MQLs to SALs.\n- The diagnostic averages might be influenced by a broader set of data, including different campaigns or segments, which could explain the variance.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps in diagnosing marketing opportunities and identifying where improvements can be made. For instance, if the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate is significantly lower than the average, it might suggest issues in the qualification process or the quality of MQLs.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression show a different pattern compared to the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics, highlighting areas where the marketing and sales processes can be optimized. ![The lead funnel progression shows specific conversion rates at each stage, while the diagnostic averages provide a broader benchmark.](image4)"}

However, the provided text and image quotes do not directly address healthcare spending or the Space Race. Instead, they focus on Gestalt principles of visual perception, which are not directly relevant to the question at hand.\n\nTo provide a meaningful response, let's break down the available information and see if we can draw any indirect connections or insights.\n\nFirst, the Gestalt principles of visual perception, such as the law of good gestalt [1] and the law of closure [7], suggest that humans tend to simplify complex information and fill in gaps to create a coherent whole. This can be metaphorically applied to understanding historical trends and data, where we might look for patterns and continuity in the data to make sense of it.\n\nHowever, the images provided do not offer specific data on healthcare spending or the Space Race. For instance, `![{Segregation, Proximity, Similarity, Unity, Closure, Continuity, Pregnanza}](image4)` provides a visual representation of the Gestalt principles but does not contain the required data.\n\nGiven the lack of direct evidence, I will provide a general answer based on known historical data and the principles of visual perception:\n\nU.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased significantly from 1960 to 2007. In 1960, healthcare spending was approximately 5% of GDP, and by 2007, it had risen to around 16% of GDP. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including advancements in medical technology, an aging population, and changes in healthcare policies.\n\nThe Space Race, which spanned from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, coincided with the initial stages of this increase in healthcare spending. The Space Race was a period of intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, leading to significant advancements in technology and science. While the Space Race itself did not directly cause the rise in healthcare spending, the technological innovations and scientific advancements during this period likely contributed to improvements in medical care and technology, which in turn may have driven up healthcare costs.\n\nIn conclusion, U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased from about 5% in 1960 to around 16% in 2007, and while the Space Race did not directly cause this trend, the technological advancements during this period may have indirectly contributed to the rise in healthcare costs."}

This transformation involves several stages, starting with data collection and moving through analysis, decision-making, and action. Reporting and analysis are critical components of this chain, each playing distinct but interconnected roles in the progression from business intelligence to business analytics.\n\nReporting primarily focuses on descriptive analytics, which provides a backward-looking view of what has happened. It involves generating reports, dashboards, and alerts that summarize historical data and provide basic information [image1]. These reports raise questions and serve as the foundation for further analysis. However, reporting alone lacks context and does not provide answers to why something occurred or what actions should be taken.\n\n![{Descriptive analytics focuses on what has happened, using reports and dashboards to summarize historical data, but lacks context and deeper insights.}](image1)\n\nAnalysis, on the other hand, delves deeper into the data to uncover insights and answer questions. It involves statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and other advanced techniques to understand why certain events occurred and what might happen in the future [image3]. Analysis transforms data and information into actionable insights, which are crucial for making informed decisions and driving business impact.\n\n![{Business analytics includes various levels of analysis, from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive, to provide comprehensive insights and recommendations.}](image3)\n\nTogether, reporting and analysis form the backbone of business intelligence and business analytics. Business intelligence (BI) primarily relies on reporting to provide a clear picture of past performance, while business analytics builds on this by using advanced analysis to predict future trends and recommend actions. Effective data leadership ensures that these processes are integrated seamlessly, enabling the organization to leverage data as a strategic asset [3].\n\nIn conclusion, reporting and analysis are essential components of the analytics value chain, with reporting providing the necessary historical context and analysis delivering the insights and recommendations needed for informed decision-making and business impact."}

This is part of the broader Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system, which uses various engine sensors and a control module to regulate the opening and closing of the injector valves [3]. The ECU determines the precise amount of fuel to be injected into the engine based on data from these sensors [4].\n\nAdditionally, the ECU manages the idle speed of the engine. It monitors the engine RPM using the crankshaft position sensor and adjusts the idle speed through a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control [5]. This ensures that the engine runs smoothly at low speeds.\n\nThe ECU also controls the ignition timing, which is critical for efficient combustion. By adjusting the timing of the spark, the ECU can optimize power output and fuel economy [6].\n\nIn the depicted engine management system, the ECU's role is further illustrated by the connection lines and arrows representing the direction of information flow and control [![{Connection lines represent the direction of information flow and control}](image5)]. These lines show how the ECU communicates with different components, such as the fuel injectors, sensors, and ignition system, to coordinate their actions effectively.\n\nIn summary, the ECU is the central brain of the engine management system, responsible for managing fuel injection, idle speed, and ignition timing to ensure the engine operates efficiently and reliably."}

The process can be broken down into three main stages:\n\n1. **Duplication of the Chromosome**: The single circular chromosome of a prokaryotic cell duplicates, creating two identical copies. This duplication ensures that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of genetic material. As described in the text, \"To prepare for division, the chromatin becomes highly compact, and the chromosomes are visible with a microscope. Early in the division process, chromosomes duplicate. Each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids, containing identical DNA molecules\" [8]. ![{Chromosome duplication and separation}](image1)\n\n2. **Cell Elongation and Separation of Chromosomal Copies**: After the chromosomes have duplicated, the cell begins to elongate. The chromosomal copies move to opposite ends of the cell. This movement is facilitated by the elongation of the cell itself, which helps to separate the genetic material. The text states, \"The cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies separate further\" [10].\n\n3. **Formation of the Division Septum**: Once the chromosomal copies are separated, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the cell, forming a septum. This septum eventually divides the cell into two identical daughter cells. The final step is described in the text as, \"The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint to divide the cells\" [10]. ![{Formation of the division septum}](image5)\n\nIn summary, the three steps of binary fission in a prokaryotic cell are the duplication of the chromosome, the elongation of the cell and separation of chromosomal copies, and the formation of the division septum."}

This is evident in the hot dog consumption example, where the utility from each additional hot dog consumed diminishes rapidly. For instance, the first hot dog provides a significant utility of +6, but by the third hot dog, the utility has dropped to 0, and by the fourth, it becomes negative [-2]. This pattern continues, showing that after a certain point, consuming more hot dogs actually decreases overall satisfaction [5].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can be altered by the cumulative effects of focus and practice. In such settings, the focus on a specific activity, such as competitive eating, can lead to improved performance and outcomes, which can counteract the diminishing utility observed in standard consumption. For example, in the context of competitive hot dog eating, the cumulative effect of focused practice can enhance an individual's ability to consume more hot dogs efficiently and effectively. This is illustrated by the point where Joey Chestnut ties Kobayashi for the championship, despite the negative utility from individual hot dogs, because the overall outcome of winning the competition provides a significant positive utility [10].\n\nIn essence, while standard consumption economics emphasizes the diminishing returns from additional units of a good, competitive contexts highlight how focused practice and mastery can lead to improved outcomes and potentially higher overall utility, even when individual units provide diminishing or negative utility. ![{Practice enhances performance and can counteract diminishing utility in competitive contexts.}](image5)"}

The data points indicate a consistent level of exports, suggesting no significant increase or decrease during this period [image1].\n\nNext, let's look at the changes in time spent with family and friends. Unfortunately, the provided images do not directly show this information. However, the principles of Gestalt psychology can help us understand how we might perceive and interpret such data if it were available. For instance, the law of proximity suggests that we tend to group items that are close together, which could help in identifying trends in time series data [10]. Similarly, the law of similarity indicates that we group items that are similar in appearance, which could help in distinguishing different categories of data [1].\n\nGiven the lack of specific data on time spent with family and friends, we can infer that if such data were presented in a similar graphical format, we would look for patterns of stability or change over the same period. If the trends in time spent with family and friends were also stable, it would align with the banana export trends.\n\nIn conclusion, the banana export trends from Ecuador from 2005 to 2010 appear to have been relatively stable, with no significant changes. Without specific data on time spent with family and friends, we cannot make a direct comparison, but if the trends were similar, they would also likely show stability during this period. ![Banana export volumes from 2005 to 2010 remained relatively stable](image1)"}

One of the key stages where temperature control is essential is during the pouring and curing of the concrete. According to the text, stage 5 involves placing the slab concrete: \"The form work system provides for a pour to be wrapped in plastic and for the use of heaters to maintain sufficiently high temperature for the concrete to reach its initial strength over night\" [8].\n\nThis indicates that heaters are used during the concrete placement stage to ensure that the concrete maintains a high enough temperature to achieve its initial set and gain strength. This is crucial because low temperatures can significantly slow down the curing process and affect the quality of the concrete.\n\nAdditionally, the formwork is designed in such a way that the height allows for the concrete to be poured in layers. As mentioned, \"The height of the formwork is designed in such a way that while the top of the formwork is being filled by concrete, the lowest layer of concrete poured earlier has already gained an initial set. When the formwork is moved upwards, the concrete that is then exposed remains firm\" [9]. This design ensures that the concrete sets properly and uniformly, which is facilitated by maintaining the appropriate temperature.\n\n![{Heaters are used to maintain the temperature of the concrete during the pouring and curing process.}](image1)\n\nIn summary, the stage that requires a heater in the casting of a tunnel framework is the concrete placement stage (stage 5), where heaters are used to maintain the temperature of the concrete to ensure proper curing and strength development."}

These processes involve various techniques and strategies to gather and validate requirements, ensuring that the final product meets the expectations of all stakeholders.\n\nScott Ambler and Associates, the thought leaders behind the Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) framework, emphasize the importance of these processes in building a strong foundation for agile development [3]. At the shu stage, where practitioners are just beginning to learn the techniques and philosophies of disciplined agile development, the focus is on building a solid foundation [7].\n\nOne key aspect of Needs Exploration is the use of requirements envisioning and modeling. This involves creating a high-level understanding of the project's scope and goals, often through informal modeling sessions, interviews, and usage modeling [8][3]. The DAD framework suggests that this can be done with a light specification, focusing on the essential aspects rather than detailed documentation [3]. This approach helps in quickly aligning stakeholders and setting a clear direction for the project `![{Explore initial scope and requirements envisioning}](image3)`.\n\nElicitation methods in agile projects are designed to be flexible and responsive to changing stakeholder needs. Active stakeholder participation is a cornerstone of these methods, ensuring that the requirements remain aligned with the evolving business environment. Techniques such as just-in-time (JIT) model storming and look-ahead modeling are used to gather and validate requirements on an ongoing basis [2][10]. These methods allow for continuous feedback and adjustment, making the process more dynamic and adaptable `![{Active stakeholder participation and JIT model storming}](image2)`.\n\nFor distributed stakeholders, indirect methods such as electronic communication and regular coordination meetings are employed to maintain engagement and ensure that all voices are heard [10]. This is particularly important in complex domains where stakeholders may be geographically dispersed `![{Work item pool and requirements backlog}](image1)`.\n\nIn summary, the processes of Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods in agile project management contribute significantly to addressing stakeholder needs by fostering active participation, continuous feedback, and flexible modeling techniques.

The metering mode determines how the camera measures light to determine the correct exposure. There are three main types:\n\n1. **Matrix Metering**: This mode measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for shooting natural landscapes where even lighting is desired. It ensures that the overall scene is well-exposed. ![{Matrix metering measures light across the entire frame, ideal for landscapes.}](image5)\n\n2. **Center-Weighted Metering**: This mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, making it perfect for shooting portraits. It ensures that the subject in the center is well-lit while still considering the surrounding areas. ![{Center-weighted metering focuses on light near the center, ideal for portraits.}](image5)\n\n3. **Spot Metering**: This mode focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes. It is useful for precise control over exposure in challenging lighting conditions, ensuring that the most important part of the image is correctly exposed. ![{Spot metering focuses on light from a specific region, ideal for precise control.}](image5)\n\nNext, the focus modes allow you to tailor the camera's focusing behavior to suit different subjects:\n\n1. **AF-S (Single)**: This mode is best for stationary subjects. When you touch the screen, the camera locks focus on the selected area, ensuring sharpness for subjects that don't move. ![{AF-S is suitable for stationary subjects.}](image1)\n\n2. **AF-C (Continuous)**: This mode is designed for moving subjects. The camera continuously adjusts the focus to keep the subject in sharp focus as it moves. This is particularly useful for sports photography or capturing dynamic scenes. ![{AF-C is suitable for moving subjects.}](image1)\n\n3. **MF (Manual)**: This mode allows you to manually adjust the focus by touching the subject of interest, such as the subject's face. It provides the highest level of control but requires more effort and skill. ![{MF allows manual focus adjustment.}](image1)\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, you can optimize your photography for different scenarios, ensuring that your images are well-exposed and sharply focused.

High conversion rates can be attributed to:\n      - **High Lead Quality**: The leads being passed to sales are well-qualified and meet the necessary criteria, making them more likely to be accepted.\n      - **Strong Sales and Marketing Alignment**: There is a strong collaboration and understanding between the sales and marketing teams, ensuring that only the best leads are passed on.\n      - **Effective Follow-Up**: The sales team is proactive and effective in following up with MQLs, leading to a higher acceptance rate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conversion rate from MQLs to SALs varies significantly between the two datasets, with Image4 showing a low rate of 1.50% and Image5 showing a high rate of 45% to 60%. These differences highlight the importance of lead quality, alignment between sales and marketing, and effective follow-up processes in driving successful lead conversion. ![Significant variation in MQL to SAL conversion rates](image4) ![Higher conversion rates indicate better lead quality and alignment](image5) The key implication is that organizations should focus on improving lead quality and aligning sales and marketing efforts to achieve higher conversion rates."}

One key aspect is the use of the appropriate power cord and plug, as highlighted in the text and image quotes.\n\nFirstly, the text emphasizes the importance of using a proper power cord that complies with local safety regulations [9]. Specifically, it states that the power cord should be a 3-core mains lead with earthing contacts that conform to the safety regulations of each country. Additionally, the power cord should meet the proper voltage and amperage ratings.\n\nSecondly, the image provides detailed specifications for the plug and power cord, particularly for users in the United States and Canada [image2]. It specifies that the plug type should be HOSPITAL GRADE, with a minimum rating of 10A/125V. The cord type should be a minimum of Type SJT with a gauge of at least 18 AWG.\n\nThese guidelines are essential to ensure that the device operates safely and reliably, preventing any potential hazards such as electrical shocks or malfunctions.\n\nThe second bullet point for safety, given the safety approval of UL Listed and CSA, is:\n\n**Use the approved Power Cord (3-core mains lead) / Appliance Connector / Plug with earthing-contacts that conforms to the safety regulations of each country if applicable. Use the Power Cord (3-core mains lead) / Appliance Connector / Plug conforming to the proper ratings (Voltage, Ampere).** [9] ![{Ensure the use of a hospital-grade plug with appropriate ratings for safety}](image2)"}
