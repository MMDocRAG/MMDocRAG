This aligns with the data from image4, which shows that the percentage of Republicans preferring a more conservative approach has remained relatively stable, with 60% consistently favoring conservatism from 2008 to 2016. The image highlights that while there was a slight dip in 2012, the overall trend remains unchanged, indicating a strong conservative stance among Republican voters.\n\nOn the Democratic side, there has been a significant shift toward a more liberal orientation. In 2016, 49% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters supported a more liberal direction, compared to 47% who favored moderation [11]. This marks a notable increase from previous years, as only a third of Democratic voters wanted a more liberal stance following Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012 [4]. Image8 supports this trend, showing that the gap between those favoring a more moderate and more liberal direction narrowed significantly by 2016, with 49% supporting a liberal approach. This shift reflects growing internal divisions within the Democratic Party, as more voters now advocate for a leftward move compared to past elections.\n\nThese changes highlight a growing ideological divide between the two parties. While Republicans have maintained a steady preference for conservatism, Democrats have become more polarized, with a larger segment now pushing for a more liberal agenda. This polarization is further emphasized by the broader dissatisfaction with candidates in 2016, where only 40% of registered voters were satisfied with the choices [1], and both parties received harsher grades than in previous campaigns [2].

For instance, very high confidence is associated with strong evidence, established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well-documented methods, and high consensus, as illustrated in the confidence evaluation chart ![Confidence levels are categorized based on evidence strength and expert consensus](image8).\n\nLikelihood, on the other hand, provides a probabilistic measure of the chance of an event occurring, expressed in specific terms such as \"very likely\" (≥9 in 10) or \"very unlikely\" (≤1 in 10) [2][3][4]. This probabilistic language allows for a quantitative estimate of uncertainty, helping to communicate the probability of impacts more precisely [2][3]. The image depicting probability terms ![Probability terms indicate specific likelihood ranges](image4) visually represents these likelihood categories, showing how each term corresponds to a numerical probability range.\n\nEach Key Finding in the document includes both a confidence description and, where scientifically justified, a likelihood designation [11]. These evaluations are based on the expert assessment and consensus of the chapter author teams, who consider the available literature, evidence quality, and agreement across studies [11]. The process for reaching these conclusions is documented in the Traceable Accounts, providing transparency and traceability [5][11].\n\nIn summary, confidence and likelihood are evaluated through a combination of qualitative evidence assessment and probabilistic language, ensuring that findings are communicated with clarity and precision. ![Confidence levels are categorized based on evidence strength and expert consensus](image8) and ![Probability terms indicate specific likelihood ranges](image4) illustrate the structured approach to these evaluations.\n\nThe levels of confidence and likelihood are evaluated by assessing the quality and consistency of evidence and expert agreement for confidence, and using probabilistic terms for likelihood, as documented in the report."}

This shift indicates a growing acceptance of current spending levels among Americans.\n\nPartisan differences in the U.S. are also evident. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have historically been more supportive of increased defense spending in Europe compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. However, the support among Republicans has notably decreased by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, as shown in the line graph where the \"Republican/Lean Rep\" line declines from 62 in 2017 to 48 in 2019 [![Decline in Republican support](image2)].

This trend is consistent with the observation that affluent and well-educated seniors adopt the internet and broadband at higher rates [1].\n\nSmartphone ownership also reflects this educational divide. While only 10% of seniors with a high school education or less own smartphones, the rate increases to 35% among college graduates [image8]. This disparity highlights the influence of education on technology adoption, as more educated seniors are better equipped to integrate digital tools into their lives. The data from image8 further illustrates that smartphone ownership is particularly low among older adults, with only 18% of all seniors owning smartphones, but this rate is significantly higher among those with a college education.\n\nAdditionally, the decline in technology adoption with age is evident across educational levels. For example, among those aged 75-79, smartphone ownership drops to 10% for college graduates, and it becomes nearly non-existent (5%) among those aged 80 and older, regardless of education [11][image8]. This suggests that while education plays a crucial role in technology adoption, age-related factors also significantly impact usage patterns.\n\nIn summary, seniors with higher educational backgrounds exhibit higher rates of internet usage and smartphone ownership compared to their less educated counterparts, underscoring the impact of education on digital engagement among older adults.\n\n![College graduates have higher internet and broadband adoption rates](image1)  \n![Smartphone ownership is higher among college-educated seniors](image8)  \n\nThe answer is: Seniors with higher educational backgrounds have significantly higher rates of internet usage and smartphone ownership compared to those with lower educational attainment."}

According to the data, seniors who have graduated from college are around three times as likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet as those who have not attended college [12]. This trend is evident in the breakdown of ownership by education level, where college graduates aged 65 and older show a higher percentage of e-book reader and tablet usage compared to those with a high school education or less [8]. Specifically, 30% of college graduates use e-book readers and 31% use tablets, whereas only 12% of those with a high school education or less use e-book readers and 11% use tablets [8]. This disparity highlights the strong correlation between higher education and technology adoption among seniors.\n\nWhen comparing this to broader trends over time, the adoption of technology among different age groups has been increasing, but younger age groups consistently show higher usage rates. For instance, the line graph from 2006 to 2013 illustrates that the 18-29 age group reached 90% technology usage by 2013, while the 65+ age group climbed to 46% during the same period ![The 65+ age group climbed to 46% technology usage by 2013](image1). This indicates a growing trend of technology adoption across all age groups, with younger individuals leading the way. However, among seniors, education level remains a critical factor in determining the likelihood of owning tablets and e-book readers.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison between all adults and those aged 65 and over shows that while 43% of all adults own a tablet or e-reader, only 27% of seniors do [7]. This lower adoption rate among seniors is partly explained by educational disparities, as higher education correlates with greater ownership of these devices [12]. The data also reveals that among seniors, those with higher household incomes are more likely to own tablets and e-book readers, reinforcing the link between education, income, and technology adoption [12].\n\nIn summary, education level plays a crucial role in the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, with college graduates showing significantly higher ownership rates. This aligns with broader trends where younger age groups have higher technology adoption rates, but within the senior population, education and income are key determinants of device ownership.\n\nEducation level significantly affects the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors,"}

The image comparing presidential success perceptions highlights this divide, showing that while Republicans have consistently high confidence in Trump's success, Democrats' views are overwhelmingly negative [image2].\n\nHistorically, the share of people saying it's \"too early to tell\" about Trump's success is lower than for previous presidents. At comparable points, nearly half of the public said it was too early to tell about Obama (47%), Bush (38%), and Clinton (43%), whereas only 23% say the same about Trump [3, 5, image3].

Among Democrats, White Democrats are less supportive of this requirement compared to Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats. Specifically, only 54% of White Democrats favor requiring photo ID, while larger shares of Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian (71%) Democrats support it [3]. This aligns with the broader trend that White Democrats are generally more supportive of policies aimed at making voting easier, whereas other racial groups within the Democratic Party show higher support for stricter measures like photo ID [8].\n\nOn the Republican side, the support for photo ID requirements is overwhelmingly high, with 93% of Republicans favoring this policy [12]. This strong support is consistent across racial groups within the Republican Party, though Hispanic Republicans are slightly more supportive of easing voting policies compared to White Republicans in other areas, such as automatic voter registration [7]. However, when it comes to photo ID, the image data shows that both White and Hispanic Republicans strongly favor this requirement, as indicated by the high percentages in the chart [image8].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends.

This disparity is also reflected in the perception that their gender has made it harder to succeed, with 48% of women in male-dominated environments feeling this way, compared to only 12% in majority-female workplaces [11]. ![Women in male-dominated STEM workplaces experience higher discrimination](image7) highlights these differences, showing that women in male-dominated settings are more likely to face challenges such as needing to prove themselves (79% vs. 52%) and perceiving sexual harassment as a problem (48% vs. 33%).\n\nFurthermore, women in male-dominated STEM environments are more likely to report specific forms of discrimination, such as earning less than a man doing the same job (29%) and being treated as if they were not competent (29%) [4].

For instance, among those with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic, a significant portion cited reasons such as mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and a lack of cultural ties [1]. Specifically, 27% mentioned a mixed Hispanic and non-Hispanic background or distant Hispanic ancestry, while 16% pointed to upbringing or limited contact with Hispanic relatives [1]. Additionally, 15% cited not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link, and 12% identified as another race or did not look Hispanic [1]. These reasons highlight the complexity of identity formation, particularly for those with mixed or distant heritage.\n\nGenerational differences play a crucial role in self-identification. For example, 36% of immigrant Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, a share that rises to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics [3]. This trend reflects the increasing assimilation and integration into American culture over generations. By the third generation, only 77% self-identify as Hispanic, and by the fourth or higher generation, this drops to just half [10]. This decline underscores the impact of generational distance from immigrant roots on identity.\n\nLanguage and cultural ties are also significant factors. While 58% of immigrant Latinos believe speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, this view is even more prevalent among U.S.-born Latinos, with 84% of second-generation and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos holding this belief [7]. The chart in ![image1](image1) further illustrates this, showing that the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who speak Spanish decreases sharply with each generation: 41% among the foreign-born, 15% among the second generation, and only 7% among the third or higher generation.

The decline continues into the third or higher generation, where only 33% report discussions about pride in their roots [3], and 35% recall attending cultural celebrations often [5].

However, when it comes to using technology outside the household, only 20% of respondents use a mobile phone, while 68% do not use any technology outside their home [![Most do not use technology outside home](image7)]. This suggests a strong reliance on personal devices within the home but limited use outside, possibly due to accessibility or convenience.\n\nRegarding radio listening habits, the data reveals notable differences across demographics. Overall, 76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, with a significant portion using mobile phones as well [![Radio and mobile phone usage for listening](image4)]. In rural areas, 77% use a radio, while in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone, indicating a shift towards mobile technology in urban settings [![Urban areas prefer mobile phones](image4)]. Gender also plays a role, with males more likely to use mobile phones (43%) compared to females (36%) [![Gender differences in radio listening](image4)]. Additionally, the frequency of radio listening varies, with 46% of respondents never listening, and 27% listening every day [![Many never listen to radio](image5)]. Females are less likely to listen regularly, with 55.7% never listening, compared to 37.1% of males [![Females listen less frequently](image5)].\n\nThe content of radio programs also influences listening habits. News is the most popular program type, with 82% of respondents tuning in, followed by music at 58% [![News and music are most popular](image6)]. This aligns with the radio content distribution, where 62% of programs are news-based [![News dominates radio content](image2)]. However, some respondents find radio programs uninteresting [11], which may contribute to the 46% who never listen [![Some find programs uninteresting]("}

The subscriber base continued to grow, reflecting the overall trend of increasing mobile subscribers in Indonesia, which reached 240 million by early 2014 [8]. This growth can be attributed to the widespread adoption of smartphones and the increasing popularity of data-based communication methods like instant messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP), which became the primary communication method for many users [9][10]. The image showing Telkomsel's subscriber count at 139.3 million highlights its dominance in the market [![Telkomsel's subscriber count](image6)].\n\nHowever, despite the growing subscriber base, Telkomsel's ARPU faced a decline.

This decline is further supported by the line graph illustrating a gradual decrease in Voice and SMS ARPU from 2013 to 2017, with a slight recovery in Mobile Data ARPU after 2015 [![ARPU trends](image2)]. The reduction in ARPU was initially driven by a price war initiated by the government, leading to lower tariffs [7].

This indicates a substantial lead for Telkomsel in smartphone adoption, which aligns with the broader trend of increasing smartphone usage in Indonesia [10]. The rise in smartphone users likely contributed to a shift in revenue streams, as data usage became more prominent [4].\n\nThe ARPU trends for both companies reflect broader industry shifts. Image1 shows a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU from 2013 to 2015, with a subsequent rise in Mobile Data ARPU after 2015.

The decline in voice and SMS ARPU can be attributed to the reduced usage of traditional services in favor of data-based communication tools [4][7].\n\nImage2 and image5 provide historical context, showing a general decline in prepaid ARPU from 2008 to 2012. Telkomsel's ARPU dropped from 53 to 34, and XL's from 35 to 31, indicating a long-term downward trend influenced by price wars and tariff reductions [2][11].

According to the data, streaming has become the leading format in the music industry, as highlighted by the fact that it accounts for 70% of total music activity [4]. This trend is particularly pronounced in genres like R&B/Hip-Hop and Latin, where streaming dominates. For instance, R&B/Hip-Hop shows a streaming share of 39% in Streaming Equivalent Albums (SEA) [image1], and its catalog streams contribute 61% to total activity [image3]. Similarly, Latin music has an impressive 68% SEA share [image1], indicating a strong preference for streaming over traditional album sales.\n\nIn contrast, genres like Rock and Country exhibit a different pattern. Rock is driven by catalog at all formats, with album sales making up 32% of physical albums and 26% of SEA [image1], and catalog streams contributing 82% to total activity [image3]. This suggests that Rock fans still value album collections, whether physical or digital. Country music, with 35% of physical album sales [image1] and a catalog stream share of 70% [image3], also shows a strong album-centric consumption pattern, albeit with a notable streaming presence.\n\nPop music, on the other hand, is mainly driven by current releases, with a catalog stream share of 58% [image3], and streaming equivalent albums at 36% [image1]. This indicates a balance between streaming and album sales, though streaming is still a significant component. The overall trend, however, is clear: streaming is rapidly becoming the largest share of the business [9], as evidenced by the 91% increase in Streaming SEA from 2014 to 2015 [image2], and it now constitutes 70% of total music activity [image4].\n\nThese trends suggest that while streaming is universally on the rise, genre-specific preferences persist. R&B/Hip-Hop and Latin fans are heavily streaming-oriented, while Rock and Country maintain a stronger connection to album sales. This diversity in consumption habits reflects the evolving landscape of the music industry, where streaming leads overall but traditional formats still hold sway in certain genres.\n\n![Streaming dominates in R&B/Hip-Hop and Latin genres](image1)  \n![Streaming shows a significant increase from 2014 to 2015](image2)  \n![Rock and Country"}

For Rock, streams contribute 23% to total activity, which is lower than the 82% catalog share seen in image3. This discrepancy may be due to the different metrics being compared—image3 focuses on catalog activity, while image8 looks at total activity.

The framework is structured into three main stages: Problem Formulation, Symbolic Reasoning, and Result Interpretation. During the Problem Formulation stage, an LLM translates a natural language problem into a symbolic representation, which is then processed by a symbolic solver in the Symbolic Reasoning stage. The Result Interpreter translates the solver's output back into a natural language answer [11].\n\nFor the logic programming module within this framework, the paper specifies the use of the Pyke expert system. Pyke is designed for deductive reasoning tasks and operates by creating a knowledge base populated with facts and rules, then applying forward- and backward-chaining algorithms to infer new facts and substantiate the goal [10]. This aligns with the framework's approach of leveraging LLMs for symbolic representation and symbolic solvers for logical inference, ensuring faithful reasoning [6].\n\n![The LOGIC-LM framework overview shows the integration of a Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter, with a self-refinement loop to enhance accuracy](image1) The framework's design emphasizes the role of LLMs in accurately translating problems into symbolic forms, which are then processed by specialized solvers like Pyke for deductive reasoning [11].\n\n![The structure of the LOGIC-LM model highlights the Problem Formulator's role in generating symbolic representations using LLMs, the Symbolic Reasoner's use of methods like Logic Programming, and the Result Interpreter's function in translating symbolic answers](image2) This modular approach allows LOGIC-LM to handle various reasoning tasks effectively by matching problems with appropriate solvers, such as Pyke for logic programming tasks.\n\nIn summary, the symbolic solver used to implement the logic programming module in the LOGIC-LM framework is the Pyke expert system."}

This bias is evident in both the text and image evidence provided. \n\nIn the text, it is mentioned that active querying strategies like VAAL tend to select data biased towards certain classes, often neglecting minority classes [4]. This bias is particularly harmful in long-tail distributions, where some classes occur much less frequently than others, leading to poor class coverage and performance [9]. The text further highlights that VAAL, along with other strategies like Entropy and Margin, can barely outperform random sampling at the beginning because they fail to include data from minority classes [4]. This lack of diversity is a critical issue, as it can escalate biased sampling, especially in datasets with imbalanced class distributions [4].\n\nThe image evidence reinforces this observation. For instance, in the analysis of the PathMNIST dataset, the VAAL strategy shows a clear preference for selecting data from the muscle class while largely ignoring minority classes like mucus and mucosa [![VAAL prefers muscle class, neglecting mucus and mucosa](image7)]. Similarly, in the OrganAMNIST dataset, VAAL tends to select data from the femur-right and platelet classes but largely ignores classes like lung, liver, and monocyte [![VAAL prefers femur-right and platelet, neglecting lung, liver, and monocyte](image6)]. This pattern of biased selection is consistent across different datasets, as seen in the comparison of querying strategies on the BloodMNIST dataset, where VAAL's class distribution is highly unbalanced [![VAAL's class distribution is highly unbalanced](image3)].\n\nMoreover, the performance analysis across MedMNIST datasets indicates that strategies like VAAL, when not incorporating label diversity, show lower AUC scores compared to when label diversity is enforced [![VAAL shows lower AUC without label diversity](image2)]. This suggests that the inherent bias in VAAL's selection process leads to poorer performance and robustness, especially in low-budget regimes where class coverage is crucial [2].\n\nIn summary, VAAL and similar active querying strategies that exhibit significant selection bias towards specific classes generally yield the worst label diversity across all datasets. This bias results in poor class coverage and performance, particularly in imbalanced datasets, highlighting the importance of enforcing label diversity in active learning strategies.\n\n**Answer**: VAAL and similar biased querying strategies generally yield the worst label"}

This is evident in the line graphs for these datasets, where \\( S_{wp} \\) (blue line) initially occupies a significant proportion before gradually decaying, while \\( S_{pq} \\) (orange line) becomes dominant in deeper layers [10]. The graph for AGNews shows \\( S_{pq} \\) reaching a stable value early on, but in SST-2, \\( S_{pq} \\) increases significantly as the layer number increases, indicating its growing dominance in deeper layers [5][10].

Initially, the user's input is processed by a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) utterance encoder, which converts the natural language input into a continuous vector representation [2]. This encoding captures the semantic meaning of the user's utterance, enabling the system to understand the request effectively. \n\nThe encoded user utterance, along with the previous system action, is then fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state [3]. This dialogue state is crucial as it accumulates evidence from the sequence of dialogue turns, allowing the system to track the user's goals and maintain context throughout the conversation [10]. The dialogue state tracker updates its estimation of the user's goals, represented by slot-value pairs, and generates a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot [10].\n\nOnce the dialogue state is updated, the system queries an external knowledge base (KB) using a symbolic query formulated from the state tracking outputs [7]. This query retrieves relevant information, which is encoded and fed into the policy network [5]. The policy network, a deep neural network, takes inputs from the dialogue-level LSTM state, slot value logits, and the encoding of the query results to determine the next system action [12]. This action is in the form of a dialogue act, such as \"request(time)\" or \"confirm(date)\", which is conditioned on the dialogue state, estimated user goals, and query results [5].\n\nThe emitted system action is then used by a natural language generator (NLG) to produce a final response in natural language format [6]. The NLG employs a template-based approach, where delexicalised tokens in the template are replaced by values from the estimated user goals or KB entities, depending on the system action [6]. For example, if the system action is \"request(time)\", the NLG might generate a response like \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" [6].\n\nThis end-to-end process ensures that the system's response is contextually relevant and aligned with the user's request, leveraging both the dialogue state and external information from the knowledge base. The entire system, including the utterance encoder, dialogue state tracker, and policy network, is fully differentiable and can be trained end-to-end, optimizing performance across all components [4].\n\n![The system uses a hierarchical LSTM network to encode the dialogue and generate responses based on the dialogue state and query results](image3)  \n![The"}

Additionally, the ablation study in [1] confirms that transformer components, including positional encodings, significantly contribute to object detection performance.\n\nVisually, ![image3](image3) provides a detailed comparison of various positional encoding configurations. The table shows that the baseline configuration, which uses fixed sine positional encodings at every attention layer in both encoder and decoder, achieves the highest AP and AP₅₀ scores. This aligns with the textual evidence that not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant AP drop, underscoring their importance. The table also highlights that learned output positional encodings are consistently used across configurations, reinforcing their role in the model's performance.\n\nRegarding loss components, [7] emphasizes the role of attention mechanisms in modeling relations between feature representations, which is critical for detection accuracy. The text in [9] discusses the extension of DETR to panoptic segmentation, where the global reasoning from encoder attention contributes to strong performance on \"stuff\" classes, though there is a deficit in mask AP for \"thing\" classes. This suggests that the loss configuration, particularly the set-based loss, plays a role in balancing detection and segmentation tasks.\n\n![image7](image7) illustrates the effect of different loss components, such as `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU`, on AP metrics. The table shows that combining `class`, `ℓ₁`, and `GIoU` yields the highest AP (40.6), indicating that these loss components work synergistically to improve detection accuracy. The bold values for APS and APL in the third row further demonstrate that this combination is particularly effective for small and large objects, enhancing overall performance.\n\nIn summary, both positional encodings and loss components are integral to the DETR-DC5 model's AP.

The analysis of attention distributions and confusion matrices provides a deeper understanding of how these models process information and make predictions.\n\nFirst, the plots in ![The performance metrics $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$ and $R_{l}$ increase with deeper layers in GPT2-XL and GPT-J](image1) demonstrate that both models exhibit improved performance metrics as the layers deepen. For GPT2-XL, $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$ reaches around 0.85 in deeper layers, while for GPT-J, it approaches 0.9. This indicates that deeper layers play a crucial role in aggregating task-relevant information, particularly around label words, which are pivotal for final predictions [3]. The increasing $R_{l}$ values further support the hypothesis that deep layers contribute significantly to the model's final output, validating the importance of label words as anchors in ICL [1].\n\nThe confusion matrices in ![The confusion matrix visualizes classification results for categories like Abbreviation, Entity, Description, Person, Location, and Number](image5) and ![The confusion matrix highlights strengths and weaknesses in classification performance across different categories](image8) offer insights into the models' classification accuracies. These matrices show that certain categories, such as \"Description-Entity\" and \"Entity-Abbreviation,\" are more prone to confusion, as indicated by the off-diagonal values. The high correlation between predicted and actual confusion scores suggests that label confusion arises when label anchors are similar, aligning with the hypothesis that label words serve as anchors for information aggregation [6][12]. This analysis framework helps diagnose ICL errors by identifying categories with similar label representations, which can lead to misclassifications.\n\nAdditionally, the table in ![The table compares performance of different methods across datasets, showing Anchor Re-weighting outperforms Vanilla ICL](image6) highlights the effectiveness of the anchor re-weighting method.

This suggests they are safer in generating responses, particularly in multi-turn conversations where other models like Falcon struggle [2]. Additionally, ![Llama 2-Chat models generally have lower violation percentages](image1) reinforces this finding, showing that Llama 2-Chat models maintain a competitive edge in safety benchmarks.\n\nThe training processes contributing to these safety features involve several key steps. Initially, Llama 2 undergoes pretraining with a robust data mix and increased context length, as depicted in ![the comparison between LLaMA 1 and LLaMA 2](image3). This pretraining phase lays the foundation for the model's capabilities. Subsequently, supervised fine-tuning is applied to create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat, followed by the integration of human feedback to develop safety and helpfulness reward models. ![The training process of Llama 2-Chat](image6) illustrates this iterative process, where reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is employed using techniques like rejection sampling and proximal policy optimization (PPO). This iterative refinement ensures that the model learns to align with human preferences for safety and helpfulness, reducing unsafe responses over time [3].\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of safety-specific data during RLHF training enhances the model's ability to refuse offensive content and behave conservatively around sensitive topics [3].

As more knowledge elements are removed, precision increases from around 14 to 26, while recall remains relatively stable at about 15, and the F1-Score shows a moderate increase from 14 to 18. This suggests that models can identify absent knowledge to a limited extent, as precision improves with more missing knowledge, indicating better localization of absent knowledge. However, recall remains low, highlighting the challenge of covering all required knowledge when it is absent [10]. \n\nIn the table from image2, the metrics for citation quality also reflect this trend. With zero knowledge elements removed (gold), precision is 30.1, recall is 57.1, and F1-Score is 39.4. As knowledge elements are removed, precision decreases sharply (e.g., 16.3 when three elements are removed), while recall drops significantly (e.g., 20.4 when three elements are removed). This demonstrates that the absence of knowledge severely affects the models' ability to generate accurate citations, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive knowledge coverage [9].\n\nThe diagram in image3 further clarifies the calculation of precision and recall. When knowledge elements are absent, the model's output may include irrelevant or missing citations, leading to lower recall and precision. For instance, if the minimum knowledge set includes [k1][k2][k3][k4][k5], but the model output only hits [k1][k2], recall is 0.4, indicating incomplete coverage of required knowledge. This aligns with the findings that models struggle to maintain high recall when knowledge is absent [3].\n\nThe retrieval analysis in image7 shows that as retrieval accuracy decreases, precision, recall, and F1-Score all decline, with precision being the most affected. This underscores the critical role of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts. When retrieval accuracy is high (e.g., 80), correctness remains robust, but recall drops sharply, suggesting that models can filter out incorrect knowledge but struggle to retrieve all necessary information [12].\n\nOverall, these changes imply that while models can partially identify absent knowledge, their ability to handle it is limited.

However, while post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts (resulting in 0% LI), it may severely affect the quality of the whole generation due to random selection and the size of the candidate set [1].

The analysis reveals that techniques such as adding positive or negative elements, or removing negatives, influence model performance differently depending on the dataset's balance and the task's nature.\n\nFirstly, the addition of positive elements (+positive) tends to improve performance, as it creates a more balanced dataset, which aligns with expectations since balanced datasets mitigate the bias towards the majority class [1]. This is evident in the results where +positive outperforms the original dataset, as seen in the performance metrics [image2]. Conversely, adding negative elements (+negative) leads to underperformance, likely due to the increased imbalance and the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples, which dominate training and hinder the model's ability to distinguish between hard negatives and positives [7]. The removal of negative elements (-negative) also results in inferior performance, despite creating a balanced dataset, because it reduces the number of training examples, limiting the model's learning capacity [1].\n\nIn sentiment analysis tasks, such as those evaluated on SST-2 and SST-5, the cross-entropy (CE) objective with BERT (BERT+CE) achieves the highest accuracy, indicating that dice loss (DL) and dynamic soft dice loss (DSC) are less effective for accuracy-oriented tasks [2][6]. This is supported by the accuracy results where BERT+CE outperforms BERT+DL and BERT+DSC [image6]. However, for tasks where F1 score is a better metric, such as NER, the DSC loss consistently outperforms other methods, including focal loss (FL) and dice loss, by addressing the dominating influence of easy-negative examples through a dynamic weight adjusting strategy [8][9]. This is demonstrated in the NER tasks on Chinese MSRA and Chinese OntoNotes 4.0, where BERT-MRC+DSC achieves the highest F1 scores [image1][image7].\n\nThe effect of data imbalance is further explored using synthetic training sets with varying positive-negative ratios. The results show that DSC loss performs best on more imbalanced datasets, as it effectively handles the imbalance by emphasizing hard-negative examples [9][image3]. This is consistent with the findings that DSC loss achieves minor improvements on balanced datasets but significant gains on imbalanced ones [9].\n\nAdditionally, the hyperparameters in the Tversky index (TI), such as \\"}

The original training set had an imbalance with 37% positive and 63% negative examples [12]. To address this, two augmentation strategies were employed: positive augmentation (+positive) and negative augmentation (+negative). The +positive augmentation created a balanced dataset with 50% positive and 50% negative examples, while the +negative augmentation resulted in a more imbalanced dataset with 21% positive and 79% negative examples [1, 7]. \n\nThe results from Table 8 [4] indicate that the +positive augmentation outperformed the original dataset, aligning with expectations as it balanced the data. However, the +negative augmentation underperformed, likely due to increased imbalance. The -negative augmentation, which reduced negative examples to balance the dataset, also underperformed because it decreased the total number of training examples, leading to inferior results [4].\n\nWhen evaluating the impact of different loss functions, the DSC loss consistently outperformed others across datasets.

For instance, the table in image1 highlights the frequency of categories such as spatial relations, conjunctions, temporal coordination, trajectory constraints, co-reference, and comparatives in the LANI and CHAI datasets. The higher occurrence of trajectory constraints in LANI (94 occurrences) compared to CHAI (0 occurrences) suggests that instructions with trajectory constraints may pose a greater challenge for goal prediction, as these constraints add complexity to the navigation task [1]. The statistical analysis in image8 further supports this, showing that temporal coordination and co-reference have statistically significant differences between present and absent groups, indicating their influence on goal prediction accuracy [8].\n\nOur approach addresses these challenges by explicitly separating goal prediction from action generation, using a language-conditioned image-to-image architecture (LING UNET) to predict goals in the agent's observation space [9]. This method avoids the need for manually designed ontologies, making the goal representation interpretable. However, the approach faces limitations, such as cascading errors and difficulty in handling intermediate trajectory constraints, which are common in the data [4]. Despite these challenges, our approach outperforms previous methods like Janner et al. (2018) in goal prediction, as shown in image6, where it achieves lower distance and higher accuracy across both LANI and CHAI datasets [6].\n\nWhen comparing our approach to human performance, the histogram in image2 reveals that while both humans and our approach achieve high ratings (4 and 5) on the Likert scale for LANI, our approach slightly outperforms humans in the highest rating category. This suggests that our model can effectively follow instructions, though the gap to human-level performance remains, particularly in complex tasks like CHAI, where inherent ambiguities and planning complexity persist [10]. The evaluation metrics in image5 and image6 further demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results, especially with oracle goals, highlighting the importance of accurate goal prediction for successful instruction execution [5].\n\nIn summary, linguistic categories like temporal coordination and co-reference significantly affect goal prediction error, and while our approach shows strong performance, especially in goal prediction, it still lags behind human performance in handling complex constraints and execution nuances. ![Our approach outperforms previous methods in goal prediction](image6) and ![our approach slightly outperforms humans in high Likert ratings](image2), but challenges remain in fully bridging the gap to human-level execution."}

For instance, BERT_LARGE shows notably high scores on tasks like CoLA, QNLI, and RTE, as evidenced by the data in image5, which highlights BERT_LARGE's dominance in these areas. This suggests that BERT's architecture, which captures both left and right context through a transformer encoder, is highly effective for tasks requiring deep contextual understanding [8].\n\nIn contrast, CNN models, such as CNN Large, perform well but generally do not surpass BERT's performance. Image5 shows that while CNN Large improves upon CNN Base, especially on SST-2 and MRPC, it still lags behind BERT_LARGE. The CNN models' performance is also compared to OpenAI GPT, with CNN Large showing better results on certain tasks like QNLI and RTE, indicating that increasing model size and complexity can enhance performance, but not to the extent of BERT [3].\n\nThe comparison also reveals that fine-tuning plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance. Image4 and image8 both illustrate that fine-tuning the CNN Large model leads to higher F1 scores on NER tasks, outperforming even BERT_BASE and BERT_LARGE in some cases.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the original dataset, which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance was largely due to the exploitation of these cues, particularly the presence of cue words like \"not\" in the warrants [2]. When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance dropped to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median scores around 50% [6]. This reduction indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully removes the cues, forcing models to rely on actual argument comprehension rather than statistical shortcuts.\n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset shows a significant drop to random accuracy](image3) demonstrates that BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset aligns closely with random guessing, confirming that the model's initial success was not due to understanding argument structures but rather exploiting dataset biases. The adversarial setup involves negating claims and inverting labels, which mirrors the distribution of cues across both labels, thereby eliminating the signal that models previously relied on [8][9]. This approach ensures a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension, as models must now genuinely understand the arguments rather than depend on superficial patterns.\n\nThe adversarial dataset's effectiveness is further highlighted by the consistent random performance across different BERT configurations, as shown in ![BERT's adversarial test performance metrics](image3). This consistency underscores the necessity of adopting the adversarial dataset as a standard for future research, as it provides a more accurate assessment of a model's true capabilities in argument comprehension [3][8]. The results align with the conclusion that BERT has not genuinely learned to comprehend arguments but has instead exploited dataset-specific cues [10].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's initial high performance on the ARCT dataset was misleading, driven by statistical exploitation rather than comprehension. The adversarial dataset serves as a more reliable benchmark, emphasizing the need for models to develop genuine understanding to achieve meaningful performance improvements.\n\nThe adversarial data setup reduces BERT's performance to random accuracy, indicating that it relies on spurious cues rather than true argument comprehension."}

According to the text, COMET is designed to generate novel and diverse commonsense knowledge tuples, with empirical results showing that it frequently produces novel knowledge that human evaluators deem correct [4]. Specifically, COMET achieves a precision of 91.7% for ConceptNet relations, which approaches human performance [7][8]. This high precision is supported by the low perplexity scores and high classifier scores, indicating the model's confidence and correctness in its predictions [11].\n\n![COMET's performance metrics](image5) illustrate that the COMET model outperforms other models, including LSTM and CKBG, across various metrics such as perplexity, score, and human-like performance.

This suggests that COMET is highly effective in generating accurate and plausible commonsense knowledge.\n\n![Novelty and classifier accuracy](image6) further demonstrates COMET's ability to generate novel tuples. The graph shows that as the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, but the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100% [image6]. This indicates that even when generating novel knowledge, COMET maintains high accuracy, reinforcing its capability to produce both novel and correct tuples.\n\nAdditionally, the ablation studies highlight the importance of pre-training on a large-scale corpus, as the COMET model with pre-training outperforms the version without pre-training (COMET - pretrain) in terms of perplexity and BLEU scores [image2].

For closed vocabulary models, which treat out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words identically, the pass-through strategy tends to have higher sensitivity due to its unique handling of each OOV character combination [6]. However, the neutral backoff strategy, which maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, reduces sensitivity significantly by minimizing unique outputs, thus enhancing robustness [3]. This is evident in the scatter plot where the neutral strategy (green bubble) shows lower sensitivity compared to the pass-through (blue bubble) in the word-only models plot ![Sensitivity and WER for word-only models](image3).\n\nIn contrast, open vocabulary models, such as char-only, word+char, and word-piece models, consider every unique character combination differently, leading to higher sensitivity when using pass-through strategies. The scatter plot for char-only models highlights this with a large blue bubble (pass-through) showing high sensitivity and moderate WER, whereas the neutral strategy (green bubble) maintains lower sensitivity while achieving a similar WER [8]. This aligns with the observation that open vocabulary models benefit less from the neutral backoff in terms of WER reduction but gain robustness through reduced sensitivity [5].\n\nThe table comparing different models under various attacks further illustrates these differences. For open vocabulary models, the pass-through strategy shows higher performance under 1-char attacks (bold 84.5 for BERT + Pass-through) but suffers from increased sensitivity, as seen in the scatter plot with a large blue bubble [4][image4]. The neutral strategy, while maintaining lower sensitivity, achieves comparable WER but slightly lower performance under no attacks, as shown in the table where BERT + Neutral has a lower \"No Attack\" score (84.0) compared to BERT + Pass-through (89.0) [image4].\n\nOverall, closed vocabulary models with neutral backoff exhibit lower sensitivity and moderate WER, making them more robust against attacks. Open vocabulary models, despite lower WER with background backoff, face higher sensitivity, emphasizing the trade-off between error rate and sensitivity. The neutral strategy consistently offers a balance by reducing sensitivity, crucial for robustness, even if it slightly compromises WER in some cases [12].\n\nThe sensitivity and word error rate differ between closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies, with closed models benefiting from lower sensitivity through neutral backoff and open"}

The objective is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, enhancing predictability of financial results [4].\n\nThe impact of exchange rate changes on Novo Nordisk’s operating profit was estimated by management, with a hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in key currencies versus EUR and DKK affecting the income statement and other comprehensive income. For 2020, a 5% increase would result in a negative impact of (1,893) million DKK on other comprehensive income and a positive impact of 299 million DKK on the income statement, leading to a total effect of (1,594) million DKK. Conversely, a 5% decrease would positively impact other comprehensive income by 1,893 million DKK and negatively affect the income statement by (299) million DKK, resulting in a total effect of 1,594 million DKK [6]. This demonstrates the sensitivity of Novo Nordisk’s financial results to exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe table in image6 shows these hypothetical impacts, highlighting how exchange rate changes can significantly affect both other comprehensive income and the income statement. The data indicates that while the income statement may see some positive effects from favorable exchange rate movements, the overall impact on comprehensive income is substantial, reflecting the high level of foreign exchange risk [![Foreign exchange risk impacts comprehensive income and income statement](image6)].\n\nAdditionally, Novo Nordisk’s credit risk is considered low, with maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties at DKK 15,089 million in 2020, down from DKK 15,663 million in 2019 [10]. The company manages this risk by only engaging with counterparties with satisfactory long-term credit ratings and diversifying credit lines [2]. The table in image5 provides a breakdown of"}

In 2018, the total AUM was $471 billion, which grew to $500 billion in 2019 and further to $657 billion in 2020 [8]. This substantial growth in AUM is primarily attributed to strong investment performance and positive net flows, contributing to a 15% increase in asset management revenues in 2020 compared to the prior year [2]. The increase in AUM across various categories, such as Equity, Fixed Income, and Liquidity, indicates a robust expansion in the firm's investment base.\n\nHowever, alongside the growth in AUM, the fee rates across most categories have generally decreased over the same period. For instance, the fee rate for Fixed Income dropped from 33 basis points (bps) in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020, and the Alternative/Other category saw a reduction from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020 [5]. The Total AUM fee rate also decreased from 47 bps in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020 [5]. The Equity category remained constant at 76 bps, but this stability contrasts with the declining trends in other areas.\n\nThe combination of increasing AUM and decreasing fee rates suggests that while the firm is managing more assets, it is doing so at slightly lower rates. This dynamic could have mixed impacts on revenues. On one hand, the higher volume of assets can offset the lower fee rates, potentially maintaining or even increasing overall revenue if the growth in AUM is substantial enough. On the other hand, continued fee rate reductions might pressure margins if the growth in AUM slows or if competitive pressures force further rate cuts.\n\n![The table shows a general trend of decreasing fee rates over the three-year period across these categories, with the exception of the Equity category, which remains constant.](image5) The decreasing fee rates reflect competitive pressures and possibly a strategic move to attract and retain clients in a crowded market.

The increase in operating lease liabilities can be attributed to several factors. \n\nFirstly, the company's overall financial dynamics, including acquisitions and changes in lease terms, likely played a role. The significant increase in the Life Sciences segment's balance due to acquisitions in 2020, as shown in image4, suggests that new leases may have been acquired or entered into as part of these transactions. Additionally, the increase in property, plant, and equipment, particularly in buildings and machinery, as depicted in image5, indicates expansion and potential new lease commitments. \n\nFurthermore, the weighted average discount rate decreased from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020, which could have affected the present value of future lease payments, contributing to higher liabilities [image8]. The consistent weighted average remaining lease term of 7 years for both years suggests that the duration of leases remained stable, but the lower discount rate would result in higher recorded liabilities. \n\nIn summary, the rise in operating lease liabilities from 2019 to 2020 was primarily influenced by strategic acquisitions, asset expansion, and a lower discount rate applied to lease obligations.\n\nThe company's operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, influenced by acquisitions, asset expansion, and a lower discount rate. ![Operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020](image8)"}

This growth was driven by a 64% increase in QCT revenues, primarily due to higher demand for 5G products and a recovery from COVID-19 impacts [10]. Additionally, QTL revenues increased by 26% due to higher sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products [10].\n\n2. **Cost Management**: While costs and expenses also increased, the growth in revenues outpaced these expenses, leading to higher operating income [6]. The table in image6 shows that operating income rose significantly, contributing to the higher net income.\n\n3. **Investment Gains**: QSI earnings before income taxes increased by $927 million, largely due to higher net gains on investments [10].

In 2019, ExxonMobil's total taxes amounted to $38.5 billion, with income tax expense at $5.3 billion and an effective tax rate of 34% [8]. By 2020, total taxes decreased to $22.8 billion, with income tax expense turning into a benefit of $5.6 billion, driven by asset impairments, and the effective tax rate dropped to 17% [9]. This reduction in taxes was largely due to changes in the mix of results across jurisdictions with varying tax rates and asset impairments, as highlighted in the financial data [![Income taxes decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image1)].\n\nCapital expenditures (Capex) also saw a notable decline. In 2019, ExxonMobil's Capex was $21.4 billion, but it decreased to $16–19 billion in 2020, reflecting lower global project spending and a focus on cost reductions amid challenging industry conditions [12]. The decrease in Capex was evident in both Downstream and Chemical sectors, with Downstream Capex dropping by $0.2 billion and Chemical Capex by $0.5 billion [10]. This strategic reduction aimed to strengthen liquidity, as the company issued $23 billion in long-term debt and implemented cost-cutting measures to manage lower earnings and cash flow [2].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes were multifaceted. The reduced tax burden and lower Capex helped conserve cash and improve liquidity, crucial during a period of lower realized prices and operational challenges [2]. However, the significant drop in Upstream earnings, from $14,442 million in 2019 to a loss of $20,030 million in 2020, underscored the impact of lower crude oil and natural gas prices [![Upstream losses in 2020 were substantial compared to 2019](image4)]. Despite these measures, the company's debt to capital ratio increased from 19.1% in 2019 to 29.2% in 2020, indicating heightened leverage [![Debt to capital ratio increased from 201"}

In 2021, Berkshire spent $27.1 billion on repurchases, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing shareholder value while maintaining a cash reserve of at least $30 billion [12]. This program underscores Berkshire's focus on financial strength and liquidity, as highlighted in [11].\n\nExamining net earnings by segment, the insurance underwriting segment saw growth, with after-tax earnings rising from $325 million in 2019 to $728 million in 2021 [9]. This increase is partly due to higher premiums and reduced incurred losses, though offset by factors like the GEICO Giveback program and higher auto claims frequencies [9]. The insurance investment income, however, decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting lower interest rates [6]. The railroad segment's earnings rose 16.1% in 2021, driven by higher freight volumes and productivity, despite increased fuel costs [10]. Utilities and energy also showed a 13.1% increase in 2021, benefiting from acquisitions and renewable energy tax benefits [10].\n\nManufacturing, service, and retailing businesses experienced a 34.0% earnings surge in 2021 over 2020, recovering from pandemic-related declines [7].

In 2020, total company-operated sales and franchised revenues decreased by 10% (10% in constant currencies), primarily due to declines in the International Operated Markets segment as a result of COVID-19 [5]. The U.S. market saw a 2% decrease in total revenues, while the International Operated Markets experienced a 17% decline [image3]. These declines were driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [2]. \n\nThe impact on earnings per share is evident in the GAAP earnings per share-diluted, which decreased by 20% from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020 [image1].

The net income for 2021 was notably higher due to several factors. U.S. upstream operations reported earnings of $7.3 billion, a stark contrast to the $1.6 billion loss in 2020, driven by higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and higher sales volumes [4]. Similarly, international upstream earnings surged to $8.5 billion in 2021 from a loss of $825 million in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion and the absence of impairments and write-offs [7]. U.S. downstream also improved, reporting earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020, largely due to higher margins and sales volumes [12]. International downstream, however, saw a decrease in earnings from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, mainly due to lower margins and higher operating expenses, partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects [2].\n\nThe return on stockholders' equity, a measure of profitability relative to shareholders' investment, likely improved in 2021 given the substantial increase in net income. This is supported by the overall financial highlights indicating a strong recovery in earnings across key segments [5].

This decline was primarily due to lower interest income, which fell from $9,414 million in 2019 to $7,391 million in 2021, partially offset by a significant reduction in interest expense from $1,731 million in 2019 to $717 million in 2021. The decrease in interest income was attributed to lower average revolving card member loan balances, while the reduction in interest expense was driven by a lower cost of funds [12].

For the U.S. defined benefit plans, fixed income securities and cash equivalents accounted for 65% of the assets, while equity securities made up 35% [image1]. This allocation reflects a balanced approach, aiming to mitigate risks through a mix of fixed income and equity investments. \n\nOn the other hand, non-U.S. defined benefit plans had a higher allocation to fixed income securities and cash equivalents at 73%, with equity securities comprising 27% [image1]. This suggests a more conservative strategy, likely influenced by the varying economic environments and market conditions in different countries, as mentioned in the text [3]. The higher proportion of fixed income securities in non-U.S. plans aligns with the strategy to better match the interest rate sensitivity of plan assets and liabilities, as detailed in the investment policy [12].\n\nThe asset allocation percentages for non-U.S. defined benefit plans also indicate a broader range, with fixed income securities ranging from 60% to 100% and equity securities from 0% to 40% [image7]. This variability underscores the tailored approach to each country's market conditions, emphasizing fixed income investments to align with liability characteristics and reduce exposure to market volatility.\n\nIn summary, the U.S. defined benefit plans had a more balanced allocation between fixed income and equity securities in 2019, while non-U.S. plans leaned more heavily on fixed income securities, reflecting a conservative strategy adapted to diverse economic environments.\n\nThe assets composition of U.S. defined benefit plans in 2019 was 65% fixed income securities and 35% equity securities, whereas non-U.S. defined benefit plans had 73% fixed income securities and 27% equity securities. ![U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans' asset allocation in 2019](image1)"}

This trend is evident in the breakdown of the current and deferred provisions. The current provision, which includes federal, state, and foreign taxes, increased significantly from $3,520 million in 2018 to $4,981 million in 2020 [image3]. This increase is primarily driven by higher federal and foreign tax provisions, reflecting changes in taxable income and tax rates across jurisdictions.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in shaping these trends. The net deferred income tax liabilities have grown from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020 [image8]. This increase in net liabilities indicates a larger mismatch between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, primarily due to higher intangible assets and lease right-of-use assets. The deferred tax assets, such as accrued expenses and lease liabilities, have also increased, but the growth in liabilities outpaces the assets, contributing to the overall rise in the total provision for income taxes.\n\nThe deferred tax provision, which reflects changes in deferred assets and liabilities, was a benefit of $(8) million in 2020, compared to a provision of $230 million in 2019 [image3]. This shift suggests that the company recognized more deferred tax benefits in 2020, likely from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences. However, the overall increase in the total provision is still significant due to the substantial rise in current taxes.\n\nIn summary, the upward trend in income tax provisions from 2018 to 2020 is largely influenced by higher current tax liabilities, while deferred tax assets and liabilities contribute by reflecting ongoing changes in the company's financial and tax positions. ![The total provision for income taxes increased from $3,562 million in 2018 to $4,973 million in 2020](image3) and ![net deferred income tax liabilities grew from $(2,993) million in 2019 to $(3,367) million in 2020"}

This indicates a significant growth in both current and noncurrent liabilities over the year. The increase in current liabilities can be attributed to higher amounts in compensation and benefits, taxes, income, and other expenses, deferred revenue, and cross-currency swap derivative liabilities. Noncurrent liabilities also saw increases in compensation and benefits, taxes, income, and other expenses, and operating lease liabilities. ![Current and noncurrent liabilities increased significantly from 2019 to 2020](image3)\n\nIn terms of total debt, the company's total debt was approximately $21.7 billion in 2019 and $21.2 billion in 2020, showing a slight decrease. However, the composition of debt changed, with more borrowings classified as long-term due to the company's intent and ability to refinance certain obligations using the Five-Year Facility. This facility provided liquidity support and allowed the company to manage its debt structure effectively. ![Total debt slightly decreased from 2019 to 2020](image2)\n\nThe changes in liabilities and debt reflect the company's strategic financial management, including refinancing and leveraging facilities like the Five-Year Facility to maintain flexibility and support its commercial paper programs.

This increase is primarily attributed to higher earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, mainly due to the conversion of employee share-based awards [3]. In contrast, the net discrete tax benefits in 2019 were significantly higher at $475 million, primarily from remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits from employee share-based awards [8]. This reduction in net discrete tax benefits contributed to the higher effective tax rate in 2020.\n\nRegarding compensation expenses, the total recognized compensation expense increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020 [1]. This rise was driven by increases in discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by lower carried interest compensation [1]. The image showing compensation expenses across categories highlights a notable increase in Wealth Management compensation from $760 million in 2019 to $1,000 million in 2020, reflecting these changes ![Compensation expenses increased in Wealth Management](image1).\n\nThe relationship between the tax rate changes and compensation expenses is evident in the impact of employee share-based awards on both metrics. The lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020, despite still being significant, did not offset the higher earnings as effectively as in 2019, leading to a higher effective tax rate. Meanwhile, the increased compensation expenses, particularly in Wealth Management, underscore the firm's higher operational costs and investment in employee incentives, which are partially hedged through financial instruments [7].

This growth aligns with the overall increase in total net revenue from $64,661 million in 2018 to $70,372 million in 2020. The growth in the U.S. market is crucial, as it reflects the company's strong performance in its primary market. Additionally, China showed notable growth from $1,164 million in 2018 to $1,732 million in 2020, indicating expanding opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nTurning to operating profit, image2 provides a detailed view of each division's performance. FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) and PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) are key contributors to operating profit. FLNA's operating profit grew steadily, reflecting strong performance in the food/snack category, which dominates its revenue mix (90% in LatAm and 55% overall for PepsiCo, as shown in image6). PBNA, however, faced challenges, with operating profit growth partially offset by cost increases and COVID-19-related charges [9]. The decline in operating profit margin by 1.0 percentage point in some divisions [7] highlights the impact of increased operating costs and the pandemic.\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, as depicted in image6, offers further context. In regions like Europe, where beverage sales account for 55% of revenue, operating profit changes might be more sensitive to fluctuations in beverage demand. Conversely, in LatAm, where food/snack sales dominate (90%), the stability of food/snack demand could contribute to consistent operating profit performance. The shift in AMESA's beverage percentage from 45% in 2018 to 30% in 2020 suggests a strategic focus on food/snacks, potentially aligning with consumer trends and impacting revenue growth positively.\n\nImage3 highlights specific financial adjustments, such as employee protection costs and inventory write-downs,"}

In 2020, cash flows from financing activities were negative at €-249 million, while in 2021, they surged to €11,839 million [3]. This dramatic shift was primarily driven by the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which involved inflows from borrowings amounting to €10 billion and additional financing of €850 million from the Siemens Group [9]. These inflows were partly offset by repayments of matured loans totaling €730 million and €300 million in cash outflows [9]. The acquisition of Varian also heavily influenced cash outflows from investing activities, which increased from €-1,912 million in 2020 to €-14,140 million in 2021 [6]. This increase was largely due to the payout for the Varian acquisition, along with additional investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment for capacity expansions [6].

This dramatic shift can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, the net income attributable to common stockholders improved markedly. In 2018, the company reported a net loss of $(1,063) million, which turned into a net income of $862 million by 2020 [3]. This improvement was driven by increased revenues across various segments, as evidenced by the growth in total revenues from $21,461 million in 2018 to $31,536 million in 2020 ![Total revenues increased from 2018 to 2020](image1).

In 2018, this loss was $(87) million, but by 2020, it had turned into a gain of $141 million [5]. This change reflects lower activities from new financing fund arrangements and adjustments related to noncontrolling interests.\n\nLastly, the company's stock-based compensation expense, particularly related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award, increased significantly in 2020. While this expense was substantial, it was a non-cash item and did not directly affect the net income.

In 2020, the Upstream segment reported a loss of $2,433 million, primarily due to a substantial loss in the United States amounting to $1,608 million and an international loss of $825 million. However, in 2021, the Upstream segment achieved a strong turnaround, earning $15,818 million, with the United States contributing $7,319 million and international operations adding $8,499 million. This dramatic shift is largely attributed to the recovery in crude oil prices and increased production efficiency [6][image6].\n\nOn the other hand, the Downstream segment also showed a positive trend but with less volatility. In 2020, the Downstream segment reported a modest earnings figure of $47 million, with the United States experiencing a loss of $571 million offset by international earnings of $618 million. In 2021, the Downstream segment's earnings surged to $2,914 million, driven by a significant increase in U.S. earnings to $2,389 million and international earnings of $525 million. This improvement reflects better margins and operational efficiencies in refining and marketing activities [5][image6].\n\nRegarding asset values, the Upstream segment's total assets decreased slightly from $191,309 million in 2020 to $184,412 million in 2021. This reduction is mainly due to a decrease in international assets from $144,476 million to $138,157 million, while U.S. assets remained relatively stable [8][image8].

In 2020, the operating income under IFRS was $9,172 million, and after adjustments, the core operating income increased to $13,645 million. The adjustments included amortization of intangible assets and impairments, which were key factors in this increase. Specifically, the amortization of intangible assets contributed positively to the core results by reducing expenses, while impairments were adjusted to reflect their impact on the financials more accurately [7]. The table for 2020 shows that amortization adjustments added $366 million to the gross profit and $366 million to the operating income, while impairments added $127 million to the gross profit and $255 million to the operating income, leading to a substantial rise in core operating income [image3]. \n\nFor 2021, the operating income under IFRS was $10,688 million, and the core operating income was adjusted to $15,215 million.

In 2020, the derivative financial instruments were valued at DKK 1,365 million, a significant increase from DKK 734 million in 2019. This increase is reflected in the financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement, which also stood at DKK 1,365 million in 2020, compared to DKK 734 million in 2019 [3]. The rise in derivative financial instruments suggests a higher exposure to financial market risks, which could impact the income statement through gains or losses recognized in financial income or expenses [8][9].\n\nThe fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted market prices for active markets, and if no active market exists, the most recent transaction price is used [2][10]. This valuation method ensures that the financial statements reflect the current market conditions, affecting the reported financial position and performance. The increase in derivative financial instruments indicates a potential for greater volatility in financial results due to changes in market conditions.\n\nTurning to cash flow changes, the table in image4 shows a significant decrease in cash flow from operating activities due to changes in working capital. In 2020, the cash flow change in working capital was DKK (4,353) million, compared to DKK (3,388) million in 2019. This decline is largely driven by increases in inventories, trade receivables, and other receivables and prepayments, which tied up more cash in 2020 [12]. The negative change in working capital indicates that more cash was used to fund operations, impacting the liquidity position of the company.\n\nThe restricted cash balance also increased from DKK 509 million in 2019 to DKK 653 million in 2020, reflecting challenges in remitting funds from subsidiaries with scarce currency availability [11]. This further constrains the company's cash flow flexibility.\n\nThe impact on the financial statements is twofold: the increased derivative financial instruments may lead to higher volatility in financial income or expenses, while the negative cash flow changes suggest tighter liquidity and operational cash constraints. These elements collectively affect the company's reported financial health, influencing investor perceptions and financial decision-making.\n\nIn summary, the increase in derivative financial instruments"}

The SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points [9]. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 17 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales.

In 2020, net income further rose to $5,185,313, and other comprehensive income (loss) net of tax turned positive at $278,740, contributing to a comprehensive income of $5,472,296 [6].\n\nThe components of other comprehensive income varied significantly over these years. Foreign currency translation losses were substantial in 2018 and 2019 but turned into a gain of $197,696 in 2020. Defined benefit plans showed a loss in 2019 but improved to a gain in 2020. Cash flow hedges and investments also fluctuated, with gains in 2020 offsetting previous losses [6]. These changes in other comprehensive income directly influenced the comprehensive income figures, which in turn affected the total shareholders' equity.\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity is evident in the detailed breakdown of equity changes. For instance, net income increases retained earnings, while other comprehensive income adjustments affect accumulated other comprehensive loss. In 2020, net income of $5,107,839 and other comprehensive income of $278,740 contributed to an increase in total shareholders' equity, which ended at $17,499,173. Purchases of Class A shares and dividends reduced equity, but share-based compensation and issuances for employee programs added to it [3][image3].

This increase is primarily driven by higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which grew from $79.854 billion in 2020 to $86.664 billion in 2021, and an increase in notes payable and other borrowings under the \"Insurance and Other\" segment from $41.522 billion to $39.272 billion [4]. Additionally, the \"Railroad, Utilities, and Energy\" segment saw a slight decrease in liabilities, but the overall increase in liabilities is largely due to the insurance segment's obligations [4].\n\nConcurrently, shareholders' equity saw a substantial increase from $200.607 billion in 2020 to $242.346 billion in 2021, a growth of about $41.739 billion [4]. This significant rise in equity is largely attributed to the strong net earnings and comprehensive income during the year. Net earnings for 2021 were $90.807 billion, a substantial increase from $43.253 billion in 2020 [2]. Comprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income, also rose from $44.272 billion in 2020 to $91.041 billion in 2021 [2].

The 2030 milestones include reducing CO₂ emissions by 25% or more compared to 2013 levels and achieving a 35% reduction in emissions from global plants.

This indicates a slight rise in overall depreciation and impairment expenses over the year. Specifically, the impairment losses recognized in 2020 were DKK 350 million, a significant decrease from DKK 982 million in 2019 [10]. This reduction in impairment losses suggests that fewer assets were deemed unrecoverable in 2020 compared to the previous year.\n\nFor intangible assets, the impairment tests conducted in 2020 and 2019 were based on management’s projections and the net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products [6]. The impairment loss in 2020 was primarily related to patents and licenses, amounting to DKK 350 million, which was lower than the DKK 982 million recognized in 2019 [10]. This decrease reflects a more optimistic outlook or improved recoverability of these assets. Intangible assets not yet available for use, such as patents and licenses, are tested annually for impairment regardless of indicators, and any impairment is measured using discounted projected cash flows [9, 12]. The net carrying amount of intangible assets at the end of 2020 was affected by these impairment losses, reducing their value compared to the beginning of the year.\n\nRegarding property, plant, and equipment, depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets [8]. Image6 shows that for \"Land and buildings\" and \"Other equipment,\" the depreciation for 2020 was DKK 644 million and DKK 320 million, respectively, compared to DKK 564 million and DKK 288 million in 2019.

The company's stock-based compensation expenses, which include costs for stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance stock units (PSUs), have shown a slight decrease over the years. In 2020, the total stock-based expense was $558 million, which reduced to $540 million in 2021 and further to $528 million in 2022 [5]. This decline suggests a controlled approach to stock-based compensation, possibly reflecting adjustments in the number of awards granted or changes in the fair value of the awards. The image showing stock-based expenses and income tax benefits supports this trend, indicating a consistent reduction in expenses from 2020 to 2022 ![Stock-based expenses decreased from 2020 to 2022](image5).\n\nSimultaneously, the net earnings per share (EPS) for Procter & Gamble have shown an upward trend. The basic EPS increased from $5.13 in 2020 to $6.00 in 2022, while the diluted EPS rose from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022 [7]. This improvement in EPS is attributed to an increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, as evidenced by the financial data in the image showing net earnings and shares outstanding ![EPS increased due to higher net earnings and reduced shares](image7). The reduction in shares outstanding could be linked to share repurchases or the vesting of stock options and awards, which aligns with the company's strategy to offset dilutive impacts through discretionary purchases [10].\n\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation expenses alongside rising net earnings per share indicates a positive financial trajectory for Procter & Gamble.

According to the image data, the foreign currency translation adjustments for the year 2020 were not specified, but for 2021, the adjustments amounted to $6 million [image2]. This indicates a minor increase in the adjustments from the unspecified amount in 2020 to $6 million in 2021, reflecting changes in currency values impacting the financial statements.\n\nNext, examining the components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the image data shows that in 2020, the U.S. component was $5,004 million, and the foreign component was $715 million, totaling $5,719 million. In 2021, the U.S. component increased significantly to $8,781 million, while the foreign component rose to $1,493 million, resulting in a total of $10,274 million [image3]. This represents a substantial increase in income before taxes, particularly in the U.S. jurisdiction, which grew by $3,777 million from 2020 to 2021. The foreign component also saw a notable increase of $778 million.\n\nThe effective tax provision and rate further illustrate these changes. In 2020, the total effective tax provision was $521 million with a 9% effective tax rate, while in 2021, it increased to $1,231 million with a 12% effective tax rate [image1]. This increase in the tax provision aligns with the higher income before taxes, particularly in the U.S., and reflects the impact of various tax benefits and provisions, such as the FDII deduction and research and development tax credits, which were significant in both years but had varying effects.\n\nIn summary, the foreign currency translation adjustments saw a small increase from 2020 to 2021, and the components of income before income taxes, especially in the U.S., experienced a substantial rise, contributing to a higher effective tax provision and rate in 2021.\n\nThe changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and components of income before income taxes from 2020 to"}

This increase was largely attributed to the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020, which boosted income from equity method investments by $44 million [5].

This change can be attributed to the completion of major capital projects such as the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco, which reduced capital expenditures from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020 [2]. The decrease in capital spending, combined with no contributions to investments in 2020, resulted in a positive cash flow from investing activities.

In 2021, the financial assumptions led to a loss of €26 million, while in 2020, they resulted in a gain of €72 million. This substantial difference is primarily due to fluctuations in the discount rate, which is a critical component of financial assumptions. The discount rate for 2021 was 1.7%, slightly higher than the 1.5% in 2020, as shown in the financial indicators table ![Discount rate increased slightly in 2021](image6).

In 2019, the foreign income before taxes was $439 million, and the foreign tax provision was a benefit of $407 million, indicating a net positive impact on the company's financials [1]. By 2021, the foreign income before taxes had increased to $1,493 million, while the foreign tax provision shifted to a provision of $518 million, representing a substantial increase in tax expenses [1]. This change suggests that the company's foreign operations have grown, but the tax environment or the company's tax strategy may have also evolved, leading to higher tax liabilities.\n\nThe increase in foreign income before taxes from 2019 to 2021, as shown in ![Foreign income before taxes increased from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021](image1), indicates a significant expansion of the company's international operations. This growth could be due to increased sales, market penetration, or strategic investments in foreign markets. However, the corresponding rise in the foreign tax provision from a benefit to a provision of $518 million highlights the complexity of managing international tax obligations. The company's financial strategy might have shifted to focus more on optimizing tax efficiency in foreign jurisdictions, possibly through restructuring or leveraging tax incentives, as evidenced by the discussion of foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and potential changes in tax rules [1].\n\nThe impact of these changes on the company's financial strategy is multifaceted. The higher foreign income suggests a successful expansion strategy, but the increased tax provision indicates that the company must navigate a more complex tax landscape. The company may need to reassess its tax planning, particularly in light of potential changes in U.S. tax policies affecting FDII and the possibility of customers moving manufacturing operations to the U.S., which could reduce the FDII deduction [1]. Additionally, the company's assertion that certain foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested and the valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets [4][9] suggest ongoing efforts to manage tax liabilities and optimize cash flows.\n\nIn summary, the changes in foreign tax provision and income before taxes reflect a growing international presence but also highlight the need for strategic tax management to mitigate potential adverse effects on financial performance.

Throughout the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $96.8 billion. Additionally, the market impact contributed $11.6 billion. However, the most notable change was the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a reduction of $587.1 billion. This sale significantly impacted the total assets under management, leading to a substantial decrease by the end of the year [4]. The table in image4 highlights these financial movements, showing the impact of the sale and the overall decline in managed assets.\n\nFor available-for-sale securities, the amortized cost, net, decreased from $215,533 million in 2020 to $175,463 million in 2021. The net unrealized gains also dropped from $4,859 million to $1,781 million, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates on the portfolio's valuation [1].

The total assets of the company saw a notable increase, driven by growth in deposits and loans, which are critical components of the balance sheet. According to the selected balance sheet data, total assets increased from 2020 to 2021, indicating a strengthening financial position [image4]. This growth in assets likely supported the company's liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives, as mentioned in the discussion about the available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities portfolios [1]. The ability to manage these portfolios effectively allows Wells Fargo to respond to economic conditions and maintain financial stability.\n\nRegarding WFAM, the assets under management experienced a substantial decline in 2021, primarily due to the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021. The table detailing WFAM AUM shows a significant outflow and a large negative impact from the sale, reducing the total AUM from $508.8 billion at the beginning of 2021 to a much lower end-of-period balance [image8]. This sale was part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on core banking activities, as evidenced by the movement of WFAM from the Wealth and Investment Management segment to Corporate and its eventual divestiture [7][12]. The sale generated net gains of $269 million, contributing to the company's financial results [5]. The reduction in AUM also aligns with the company's decision to reposition its portfolio for capital management purposes, as seen in the transfer of AFS debt securities to HTM debt securities [8].\n\nThe strategic sale of WFAM and the focus on core banking activities suggest a shift towards optimizing capital allocation and enhancing operational efficiency. The increase in total assets, coupled with the divestiture of non-core assets like WFAM, indicates a dual approach: strengthening the balance sheet while divesting non-essential operations to improve overall financial health and focus on primary banking services.\n\nIn summary, the changes in total assets and WFAM AUM from 2020 to 2021 impacted Wells Fargo's financial strategy by enhancing liquidity and risk management capabilities while allowing the company to concentrate on its core banking functions through the sale of non-core businesses. ![The table shows a significant decline in"}

In Germany, the actuarial assumptions are based on Siemens-specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2021 for 2021 and Siemens Bio 2017/2020 for 2020), which incorporate data from the German Siemens population and the Federal Statistical Office. This reflects a tailored approach to demographic projections, ensuring that the assumptions align closely with the local workforce characteristics [5]. In contrast, the United States uses the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions for both years, indicating a standardized approach that may not be as specific to the company's workforce [5].\n\nFinancially, the discount rates, which are crucial for calculating the present value of future benefit obligations, also differ between the two countries. The discount rate for the Euro (relevant to Germany) was 1.0% in 2021 and 0.9% in 2020, while the U.S. dollar discount rate was 2.7% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2020 [![Discount rates for different currencies](image1)]. These rates are determined by yields on high-quality corporate bonds or government bond yields, affecting the valuation of defined benefit obligations. A higher discount rate in the U.S. suggests a potentially lower present value of future obligations compared to Germany, given the lower Euro discount rate.\n\nAdditionally, the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the discount rate is significant. For instance, a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the defined benefit obligation by 271 million euros in 2021 for the Euro and 266 million euros in 2020 for the U.S. dollar [![Effects of discount rate changes](image4)]. This highlights the substantial impact of interest rate fluctuations on pension liabilities in both regions.\n\nFurthermore, actuarial gains and losses due to changes in financial assumptions were more pronounced in 2021 (-26 million euros) compared to 2020 (72 million euros), indicating volatility in the economic environment affecting these plans [![Actuarial gains and losses"}

This change is primarily driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew from $478,417 million to $513,120 million, reflecting higher loan demand and increased originations, particularly in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio [8]. The increase in commercial loans is attributed to higher loan demand and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [8]. In contrast, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million to $382,274 million, mainly due to a reduction in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, influenced by low interest rates and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [8].\n\nRegarding deposits, there was a notable shift in the composition.

However, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, further illustrating the move away from interest-sensitive investments [6].\n\nThe combination of these factors—low interest rates affecting short-term investments and strategic asset reallocation—contributed to the overall decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThe decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to lower interest income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, influenced by low interest rates, while asset allocations shifted towards liquidity and equity diversification. ![Interest and other investment income decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image7) and ![asset allocations"}

By 2020, the net income rose to $556 million, and the comprehensive income attributable to the partnership reached $542 million [3]. This growth reflects a consistent upward trend in financial performance over the three years.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this increase. Firstly, the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019 and Mattox in April 2020 led to higher income from equity method investments, which increased by $44 million in 2020 compared to 2019 [11]. Additionally, the elimination of incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and the conversion of the general partner's 2% economic interest into a non-economic interest on April 1, 2020, simplified the equity structure and reduced the dilution of net income per unit [5]. This restructuring likely enhanced the partnership's financial metrics by removing certain obligations and improving the allocation of income to common unitholders.\n\nThe cash flow statement further illustrates the partnership's strong operational performance, with net cash provided by operating activities increasing from $507 million in 2018 to $650 million in 2020 [image2]. This improvement in cash generation supports the higher net income figures. Moreover, the comprehensive income data shows a reduction in losses related to remeasurements of pension and other postretirement benefits, which contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income [image3].\n\nIn summary, strategic acquisitions, operational efficiency, and structural changes in equity distribution were key drivers behind the rise in net and comprehensive income for the partnership from 2018 to 2020.\n\nThe net income and comprehensive income attributable to the partnership increased from 2018 to 2020 due to strategic acquisitions, operational improvements, and equity restructuring."}

The table in image3 provides financial data across three years: 2020, 2019, and 2018. For 2020, the net income is $2,570 million, while for 2018, it is $3,554 million. This indicates a decrease in net income over the period. The decrease in net income from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to several factors. According to text [10], while the company's revenue and operating profit margin were positive, revenue remained below the median relative to competitors, and TSR was also below the median. Additionally, the company faced challenges such as acquisition charges, restructuring charges, and litigation expenses, which are included in the \"Other\" segment [1]. These factors likely contributed to the reduced net income.\n\nNext, let's consider retained earnings. The table in image4 shows numerical data across three columns, representing different years. The ending balance for 2018 is $7,189 million, and for 2020, it is $6,139 million. This suggests a decrease in retained earnings over the period. The decrease in retained earnings can be linked to the company's capital management strategy, which involved returning approximately 109% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2020 [12]. The significant share repurchases of $2.6 billion reduced outstanding shares, impacting retained earnings. Additionally, dividends declared and paid increased from $2.63 per share in 2018 to $3.72 per share in 2020 [8][9], further affecting retained earnings.\n\nThe company's strategic focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share and the reorganization of product lines within the Analog segment [11] also played a role. Despite these strategic moves, the overall financial performance, as reflected in net income and retained earnings, showed a decline from 2018 to 2020 due to the factors mentioned above.\n\nIn summary, the company's net income decreased from $3,554 million in 2018 to $"}

In the **Commercial** segment, there was a decrease of 6% in risk-based services and a 5% decline in fee-based services, leading to an overall 6% reduction in total commercial services [4]. This decline is attributed to increased unemployment and economic-driven employment attrition, as well as employer actions in response to the pandemic [1][5]. The **Public and Senior** segment, however, saw growth: Medicare Advantage increased by 8% and Medicaid by 12%, driven by states easing redetermination requirements and growth in Dual Special Needs Plans due to COVID-19 [5]. The **Global** segment also decreased by 5%, primarily due to increased unemployment and underwriting discipline [5]. \n\n![The table shows a decrease in commercial services and increases in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid](image4) \n\nThese changes reflect broader economic impacts and shifts in healthcare utilization patterns during the pandemic.

For Pension Benefits, the discount rate increased from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022, as shown in ![Discount rate increased for Pension Benefits](image1). This significant rise in the discount rate can reduce the present value of future benefit obligations, potentially lowering the net amount recognized for pension liabilities. Conversely, the expected return on plan assets decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022, as depicted in ![Expected return on plan assets decreased for Pension Benefits](image2). A lower expected return may increase the net periodic benefit cost, as the company would need to contribute more to meet its obligations.\n\nFor Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate also increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022, as shown in ![Discount rate increased for Other Retiree Benefits](image1). Similar to Pension Benefits, this increase in the discount rate would reduce the present value of future obligations, potentially decreasing the net amount recognized for retiree benefits. The expected return on plan assets remained constant at 8.4% for both years, as depicted in ![Expected return on plan assets remained constant for Other Retiree Benefits](image2), which suggests no change in the expected investment performance impact on the net amount recognized.\n\nThese changes in discount rates and expected returns have direct implications on the net amount recognized. The higher discount rates for both benefit types would generally lead to a reduction in the present value of liabilities, which could decrease the net amount recognized.

The net operating income improved by $392 million, representing a 60% increase, as shown in the table where the 2020 figure was $(262) million compared to $(654) million in 2019 [6]. This improvement was driven by several factors, including cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay, which offset growth in regulatory program costs and technology investments [1]. Additionally, the reallocation of revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings debt, and hyperinflation impacts in Argentina to global businesses contributed to better financial reflection [4].\n\nIn terms of adjusted revenue, Global Markets saw a substantial increase of $1,562 million, or 27%, from 2019 to 2020, reaching $7,290 million [3]. This growth was primarily attributed to higher volatility levels and increased client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, where revenues rose by $702 million (26%) and $556 million (90%), respectively [7].

This significant decline was primarily driven by several key factors. Firstly, the company reported a substantial loss of $22.4 billion, which directly reduced equity [10]. Additionally, ExxonMobil distributed $14.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, further decreasing equity [10]. These factors were partially offset by a $1.8 billion increase due to foreign exchange translation effects from a weaker U.S. dollar and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves, which increased equity [10]. \n\nThe image showing ExxonMobil's shareholders' equity from 2017 to 2020 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes, illustrating how the components of equity evolved over the years.

In 2020, the company's total equity increased significantly from RMB 43,678 million to RMB 52,731 million, primarily driven by growth in retained earnings and additional paid-in capital. Retained earnings grew from RMB 7,007 million to RMB 11,111 million, reflecting the company's profitability and reinvestment of profits. Additional paid-in capital also saw an increase from RMB 34,425 million to RMB 35,044 million, indicating contributions from equity holders and share-based compensation activities.

This change was largely due to a significant increase in treasury shares, which rose from RMB (134) million to RMB (3,660) million, reflecting the company's repurchase of its own shares. Retained earnings continued to grow, increasing from RMB 11,111 million to RMB 14,194 million, supported by ongoing profitability. However, other reserves decreased from RMB 6,300 million to RMB 3,726 million, possibly due to allocations to statutory reserves or other adjustments.

In contrast, directors like O P Bhatt and Dr. Pradeep Kumar Khosla received higher commissions of ₹200.00 and ₹140.00, respectively, alongside their sitting fees [image8]. The total remuneration for all Independent Directors combined was ₹910.60, significantly lower than the Managing Director's individual remuneration. \n\nThe disparity reflects the variable component of remuneration for executive roles, which includes a substantial commission based on company performance, as opposed to the fixed sitting fees and commission for Independent Directors [3][7]. The Managing Director's remuneration also aligns with the company's policy of paying commissions to executive directors, whereas Independent Directors receive a smaller, fixed commission [12]. This structure underscores the performance-based incentives for executive leadership compared to the governance-focused compensation for Independent Directors.\n\nIn summary, the Managing Director's remuneration is substantially higher and more performance-oriented than that of the Independent Directors, reflecting their differing roles and responsibilities within the company. ![The Managing Director's remuneration is significantly higher than that of Independent Directors](image2) ![Independent Directors receive lower, fixed remuneration compared to the Managing Director](image8) \n\nThe remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director is significantly higher and more performance-based than that of the Independent Directors."}

This growth indicates a strong performance across all services, including the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, which likely contributed to the overall increase.\n\nIn terms of costs, the total cost of revenues also increased from $3,451 million in 2019 to $4,235 million in 2020, a variance of $784 million [4]. The cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from 26% in 2019 to 25% in 2020, suggesting that while costs rose, they did not grow as rapidly as revenues [4]. This improvement in cost efficiency could be attributed to the shift in business mix towards enterprise and international markets, which have longer contract durations and potentially lower service delivery costs compared to perpetual and term software licenses [1].\n\nThe increase in revenue for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' likely had a positive impact on the overall financial performance. The gross profit for 2020 was $12,863 million, representing 75% of total revenues, up from 74% in 2019 [5]. This indicates that the company maintained or slightly improved its profitability margins despite the rise in costs. Additionally, the decrease in \"Other expense\" from $94 million in 2019 to $18 million in 2020, a reduction of $76 million, further contributed to improved financial performance [![Other expense decreased significantly](image1)].\n\nThe growth in 'Salesforce Platform and Other' revenue, combined with controlled cost increases and reduced other expenses, suggests that the company is effectively scaling its operations and optimizing its financial performance.

This reduction is primarily attributed to a decline in operating lease costs, which dropped from $2,551 million in 2020 to $2,199 million in 2021, while finance lease costs remained relatively stable at $66 million in both years [3]. The stability in finance lease costs suggests consistent obligations, whereas the decrease in operating lease costs indicates a reduction in expenses related to short-term or variable leases.\n\n![Total lease costs decreased from 2020 to 2021](image3)\n\nFor lease liabilities, the total operating lease liabilities decreased from $3,906 million in 2020 to $3,503 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction in both current and noncurrent liabilities [6].

Specifically, commercial loans saw a significant decline, predominantly in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, due to increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [5]. This is reflected in the financial data showing a $22,867 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans from 2020 to 2021 [![Commercial and industrial loans decreased by $22,867 million](image3)]. Additionally, consumer loans decreased, mainly due to a reduction in the residential mortgage first lien portfolio, influenced by low interest rates and loan transfers to loans held for sale [5]. The table in image6 further illustrates these changes, showing decreases in Home Lending and Small Business loans, with Home Lending loans dropping by $17.8 billion [![Home Lending loans decreased by $17.8 billion](image6)].\n\nDeposits, however, increased due to higher liquidity and savings among consumer customers, supported by government stimulus programs and economic uncertainty [8][11]. This trend is evident in the financial summary, where total deposits rose despite fluctuations in trading-related assets [![Total deposits increased due to higher liquidity](image5)]. The increase in deposits is also supported by the data in image4, which highlights a rise in deposit-related fees and total deposits [![Total deposits increased](image4)].\n\nThe contributing factors include government stimulus programs, which boosted consumer liquidity and savings, and operational adjustments like reduced headcount and lower expenses, which improved efficiency [1][4]. The improved economic environment also reduced credit losses, further stabilizing financial performance [10].\n\nIn summary, total loans decreased due to lower demand and higher paydowns, while deposits increased due to higher liquidity and savings, driven by government stimulus and economic conditions. ![Total loans decreased and deposits increased](image3) ![Total deposits increased](image5)\n\nThe total loans decreased, and deposits increased from 2020 to 2021, driven by lower loan demand and higher paydowns for loans, and higher liquidity and savings for deposits."}

According to the text, this increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities from the E*TRADE acquisition, and higher lending commitments within Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments [3]. The image data further illustrates that Credit Risk RWA rose by $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach, leading to final balances of $387,066 million and $284,930 million, respectively [![Credit Risk RWA increased significantly in 2020](image4)]. This indicates a higher perceived credit risk, necessitating more capital to meet regulatory requirements and maintain financial stability.\n\nSecondly, External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased](image7)]. Despite this decline, the institution still exceeded the required ratio of 21.5%, suggesting that while the proportion of TLAC relative to RWA diminished, the absolute amount of TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million. This reflects the institution's efforts to bolster its loss-absorbing capacity, albeit at a slightly reduced rate relative to the growth in RWA.\n\nThe combination of these changes suggests that while the institution faced increased credit risk exposure, it also strengthened its capacity to absorb potential losses. The higher Credit Risk RWA required more capital allocation, which was partially offset by the growth in TLAC. However, the slight decrease in TLAC as a percentage of RWA indicates that the rate of increase in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC, necessitating careful management to maintain regulatory compliance and financial resilience.\n\nIn summary, the financial institution's capital structure became more risk-weighted due to increased credit exposures, but it maintained robust loss-absorbing capacity through higher TLAC levels,"}

This indicates a higher tax burden in 2020. Additionally, the Australian operations' ETR also rose from 27.8% to 31.4% during the same period. The increase in tax rates is further supported by the text, which mentions that deferred tax is calculated using enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date [8]. The reconciliation of the effective tax rate in image3 highlights various factors contributing to these changes, including the utilization of carried-forward tax losses and current year losses without recognized deferred tax assets. Unused tax losses increased from $1,063,000 in 2019 to $2,693,000 in 2020 [12], and the net deferred tax assets grew from $6,372,000 in 2019 to $9,344,000 in 2020, as seen in image4 and image6. This suggests that while the company recognized more deferred tax assets, the overall tax expense still rose due to higher taxable profits or changes in tax laws.\n\nRegarding impairment charges, image2 shows that Lovisa Holdings recognized $6,117,000 in impairment charges in 2020, primarily due to the decision to exit the Spanish market and write-downs of fixed assets, key money, and lease right-of-use assets. This contrasts with 2019, where no impairment charges were recorded [6]. The significant impairment in 2020 reflects strategic changes and asset revaluations, impacting the company's financial performance.\n\nIn summary, the major changes include a substantial increase in tax expenses, driven by higher effective tax rates and deferred tax asset recognition, and the introduction of impairment charges in 2020 due to market exit and asset write-downs.\n\n![Global and Australian ETR increased significantly in 2020](image8)  \n![Impairment charges were recognized in 2020 but not in 2019"}

In 2019 to 2020, there was a notable net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million, primarily driven by lower interest rates across various financial instruments, as shown in image2. This decrease was particularly pronounced in interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, which saw a decline of $1,464 million. In contrast, from 2018 to 2019, interest income had increased by $4,452 million, with U.S. commercial loans contributing positively by $1,224 million. The downturn in 2020 reflects the broader economic impact of COVID-19, which led to lower rates and reduced net interest income, as mentioned in [5].\n\nRegarding interest expense, there was a net decrease of $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020, largely due to reduced expenses on loans and federal funds purchased, which decreased by $14,120 million. This reduction in expenses partially offset the decline in interest income. However, the overall net interest income still decreased significantly, as the drop in interest income outpaced the decrease in expenses. In comparison, from 2018 to 2019, interest expenses had increased by $714 million, indicating a different economic environment with higher rates and costs.\n\nThese changes are closely tied to Bank of America's organizational structure, which is divided into key segments such as Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets, as depicted in image1. The Consumer Banking segment, for instance, experienced a decrease in net interest income from $16,904 million in 2019 to $13,739 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower rates on deposits and consumer lending, as shown in image5. The Global Banking and Global Markets segments also faced challenges due to lower interest rates, affecting their net interest income contributions.\n\nThe organizational structure allows Bank of America to manage and report these changes across different business units, enabling targeted strategies to address specific challenges.

This decline was primarily driven by a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a decrease of 44.4% [7]. The decrease in interest income was largely attributed to lower yields on short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [4]. Despite this, dividend income increased from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, reflecting a 3.5% rise [7]. This increase was partly due to dividends from investments in preferred stock, such as Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which contributed $121 million in 2021 compared to $26 million in 2020 [5].\n\nRegarding asset composition, the total invested assets increased from $363,117 million in 2020 to $446,277 million in 2021 [image3]. This growth was primarily driven by a substantial rise in equity securities, which grew from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, an increase of 24.3% [image3]. Meanwhile, cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills also increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, a rise of 35.2% [image3]. However, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, a decline of 19.3% [image3]. The increase in equity securities and cash holdings suggests a strategic shift towards maintaining liquidity and safety, aligning with the company's emphasis on liquidity over yield [4].\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted.

According to the text, the fair values of these contracts are affected by interest rate risks, although the exposure has diminished due to the short duration of remaining contracts as of December 31, 2021 [8]. The table in image7 illustrates that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of equity index put option contracts from $99 million to $94 million, while a 100 basis point decrease would slightly increase it to $105 million. This sensitivity highlights the inverse relationship between interest rates and the fair value of these contracts, where higher rates generally lead to lower fair values [7][8].\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings, the data in image1 shows a stark contrast between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, non-U.S. denominated debt resulted in a net loss of $764 million, whereas in 2021, it contributed a gain of $955 million. This shift indicates a significant positive change in the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net earnings, reflecting favorable movements in exchange rates for the company's non-U.S. Dollar-denominated senior notes [3]. The table in image8 further supports this by showing a substantial pre-tax gain of $1.3 billion in 2021 compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.0 billion in 2020, underscoring the volatility and impact of foreign currency fluctuations on financial performance [3].\n\nIn summary, interest rate changes inversely affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts, and the effects of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings improved significantly from a loss in 2020 to a gain in 2021 due to favorable foreign currency movements. ![Interest rate changes impact equity index put option contracts](image7) ![Non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings improved from 2020 to 2021](image1)\n\nChanges in interest rates inversely affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts, and non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings improved from a loss in 2020 to a gain in 2021."}

According to the financial data, the GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was (18.6) percent, while the Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was (1.5) percent. This stark contrast is primarily due to the recognition of a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter of 2020, as well as a benefit of $0.2 billion from a foreign tax law change [4][7]. These adjustments significantly reduced the tax burden in the non-GAAP calculation, leading to a much lower effective tax rate compared to the GAAP figure.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the GAAP effective tax rate was 7.2 percent, whereas the Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was 8.5 percent [3][7].

The potential impacts of such disruptions include supply issues and increased costs, which can significantly affect the company's ability to meet consumer demand and maintain profitability [6].\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Nestlé employs several strategies. These include implementing safety and security policies to protect against disruptions and developing business continuity plans to ensure operations can continue even under adverse conditions [6]. These measures are crucial for maintaining the resilience of Nestlé's supply chain, especially in regions where geopolitical or environmental factors might pose additional challenges.\n\nThe distribution of Nestlé's factories across different regions is illustrated in the image showing the share capital by geography, where countries like Switzerland and the United States hold significant shares [![Distribution of share capital by geography](image2)]. This geographic spread allows Nestlé to diversify its supply chain risks, as operations in one region can compensate for disruptions in another. For instance, the presence in multiple countries within the Americas, as shown in the table listing countries like Brazil and Mexico with high numerical values, indicates a broad operational base that can help buffer against localized disruptions [![Countries in the Americas](image1)].\n\nFurthermore, Nestlé's efforts to enhance supply chain resilience are evident in its use of advanced technologies. The company has expanded the scope of its Transport Hub technologies to cover 50% of its global logistics network and utilized AI-powered network optimization tools to evaluate different sourcing and delivery scenarios [10]. These tools not only improve efficiency but also enable quicker responses to changes in demand, which is vital for regions with varying market conditions and potential disruptions.\n\nIn summary, Nestlé addresses supply chain disruptions through a combination of strategic geographic distribution, robust policies, and technological advancements, ensuring continuity and adaptability across its global operations.\n\nThe potential impacts of supply chain disruptions include supply issues and cost increases, while mitigations involve safety policies and business continuity plans, supported by Nestlé's global factory distribution and advanced logistics technologies."}

Subsequent months saw fluctuations, with notable lows in September 2002 (Rs. 310.00) and December 2002 (Rs. 300.00), reflecting periods of decline. The price recovered slightly in October 2002, reaching a high of Rs. 415.00, but overall, the trend showed volatility. By March 2003, the price settled at a high of Rs. 329.00 and a low of Rs. 286.00, indicating a downward trend towards the end of the period [5].\n\n![The share prices of GPI fluctuated between April 2002 and March 2003, with notable peaks and troughs](image5)\n\nComparatively, the performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex over the same period is illustrated in a line graph. The graph shows that GPI's performance fluctuated between a normalized price/index of 106 at its highest and 84 at its lowest. The BSE Sensex, represented by a separate line, varied between 98 and 84. This suggests that GPI's performance was more volatile than the BSE Sensex, with higher peaks and lower troughs.

This difference is also reflected in the external gross profit margin, where Cloud & Cognitive Software had a margin of 77.1%, compared to GBS's 27.7% [6][4]. The pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software was $7,811 million, whereas GBS reported a pre-tax income of $1,623 million, further highlighting the disparity in profitability between the two segments [4][6].\n\nThe factors contributing to these financial results can be attributed to several strategic and operational elements. For Cloud & Cognitive Software, the decline in pre-tax income by 12.4% was primarily driven by the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, ongoing investments in key strategic areas, and lower income from IP partnership agreements [7]. Despite these challenges, the segment maintained a high gross profit margin, reflecting its focus on high-value offerings and the integration of Red Hat's capabilities, which are critical for IBM's hybrid cloud and AI strategy [5].\n\nOn the other hand, GBS's financial performance was influenced by the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings and productivity improvements, which drove year-to-year improvements in margins and pre-tax income [3]. The segment's revenue was flat as reported but grew adjusted for currency, with strong growth in Consulting services that supported clients' digital journeys [9]. However, Application Management and Global Process Services faced declines, offset by growth in cloud-related offerings [9]. The image data confirms these trends, showing a 3.0% increase in GBS's external gross profit and a 1.3% rise in pre-tax income, with a slight improvement in pre-tax margin [![GBS financial improvements](image6)].\n\nOverall, while Cloud & Cognitive Software generated higher gross profits and maintained a strong margin, its pre-tax income was affected by strategic investments and acquisition-related adjustments. GBS, despite facing some declines in traditional services, showed resilience through its focus on higher-value and cloud-centric offerings, contributing to its improved financial metrics [![GBS revenue components](image2)].\n\nThe external gross profit for Cloud & Cognitive Software was significantly higher than that of Global Business Services in 2019, and its pre-tax income"}

The shipment volume for cigarettes decreased by 11.8%, while the shipment volume for heated tobacco units increased by 50.8%, resulting in an overall shipment volume decrease of 11.6% [3]. This decline in cigarette shipments was primarily due to lower market shares in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, as well as the unfavorable impact of the RBH deconsolidation [12]. The shift towards heated tobacco units, particularly in Japan, partially offset the decline in cigarette shipments [10].\n\nFinancially, the net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, but excluding unfavorable currency movements, it increased by $0.2 billion due to higher net earnings, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and asset impairment costs [3]. The higher working capital requirements were mainly due to COVID-19-related inventory build-up in the supply chain [8]. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH [11].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends. The shipment volume for cigarettes in Latin America & Canada dropped from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020, while heated tobacco units increased from 299 million to 451 million units, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences [![The shipment volume for cigarettes decreased by 11.8% and heated tobacco units increased by 50.8%](image3)].

In 2021, net income for the company as a whole increased to $21.5 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2020 [8]. This improvement was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory fees, despite lower net interest income [8]. The net interest income itself decreased from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, primarily due to lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, and other factors [1]. However, noninterest income grew, contributing to overall revenue increases [6].\n\nRegarding balance sheet data, total loans decreased from 2020 to 2021, as paydowns exceeded originations [5]. This decline was evident across various segments, including Home Lending, where loan balances were affected by curtailed non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspended home equity originations in 2020 [5]. Small Business loans also saw a decline due to reduced PPP loans [5]. The image data confirms these trends, showing a decrease in total loans from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021, a reduction of $30,199 million or 14% [image8]. Specifically, Home Lending loans decreased, reflecting the impact of mortgage servicing and originations [image6].\n\nIn contrast, total deposits increased over the same period, driven by higher liquidity and savings among consumer customers, influenced by government stimulus and economic uncertainty [11]. The image data illustrates this growth, with total deposits rising from $1.3 trillion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2021, a $100 billion increase [image2]. This rise in deposits was partially offset by lower loan balances, affecting the net interest margin [7].\n\nKey changes in loans and deposits highlight a shift toward higher liquidity and reduced lending activity.

According to the data, average Card Member loans decreased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $12.9 billion in 2020, before increasing to $15.0 billion in 2021 [image7]. This trend indicates a recovery in loan balances post-2020, likely driven by improved economic conditions and customer financial strength, as mentioned in the text [10]. The increase in loans in 2021 aligns with the company's reported growth in billed business and customer retention [8].\n\nNet interest income, however, showed a decline from $866 million in 2019 to $967 million in 2020, and then a slight increase to $1,011 million in 2021 [image7]. Despite the overall decrease, the slight uptick in 2021 was attributed to lower costs of funds, partially offset by reduced revolving loan balances [12]. This suggests that while the company managed to optimize its funding costs, the lower loan balances limited the growth in interest income.\n\nThe implications for the company's financial performance are multifaceted. The recovery in average Card Member loans in 2021 contributed to higher non-interest revenues, particularly in discount revenue, which grew due to increased Card Member spending [9]. This aligns with the 21% increase in billed business observed in 2021 [image5]. Additionally, the decrease in net interest income was mitigated by strong non-interest revenue growth, leading to a 17% increase in total revenues net of interest expense [2]. The reserve releases in 2021, driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, further enhanced profitability by reducing provisions for credit losses [4], as evidenced by the significant decrease from $3,150 million in 2020 to a net benefit of $(945) million in 2021 [image2].\n\nOverall, the changes in average Card Member loans and net interest income highlight a strategic focus on non-interest revenue growth and risk management, which supported the company's financial resilience and profitability during the period [image8].\n\nThe average Card Member loans increased from 2020 to 202"}

Specifically, share-based compensation expense increased restricted share units by 1,118,284 and additional paid-in capital by $79,522, totaling $1,197,806 [image2]. This reflects the company's practice of rewarding employees with equity, which enhances shareholder equity by recognizing the value of these compensations in the financial statements.\n\nAdditionally, cash flows from operating activities played a crucial role in maintaining and improving the company's cash position. The cash flow statement for 2020 highlights net income of $5,185,313, which is a primary component of cash flows from operating activities [image4]. This net income, adjusted for non-cash items like depreciation and share-based compensation, contributed positively to the cash generated from operations. The operating activities section of the cash flow statement indicates that despite various adjustments, the company maintained a strong cash flow, supporting its liquidity and financial stability.\n\nThe combination of these factors—share-based compensation enhancing equity and robust operating cash flows—ensured that Accenture plc could sustain its financial health.

This growth was largely due to the issuance of new shares in March 2021 for financing the acquisition of Varian, which added €53 million to issued capital and €2,275 million to capital reserves [7]. The capital increase and the use of capital reserves to acquire treasury shares, which rose from €36 million in 2020 to €240 million in 2021, were key components [![Treasury shares increased](image6)].

This issuance and redemption activity contributed to the net cash used in financing activities, which amounted to $14,933 million in 2021 [image3]. The redemption of preferred shares reduced the company's long-term debt, while the issuance provided capital to meet these obligations, impacting the cash flows from financing activities.\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity is reflected in the changes in preferred shares and additional paid-in capital.

According to the financial statement in image1, the consolidated total assets and liabilities & shareholders' equity are listed for both years, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial position. The increase in total assets from 2020 to 2021 indicates growth in the company's resources, which could be attributed to various factors such as increased sales, investments, or retained earnings. This growth in assets suggests that the company has expanded its operational capacity or improved its financial health, potentially enhancing its ability to invest in future projects or withstand economic fluctuations.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, image2 highlights that the consolidated net cash provided by operating activities increased from $4.05 billion in 2020 to $7.18 billion in 2021, as also mentioned in text quote [1]. This substantial increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2021 adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, which favorably impacted cash flow. However, increased working capital requirements partially offset these gains, with changes in inventory and accounts receivable negatively affecting cash flow, though favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses provided some balance [1][5].\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The increase in cash flow from operating activities strengthens the company's liquidity position, enabling it to fund its ME&T operations more effectively, as noted in text quote [6]. This improved cash flow can support strategic investments, reduce reliance on external financing, and provide a buffer against market volatility. Additionally, the higher total assets suggest a robust financial foundation, which can enhance the company's creditworthiness and investment attractiveness. However, the challenges in managing working capital, as indicated by the unfavorable changes in inventory and accounts receivable, highlight the need for continued focus on operational efficiency to sustain these positive trends.\n\nIn summary, the increase in total assets and cash flow from operating activities from 2020 to 2021 for the consolidated segment reflects a strengthening financial position, with positive implications for business operations, including enhanced liquidity and investment capacity.

This decline can be attributed to various factors, including the sale of client financing receivables and a reduction in net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases, which decreased from $6,224 million in 2019 to $4,092 million in 2020 [6].\n\nRegarding total equity, there was a decrease of $397 million, from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020 [6]. This reduction was primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, mainly from foreign currency translation adjustments [1]. These factors were partially offset by net income of $5,590 million and an increase in common stock of $661 million [1].\n\nTotal company debt also saw a decrease, from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020, a reduction of $1,361 million [9].

In 2019, the company recorded a significant tax benefit due to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property, amounting to $2,472 million, which contributed to a high effective tax rate of 41% [2]. This was primarily related to the relinquishment of the federal tax basis step-up of intellectual property distributed in fiscal 2018, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense [8]. Additionally, the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets from check-the-box elections led to a $570 million tax benefit [8]. These factors, combined with other adjustments, resulted in a total effective tax provision of $3,095 million in 2019 [image2].\n\nIn 2020, the effective tax rate dropped to 9%, reflecting a total effective tax provision of $521 million [image2]. This decrease was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted global economies and led to impairments in non-marketable equity investments, including a full impairment of the investment in OneWeb [7]. However, the tax provision was also affected by the benefit from the FDII deduction and excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards, which were $381 million and $83 million, respectively [image2].\n\nBy 2021, the effective tax rate further decreased to 12%, with a total effective tax provision of $1,231 million [image2]. The excess tax benefits from share-based awards increased to $265 million, and the benefit from the FDII deduction was $550 million [image2]. Unrecognized tax benefits also rose to $2,136 million in 2021, primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding taxes [10][image5]. The company continued to assert that certain foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested, avoiding deferred tax liabilities of approximately $63 million [9].\n\nThe financial data also highlights fluctuations in revenues and expenses. Total QCT revenues grew from $14,639 million in 2019 to $27,019 million in 2021, driven by increases in handset and IoT segments [image3]."}

The sale generated a net gain of $269 million, which was recorded in the income statement and contributed to the increase in noninterest income for 2021. This gain, along with other sales such as the Corporate Trust Services business and the student loan portfolio, led to a significant rise in noninterest income from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, a 104% increase `![The table presents a summary of an income statement and selected metrics for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, with changes in dollar amounts and percentages from the previous years.](image1)`.

This decline was mainly due to lower interest rates, which reduced the income generated from interest-bearing assets. However, this decrease was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, as well as the deployment of excess deposits into securities [6].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends. ![The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars](image1) shows a net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, with significant declines in categories like interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, and time deposits and federal funds. Meanwhile, interest expense decreased by $5,627 million over the same period, primarily due to reductions in interest-bearing deposits and loans and federal funds purchased. Despite the decrease in interest expenses, the substantial drop in interest income led to a notable reduction in net interest income, contributing to a narrower net interest spread.\n\nAdditionally, the decline in net interest income was influenced by the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet to interest rate movements. The text notes that higher interest rates adversely affect the fair value of debt securities and capital levels under Basel 3 rules, but the near-term adverse impact is reduced over time by positive impacts on net interest income from upward rate shifts [2]. This suggests that while lower rates reduced immediate net interest income, the bank's asset sensitivity and strategic deployment of deposits into securities helped mitigate some negative effects.\n\nIn summary, the main contributing factors to the reduced net interest spread were the significant decrease in interest income due to lower rates, partially offset by reduced interest expenses. The strategic management of deposits and funding costs played a role in mitigating the impact, but the overall effect was a narrower net interest spread.\n\nThe net interest spread decreased due to a significant drop in interest income outpacing the reduction in interest expenses, primarily driven by lower interest"}

According to the financial data for 2020 and 2019, the reported GAAP measure for PBNA in 2020 was $1,900 million, while in 2019 it was $2,000 million.

The core non-GAAP measure adjusts the reported GAAP measure by accounting for items affecting comparability, such as mark-to-market net impact, restructuring and impairment charges, and inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges. In 2020, the core non-GAAP measure for PBNA was $2,000 million, while in 2019 it was $2,050 million. This shows a decrease of $50 million in the core non-GAAP measure from 2019 to 2020 [5].\n\nThe influencing factors for these changes include:\n\n1. **Mark-to-market net impact**: In 2020, the mark-to-market net impact for PBNA was $(0.04) million, while in 2019 it was $(0.06) million. This adjustment reflects the fair value changes of certain financial instruments [3].\n\n2. **Restructuring and impairment charges**: In 2020, PBNA incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $0.17 million, while in 2019 it was $0.21 million. These charges are costs associated with restructuring activities or impairment of assets [3].\n\n3. **Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges**: In 2020, PBNA had inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $0.17 million, while in 2019 it was $0.03 million.

This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and asset impairment and exit costs, although net earnings were higher when excluding certain non-cash charges. The table in image1 shows that net cash provided by operating activities was $9,812 million in 2020 compared to $10,090 million in 2019, reflecting this decline. However, excluding unfavorable currency movements, operating cash flows actually increased by $0.2 billion, indicating underlying operational improvements.\n\nFor investing activities, net cash used decreased by $0.7 billion from 2019 to 2020, as highlighted in [2]. This reduction was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH, which reduced cash outflows. Image1 confirms this trend, showing capital expenditures of $602 million in 2020 compared to $852 million in 2019. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities contributed positively to the overall cash balance.\n\nFinancing activities saw an increase in net cash used by $0.4 billion from 2019 to 2020, as stated in [3].

The Annual Total Remuneration for directors is determined based on consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota's share price, which are critical indicators of business performance and shareholder value, respectively [1]. This approach ensures that a significant portion of the remuneration is performance-linked, motivating directors to enhance corporate value over the medium to long term [5]. \n\nThe evaluation framework further emphasizes this alignment by assigning a 50% weight to consolidated operating income and another 50% to the volatility of Toyota’s share price, reflecting the company's commitment to achieving sustainable growth and maintaining shareholder confidence [7]. The consolidated operating income is evaluated against a reference value of 1 trillion yen, with the current fiscal year achieving 150% of the required income, showcasing strong performance [7]. Meanwhile, the share price volatility is assessed relative to the Nikkei stock average, providing a benchmark for shareholder value [7].\n\nAdditionally, individual performance evaluations are conducted in line with the \"Toyoda spirit,\" ensuring qualitative assessments complement quantitative metrics [11]. This dual approach ensures that remuneration not only rewards financial success but also recognizes efforts aligned with Toyota's strategic objectives.

This substantial growth was primarily driven by a substantial gain in foreign currency translation adjustments, which shifted from a loss of $632 million in 2018 to a gain of $2,918 million in 2020. This positive shift in foreign currency translation adjustments was a major factor in the overall increase in comprehensive income, as highlighted in the financial data [5]. Additionally, the company experienced higher net earnings, which grew from $2,651 million in 2018 to $3,646 million in 2020, contributing to the rise in comprehensive income [6]. \n\nThe table in image5 clearly illustrates these changes, showing the comprehensive income figures for each year and the components that influenced them. The foreign currency translation adjustments, in particular, had a dramatic impact, moving from a significant loss in 2018 to a substantial gain in 2020, which is a key driver of the comprehensive income increase. Furthermore, the table in image7 provides a detailed breakdown of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) over the years, emphasizing the role of foreign currency translation adjustments in the overall comprehensive income changes. \n\nOther factors contributing to the comprehensive income increase include a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments, which improved from a loss of $113 million in 2019 to a loss of $72 million in 2020, and higher net earnings from the company's operations, including the impact of the Cytiva Acquisition and the gain on the sale of product lines [3][6]. These elements collectively contributed to the substantial rise in comprehensive income over the three-year period.\n\n![Comprehensive income increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments](image5)  \n![Foreign currency translation adjustments had a major impact on comprehensive income changes](image7)\n\nThe comprehensive income of Danaher Corporation increased from $2,005 million in 2018 to $6,346 million in 2020, mainly due to a substantial gain in foreign currency translation adjustments and higher net earnings."}

This project is implemented through various agencies, indicating a collaborative approach to address the pandemic's impact nationwide. Other COVID-related projects, such as those in Maharashtra and Kerala, also show substantial financial commitments, reflecting the bank's focus on widespread relief efforts. The implementation mode for these projects is often through external agencies, as seen in image7, where projects like \"COVID Relief\" are managed by organizations like Setu Charitable Trust and National Health and Education Society. This approach allows for leveraging specialized expertise and resources to efficiently distribute aid.\n\nOn the other hand, Rural Development Projects (HRDP) are detailed in images2, 3, 5, and 6. These projects are implemented across multiple states, including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra, with varying amounts spent, such as ₹0.86 crore in Firozpur and Amritsar (image2) and larger sums like ₹181.86 crore in projects across multiple districts (image3). The implementation mode for HRDP is consistently indirect, as all projects are marked as \"No\" for direct implementation (image2, image3, image5, image6). Instead, they are executed through agencies like Shramik Bharti and Centre for Advance Research and Development, as shown in image2 and image3. This method ensures localized expertise and community engagement, crucial for sustainable rural development.\n\nA key difference in project implementation modes is the scale and reach. COVID Relief projects often involve larger, PAN India initiatives with significant funding, while HRDP focuses on localized, smaller-scale projects with tailored approaches to specific regions. The use of external agencies in both cases underscores a reliance on specialized organizations to achieve project goals effectively.\n\nIn summary, COVID Relief projects tend to have higher financial allocations and broader geographic coverage, implemented through specialized agencies, whereas Rural Development Projects are more localized with varied funding, also executed through external agencies to ensure community-specific solutions. ![COVID Relief projects have higher financial allocations and broader geographic coverage](image7) and ![Rural Development Projects are more localized with varied funding](image3). \n\nThe key differences lie in the scale of funding and geographic focus, with COVID Relief projects being more extensive and HRDP being"}

According to the financial data [6], PepsiCo's net income was $12,559 million in 2018, $7,353 million in 2019, and $7,175 million in 2020. The comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo was $10,453 million in 2018, $8,133 million in 2019, and $5,944 million in 2020 [image1]. This shows a significant decrease in both net income and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020.\n\nNext, we examine the net cash provided by operating activities. The cash flow data [7] indicates that PepsiCo generated $9,415 million in 2018, $9,649 million in 2019, and $10,613 million in 2020 [image4]. Despite the decline in net income and comprehensive income, the net cash provided by operating activities increased over the three years.\n\nComparing these figures, we observe that in 2018, PepsiCo's net cash from operating activities ($9,415 million) was lower than both its net income ($12,559 million) and comprehensive income ($10,453 million). In 2019, the net cash from operating activities ($9,649 million) was slightly lower than the net income ($7,353 million) but higher than the comprehensive income ($8,133 million). By 2020, the net cash from operating activities ($10,613 million) exceeded both the net income ($7,175 million) and comprehensive income ($5,944 million).\n\nThis trend suggests that while PepsiCo's profitability metrics (net income and comprehensive income) decreased over the years, its ability to generate cash from operations improved.

The actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions such as discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression, which can vary due to market and economic conditions [3]. \n\nFor instance, the discount rate, a critical factor in calculating the DBO, increased slightly in 2021 compared to 2020. The discount rate for the Euro was 1.0% in 2021 versus 0.9% in 2020, and for the U.S. dollar, it was 2.7% in 2021 compared to 2.4% in 2020 [![Discount rates increased slightly in 2021](image2)]. This change in discount rates directly affects the present value of future benefit entitlements, as higher discount rates reduce the DBO. However, the overall impact on the DBO also depends on other factors like compensation increases and pension progression rates. \n\nCompensation increases and pension progression rates for specific countries like the United Kingdom and Switzerland showed minor increases from 2020 to 2021. For example, the United Kingdom's compensation increase was 3.0% in 2021 compared to 2.6% in 2020, and pension progression remained at 3.0% for both years [![Compensation and pension progression rates for the UK](image3)]. These adjustments influence the projected future benefits and, consequently, the DBO.\n\nThe actuarial gains and losses table highlights the financial impact of these changes. In 2021, there were actuarial losses of €22 million, primarily due to changes in financial assumptions (-€26 million), whereas in 2020, there were actuarial gains of €67 million [![Actuarial losses in 2021](image4)]. This shift indicates that unfavorable changes in assumptions, such as higher discount rates or altered demographic projections, contributed to an increased DBO.\n\nAdditionally, the sensitivity analysis shows that a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the DBO by €271 million in 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020 [![Sensitivity to discount rate changes]("}

According to the data, the total RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, with the final RWA at December 31, 2020, being $453,106 million (Standardized) and $445,151 million (Advanced) compared to $394,177 million (Standardized) and $382,496 million (Advanced) in 2019 [image3]. This increase in RWA was primarily driven by higher market volatility, which led to an increase in Market Risk RWA, and changes in credit risk exposures, including derivatives and investment securities [8][12].\n\nDespite the increase in RWA, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [image7]. This decrease indicates that while the absolute amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020, the growth in RWA outpaced the growth in TLAC, resulting in a lower percentage. The regulatory minimum requirement for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%, and the required ratio is 21.5%, both of which were comfortably exceeded in both years [image7].\n\nThe decrease in the percentage reflects the institution's ability to maintain a strong buffer above regulatory requirements, even as RWA expanded. This suggests that the institution managed to balance the growth in risk-weighted assets with sufficient loss-absorbing capacity, albeit at a slightly reduced relative level compared to the previous year.\n\nIn summary, the increase in RWA components, particularly market and credit risks, led to a higher absolute TLAC but a lower percentage of TLAC relative to RWA from 2019 to 2020, while still maintaining compliance with regulatory standards. ![External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020](image"}

By 2020, Lovisa had expanded its presence to 435 stores across 15 countries, demonstrating a steady growth trajectory as shown in the table from image1, which highlights the increasing number of stores each year. This expansion was driven by a combination of company-owned stores in key markets like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, as well as franchised stores in regions such as the Middle East and Vietnam [1][9].\n\nA key achievement in this period was the successful opening of 47 stores outside of Australia, with specific expansions in the UK, France, and the USA, as detailed in image2. This expansion strategy involved targeting high-traffic areas and securing quality retail sites, often in premium shopping centers, which aligns with Lovisa's refined global store model emphasizing optimal store size and layout [8]. The company's ability to quickly fit out new stores, averaging 14 days, facilitated rapid international roll-outs [8].\n\nHowever, the expansion faced challenges such as competition and economic conditions, particularly in the fast fashion jewelry sector, which has low barriers to entry and is subject to changing customer preferences [2]. To mitigate these risks, Lovisa employed a product team of over 20 people to stay ahead of trends and ensure product innovation, a core component of its competitive advantage [5][6]. Additionally, the company streamlined its global supply chain, optimizing its supply base in Asia and enhancing freight options to maintain operating speed, with over 56% of products moved through the China warehouse [10][image2].\n\nFinancially, Lovisa's expansion was supported by improved net working capital and net cash positions, as evidenced by the consolidated financial summary in image5, which shows a significant increase in net cash from 2019 to 2020. Despite these achievements, the company faced challenges like supply chain disruptions and the impact of COVID-19, which temporarily affected travel for trend identification and store openings [6][12].\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion from 2016 to 2020 was characterized by strategic market entry, efficient store roll-outs, and a focus on trend leadership, with notable achievements in store openings and supply chain optimization, while navigating competitive and economic challenges. ![Lovisa expanded to 4"}

In 2020, net interest income decreased by $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies [9]. This decline was partly offset by interest income from the growth in average interest-earning assets (AIEA), which increased by $170.1 billion or 8.8% [9]. The reduction in NII reflects the broader economic challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, including lower market interest rates, particularly in Asia and North America [2][3][8].\n\nInterest expense also decreased in 2020, driven by lower market interest rates, which reduced funding costs on customer deposits and debt issuances [11]. However, the decrease in interest expense was not sufficient to fully offset the decline in interest income, leading to a net reduction in NII. The table in image1 shows that interest income for the year ended December 2020 was $41,756 million, down from the previous year, while interest expense was $(14,178) million, also lower than in 2019. This resulted in a net interest income of $27,578 million for 2020, a decrease from the prior year [image1].\n\nThe impact on net operating income is evident in the \"Summary Consolidated Income Statement\" (image5), which highlights a reduction in net operating income before credit provisions due to the decline in NII.

The total number of shares held by the public, both in dematerialized and physical form, remained constant at 3,752,384,706, representing 100% ownership [image5]. However, there were minor changes in the distribution among categories: individual shareholders experienced a decrease of 0.2%, while clearing members saw an increase of 0.1% in their shareholding percentage [image5]. This indicates slight shifts within the public shareholding structure, but no significant overall change in the total public shareholding percentage.\n\nNext, we look at the top ten shareholders. The table in image8 lists the top ten shareholders and their shareholding at the beginning and end of the year. Notably, there is no mention of any changes in the number of shares or the percentage of total shares held by these shareholders. This suggests that the top ten shareholders maintained their positions without any significant alterations in their shareholdings during the fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the shareholding of Tata group companies, which includes Tata Sons Private Limited as the primary shareholder, remained consistent at 72% of the total shares throughout the year [image7]. There were no changes in the percentage shareholding for any of the Tata group companies during this period, reinforcing the stability in the top shareholding structure.\n\nIn summary, while there were minor adjustments within the public shareholding categories, the overall public shareholding percentage and the top ten shareholders' positions remained largely unchanged between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020.\n\n![The total public shareholding percentage remained steady at 28%](image5)  \n![The top ten shareholders maintained their positions without significant changes](image8)  \n![Tata group companies' shareholding remained consistent at 72%](image7)\n\nThe changes in shareholding patterns between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, were minimal, with no significant alterations in the top ten shareholders' positions or the overall public shareholding percentage."}

This decline was largely attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [9]. Despite this, dividend income saw a modest increase of 3.5%, which helped partially offset the overall decrease in net investment income [6]. The table in image6 highlights these changes, showing a substantial drop in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, while dividend income rose from $4,890 million to $5,060 million [![Net investment income decreased due to lower interest income](image6)].\n\nIn contrast, railroad operating earnings increased by 15.7% from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher freight volumes and a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit [5]. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic's economic slowdown in 2020 led to improved volumes, particularly in coal and consumer products, as evidenced by the 8.9% and 7.7% volume increases, respectively [3][10]. Additionally, higher fuel surcharge revenue due to elevated fuel prices contributed to the revenue growth [5]. The table in image8 reflects this improvement, showing railroad operating revenues rising from $20,181 million in 2020 to $22,513 million in 2021, with net earnings increasing from $5,161 million to $5,990 million [![Railroad operating earnings increased due to higher volumes and revenue per unit](image8)].\n\nOverall, while net investment income faced challenges from low interest rates, railroad operating earnings benefited from post-pandemic economic recovery and increased demand.\n\nThe net investment income decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021, while railroad operating earnings increased by 15.7% during the same period."}

According to the table in image7, the total shareholders' equity for McDonald's was $25,714.1 million in 2018, $23,414.9 million in 2019, and $22,500.0 million in 2020. This indicates a decrease in total shareholders' equity over the three-year period. The decline can be attributed to various factors such as dividends paid, treasury stock purchases, and the impact of net income and comprehensive income, as detailed in the table. Specifically, the table shows that net income and comprehensive income contributed to changes in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, while treasury stock purchases reduced the equity.\n\nNext, let's look at the number of systemwide restaurants. Image8 provides the data for the number of restaurants. In 2018, McDonald's had 37,855 systemwide restaurants, which increased to 38,695 in 2019 and further to 39,198 in 2020. This shows a steady growth in the number of restaurants over the three years. The increase is primarily driven by the expansion of franchised restaurants, which grew from 35,085 in 2018 to 36,521 in 2020, as noted in the same image. The company-operated restaurants also saw a slight increase from 2,770 in 2018 to 2,677 in 2020, although this growth was less pronounced compared to franchised locations.\n\nCombining these observations, we can conclude that while McDonald's total shareholders' equity decreased from 2018 to 2020, the number of systemwide restaurants increased, reflecting the company's strategic focus on franchising and expansion.\n\n![Total shareholders' equity decreased from $25,714.1 million in 2018 to $22,500.0 million in 2020](image7)  \n![The number of systemwide restaurants increased from 37,855 in 201"}

This change reflects adjustments in accumulated amortization and other factors affecting the net value. Specifically, the gross carrying amount increased from $445 million in 2019 to $456 million in 2020, while accumulated amortization rose from $113 million to $162 million. The increase in accumulated amortization indicates higher amortization expenses over the period, which is consistent with the depreciation and amortization expense reported as $232 million in 2020, up from $227 million in 2019 [8]. Despite the higher amortization, the net carrying amount decreased due to the larger increase in accumulated amortization compared to the growth in gross carrying amount.\n\nThe amortization expenses, which are part of the broader depreciation and amortization expenses, contributed to the reduction in the net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets. The overall depreciation and amortization expenses increased slightly from 2019 to 2020, aligning with the higher accumulated amortization observed in the intangible assets [8]. This suggests that while the company's investment in finite-lived intangible assets grew, the rate of amortization also increased, impacting the net carrying value.\n\nIn summary, the net carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to increased accumulated amortization, despite a slight increase in gross carrying amount.

In terms of shareholding, S Fallscheer began FY19 with 4,140,000 shares and purchased an additional 1,687,764 shares during the year, resulting in a total of 5,827,764 shares held by the end of FY20 [7]. This increase in shareholding indicates a potential strengthening of their stake in the company, aligning their interests more closely with shareholder wealth and possibly signaling confidence in the company's future performance.\n\nRegarding remuneration, the data from the remuneration table highlights changes in various components of S Fallscheer's compensation [6]. While specific figures are not detailed in the provided quotes, the structure of remuneration typically includes short-term employment benefits, performance-based payments, and share-based payments. The increase in shareholdings could also imply a greater emphasis on long-term incentives tied to the company's performance, as evidenced by the details of the Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) [4][5]. For instance, S Fallscheer was granted 956,328 performance rights/options in FY20, valued at $3,000,000, which vest on 3 July 2022 [4]. This suggests a focus on future performance and potential rewards contingent on achieving set targets.\n\nThe financial data from the company's performance, such as a decline in EBIT and net profit after tax from FY19 to FY20 [![Decline in EBIT and net profit](image1)], may have influenced these changes. Despite the reduced profitability, the company continued to invest in key management through share-based incentives, which could be aimed at retaining talent and motivating performance recovery. The vesting of these options in future years ties S Fallscheer's financial interests to the company's long-term success, potentially aligning their actions with shareholder interests.\n\nOverall, the changes in S Fallscheer's shareholding and remuneration structure imply a strategic approach to aligning executive incentives with shareholder outcomes, despite short-term financial challenges.

This indicates a rise in the perceived value of stock options over the years. For restricted shares, the weighted-average grant date fair value also increased from $229 per share in 2018 to $303 per share in 2020, reflecting a similar trend in valuation [6].\n\nIn 2020, the key financial assumptions used in valuing stock options included a risk-free interest rate ranging from 0.2% to 1.4%, expected volatility between 22.2% and 29.5%, an expected dividend yield of 1.4% to 1.7%, and an expected life of 5.1 years. These assumptions are crucial for determining the fair value of stock options, as they influence the expected future benefits and risks associated with the options [5]. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields, while expected volatilities are derived from historical and implied volatilities of the company's stock [6]. The expected dividend yield considers the company's dividend payments, and the expected life is estimated based on historical exercise patterns [6].\n\n![The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options increased from $43 in 2018 to $54 in 2020, and for restricted shares, it rose from $229 to $303](image6) The increase in these values suggests a growing valuation of the company's equity, aligning with broader market conditions and company performance.\n\nThe financial assumptions for 2020, such as lower risk-free rates and higher expected volatility compared to previous years, reflect the economic environment and the company's stock performance.

In 2019, service costs accounted for 89.3% of the total cost of revenues, amounting to RMB14,967 million. By 2020, this figure rose to RMB17,478 million, and further to RMB18,992 million in 2021, making up 87.0% of the total cost of revenues [6]. This indicates a growing investment in content and operational support, essential for expanding both online music services and social entertainment services. The increase in service costs is attributed to higher content costs, fees paid to content creators, and content delivery costs, which are critical for maintaining and enhancing the company's service offerings [8].\n\nOther cost of revenues, which include employee benefits and advertising agency fees, also increased from RMB1,794 million in 2019 to RMB2,848 million in 2021, contributing 13.0% to the total cost of revenues in the latter year [6]. This rise is primarily due to higher agency fees and payment channel fees, highlighting the company's expanding operational scale and increased transaction volumes [2].\n\nOperating expenses, particularly general and administrative expenses, showed a notable increase. In 2019, general and administrative expenses were RMB2,703 million, representing 57.0% of total operating expenses. By 2021, these expenses had risen to RMB4,009 million, accounting for 60.0% of total operating expenses [image2]. This growth is largely driven by increased R&D expenses, which escalated from RMB1,159 million in 2019 to RMB2,339 million in 2021, reflecting the company's commitment to innovation and technological advancement [5]. The emphasis on R&D is part of a strategy to enhance competitive advantages and improve product offerings, as evidenced by the consistent increase in R&D spending [10].\n\nSelling and marketing expenses, although a smaller portion of total operating expenses, also saw an increase from RMB2,041 million in "}

This indicates that the prices are based on actual production data, which is crucial for accurate analysis. \n\nLooking at the table in image3, which presents data on average production prices and costs for oil and gas in different regions for the years 2020 and 2019, we can observe the variations in pricing across regions and years. The table is organized by regions such as the United States, Canada, Other Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia/Oceania, and a Total column. It provides average production prices for crude oil, NGL, natural gas, bitumen, and synthetic oil, along with costs per oil-equivalent barrel [image3]. \n\nFor crude oil, the average production prices in 2020 were generally lower compared to 2019 across most regions. For instance, in the United States, the price decreased from $64.53 per barrel in 2019 to $60.61 per barrel in 2020. Similarly, in Canada/Other Americas, the price dropped from $69.57 to $66.89 per barrel. This trend is consistent across other regions as well, indicating a broad decline in crude oil prices over the two years [image3].\n\nFor NGL, the average production prices also showed a decrease from 2019 to 2020. In the United States, the price per barrel fell from $37.27 to $30.72. In Canada/Other Americas, it decreased from $38.53 to $36.34. This pattern of declining prices is observed in other regions, reflecting a similar downward trend in NGL prices [image3].\n\nThe text further explains that crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces, and these fluctuations have impacted earnings from Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical operations [12].

This decline is also evident in the reduction of new credit card accounts, which dropped from 4,320,000 in 2019 to 2,505,000 in 2020 [image7]. The gross interest yield on credit cards decreased from 10.76% in 2019 to 10.27% in 2020, while the risk-adjusted margin increased from 8.28 to 9.16, indicating a shift towards more profitable lending practices amidst reduced volume [image7]. Additionally, credit card purchase volumes fell by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion, driven by the pandemic's impact on spending, especially in travel and entertainment [10]. However, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion, suggesting a preference for debit over credit as businesses reopened and spending improved [10].\n\nIn the home equity segment, outstanding balances decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020, with 80% of the portfolio managed in Consumer Banking [1].

For coal, the report highlights that lower prices and volumes led to a substantial decrease in Underlying EBITDA by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021 [2]. This decline was driven by lower price impacts of US$0.7 billion and reduced volumes impacting Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million. Additionally, increased controllable cash costs, such as maintenance and stripping volumes, further strained profitability, though cost reduction initiatives provided some offset [2]. The table in image6 shows that while total metallurgical coal production remained stable at 41 Mt in both 2021 and 2020, the average realized price dropped from US$130.97 to US$106.64 per ton, reflecting the adverse price environment. Energy coal production decreased from 23 Mt to 19 Mt, with a slight increase in average realized price from US$57.10 to US$58.42 per ton, indicating mixed impacts on revenue [![image6](image6)]. \n\nFor nickel, the financial performance improved with Underlying EBITDA increasing by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, attributed to higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns in the prior year [9]. The average realized sales price for nickel rose to US$16,250 per ton in FY2021 from US$13,860 per ton in FY2020, driven by strong demand and supply disruptions [6].

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, reduced loan balances, and other factors such as unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results and higher securities premium amortization [7]. Despite this, the net interest income in 2021 included $518 million from PPP loans and $1.1 billion from loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools, which partially offset the negative impacts [7].\n\nConversely, noninterest income saw a substantial increase of $5,120 million, representing a 104% growth from 2020 to 2021 [2]. This surge was largely attributed to higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory fees, as well as gains from the sale of the Corporate Trust Services business, student loan portfolio, and WFAM [9]. However, this growth was partially offset by lower lease income due to a $268 million impairment of rail cars used for coal transportation [9].\n\nThe combined effect of these changes on total revenue was a net positive, with total revenue increasing by $3,138 million, or 59%, from 2020 to 2021 [2].

According to the table in image1, the total gross and net productive wells for equity companies in Europe are listed for both years. In 2019, the gross productive wells were 49, and the net productive wells were 3. In 2020, the gross productive wells remained the same at 49, while the net productive wells decreased to 3. This indicates that there was no change in the gross productive wells, but the net productive wells remained stable as well.\n\nNext, we look at the developed acreage data from image7. For equity companies in Europe, the gross developed acreage in 2019 was 4,069 thousand acres, and the net developed acreage was 1,280 thousand acres. In 2020, the gross developed acreage decreased slightly to 3,667 thousand acres, and the net developed acreage decreased to 1,118 thousand acres. This shows a reduction in both gross and net developed acreage for equity companies in Europe from 2019 to 2020.\n\nCombining these observations, we can conclude that while the gross and net productive wells for equity companies in Europe remained unchanged from 2019 to 2020, there was a decrease in both gross and net developed acreage.\n\n![Gross and net productive wells for equity companies in Europe remained unchanged from 2019 to 2020](image1)  \n![Gross developed acreage for equity companies in Europe decreased from 4,069 to 3,667 thousand acres, and net developed acreage decreased from 1,280 to 1,118 thousand acres from 2019 to 2020](image7)\n\nIn summary, the total gross and net productive wells for equity companies in Europe did not change from 2019 to 2020, but the developed acreage decreased."}

Firstly, the decrease in income tax payments played a crucial role, as tax deductions from the senior notes exchange reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in 2021, more than offsetting the higher taxable income from operations [4]. Additionally, the company's operating income increased from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, reflecting stronger operational performance [6][image6]. The changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed, with a decrease in the negative impact from $178 million in 2020 to $1,499 million in 2021, indicating better management of working capital [image6].

This substantial increase was primarily driven by several key factors. Firstly, higher margins on refined product sales contributed $1.6 billion to the earnings, reflecting improved market conditions and operational efficiencies [2]. Additionally, earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem added $1.0 billion, indicating stronger performance from joint ventures [2]. Higher sales volumes of $470 million also played a role, suggesting increased demand or production capacity utilization [2].

One key aspect of these policies is the provision of parental leave, which is crucial for supporting employees with family responsibilities. According to the data, a total of 21,746 female employees and 98,347 male employees are entitled to parental leave, indicating a significant disparity in entitlements, likely due to the traditional gender roles where women are more likely to take primary caregiving responsibilities [5]. However, the usage of parental leave shows that 1,025 females and 2,023 males have availed it, suggesting that while more males are entitled, a higher proportion of females who are entitled actually use the leave [image5]. \n\nThe return-to-work statistics after parental leave provide further insights. Out of those who availed the leave, 967 females (94%) and 1,941 males (96%) returned to work, showing a high return rate for both genders. However, only 66 females (6%) and 75 males (4%) were still employed 12 months after returning, which highlights a challenge in retaining employees post-leave, particularly for women [image5]. This could reflect broader issues in balancing work and family life, despite the bank's efforts to support women through initiatives like flexi work time and part-time arrangements [11].\n\nThe graphical representation of workforce diversity indicators also sheds light on gender distribution across different roles and age groups. For instance, in senior management, only 4% are female compared to 6% male, indicating underrepresentation at higher levels [image6]. This aligns with the bank's goal to increase women's representation to 25% by FY25 through programs like Careers 2.0 and the Career Accelerator Programme [5]. The data on new hires and attrition by region further illustrates that while efforts are being made to hire more women, attrition rates are higher for females in some regions, such as the South and West, which may impact overall gender diversity [image7].\n\nOverall, while HDFC Bank has made strides in offering parental leave and promoting gender diversity, the data suggests that more targeted efforts are needed to improve retention and representation, especially in leadership roles. The bank's commitment to addressing unconscious biases and creating an inclusive environment is crucial for achieving these goals [4].\n\n![Parental leave data highlights disparities"}

The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased from 8.3% to 8.4% [image1, image8], while the SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio) rose from 6.4% to 7.4% [image1, image8]. These changes were influenced by adjustments in adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure, as well as the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks under a temporary rule, which increased the SLR by 80 basis points [4, image8].\n\nIn summary, both risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios improved from 2019 to 2020, driven by capital increases and regulatory adjustments. ![Risk-based capital ratios improved from 2019 to 2020](image6) ![Leverage-based capital ratios also showed improvements](image8)\n\nThe risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios increased from 2019 to 2020 under both approaches due to capital growth and regulatory adjustments."}

In contrast, the 'Other expense' saw a reduction from $94 million in fiscal year 2019 to $18 million in fiscal year 2020, marking a decrease in expense of $76 million [5]. This decrease in 'Other expense' is primarily due to lower interest expense on debt and operating leases, offset by investment income, which increased by $61 million in fiscal 2020 due to higher interest income from larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances [1]. \n\n![Gains on strategic investments, net decreased by $115 million and Other expense decreased by $76 million from fiscal year 2019 to 2020](image5)\n\nThe 'Gains on strategic investments, net' decreased by $115 million, and 'Other expense' decreased by $76 million from fiscal year 2019 to 2020."}

The decrease in 2021 for Tencent Group might suggest adjustments or settlements that reduced the payable amounts compared to the peak in 2020. This dynamic could be influenced by strategic partnerships, such as the five-year strategic partnership with China Literature mentioned in the text, which might have impacted transaction volumes and payable amounts. [4]\n\nIn summary, the accounts payable to related parties, especially Tencent Group, initially rose sharply from 2019 to 2020 but saw a slight decline in 2021, while obligations to associates increased steadily over the three years."}

Moving to 2020, the company faced a substantial pre-tax loss of $764 million, reflecting the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities [4]. This significant loss in 2020 was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt, as well as the Great Britain Pound denominated debt of Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) [9]. \n\nIn 2021, the situation reversed, with Berkshire and BHFC recording a pre-tax gain of $955 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar senior notes [4].

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $10,865 million, which increased to $14,821 million in 2019, and further to $15,533 million in 2020 [7]. This upward trend can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the net earnings, a major component of comprehensive income, grew consistently over the years. Net earnings were $12,382 million in 2018, $14,239 million in 2019, and $15,769 million in 2020 [7]. This growth was driven by increased revenues and improved operational efficiency, as evidenced by the 6% increase in consolidated revenues and a 14% rise in earnings from operations in 2020 [1]. The strong performance of Optum, with a 21% revenue growth, and United Healthcare, which saw a 20% increase in earnings, significantly contributed to these results [1].\n\nHowever, other comprehensive income components showed variability. In 2018, other comprehensive income was a loss of $1,517 million, primarily due to foreign currency translation losses of $1,242 million [7]. By 2019, other comprehensive income turned positive at $582 million, largely because of reduced foreign currency translation losses ($271 million) and higher unrealized gains on investment securities ($1,212 million) [7]. In 2020, other comprehensive income was a loss of $236 million, mainly due to increased foreign currency translation losses ($983 million) and lower unrealized gains on investment securities ($1,058 million) [7]. Despite these losses, the overall comprehensive income still grew due to the substantial increase in net earnings.\n\nThe comprehensive income attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders also reflected these trends, rising from $10,469 million in 2018 to $14,421 million in 2019, and $15,167 million in 2020 [7].

This decline of 72 basis points over the two-year period can be attributed to several factors. \n\nFirstly, the decrease in core merchandise categories was a significant contributor. The gross margin in these categories, expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased by 27 basis points, with the most notable decline in fresh foods [8]. This was primarily driven by higher inflation and increased costs in fresh foods and foods and sundries, which negatively impacted the overall gross margin [5]. Additionally, a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs further reduced the gross margin by 19 basis points [5].\n\nSecondly, the impact of gasoline price inflation played a role. While higher gasoline prices positively affected net sales by $9,230 million in 2022, they generally have a lower gross margin percentage compared to non-gasoline business, thus lowering the overall gross margin percentage [11]. The increase in gasoline sales volume by 22% also contributed to this effect [11].\n\nThirdly, the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19 provided a slight positive impact of five basis points on the gross margin, but this was offset by a one-time charge for granting employees an additional day of paid time off [5]. Furthermore, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted the gross margin by approximately $176 million, primarily affecting Other International Operations [5].\n\nLastly, the shift in sales mix toward warehouse ancillary and other businesses, which have lower gross margins, also contributed to the overall decline. Although these businesses positively impacted the gross margin by 29 basis points, the broader impact of higher inflation and cost increases in core categories outweighed this benefit [5].\n\nIn summary, the gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022, primarily due to higher inflation, increased costs in core merchandise, the impact of gasoline sales, and currency fluctuations, partially offset by operational adjustments and sales mix changes.\n\n![Gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022](image8)"}

Specifically, the core gross profit in 2020 was adjusted from an IFRS result of $29,896 million to a core result of $33,275 million, with adjustments primarily involving amortization of intangible assets [7]. This indicates that the cost of goods sold was reduced by these adjustments, leading to a higher core gross profit.\n\nIn 2021, the adjustments to the cost of goods sold included amortization of intangible assets and other items, which also contributed to an increase in the core gross profit. The IFRS gross profit for 2021 was $32,218 million, and after adjustments totaling $3,763 million (amortization of $3,419 million and other items of $344 million), the core gross profit reached $35,981 million [8]. This shows a similar pattern to 2020, where the adjustments reduced the cost of goods sold, thereby increasing the core gross profit.\n\nComparing the two years, the adjustments in 2021 were more substantial in terms of the absolute amount, with a larger impact on the core gross profit due to higher amortization of intangible assets. The core gross profit increased by $5,085 million from 2020 to 2021, reflecting the significant adjustments made to the cost of goods sold in both years.

This increase can be attributed to several factors. \n\nFirstly, the company issued new long-term debt in both years. In 2020, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025 and another $750 million due in 2030, with net proceeds of $749 million and $749 million respectively, after accounting for issuance discounts [7][9].

The increase in net earnings is attributed to several factors, including a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes and interest expense in the current year, and a reduction in shares outstanding.

Additionally, the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) also worsened, moving from a loss of $2,895 million in 2020 to $2,945 million in 2021, primarily driven by significant foreign currency translation adjustments, which increased from a loss of $2,229 million in 2020 to $2,392 million in 2021 [3].

However, the company's ability to maintain positive cash flow from operations helped mitigate the reduction in retained earnings.

In 2022, total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million to $4,091 million, primarily due to reductions in loss and other carryforwards and pension and other retiree benefits [6]. This decrease suggests a potential reduction in future tax benefits available to the company. Conversely, deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million to $9,288 million, largely driven by higher amounts in goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, and unrealized gains on financial and foreign exchange transactions [7].

This aligns with the text's explanation that Activision Blizzard retains the discretion to adjust performance objectives by substituting or combining OI and AOP OI objectives of different business units [3][12]. \n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that the actual number of shares vested can vary based on performance relative to the grant date measure, and if conditions are not met, unvested RSUs are forfeited [6]. The image further clarifies that vesting is evaluated annually, with each year's vesting contingent on meeting the respective year's financial criteria [8]. This structured approach ensures that vesting is directly linked to the company's financial performance, incentivizing employees to contribute to meeting or exceeding the set objectives.\n\nIn summary, the conditions for restricted share units vesting over the first three years are based on meeting or exceeding the Non-GAAP Operating Income targets set in the Annual Operating Plan for each respective year, with adjustments possible at the company's discretion. \n\nThe conditions for restricted share units vesting over the first three years are contingent upon meeting the Non-GAAP Operating Income targets set in the Annual Operating Plan for each year."}

By 2020, this shifted to a cost of $239 million, reflecting a reversal in the funding status. In 2021, the cost increased dramatically to $1,122 million, primarily due to a substantial mark-to-market loss of $833 million, which was driven by higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to 2020 [5]. This loss was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return [5].

The absence of an estimated mark-to-market gain or loss for 2022 suggests that the expected cost is based solely on other factors like discount rates and expected returns on plan assets [8].

Initially, in 1998, the focus was heavily skewed toward Seed investments, which accounted for 78% of the total, with only 18% allocated to Early Stage and a mere 4% to Mid-Stage.

This shift suggests a strategic pivot toward supporting companies that had already demonstrated initial viability and were ready for scaling, reflecting a maturation in the venture capital ecosystem. The decline in Seed investments could be attributed to the post-bubble environment, where investors became more cautious and selective, as highlighted by the scarcity of VC money in Europe, which drove up capital efficiency and yield due to increased selectivity [3].

According to the data, 64% of Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 33% align with the Republican Party [1]. This trend is supported by a Pew Research Center study, which found that Latino voters' party affiliation has not significantly changed in recent years [7].

A survey indicates that 45% of all Hispanics believe there is \"a great deal of difference\" between the parties, with similar perceptions among both Democratic-leaning (47%) and Republican-leaning (48%) Latinos [8]. This suggests that while party alignment remains consistent, the perceived distinctions between the parties are recognized by a significant portion of the Latino electorate ![Perceived differences among Hispanics](image8).\n\nAdditionally, the image comparing perceptions of racial discrimination highlights differing views based on political affiliation. Among Latino voters, 35% of all Latinos see racial discrimination where it does not exist, while 61% do not see existing discrimination. This perception varies significantly between Democratic-leaning (25% see non-existent discrimination) and Republican-leaning (62% see non-existent discrimination) voters ![Perceptions of racial discrimination](image2). This divergence in views may contribute to the perceived differences between the parties.\n\nIn summary, Latino registered voters' alignment with the Democratic Party has remained steady, and they perceive notable differences between the parties, particularly in issues like racial discrimination and political figures like Trump. The stability in party affiliation contrasts with the dynamic shifts in issue importance, such as abortion, which rose from 42% to 57% in importance among Hispanic voters after the Supreme Court's decision ![Shift in issue importance](image3).\n\nThe alignment of Latino registered voters with the Democratic Party has remained stable over recent years, with 64% identifying with or leaning toward the Democratic Party and 33% toward the Republican Party.

Telkomsel, the largest operator, maintained its dominance with a substantial subscriber base of 139.3 million and a notable increase in data users to 63.5 million by late 2014 [image2]. This growth in data users suggests a strong adoption of data-driven services, aligning with the trend of increased data usage and the decline in traditional voice and SMS services [1, 5, 9]. XL, with 58.3 million subscribers, also saw a rise in data users to 32 million, indicating a shift towards data-centric offerings [image2]. Indosat, with 54.2 million subscribers, reported 29 million data users, showing a similar trend [image2]. \n\nThe decline in voice and SMS ARPU, as depicted in the line graph from 2013 to 2017, underscores the industry-wide shift towards data services [image1]. This trend is further supported by the high usage of instant messaging (IM) platforms, with 90% of mobile users engaging in IM daily [11]. The consistent growth in mobile subscribers, reaching 240 million by early 2014, highlights the expanding market [10]. The data user numbers for all three operators suggest a successful pivot towards data services, driven by the increasing popularity of smartphones and data-based communication tools [6, 11].\n\nThe bar chart comparing various metrics for different providers reinforces Telkomsel's lead in both subscribers and data users, with XL and Indosat following [image6].

As generations advance, the connection to Hispanic identity and the perception of living in a Hispanic community weaken, influenced by factors such as intermarriage and lower immigration levels [7].\n\nIn summary, perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity decrease across generations, with higher generations feeling less connected to predominantly Hispanic communities. This trend is consistent with broader patterns of assimilation and changing identity dynamics among U.S. Hispanics. \n\nThe answer is: Perceptions of neighborhood Hispanic identity decrease across generations, with higher generations feeling less connected to predominantly Hispanic communities."}

Initially, the supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004, as noted in the text [5]. This period was marked by a dramatic shift in the venture capital landscape, with many funds struggling post-bubble, as evidenced by the decline in the number of active VC funds from 1,600 in 1999 to 711 in 2011, a 63% reduction ![Reduction in active VC funds from 1999 to 2011](image6). This scarcity of capital led to lower entry valuations and increased capital efficiency, with European VC achieving roughly 70% higher efficiency than the US [10].\n\nDespite the reduction in the number of funds, the quality and performance of the remaining funds improved. The text highlights that European VC has emerged with strong fundamentals, benefiting from a higher capital efficiency and a mature ecosystem that allows companies to scale faster and achieve more value sooner [2][3]. This is further illustrated by the success of European companies, with many achieving significant financial milestones such as valuations over $1 billion and returns exceeding tenfold, as shown in the chart ![Financial success of European companies](image1).\n\nThe market dynamics also shifted, with a growing demand-supply imbalance. The line graph from 2000 to 2010 shows that while the supply of capital dropped sharply post-2004, demand began to rise, particularly with an exit boom starting around 2005, which drove up demand ![Supply and demand shifts in VC market](image2). This created a \"current supply gap\" by 2009-2010, indicating that the available capital was insufficient to meet the growing number of viable investment opportunities.\n\nMoreover, the post-bubble vintages, which effectively began in 2004/2005, showed improved performance, as evidenced by recent exits across top-tier funds. European IPOs also demonstrated better post-IPO performance compared to US IPOs from 2004 to 2011 ![Better post-IPO performance of European IPOs](image4). This suggests that the European VC market, though smaller in scale compared to the US [3][image3], has been more efficient and selective, leading to stronger outcomes for investors"}

Among those who support it, the primary reasons include the belief that it would be effective in identifying individuals who are deserving of parole [12], and that it could introduce fairness and reduce bias by providing a more objective assessment [4]. Some also argue that it should be one of several factors considered in the decision-making process, acknowledging the complexity of human judgment [4]. Additionally, there is a sentiment that people deserve a second chance, and the system could help identify repeat offenders more accurately [4].\n\nOn the other hand, a significant portion of the population opposes the use of automated criminal risk scores. The main concerns revolve around the lack of individual focus, as many believe that every individual and circumstance is unique, and a computer program may fail to capture these nuances [7][10][11]. There is also a strong belief that people can change, and a rigid system might not account for personal growth or development [7][11]. The fear of unfair bias or profiling is another critical issue, with worries that the algorithm might perpetuate existing biases or violate privacy [7][11].

The left side of the image lists four critical facts: increasing world population, increasing energy demand, limited energy supplies, and environmental effects of energy use. These points highlight the interconnected issues that the world faces as it grows and consumes more resources. The increasing world population [7] directly correlates with higher energy demand, which is evident from the steady rise in the number of vehicles over the years, as shown in image6, where the growth in vehicle numbers indicates a surge in energy consumption. However, this demand is met with limited energy supplies, as depicted in image3, where crude availability peaks and then declines, emphasizing the finite nature of fossil fuels.

According to the data, younger Americans (ages 18-29) are slightly more inclined to promote human rights, with 76% favoring this stance, compared to 21% who prioritize economic relations [5]. This trend continues among those aged 30-49, where 75% support human rights over economic ties, with 22% choosing economic relations [5]. However, older Americans (ages 50 and above) show a slight decrease in this preference, with 71% advocating for human rights and 24% prioritizing economic relations [5].

Among self-identified Hispanics, the majority are third or higher generation, making up 65% of the group, while 29% are second generation, and only 18% are foreign born [6]. This indicates a growing distance from immigrant roots, which aligns with the trend that Hispanic identity fades as connections to ancestral origins diminish [8]. For instance, 82% of foreign-born Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their country of origin, but this drops to 69% among second-generation Hispanics and only 44% among third or higher generation Hispanics [9]. This decline in connection is also reflected in self-identification patterns, where foreign-born individuals are more likely to often identify as Hispanic (57%) compared to second-generation (50%) and third or higher generation (33%) individuals ![Self-identification varies by generation](image1).\n\nThe image showing generational makeup further highlights that among self-identified Hispanics, the third or higher generation dominates, whereas non-Hispanics are almost entirely (96%) third or higher generation [6]. This suggests that as generations progress, the likelihood of identifying as Hispanic decreases, and non-Hispanic heritage becomes more common [11]. The chart illustrating self-identification terms also shows that 50% of self-identified Hispanics prefer to identify by their country of origin/heritage, while 23% use \"Hispanic/Latino\" and another 23% identify as \"American\" [image2]. This preference for \"American\" likely increases among later generations, as seen in the data where third or higher generation Hispanics are less likely to live in largely Latino neighborhoods (30%) and have fewer Latino friends (37%) compared to earlier generations [4][5].\n\nAdditionally, the image depicting reasons for not identifying as Hispanic reveals that 27% cite a mixed background or distant Hispanic ancestry, and 16% mention upbringing with no contact with Hispanic relatives [image7].

According to the Pew Research Center survey, while 52% of Americans still see their country as the world’s leading economic power in 2020, this is down from 59% in March, marking an unprecedented high [1].

Initially, the population surged dramatically, growing from just 130 in 1870 to 8,267 by 1880 and peaking at 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This rapid increase was driven by the Homestead Act of 1862, which attracted settlers by offering 160 acres of land to those who built a permanent structure and resided there for five years [5]. The Transcontinental Railroad Act also played a crucial role, as the Union Pacific Railroad transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state, drawing pioneers from states like Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and New England, as well as immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia [2][5]. These settlers established ethnic enclaves across the county, contributing to its cultural diversity [2][7].\n\n![Hamilton County's population growth from 1870 to 1890](image2) illustrates this explosive growth, with the population reaching its highest point in 1890. However, after this peak, the population began a slow decline, dropping to 13,330 by 1900 and continuing to decrease through the 20th century, with some fluctuations [1]. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The mechanization of agriculture led to farm consolidation, reducing the number of farms and increasing the average farm size, which diminished the need for a large rural workforce [6]. By 1900, Hamilton County had over 2,000 farms, but by 2002, this number had dwindled to 603, with the average farm size rising to 577 acres [6]. This shift reduced the population in rural areas as people moved to larger towns or urban centers for better opportunities.\n\n![Population data showing the decline after 1890](image2) highlights the steady decrease, with Hamilton County's population reaching 9,403 by 2000. The decline was also influenced by the dependency on rail connections for town development; towns without rail lines often lost businesses and residents to more connected areas [10]. For instance, the town of Hamilton was abandoned after Aurora became the county seat, demonstrating how transportation patterns affected population distribution [10].\n\n"}

Currently, with a peak service of 5 trains per hour and 5 cars per train, the total number of train cars needed during peak hours is 25 [1]. When considering the use of Metrolink's used cars, the peak service increases to 6 trains per hour with 5 cars per train, resulting in a requirement of 30 train cars [4]. This scenario is illustrated in the table from image4, which shows the transition from the current service to a more frequent service using existing resources ![Current service to Metrolink used cars](image4).\n\nElectrification of the trains further enhances capacity, allowing for a peak service of 6 trains per hour with 6 cars per train, necessitating 36 train cars during peak hours. This improvement is also detailed in image4, highlighting the impact of electrification on service capacity ![Electrification impact](image4). Extending platforms to accommodate longer trains leads to a peak service of 6 trains per hour with 8 cars per train, requiring 48 train cars, as shown in the same table ![Platform extension impact](image4).\n\nThe most substantial increase in capacity is achieved by increasing frequency, potentially with the integration of High-Speed Rail (HSR), which results in a peak service of 8 trains per hour with 8 cars per train, requiring 64 train cars during peak hours. This scenario represents the highest capacity improvement among the options presented ![Frequency increase with HSR](image4).\n\nThese changes in peak hour train car requirements reflect the need to accommodate growing ridership and improve service efficiency.

However, this division is further nuanced when considering their leanings. Among those who lean Democratic, 69% support regulation, while only 31% of those with no political lean and 33% of Republican leaners agree [5].

For instance, Galician (GL) to English (EN) shows a substantial increase of up to 11 BLEU points, as highlighted in the text [2]. This improvement is attributed to pre-trained embeddings aiding in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating more grammatically well-formed sentences, as evidenced by the successful translation of terms like \"Chris,\" \"big lawyer,\" and \"patent legislation\" [1]. The table in image3 further illustrates this by showing bold numbers indicating notable improvements in BLEU scores for GL→EN under pre-trained conditions, emphasizing the effectiveness of pre-training in low-resource scenarios.\n\nIn contrast, higher-resource languages like Portuguese (PT) to English (EN) exhibit consistent gains of approximately 3 BLEU points [2]. The table in image3 also reflects this consistency, with PT→EN showing moderate improvements under pre-trained conditions. However, the impact of pre-training is more pronounced when the baseline system is moderately effective, typically with a BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [11]. This trend is visible in image7, where the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes, especially for languages like Portuguese (Pt) and Turkish (Tr), as shown in the bottom graph.\n\nThe similarity between source and target languages also influences the efficacy of pre-training. For example, GL/PT, which shares a high similarity, demonstrates the largest gains, while BE/RU, with lower similarity, shows minimal improvement or even a slight decrease [10]. Image2 supports this by showing larger improvements for language pairs with less common linguistic features, such as Hebrew (HE) to Portuguese (PT), which sees an increase of +8.9 BLEU points. Aligning word embeddings further enhances these gains, as seen in image4, where aligned conditions often yield higher scores than unaligned ones, particularly for GL→EN and RU→EN.\n\nIn multilingual systems, pre-training and alignment of embeddings lead to better performance compared to bilingual systems. Image5 highlights this by showing higher \"align\" scores for GL+PT evaluated on GL, indicating that shared encoders benefit from aligned embeddings. The table in image5 also demonstrates that pre-training helps more in multilingual setups, as seen in the \"pre\" and \"align\" columns, which outperform the \"bi\" baseline.\n\nOverall, pre-training is most beneficial for low-resource languages and when training data is limited, as it helps bootstrap"}

These figures suggest that while there is a notable level of consensus, the presence of disagreements highlights the subjective nature of evaluating mixed-modal responses. The variability in agreement levels across different comparisons underscores the complexity of assessing performance in tasks requiring both text and image generation, as annotators may have differing interpretations of relevance and quality [6].\n\nFurthermore, ![Chameleon vs. Gemini](image5) and ![Chameleon vs. GPT-4V](image5) show slightly lower unanimous agreement rates (30.2% and 28.6%, respectively), with higher instances of no agreement (10.5% and 13.1%).

The image4 provides a detailed comparison of different model variants across several datasets, including BoolQ, using metrics such as AUPRC.\n\nFrom image4, we observe that the AUPRC values for the BoolQ dataset are reported for different model combinations.

According to the text, as the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is a noticeable improvement in performance, but further increases (e.g., ≥10) yield limited additional gains [4]. This suggests that while more demonstrations can enhance understanding, there is a point of diminishing returns. \n\n![The graph shows the performance (Micro-F1 score) of different models/datasets with and without logical constraints as the number of demonstration samples increases](image1) illustrates this trend visually. The left graph in the image demonstrates that incorporating logical constraints consistently leads to higher Micro-F1 scores across different numbers of demonstration samples. For instance, with 5 demonstrations, MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints achieves a Micro-F1 of 25.7%, surpassing the 24.5% obtained with 10 demonstrations without logical constraints [4]. This highlights the importance of combining logical constraints with a moderate number of demonstrations to optimize performance.\n\nFurthermore, the text emphasizes that adding logical constraints into LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially when paired with more demonstrations [4].

This aligns with the findings that over 90% of errors occur during the Reasoning step, with Reasoning Error and Math Error being the major loss buckets [12]. \n\n![Reasoning Error is the most frequent error type in Step-Back Prompting on TimeQA](image6) illustrates that Reasoning Error constitutes 55% of the errors, significantly outpacing other error types such as Math Error (25%), Context Loss (7%), and Principle Error (9%).

This method is effective but requires access to model parameters and training data, which can be limiting for large, inaccessible models [12]. \n\nGeneration-time correction, as shown in image1, uses automated feedback to guide the model during output generation.

In the single-task model [11], there is a single decoder that attends to the states of the encoder directly. This setup involves encoding the input sequence into hidden states, which are then used by the attention mechanism to produce context vectors that inform the decoder states, ultimately guiding the output prediction through a softmax function. This straightforward approach focuses solely on the encoder's hidden states for generating the output sequence.\n\nIn contrast, the multitask model [12] introduces a more complex architecture by incorporating two separate decoders, each with its own attention mechanism.

This means that while the encoder's hidden states are shared, the attention mechanisms and context vectors for each decoder are distinct, allowing each decoder to focus on different aspects of the input sequence. This separation enables the model to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as speech transcription and translation, by learning task-specific representations from the shared encoder states.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the multitask model's ability to maintain separate attention mechanisms for each decoder, enabling it to address multiple objectives without directly influencing one another's attention weights.

According to the evidence, LLM reranking significantly enhances performance on hard samples (those with lower confidence scores), while it tends to degrade performance on easy samples (those with higher confidence scores). This is consistent with the findings that LLMs are more proficient in handling complex or challenging instances that require external knowledge or sophisticated reasoning, as opposed to straightforward samples where SLMs perform better [2].\n\n![LLM reranking improves performance on hard samples but degrades it on easy samples](image6) shows that for the FewNERD dataset, the blue line (with LLM reranking) consistently outperforms the pink line (without LLM reranking) in the lower confidence score range, indicating a substantial improvement in micro-F1 for hard samples. Conversely, for samples with higher confidence scores, the performance with LLM reranking is lower, reflecting the degradation mentioned in the text. This aligns with the hypothesis that LLMs excel in rectifying errors in hard samples but underperform on easy ones [2].\n\nThe adaptive filter-then-rerank paradigm addresses this by selectively reranking only the hard samples identified by SLMs, thereby leveraging the strengths of both models. This approach ensures that LLMs focus on the samples where they can add the most value, while SLMs handle the straightforward cases efficiently. The results demonstrate that this method leads to a significant performance boost on hard samples, contributing to an overall improvement in micro-F1 scores [4][5][8].\n\nIn summary, LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance on hard samples with lower confidence scores but decreases it on easy samples with higher confidence scores for the FewNERD dataset.

At each level, it selects the top nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query vector, progressively focusing on finer details as it descends through the lower layers [8]. This method allows for controlled specificity and breadth by adjusting the depth and number of nodes selected at each layer, offering a broad outlook initially and narrowing down to finer details [9]. However, this approach maintains a constant ratio of thematic information to granular details, which may not always align with the question's requirements [3].\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method simplifies the process by flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer, evaluating all nodes simultaneously based on cosine similarity [10]. This approach offers greater flexibility, as it retrieves information at the correct level of granularity for a given question by searching through all nodes at once [3]. The collapsed tree method is shown to perform better, especially with a context length of 2000 tokens, as it peaks in F1 score and slightly decreases as the context length increases to 2500 [![The collapsed tree method peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score](image4)]. This flexibility allows it to adapt more effectively to the complexity of the query compared to the tree traversal method, which shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length but overall performs lower [![The collapsed tree method outperforms tree traversal](image4)].\n\nThe qualitative analysis further highlights the advantage of RAPTOR's tree structure over Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) methods. For thematic, multi-hop questions, RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval allows it to choose nodes from different tree layers, matching the question’s detail level, often yielding more relevant and comprehensive information [2]. This is illustrated in the Cinderella fairytale example, where RAPTOR selects nodes from various layers depending on the granularity required, encompassing the information retrieved by DPR directly or through summarization [![RAPTOR selects nodes from different layers for thematic questions](image6)].\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval offers a structured, layer-by-layer approach with controlled specificity, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval provides a flexible, simultaneous evaluation of all nodes, adapting better to"}

Unlike traditional detection methods that rely on spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression, DETR simplifies the detection pipeline by using these object queries to directly predict all objects at once [2]. The object queries are transformed through the decoder, which employs multi-headed self- and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms to globally reason about the relations between objects and the entire image context [5]. This allows the model to process all objects in parallel, enhancing its ability to handle complex scenes and large objects effectively [7].\n\n![The DETR model uses object queries as learned positional encodings to predict objects in parallel](image4) The architecture starts with a CNN backbone that extracts image features, which are then passed to the transformer encoder-decoder.

The object queries are essential for ensuring that each prediction is unique and distinct, as they are transformed independently by the decoder [5].

While it is less resource-intensive, the results indicate that in-context learning does not match the performance gains achieved through fine-tuning [12]. For example, models fine-tuned using the FGVC-Aircraft dataset consistently outperform those using in-context learning prompts across almost all datasets for both QWen-VL and InternLM-XC2 [12]. This suggests that while in-context learning is valuable for its flexibility, fine-tuning provides a more substantial boost in accuracy.\n\nThe comparison between fine-tuning and in-context learning is further illustrated in the performance metrics across various datasets. Fine-tuning the InternLM-XC2 model with target datasets like FGVC-Aircraft significantly bolsters its ranking capabilities, as evidenced by the higher average performance values in the evaluation tables [image5]. The green-highlighted numbers in these tables indicate that fine-tuning leads to the highest performance for specific dataset and strategy combinations, underscoring its efficacy [image5]. In contrast, in-context learning, while effective, does not achieve the same level of improvement, highlighting the trade-off between flexibility and performance.\n\nIn summary"}

The study involves examining users with extremely high scores for certain personality traits, particularly those in the top 10 for each trait, to evaluate the accuracy of personality detection [3]. The personality traits are based on the OCEAN model, which includes Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism [7].\n\nImage2 provides a visual representation of different methods for incorporating personality scores into a model.

However, when incorporating contextual augmentation with a label-conditional architecture, the average score increases to 77.83 [image1].

This approach allows for a wider range of word substitutions compared to synonym-based methods, which are limited to words with nearly identical meanings [9]. The label-conditional architecture further enhances this by ensuring that the substitutions align with the original sentiment label, as shown in the predictions for the sentence \"the actors are fantastic\" where positive and negative labels yield different word replacements [image2].\n\nThe experimental results demonstrate that contextual augmentation with label conditioning significantly boosts model performance across various datasets, outperforming synonym-based augmentation [10].

This foundational step ensures that the model understands the desired tone and style of the generated pairs while providing essential image information such as bounding boxes and descriptions [4].\n\nFollowing this, the **Cold Start** phase is initiated. This stage is crucial for identifying the best system message and in-context examples. It involves querying instruction-response pairs in a dataset using a heuristic approach until satisfactory examples are obtained. This step is vital for enhancing the quality of the coreset, which impacts subsequent data collection [4].\n\nIn **Step 2: Generate Instruction-Response Pairs**, ChatGPT is utilized to create these pairs. The model generates responses based on the visual context, including timestamps, captions, and object information, targeting the fundamental capabilities of vision-language models: perception, reasoning, and planning [12]. This step leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT to produce diverse and creative pairs that align with real-world visual content [7].\n\n**Step 3: Filtering** is then applied to ensure the quality of the generated pairs. ChatGPT is again employed to filter out low-quality or irrelevant pairs, refining the dataset to maintain high standards [4].\n\nFinally, **Step 4: Translation** expands the instruction-response pairs into eight languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, Korean, and Arabic.

However, the introduction of relation propagation in \"DyGIE-RelProp\" aims to mitigate this decline, although it is not as effective as the base \"DyGIE\" model without relation propagation. This suggests that while relation propagation helps in managing the complexity introduced by multiple entities, its effectiveness is limited compared to the base model.\n\nThe text evidence supports this observation by noting that relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities, where broader context is beneficial [1]. The dynamic span graph approach in DyGIE enhances interaction across tasks, allowing the model to learn useful information from broader context, which is crucial for handling sentences with multiple entities [2]. The model's ability to propagate relations among likely entity spans helps in capturing different relation types, as indicated by the tensor capturing scores for each relation type [6]. However, the ReLU function is used to filter out unlikely relations, reducing noise from all possible span pairs [4].\n\nThe performance metrics further illustrate the impact of relation propagation.

When repetition control is applied, it tends to reduce the number of questions produced by the model. This is evident from the analysis in the text, which states that introducing repetition control decreases the question-asking rate from 97.72% to 79.67% when the control level is set to 10 [10]. The primary reason for this reduction is the use of the \"extrep bigram\" feature in weighted decoding, which discourages the repetition of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. Since many questions contain common bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is,\" this feature inadvertently limits the model's ability to generate questions. To mitigate this, an additional setting, \"z = 10 (boost),\" is introduced, which allows the model to bypass the \"extrep bigram\" feature during beam search while still using it for reranking candidates. This adjustment enables the model to achieve a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with a slight increase in external bigram repetition [10].\n\n![Repetition control reduces question-asking frequency](image4) illustrates this effect visually. The graph shows that while the \"Question-controlled CT\" line (blue with circles) approaches near 100% question frequency as the control level increases, the \"Question-controlled CT with repetition control\" line (purple with squares) shows a more gradual increase, peaking at around 80%. This demonstrates that repetition control constrains the model's ability to ask questions, aligning with the text's explanation [10].\n\nFurthermore, the text highlights that controlling repetition is crucial for improving engagingness, as it addresses a major limitation of naive sequence-to-sequence dialogue agents [11]. However, this control must be balanced with other attributes like question-asking to maintain conversational quality. The optimal balance is achieved by adjusting the control settings, as shown in the engagingness analysis [1, 3, 6].\n\nIn summary, repetition control reduces question-asking frequency due to the suppression of repetitive bigrams, but adjustments like the \"boost\" setting can help restore higher question rates while managing repetition.\n\nThe presence of repetition control reduces the frequency of question-asking in generated text."}

This approach leverages the long-term user embedding to provide a starting point for the GRU, which then processes the recent browsing history to generate the short-term representation. The final user representation is derived from the last hidden state of the GRU network [2]. This method is depicted in the left side of the image, where the user embedding from past click history is initialized into the model, and GRU cells sequentially process encoded news information to compute a relevance score for candidate news [![LSTUR-ini initializes the GRU with long-term user representation](image2)].\n\nIn contrast, LSTUR-con concatenates the long-term and short-term user representations to form a unified user vector.

According to [1], QK-Norm is introduced to control the norm growth of inputs to the softmax function within the attention mechanism, which is crucial for maintaining stable training. [6] further explains that the standard LLaMa architecture faced issues with slow norm growth, leading to divergences, especially when training with multiple modalities. This divergence is linked to the translation invariant property of softmax, which can cause norms to grow uncontrollably, as illustrated in Figure 5a [6].\n\nThe image quotes offer visual evidence of these dynamics. ![The graph shows training loss with and without QK-Norm](image7) clearly demonstrates that without QK-Norm, the training loss is consistently higher compared to when QK-Norm is applied.

This process continues until a specified number of iterations is reached or a threshold is met, ensuring that the system progressively refines its context with each cycle. This method is particularly useful for tasks requiring detailed and contextually rich responses, as it allows the system to iteratively build upon previous outputs to enhance accuracy and relevance [2]. ![Iterative Retrieval alternates between retrieval and generation to refine context](image2).\n\n**Recursive Retrieval**, on the other hand, focuses on gradually refining the user query and dividing complex problems into sub-problems. It employs query transformation or decomposition to continuously solve intricate issues through retrieval and generation. This approach is beneficial in scenarios where the user's needs are ambiguous or the information sought is highly specialized, as it allows the system to adaptively refine its search strategy based on feedback from previous retrieval results. Techniques like IRCoT and ToC exemplify this by using chain-of-thought or clarification trees to optimize ambiguous queries, leading to more precise outcomes [11]. ![Recursive Retrieval refines queries and solves complex problems through iterative refinement](image2).\n\n**Adaptive Retrieval** introduces a dynamic element by enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine when external knowledge retrieval is necessary. It uses special tokens to decide when to stop retrieval and generation, allowing for on-demand retrieval based on the system's judgment. This flexibility is advantageous in diverse scenarios, as it optimizes efficiency by retrieving information only when needed, reducing redundancy and enhancing relevance.

This suggests that RetNRef performs better than these models in many cases. However, to pinpoint the highest win rate, we need to look at the specific comparisons in Table 5.\n\n![RetrieveNRefine++ has the highest win rate against Memory Network](image5) shows that RetrieveNRefine++ achieves a win rate of 54.5% against the Memory Network, which is the highest among the comparisons listed.

In the distractor setting, where gold paragraphs are paired with eight spurious paragraphs selected using TF-IDF similarity, single-paragraph BERT achieves a competitive F1 score of 67.08, comparable to state-of-the-art models [7]. This suggests that many questions in the H OTPOT QA dataset can be answered with single-hop reasoning, even when distractors are present [4]. However, the model's performance drops to 46.84 F1 when evaluated on adversarially selected distractors, indicating vulnerability to changes in distractor distribution [2].

Conversely, the 'Word LSTM-B' (backward LSTM) processes the word embeddings from right to left, capturing the subsequent context. By combining the outputs of these bi-directional LSTMs, the model can create a comprehensive word representation that incorporates information from both the past and future words in the sequence.

This indicates that DSGAN helps in reducing false positives, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy.\n\nThe quantitative improvements are further highlighted in ![Performance comparison with and without DSGAN](image8), where the performance metrics (likely AUC values) increase when DSGAN is added. For example, the PCNN+ATT model sees an improvement from 0.253 to 0.264, and the p-values indicate that these enhancements are statistically significant, with values well below the 0.05 threshold.\n\nAdditionally, the adversarial training process depicted in ![Adversarial learning setup](image7) illustrates how the generator and discriminator interact iteratively. The generator produces probabilities that categorize samples into high and low confidence, which are then used to train the discriminator. Over epochs, as shown in ![Discriminator accuracy decline](image5), the discriminator's accuracy on the negative dataset \\(N^D\\) decreases, reflecting the generator's success in collapsing the discriminator's decision boundary. This decline signifies that the generator is effectively learning to generate true positives, as evidenced by the improved F1 scores in ![F1 score trends](image3).\n\nThe hyperparameters in ![Hyperparameters used](image1) ensure that the models, including the generator and discriminator, are optimized for performance. The use of CNNs with specific window and kernel sizes, along with word and position embeddings, aligns with the study's goal of leveraging simple yet effective architectures for relation extraction tasks.\n\nIn summary, DSGAN's adversarial learning approach refines"}

Without repetition control, the model is designed to produce questions in 100% of utterances when z=10, as shown in image2 where the \"Question-controlled CT\" line approaches near 100% question frequency. However, when repetition control is applied, the \"Question-controlled CT with repetition control\" line in image2 shows a reduced question-asking rate, reaching only about 80%. This reduction occurs because the repetition control mechanism, specifically the \"extrep bigram\" feature, discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, which often include common question phrases like \"do you\" and \"what is.\" This feature prevents the model from repeating these bigrams, thereby limiting its ability to generate questions at the intended rate. To mitigate this, an additional setting, \"z=10 (boost),\" is introduced, which allows the model to bypass the \"extrep bigram\" feature during beam search but still uses it for reranking candidates. This adjustment enables the model to achieve a 99.54% question-asking rate, as mentioned in [6], though it slightly increases external bigram repetition. This demonstrates the trade-off between controlling repetition and maintaining high question-asking rates, highlighting the complexity of balancing these attributes in dialogue models. ![The question-asking rate is reduced to about 80% with repetition control at z=10](image2)"}

When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance dropped to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median scores around 50% [5], as shown in the table where BERT's metrics are highlighted in bold [![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set](image6)].

For instance, BoV and BiLSTM had maximum scores of around 59.5% and 59.2%, respectively, on the original test set [![Comparison of model performances](image5)], which further decreased on the adversarial set. The adversarial transformation thus levels the playing field, revealing that all models struggle without the spurious cues, but BERT's drop is more pronounced due to its higher initial reliance on them [12].\n\nThe adversarial dataset's design, which mirrors statistical cues by negating claims and inverting labels [3], is illustrated by comparing original and adversarial viewpoints, such as the example with Google's monopoly status [![Example of adversarial transformation](image3)].

In contrast, when comparing Chameleon with GPT-4V+, the agreement levels were slightly higher, with 35.4% of instances having all three annotators agree, 55.2% with two agreeing, and 9.3% with no agreement. This suggests a slightly stronger consensus when evaluating against GPT-4V+. Comparisons with the original Gemini and GPT-4V models showed lower agreement rates, with 30.2% and 28.6% of instances having all three annotators agree, respectively. The higher disagreement rates in these comparisons, particularly with GPT-4V (13.1% no agreement), highlight the challenges in evaluating mixed-modal responses, as noted in text [11], where annotators often found it difficult to reach a unanimous decision. This variability underscores the complexity of assessing mixed-modal outputs, where subjective interpretations can lead to differing judgments among annotators. ![Annotator agreement levels vary across model comparisons](image2) Overall, Chameleon's evaluations reveal that while there is a general trend towards partial agreement, achieving full consensus remains challenging, reflecting the nuanced nature of mixed-modal response assessment."}

The final user utterance vector is generated by concatenating the last forward and backward LSTM states, effectively encapsulating the entire utterance's meaning in a single vector [8].

This aligns with the dataset's emphasis on supporting AR headset applications by understanding and planning within indoor environments, as mentioned in text quotes [6] and [10], where the model is trained to provide context-aware responses for activities in indoor spaces. The inclusion of egocentric videos and sequential images in the dataset, as described in [6], further supports the model's ability to perform egocentric planning tasks effectively. ![Egocentric planning is the top task in the planning branch](image8)"}

However, incorporating defenses such as pass-through and neutral backoff strategies can mitigate these effects. Specifically, the pass-through backoff variant of the ScRNN model offers better protection, bringing adversarial accuracy within a 5% range for swap attacks and mitigating effects in word-piece models by 21% [5]. The neutral backoff variant is noted for its low sensitivity, which contributes to higher robustness [11].\n\n![BERT + Pass-through has the highest improvement in performance with 1-char attacks](image2) shows that the \"BERT + Pass-through\" model maintains the highest performance under 1-char attacks, with an accuracy of 84.5%, highlighted in bold. This indicates that the pass-through strategy effectively counters the impact of single-character perturbations. \n\nFor 2-char attacks, ![BERT + Neutral has the highest performance under 2-char attack](image2) reveals that the \"BERT + Neutral\" model achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 82.5%, also highlighted in bold. This suggests that the neutral backoff strategy is particularly effective in handling more complex perturbations involving two characters.\n\nAdditionally, ![the relationship between sensitivity and WER for models](image3) supports these findings by illustrating that the neutral backoff strategy (green bubble) offers a balance between lower sensitivity and manageable WER, contributing to robustness.

These scores highlight its superiority over models like InstructGPT, Codex, and FLAN-T5, especially in handling claims with high reasoning depth. This indicates that decomposing claims into simpler steps enhances reasoning accuracy [1].\n\nThe system's architecture, as depicted in Figure 2, consists of five key modules: Claim Verifier, Question Generator, Question-Answering Model, Validator, and Reasoner [3]. The Claim Verifier assesses if the existing context is sufficient to validate a claim. If not, the Question Generator formulates a necessary question, which the Question-Answering Model then answers using retrieved evidence. The Validator evaluates the usefulness of the generated (Q, A) pair, and if valid, it is added to the context. This iterative process continues until the Claim Verifier confirms the context is sufficient, at which point the Reasoner determines the claim's veracity [3].\n\nThe Question-Answering (QA) module is crucial for the system's reliability, and QACHECK offers flexibility by allowing users to choose between different QA implementations. These include the Retriever–Reader model, FLAN-T5, and GPT Reciter–Reader, each with distinct approaches to answering questions [2, 8, 9]. The Retriever–Reader uses a retriever to find evidence from a corpus and a reader to generate answers, while FLAN-T5 directly answers based on its parametric knowledge. The GPT Reciter–Reader leverages InstructGPT to retrieve relevant information and a reader to produce answers, offering a robust knowledge base [8, 9]. Figure 4 illustrates these implementations, showing how users can select the QA model based on their needs [4, 8, 9].\n\nThe user interface of the QACHECK demo, shown in Figure 4, is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to input claims and visualize the step-by-step reasoning process.

Simultaneously, a fine-tuned BERT model processes the concatenation of domain-slot pairs and recent dialog context, producing start and end vector distributions. These representations are then matched using cosine similarity, as indicated by the evidence from the text: \"We calculate the relevance score between the aggregated representation and a reference candidate by the cosine similarity\" [1].

Mismatch repair (MMR) is depicted as correcting single base mismatches and insertions/deletions that occur during DNA replication [12]. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is illustrated as addressing pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts, which are typically induced by UV light and certain chemicals [6]. Recombinational repair mechanisms are shown to handle double-strand breaks (DSBs) and interstrand cross-links, which can result from replication errors or ionizing radiation [7].

During the Problem Formulation stage, the model uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language description of the problem into a symbolic representation. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement and translating them into a suitable symbolic language [12]. For example, a natural language statement like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing\" is transformed into a symbolic formulation such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [6].\n\n![The LOGIC-LM model is composed of three main modules: Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter](image5)\n\nOnce the problem is formulated symbolically, the Symbolic Reasoner module takes over. This component performs logical inference on the symbolic formulation using deterministic algorithms, such as logic programming engines or constraint optimization methods, depending on the nature of the problem [2]. For instance, deductive reasoning problems might use logical programming (LP) with a solver like Pyke, while first-order logic problems might employ a prover like Prover9 [6]. The symbolic solver ensures that the reasoning is faithful and precise, leveraging the strengths of symbolic logic to handle complex logical structures [9].\n\n![The Symbolic Reasoner performs inference using methods like Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, and Constraint Optimization](image5)\n\nAfter the symbolic solver derives an answer, the Result Interpreter module translates this symbolic output back into natural language.

According to the text, DS-DST significantly outperforms DS-Span for certain slots, including hotel-type, due to its ability to handle categorical slots more effectively [6]. The dual strategy model, DS-DST, leverages a pre-trained BERT model to interact deeply with dialog context and slot information, allowing it to predict values that are not directly extractable from the dialog context [5]. This is particularly relevant for slots like hotel-type, where the user might not explicitly mention the type but it can be inferred from the context or selected from a candidate list.\n\n![DS-DST model architecture](image2) illustrates how DS-DST processes both categorical and non-categorical slots by using a fixed BERT model for candidate-value lists and a fine-tuned BERT model for dialog context, enhancing its ability to accurately predict slot values like hotel-type. The model's design enables it to handle categorical slots by selecting values from a predefined list, which is crucial for slots where direct span extraction is unreliable.\n\nIn the error analysis, it is noted that DS-DST and DS-Picklist dramatically reduce errors for slots such as hotel-type compared to DS-Span, which struggles with values that have different expressions or are not explicitly mentioned [10]. This indicates that DS-DST's approach to handling categorical slots, such as hotel-type, is more robust and accurate.\n\nThe table in ![Slot statistics](image8) provides specific metrics for DS-DST's performance on various slots. For the hotel-type slot, DS-DST shows a high success rate, reflecting its effectiveness in accurately predicting this slot type compared to DS-Span, which often fails to find the correct value due to reliance on direct span extraction.\n\nIn conclusion, the accuracy of DS-DST for the hotel-type slot is significantly higher than that of DS-Span, as evidenced by its ability to handle categorical slots through a dual strategy that combines context understanding and candidate-value selection.\n\nThe accuracy of DS-DST for the hotel-type slot is significantly higher than DS-Span, as it effectively handles categorical slots through a dual strategy."}

In dataset D1, the training set contains 637 neutral examples, which is relatively balanced compared to the positive (2164) and negative (807) examples. The test set also has a balanced distribution with 196 neutral examples. This balanced distribution in D1 allows classifiers to learn neutral-related features more effectively, as mentioned in text quote [10], contributing to better performance in macro-F1 scores.\n\nIn contrast, datasets D3 and D4 exhibit a stark imbalance in neutral examples. For D3, the training set has only 50 neutral examples, and the test set has 35, making it extremely challenging for models to learn from such a small number of instances. Similarly, D4 has 88 neutral examples in the training set and 38 in the test set. This imbalance is critical because, as noted in text quote [5], even a small prediction difference can significantly impact the precision and recall on the neutral class, affecting macro-F1 scores more dramatically. The lack of neutral examples in D3 and D4 is a key factor in the difficulty of predicting neutral instances, as highlighted in text quote [12].\n\nThe image1 clearly shows that D3 and D4 have the fewest neutral examples, which aligns with the explanation in text quote [10] that D1 has more neutral examples in the training set, making it easier for classifiers to perform well on this class. The extreme imbalance in D3 and D4 is a primary reason for the significant improvements observed when using document-level knowledge, as transferring knowledge from balanced document-level data helps compensate for the lack of neutral examples, as discussed in text quote [4].\n\n![D3 and D4 have significantly fewer neutral examples compared to D1 and D2](image1)\n\nIn summary, the distribution of neutral examples is much more balanced in D1 compared to D3 and D4, where the scarcity of neutral examples poses a challenge for aspect-level sentiment classification models.\n\nThe distribution of neutral examples is significantly more balanced in D1 compared to D3 and D4."}

Word-level embeddings provide a semantic representation of each word, capturing the meaning and context within the language. However, they may not fully account for morphological variations or rare words, especially in low-resource languages where word embeddings might be less reliable due to limited data. Character-level embeddings, on the other hand, allow the model to understand subword information, such as prefixes, suffixes, and capitalization patterns, which are crucial for identifying named entities accurately. This dual approach ensures that the model can handle both frequent and infrequent words effectively, leveraging the strengths of both types of embeddings.\n\nFor instance, the hierarchical CRF model depicted in ![The image shows a Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model architecture that processes both character and word embeddings](image3) integrates character-level and word-level information. The Char Bi-LSTM layer captures subword features, while the Word Bi-LSTM processes concatenated embeddings to consider contextual dependencies. This combination helps the model address challenges like word order differences and lexical mapping issues, as mentioned in [1] and [8]. The self-attention mechanism further enhances the model's ability to weigh different input positions, improving robustness to word order variations.\n\nAdditionally, the comparative analysis in ![The table compares different models and methods for Spanish, Dutch, and German, highlighting the performance of \"BWET\" methods with enhancements like self-attention](image1) and ![The table shows the Translation model outperforming others across languages](image2) demonstrates that incorporating character-level information leads to better performance, particularly in languages with complex morphology. The Translation model, which likely benefits from such dual embeddings, achieves the highest scores across languages, underscoring the importance of this approach.\n\nIn summary, using both word-level and character-level embeddings allows the model to leverage semantic and morphological information, improving NER accuracy and robustness, especially in cross-lingual and low-resource settings.\n\nThe model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to capture semantic and morphological information, enhancing NER performance."}

Artemisia, born in Rome as the eldest child of Orazio, was directly mentored by her father, who was a prominent Mannerist painter [1]. This mentorship played a crucial role in shaping her skills and artistic direction. Orazio's expertise and the naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes, and use of chiaroscuro are evident in Artemisia's work, particularly in her notable piece, \"Judith Slaying Holofernes\" [1]. The knowledge graph in image7 highlights their relationship, emphasizing their roles as painters and their Italian citizenship, which underscores the familial and cultural context of her development [![Orazio and Artemisia's relationship in the knowledge graph](image7)].\n\nArtemisia's integration into the Baroque movement, influenced by Caravaggio, was further solidified through her father's teachings and exposure to his Mannerist techniques [7]. This foundation allowed her to become a significant figure in the Caravaggisti movement, known for dramatic realism [1]. The knowledge graph effectively maps these connections, showing how Orazio's influence extended beyond mere familial ties to a profound impact on her artistic identity and career trajectory [![Orazio's influence on Artemisia's Baroque style](image7)].\n\nIn summary, Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia's career is manifested through direct mentorship, shared artistic techniques, and the cultural context depicted in the knowledge graph, highlighting their interconnected roles in the art world."}
{"q_id": 1497, "model": "InternVL3-78B", "in_tok": 4133, "out_tok": 512, "total_tok": 4645, "response": "The pre-processing step in the zero-shot recognition system, as illustrated in the diagram, plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's ability to accurately identify objects within detection datasets. According to the text, the methodology involves two key pre-processing techniques: **cropping** and **blurring** [8]. These steps are specifically designed to address the challenges posed by object detection datasets, where images often contain multiple objects of varying sizes and positions. \n\n![The diagram shows how pre-processing techniques like cropping and resizing assist in zero-shot recognition for object detection tasks using multimodal retrieval methods](image8) \n\nIn the pre-processing phase, the image is first segmented into regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates. Each region is then cropped and resized to a fixed proportion, ensuring that the objects of interest are isolated and standardized in size. This step is essential because, unlike in image classification tasks where objects are typically large and centrally positioned, objects in detection datasets can be smaller and more dispersed. By cropping and resizing, the model can focus on the relevant regions without being distracted by the surrounding context.\n\nAdditionally, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This strategy directs the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to concentrate on the objects within the bounding boxes, thereby improving their identification accuracy. The blurring helps to reduce noise and irrelevant details, making the objects more prominent and easier to classify. This approach is supported by the observation that a proper amount of blurring can significantly enhance classification accuracy by maintaining context while highlighting the foreground object [7].\n\nThe pre-processed image embeddings are then used in a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search, as depicted in the diagram. The embeddings are indexed and stored in memory, allowing the system to retrieve potential labels associated with each bounding box. For instance, Bbox1 might be linked to \"flower arrangement,\" Bbox2 to \"saltshaker,\" and Bbox3 to \"vase.\" This retrieval process, combined with the ranking capabilities of MLLMs, ensures that the final predictions are both contextually aware and precise.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing steps of cropping and blurring are integral to the zero-shot recognition system, as they prepare the input data in a way that optimizes the model's performance by isolating and emphasizing the objects of interest. This method not only aligns with the system's design but also demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy across various datasets, as evidenced by the performance metrics in the provided tables [image2, image"}

This score is significant because it indicates that among the models listed, the Cognitive Graph model performs the best in the open-domain setting, where the model must retrieve and reason over a large set of paragraphs without the aid of predefined distractors. The open-domain setting is particularly challenging due to the difficulty in retrieving the correct paragraphs, as highlighted in text quote [5], where the single-hop model struggles with insufficient retrieval methods. The Cognitive Graph model's higher score suggests it may have more effective retrieval or reasoning capabilities in this context compared to other models like Single-paragraph BERT, which achieves a lower Open F1 score of 38.40 [7]. This performance underscores the importance of developing models that can efficiently handle open-domain questions, where the ability to retrieve and process relevant information from a vast pool of data is crucial. The table in image7 provides a clear comparison, showing that while many models perform well in the distractor setting, the Cognitive Graph model stands out in the open-domain scenario, emphasizing the need for advancements in retrieval and reasoning for multi-hop questions. ![Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score](image7)\n\nThe Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score of 48.87, indicating superior performance in the open-domain setting."}

This is further supported by the results in image1, where the \"− abstract\" configuration shows a noticeable drop in scores across all metrics compared to the base SPECTER model. The abstract provides crucial contextual information that aids the model in understanding the content and relevance of scientific documents.\n\nConversely, adding author information as an input actually hurts performance, which is surprising. The text suggests that this could be due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus or suboptimal tokenization by SciBERT, leading to noisy correlations [8].

The DS-DST model, which combines both categorical and non-categorical approaches, shows significant improvement over DS-Span for certain slots, including 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by', by leveraging candidate-value lists for categorical slots [9].

This is because DS-Picklist has access to a full ontology, allowing it to predict values from candidate-value lists more effectively, which is crucial for slots where direct span extraction is unreliable [12]. The table in ![DS-DST and DS-Picklist performance on time-related slots](image4) highlights the accuracy percentages for each slot, indicating that DS-Picklist's reliance on a full ontology helps it achieve higher accuracy for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' compared to DS-DST, which may not have the same level of ontology access.\n\nFurthermore, ![Accuracy of dialogue state tracking models](image5) shows that DS-Picklist+ achieves the highest accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0, suggesting its effectiveness in handling slots that benefit from a comprehensive ontology.

The collapsed tree approach, as depicted in the graph, demonstrates a peak performance at around 2000 tokens, achieving the highest F1 score before a slight decline as the context length extends to 2500 tokens. This method's flexibility in evaluating all nodes simultaneously allows it to retrieve information at the appropriate granularity for a given question, which is crucial for maintaining high relevance and comprehensiveness [4][6]. The graph highlights that the collapsed tree method consistently outperforms the tree traversal method, which shows a more gradual increase in F1 score with context length but remains lower overall. The tree traversal method, which prunes and selects nodes layer-by-layer, may not adapt as effectively to varying question requirements, as it maintains a constant ratio of thematic to granular information regardless of the query [6][10]. This limitation is evident in the graph, where the tree traversal line does not reach the same peak as the collapsed tree, underscoring its less flexible retrieval strategy. The collapsed tree's superior performance is attributed to its ability to search through all nodes at once, ensuring that the context retrieved aligns better with the question's specificity [4][6]. This is further supported by the qualitative study on the Cinderella fairytale, where RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval, using the collapsed tree method, often yields more relevant information compared to DPR, as illustrated in the retrieval process diagram [2][7].\n\n![The collapsed tree method outperforms tree traversal across context lengths, peaking at 2000 tokens](image8)\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree method offers greater flexibility and consistently higher F1 scores compared to tree traversal, particularly at a context length of 2000 tokens."}

The exam covers the entire recruiting life cycle, emphasizing the importance of effectively searching the network, which is as crucial as knowing how to post a job [6]. Understanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings is a fundamental skill for talent acquisition professionals, even as next-gen tools improve efficiency [4]. This skill is directly tied to the ability to identify and engage talent efficiently, a core component of the certification [4].\n\nThe Venn diagram in the question illustrates the intersection of different skills, such as Engineering and Java, and highlights the importance of precise search strategies. For instance, the search string \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" would exclude candidates labeled as managers, focusing on those with both Engineering and Java skills but not managerial roles [2]. This type of Boolean logic is essential for narrowing down search results to find the most relevant candidates, a skill that is critical for the certification [4].\n\n![The Venn diagram shows the intersection of Engineering, Java, and a third category, illustrating how Boolean search strings can filter specific skill sets](image7) The diagram emphasizes the need to understand overlapping skill sets, which aligns with the certification's focus on identifying talent through effective search techniques [4]. Additionally, the certification covers building a talent pipeline, posting jobs, and maximizing efficiency, all of which require a solid grasp of search and engagement strategies [4][11].\n\n![The LinkedIn Recruiter Certification diagram highlights key areas: Identifying talent, Engaging talent, Building a talent pipeline, Posting jobs, and Maximizing efficiency](image4) These areas are interconnected, and mastering Boolean searches enhances a recruiter's ability to perform each of these tasks effectively. The certification curriculum encourages focused learning on best practices, ensuring that certified recruiters can efficiently source, engage, and manage talent [5][7].\n\nIn summary, candidates should concentrate on mastering search techniques, including Boolean logic, as well as understanding how to engage talent, build pipelines, post jobs, and use tools for organization and collaboration. The Venn diagram exemplifies the precision needed in searches to target specific talent, a skill that is foundational to the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification.\n\nCandidates need to focus on mastering search techniques, including Boolean logic, and understanding how to engage talent, build pipelines, post jobs, and use organizational tools for the LinkedIn Recruiter Certification exam.

The thermal resistance values are crucial for assessing how efficiently heat dissipates from the junction to the ambient environment and the case. \n\nThe 8051AH and 8751BH parts are manufactured using different processes: the 8051AH is on P 414.1 (HMOS II), while the 8751BH is on P 422 (HMOS-E) [8]. These process differences can influence thermal properties. \n\n![Thermal resistance information for various electronic parts](image5) provides specific thermal resistance values for these parts. For the 8051AH, the thermal resistance (θja) is 45°C/W for a 40-Pin Plastic DIP package, and θjc is 16°C/W. In contrast, the 8751BH has a θja of 36°C/W and θjc of 12°C/W for a 40-Pin PLCC package. \n\nThe lower θja and θjc values for the 8751BH indicate better thermal performance, meaning it dissipates heat more efficiently compared to the 8051AH. This is likely due to the different packaging and manufacturing processes used for each part.\n\nIn summary, the 8751BH has lower thermal resistance values than the 8051AH, indicating more efficient heat dissipation."}

In the parental (P) generation, plants with homozygous alleles (PP for purple flowers and pp for white flowers) produce gametes that carry only one allele each—P from the PP plant and p from the pp plant [11]. When these gametes combine during fertilization, all F1 generation offspring are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype [4, 8]. This is visually represented in the genetic cross diagram, where the F1 hybrids are uniformly purple [![The F₁ generation shows all offspring as heterozygous (Pp) with the dominant purple phenotype](image1)].\n\nIn the F2 generation, the heterozygous F1 plants (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. When these gametes combine, the resulting offspring exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers, corresponding to the genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp [11]. This segregation of alleles is a key aspect of Mendel's discovery, demonstrating that recessive traits can reappear in subsequent generations [7]. The image illustrating the F2 generation highlights this ratio, showing the dominance of the P allele and the reappearance of the recessive p allele in one-quarter of the offspring [![The F₂ generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers](image4)].\n\nAdditionally, the concept of gene loci on homologous chromosomes further supports this pattern, as each parent contributes one allele to the offspring, resulting in the observed ratios [5]. The visualization of alleles on a chromosome emphasizes how dominant and recessive alleles interact to determine the phenotype [![The chromosome shows alleles labeled \"P,\" \"a,\" and \"B,\" with at least one dominant allele](image3)]. This consistent pattern across generations aligns with Mendel's experiments, confirming that traits are inherited through discrete units now known as genes [1, 4].\n\nMendelian inheritance thus explains the F2 generation ratios by demonstrating the predictable segregation of alleles and the dominance of certain traits over others, as illustrated in both the genetic cross diagrams and the phenotypic outcomes [![The F₂ generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers"}

When a homozygous dominant parent (PP) with purple flowers is crossed with a homozygous recessive parent (pp) with white flowers, all F1 generation offspring are heterozygous (Pp) and exhibit the dominant purple phenotype [3]. This is illustrated in the genetic cross diagram, where the F1 hybrids produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles [![F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white](image3)]. \n\nWhen these F1 hybrids (Pp) are crossed, the F2 generation results in a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers. This occurs because the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p) in heterozygous individuals, while homozygous recessive individuals (pp) express the white phenotype. The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP (homozygous dominant): 2 Pp (heterozygous): 1 pp (homozygous recessive) [3]. This pattern is consistent with Mendel's observations, where the recessive trait reappears in one quarter of the F2 offspring [3].\n\nThe Punnett square further supports this outcome by showing the possible combinations of alleles from the parents (D and d), leading to offspring with genotypes DD, Dd, and dd, with corresponding phenotypes [![Punnett square demonstrates the inheritance pattern and probability of traits](image2)].

The 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' strategies are two key approaches used in this context, each with distinct focuses and techniques.\n\nThe 'Needs Exploration' strategy, as depicted in image2, encompasses a range of activities aimed at understanding and defining stakeholder requirements. This includes active stakeholder participation, high-level and detailed requirements specification, split (A/B) testing, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). These methods emphasize collaboration and iterative refinement of requirements to ensure they are well-understood and aligned with stakeholder expectations. For instance, active stakeholder participation ensures that stakeholders are involved throughout the process, providing continuous feedback and validation of requirements. ATDD, a component of this strategy, involves creating acceptance tests to define the criteria for a feature, ensuring that the final product meets the desired specifications [2].\n\nOn the other hand, 'Elicitation Methods' focus on how stakeholders communicate their needs to the development team. Image4 highlights strategies such as Just-in-Time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, and iteration demos. These methods prioritize timely and effective communication to capture stakeholder requirements accurately. JIT model storming, for example, involves quick, collaborative sessions to model requirements as needed, reducing the overhead of formal documentation and allowing for rapid adaptation to changes. Look-ahead modeling helps anticipate future needs, while iteration demos provide tangible feedback loops, ensuring that the development aligns with stakeholder expectations.\n\nBoth strategies are integral to disciplined agile development, as they address different aspects of requirement gathering. 'Needs Exploration' is more about the depth and detail of requirements, ensuring they are well-defined and validated through various techniques. In contrast, 'Elicitation Methods' focus on the process of gathering these requirements, emphasizing flexibility and continuous communication. Together, they ensure that stakeholder needs are not only understood but also effectively integrated into the development process.\n\n![The 'Needs Exploration' strategy includes active stakeholder participation and ATDD](image2) and ![Elicitation Methods involve JIT model storming and iteration demos](image4) illustrate how these strategies complement each other in disciplined agile management.

In the context of the provided figures, we can see several key points that highlight these impacts.\n\nFirst, structured markup errors are evident in the table from image7, which shows a high number of errors across various data types. For instance, the \"Blog\" and \"Article\" entries from schema.org have 72,441 and 49,222 errors, respectively, while the \"hatom\" and \"hentry\" entries from microformats.org have 100% error rates. These errors can lead to search engines failing to correctly understand the content's structure and context, potentially reducing the visibility of the website in search results. Properly implemented structured markup helps search engines like Google to better index and display rich snippets, which can enhance click-through rates and user engagement. However, errors in this markup can result in missed opportunities for rich snippets and may lead to lower search rankings [7].\n\nMeta description issues are highlighted in image3, where there are 2,215 duplicate meta descriptions, 1,450 short meta descriptions, and 621 duplicate title tags. Duplicate and poorly written meta descriptions can dilute the uniqueness and relevance of each page, making it harder for search engines to determine the best page to display for a given query. This can lead to lower click-through rates and a less effective user experience, as search engines may not display the most relevant snippet for a page. Additionally, missing or duplicate title tags can confuse both users and search engines, potentially harming the site's SEO performance by failing to provide clear, distinct signals about each page's content [3].\n\nFurthermore, the cumulative backlink growth shown in image1 and referring domains in image4 indicate the importance of a strong backlink profile, which can be influenced by the quality of on-page SEO elements like meta descriptions and structured markup. If a site's pages have poor meta descriptions or markup errors, it may deter other sites from linking to it, as the content may not appear as authoritative or relevant. This can slow the growth of backlinks, as seen in the steady rise from mid-2012 onwards in image1, which might be partially attributed to improved SEO practices addressing such issues.\n\nIn summary, addressing structured markup errors and optimizing meta descriptions are crucial for enhancing SEO performance. Correcting these issues can improve search engine understanding, increase visibility through rich snippets, and ensure that each"}

For volcanoes, the map in image4 shows a distribution mostly near the Pacific Ring of Fire, labeled \"Volcanos of the world,\" with a URL provided for further details. This map highlights the global spread of volcanic activity, emphasizing regions with high volcanic activity. In contrast, the map of public libraries in the Netherlands, as seen in image6, uses red dots to represent the locations of libraries across the country. This map is part of a series that includes other geographic points of interest, such as Dutch national heritage sites and big cities, but the focus here is on the distribution of libraries within the Netherlands.\n\nBoth maps use a similar visual approach—red dots on a geographic background—to convey data points, but they differ in scale and context. The volcano map covers a global perspective, while the library map is confined to the Netherlands. The library map in image6 is more localized and likely serves to inform about accessibility and distribution within a specific country, whereas the volcano map provides a broader, global overview of natural phenomena. The use of red dots in both cases allows for quick visual identification of data points, but the library map may include additional contextual information, such as links to further details, as seen in the description of image6.\n\nIn terms of data presentation, the library map in image6 is part of a structured data query from Wikidata, as indicated by the SPARQL query in image1 and image5, which retrieves and visualizes library data.

One significant barrier is the lack of a unified ownership of the customer experience, leading to siloed approaches and misaligned goals within organizations. This fragmentation is evident in the high percentage of respondents who identify \"There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" as a frequent challenge, with 52% of respondents highlighting this issue ![There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals](image6). Additionally, the prevalence of siloed structures by business line, product, or brand further exacerbates the problem, as 46% of respondents note this as a barrier ![We are too siloed by business line/product/brand](image6).\n\nAnother critical barrier is the overemphasis on traditional metrics such as reach and frequency, which fail to capture the full spectrum of customer engagement and sentiment [2]. This focus on quantitative data over qualitative insights, such as customer satisfaction and brand loyalty, limits the ability to understand and influence customer behavior effectively [1][5][7]. The image showing the distribution of how marketing attribution is calculated underscores this issue, with 52% of respondents attributing activity to the most recent touchpoint, indicating a reliance on last-click attribution rather than a holistic view of the customer journey ![Attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint](image3).\n\nMoreover, the absence of a 360-degree view of customer activities and behaviors is a significant obstacle. Marketers often look at tactical metrics in isolation, neglecting the comprehensive dashboard needed to integrate all marketing efforts and customer interactions [2]. This lack of a unified perspective is reflected in the challenges related to measuring the influence of activities on customer behavior, with 27% of respondents citing this as a problem ![We are unable to measure the influence of our activities on customer behavior](image6).\n\nLeadership commitment and guidance are also crucial for overcoming these barriers. Without company-wide alignment across various departments, including Business Groups, Sales, Finance, HR, and Marketing, the adoption of an integrated approach remains difficult [8]. The image highlighting business-related topics, such as customer experience and strategy, emphasizes the need for cross-functional collaboration to address these challenges ![Customer experience and strategy are critical business topics](image4).\n\nIn summary, the major barriers to adopting an integrated customer management approach include siloed organizational structures, over-reliance"}

This reflects how our minds tend to complete incomplete figures, creating a sense of wholeness even when parts are missing [11].\n\nThe **Proximity** principle is showcased through the letter \"E,\" depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together, indicating that elements close to each other are perceived as a single unit [image2]. This reinforces the idea that proximity influences our grouping of visual elements [1].\n\nThe **Continuity** principle is illustrated by the letter \"S,\" which follows a continuous contour line, guiding the viewer's eye smoothly along its path [image2]. This highlights how our perception favors continuous lines and patterns, creating a sense of flow and connection [3].\n\nThe **Similarity** principle is evident in the letters \"T\" and \"A,\" which share a similar striped pattern, leading us to group them together based on visual similarity [image2]. This aligns with the concept that objects with similar characteristics are perceived as part of the same group [10].\n\nLastly, the **Prägnanz** principle is reflected in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A,\" suggesting that our perception tends to favor the simplest and most stable form [image2]. This aligns with the Gestalt theory's focus on conciseness and the mental prioritization of global regularity over spatial relations [4].\n\nOverall, the design of \"GESTALT\" effectively uses these principles to create a unified and meaningful visual representation, demonstrating how Gestalt psychology explains our natural tendency to impose structure and coherence on visual elements [image2].\n\nThe principles of Gestalt psychology manifest in the design of the word \"GESTALT\" by using segregation, closure, proximity, continuity, similarity, and prä"}

According to the electrical characteristics table in image8, the maximum power supply current (I_CC) for the 8751H and 8751H-8 is 250 mA, which is significantly higher than the 175 mA for devices like the 8032AH/8052AH/8751BH/8752BH and the 125 mA for the 8031AH/8051AH/8051AHP. This indicates that the 8751H requires more power under the same test conditions, likely due to its higher operational frequency or additional features such as the Program Memory Security bit [10].\n\nNext, the timing parameters are crucial for understanding the operational speed and synchronization of the microcontroller. Image2 and image6 provide timing parameters for oscillators, showing that the 8751H operates with a minimum oscillator frequency of 3.5 MHz and a maximum of 12 MHz, as seen in image1. The timing diagram in image5 illustrates the external program memory read cycle, highlighting the coordination between ALE, PSEN, PORT 0, and PORT 2 signals. The specific timing intervals, such as ALE Pulse Width and Address Valid to ALE Low, are critical for ensuring proper memory interfacing. The 8751H's timing parameters, as shown in image2, are optimized for its operational frequency, which may differ from other devices with variable oscillators.\n\nAdditionally, the electrical characteristics in image3 and image8 provide input and output voltage specifications, which are essential for ensuring compatibility with external circuits. The 8751H's input leakage current (I_LL) for Port 0 is ±100 µA, which is higher than the ±10 µA for other devices, indicating potential differences in input handling and noise susceptibility [1].\n\nIn summary, the 8751H has a higher power supply current requirement and specific timing parameters tailored to its operational frequency and features, distinguishing it from other devices in the tables.\n\nThe 8751H requires a higher power supply current and has distinct timing parameters optimized for its operational frequency and features. ![The 87"}

This ensures that the team remains aligned with stakeholder expectations and adapts to new needs as they arise.\n\nAdditionally, the Construction phase involves implementing Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to enhance the quality of the solution and prove the architecture early. This approach is part of the broader strategy to produce a solution that meets the evolving requirements and technical strategies, as outlined in the DAD framework. The process also includes look-ahead modeling of work items and identifying new needs during demos, which helps in maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changes.\n\nFurthermore, the Construction phase incorporates test-driven development (TDD) as a core practice, where tests are written first, followed by code changes to meet the test criteria. This iterative cycle of adding tests, making changes, and running tests again is visually represented in the TDD flowchart ![Process of test-driven development (TDD)](image8). This method ensures continuous improvement and validation of the solution, aligning with the disciplined agile principle of collaboration and evolution over documentation and freezing, as mentioned in the text [9].\n\nIn summary, the Construction phase involves active stakeholder participation, iterative modeling, BDD, and TDD to produce a high-quality, adaptable solution that meets stakeholder needs.\n\nThe Construction phase involves active stakeholder participation, iterative modeling, Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to produce a high-quality, adaptable solution."}

This is followed by the elongation of the cell and the movement of the duplicated chromosomes, preparing for the physical separation of the cell. Finally, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint, dividing the cell into two identical daughter cells.\n\nThe interphase stage is crucial for binary fission, as it involves the duplication of the cell's DNA and the increase in cytoplasmic volume [5]. During this phase, the cell prepares for division by replicating its genetic material, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive an identical copy [4]. ![The image shows a cell during the interphase stage of the cell cycle, highlighting the growth and preparation for division](image6)\n\nOnce the DNA is duplicated, the cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies begin to separate from each other. This separation is facilitated by the movement of the replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell [11]. The elongation of the cell ensures that there is enough space for the chromosomes to be evenly distributed [2]. ![The image illustrates a bacterial cell with duplicated genetic material, indicating the preparation for division](image4)\n\nThe final step involves the inward growth of the plasma membrane at the midpoint of the cell, effectively dividing the cell into two separate entities.

This concept suggests that as more of a good is consumed, the additional satisfaction (utility) gained from each successive unit decreases. For instance, the first hot dog might provide a high utility of +10, but by the sixth hot dog, the utility plummets to -10, indicating a negative experience [8]. This is visually represented in the table where utility declines sharply with each additional hot dog consumed, highlighting the diminishing returns [![Diminishing returns in hot dog consumption](image8)]. \n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the narrative shifts. The image illustrating hot dog consumption in a competitive setting shows a dramatic change in utility at 64 hot dogs, where utility jumps from -50 to +5000, marking a significant turning point [![Utility spike at 64 hot dogs](image1)]. This suggests that in competition, persistence and focus can lead to a breakthrough, transforming the experience from negative to highly positive. The person holding the tray at the championship point underscores how focused effort can culminate in a remarkable outcome, despite initial diminishing returns [![Championship achievement](image1)]. \n\nThis contrast between standard consumption and competitive contexts highlights the power of intentional focus. While variety is typically recommended to avoid diminishing utility in everyday scenarios [2], competition rewards sustained effort, where the cumulative effect of focus can lead to mastery and success [9]. The line graph of violinists further supports this, showing that early and consistent practice leads to greater accumulated skill, distinguishing the \"Best\" from others [![Accumulated practice hours](image6)]. Thus, in competition, the focus can enhance utility through skill development and achievement, contrasting with the diminishing utility observed in standard consumption.\n\nIn summary, diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption advises against overindulgence, but in competitive settings, focused practice can overcome initial diminishing returns, leading to significant positive outcomes. \n\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts in that standard consumption emphasizes variety to avoid negative utility, while competition rewards focused effort, potentially transforming diminishing returns into substantial gains."}

The metering modes, as illustrated in image5, provide options tailored to specific lighting conditions. Matrix Metering Mode measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for natural landscapes where even lighting is crucial [image5]. Center Metering Mode focuses on light near the center, perfect for portraits where the subject's face is the primary focus [image5]. Spot Metering Mode targets a specific region, such as a subject's eyes, ensuring accurate exposure in challenging lighting [image5].\n\nSimilarly, focus modes, as shown in image4, cater to different subjects. AF-S (single) is best for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus on non-moving objects [image4]. AF-C (continuous) is designed for moving subjects, maintaining focus on dynamic scenes like sports or wildlife [image4]. Manual focus (MF) allows for precise control, useful for specific subjects like faces, where touch-based adjustments can be made [image4]. These settings, combined with Pro Mode's control over ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation [9][image3], enable photographers to fine-tune their shots for optimal results in various environments.\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, photographers can achieve professional-quality images tailored to their specific needs, whether capturing landscapes, portraits, or action shots. ![Metering modes guide](image5) and ![Focus modes guide](image4) provide clear visual references for these adjustments.\n\nThe different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by allowing tailored adjustments to lighting and focus, ensuring optimal image quality across various scenarios."}

This rate is crucial for diagnosing marketing opportunities and ensuring that leads are not only generated but also qualified for sales engagement [1].\n\nIn image4, the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is explicitly stated as 1.50%. This low rate suggests that only a small fraction of marketing-qualified leads are being accepted by the sales team, indicating potential issues in lead quality or alignment between marketing and sales criteria [4]. This could imply that the leads being qualified by marketing may not meet the sales team's standards or that there is a disconnect in the lead scoring process [10].\n\nImage7 provides cross-industry average conversion rates, where the MQL to SAL conversion rate ranges from 45% to 75%. This wide range highlights significant variability across industries and companies, suggesting that a 1.50% rate, as seen in image4, is considerably below average. Such a low rate could indicate inefficiencies in lead qualification processes or misalignment in lead definitions between marketing and sales teams.\n\nThe implications of these differences are substantial. A low MQL to SAL conversion rate, as observed in image4, may point to several issues:\n- **Lead Quality**: Marketing may be qualifying leads that do not meet sales criteria, leading to wasted resources and time.\n- **Alignment**: There might be a lack of synchronization between marketing and sales on what constitutes a qualified lead.\n- **Process Improvement**: There is a need to refine lead scoring models to better align with sales acceptance criteria, ensuring that only high-quality leads are passed to sales [10].\n\nConversely, industries with higher conversion rates (45-75% in image7) likely have more effective lead qualification processes and better alignment between marketing and sales teams. This alignment ensures that leads are not only generated but also meet the necessary criteria for sales engagement, leading to more efficient use of resources and higher sales productivity.\n\nIn summary, the low MQL to SAL conversion rate observed in image4 compared to the industry averages in image7 suggests a need for improved lead qualification and better alignment between marketing and sales efforts to enhance lead quality and sales efficiency.\n\n![The conversion rate from"}
