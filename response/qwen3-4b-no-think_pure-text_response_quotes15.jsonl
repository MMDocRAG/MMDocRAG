For instance, [1] indicates that those with some college experience (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%) are less likely to think neither party has high ethical standards compared to other groups. This suggests that higher education may correlate with more positive views of ethical standards across parties.\n\n![Both parties](image4) shows that educational levels influence perceptions of both parties. Among those with at least a college degree, 31% say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe either party, while 43% say it describes one but not the other. This implies that higher education might lead to more nuanced or critical views of political ethics.\n\nPolitical affiliations also play a significant role. [2] highlights that independents are more negative about the administration's ethical standards than partisans. Specifically, two-thirds of independents say the standards are \"not good\" or \"poor,\" whereas majorities of Republicans and Democrats describe their own party positively. This indicates that political leanings significantly affect ethical evaluations.\n\nRegarding approval ratings of Trump, [8] notes that younger adults, those with higher education, and non-whites are more likely to disapprove of his job performance. This suggests that educational attainment and demographic factors like race and age influence public opinion on Trump's leadership.\n\n![Demographic Disapproval](image2) further illustrates these points by showing how different demographic groups rate disapproval and approval. The chart divides responses by gender, race, age, education level, political affiliation, and religious affiliation, highlighting significant variations in opinions across these categories.\n\nIn summary, educational levels and political affiliations significantly shape perceptions of ethical standards and approval ratings of Trump, with higher education and certain political leanings often correlating with more critical views of political ethics and leadership."}

By comparison, 48% of those with a bachelor’s degree and 44% of those with less education rated the government’s performance positively.\n\nWhen comparing views on whether anti-terror policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties or not far enough to protect the country, [7] states that by two-to-one, Americans now said they were more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies had not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) rather than that these policies had gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (28%). This shift has been more pronounced among Republicans, with slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) now saying their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough.\n\n![Concern about policies](image5)  \nThis image shows survey results on opinions about the balance between civil liberties and national protection across different age groups. It highlights that older adults (65+) are more concerned that policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (71%), while younger adults (18-29) are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%). \n\nThe data from [5] and [7] indicate that while there is a general concern that policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, there is also a significant portion of the population that believes these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties.

However, [9] indicates that two-thirds (66%) now believe the U.S. and its allies will either definitely or probably succeed in their campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, up 11 points from July (from 55%).

[2] highlights wide partisan divides in current assessments of the campaign against ISIS, but more modest ones in predictions of its ultimate success. For instance, 45% of Democrats, compared with 33% of independents and 26% of Republicans, say the campaign is going at least fairly well. Conversely, six-in-ten or more Republicans (65%), Democrats (72%), and independents (62%) say it will ultimately be successful.

In contrast, Germans are divided between increasing or maintaining budgets [8]. \n\n![image1](image1)  \nThis chart illustrates the significant difference in opinion between the U.S. and Germany on an unspecified issue regarding whether something should or should not be done.

In the U.S., there has been a notable shift in views regarding whether European allies should increase their defense spending. In 2017, 45% of Americans believed European allies should dedicate more resources to national defense, but by 2019, this number had dropped to 50%, indicating a significant change in public sentiment [5]. This trend is also reflected in the partisan divide, where Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe [8]. However, even among Republicans, support for increased defense spending has declined, showing a decrease of 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [8].\n\n![Should/Should not](image1)  \nThis image shows the difference in opinions between the U.S. and Germany on an unspecified issue.

The chart uses different colors to represent the \"Should not\" and \"Should\" positions for each country, indicating a significant difference in opinion between the two countries on the issue at hand.\n\nIn Germany, opinions on defense spending have also changed over the years. The public is divided on whether to increase or maintain current levels of spending on national defense, with about four-in-ten taking each view. Like in the U.S., views on this issue in Germany have changed since 2017. At that time, about half of Germans were content with their country’s defense spending, while about a third felt it should be increased [7]. The data from the comparative bar chart shows changing opinions in both countries regarding national defense spending over the three-year period [5].\n\n![Trends over three years](image2)  \nThe image is a line graph showing trends over three years, from 2017 to 2019, for two political affiliations: \"Republican/Lean Rep\" and \"Democrat/Lean Dem.\" The \"Republican/Lean Rep\" line is depicted in red and shows a decline from 62 in 2017 to 48 in 2019. The \"Democrat/Lean Dem\" line is depicted in blue and shows a slight decline from 34 in 2017 to 28 in 2019, with a noted low point at 27 in 2018.\n\nThe perception of the importance of the subject also differs between the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., a higher percentage of respondents view the subject as \"Very important\" compared to German respondents, who tend to view it as less important overall [3]. This is illustrated in the horizontal bar chart comparing the perceived importance of an unspecified subject between respondents from the U.S. and Germany [3].\n\n![Perceived importance](image3)  \nThe image is a horizontal bar chart comparing the perceived importance of an unspecified subject between respondents from the U.S. and Germany. The bars are divided into four segments, each representing different levels of importance: \"Not important at all,\" \"Not too important,\" \"Somewhat important,\" and \"Very important.\" For the U.S. respondents: 5% consider it \"Not important at all,\" 8% consider it \"Not too important,\" 29% consider it \"Somewhat important,\" and 56% consider it \"Very important.\" For the German respondents: 15% consider it \"Not important at all,\" 30% consider it \"Not too important,\" 37% consider it \"Somewhat important,\" and 15% consider it \"Very important.\"\n\nIn terms of specific political parties in Germany, the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens have different stances on defense spending. The CDU/CSU has the highest support with 51, followed by the SPD with 41, and the Greens with 28 [4]. This indicates a clear partisan divide in Germany regarding defense spending.\n\n![Political parties](image4)  \nThe image is a horizontal bar chart displaying numerical values associated with three different political parties. The parties listed are CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens. The numbers next to each party indicate specific values: CDU/CSU has 51, SPD has 41, and Greens have 28. The chart is likely used to represent poll results, seats in a parliament, or other similar data related to these political parties.\n\nIn summary, both American and German opinions on defense spending have evolved over the years, with significant changes in public sentiment and partisan divides.

This age-related disparity is reflected in a horizontal bar chart that shows higher percentages of younger Germans viewing the bases as \"Not important\" compared to older Germans [3]. \n\nIn contrast, in the U.S., political affiliation plays a significant role in determining which countries are considered the most important foreign policy partners.

The image shows that Hispanic individuals are more optimistic about their financial situation, with 76% feeling better off in 2004, 67% in 2008, 73% in 2011, and 81% in 2015, compared to the general public's 70%, 56%, 58%, and 61% respectively, as depicted in ![Comparison of attitudes or opinions of Hispanic individuals and the general public](image4). This suggests that even though Hispanics face higher unemployment rates, they tend to have more positive views about their economic status.\n\nThese trends contribute to income and wealth disparities. The image illustrates that median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, reaching $42,491 in 2014, while the general public's income was higher at $53,700, as shown in ![Comparison of income and poverty rates for Hispanic and all U.S. households](image2). Additionally, the poverty rate for Hispanics was 23.6% in 2014, significantly higher than the 14.8% for all U.S. households. Wealth disparities are also evident, with Hispanic households having a much lower median wealth compared to all U.S. households, as shown in the same image.\n\nIn summary, while Hispanic unemployment rates have improved, they remain higher than those of non-Hispanics, and Hispanics generally have more positive economic perceptions, which may partially offset some of the income and wealth disparities. However, these disparities persist, as indicated by the data."}

This trend is further supported by [10], which highlights that device ownership among older adults differs notably from the population as a whole.\n\n![Internet Usage by Age Group](image1)  \nThis image shows that the percentage of internet users who go online daily or almost every day decreases with age. For example, 88% of 18-29 year olds go online daily, whereas only 71% of 65+ year olds do so.

Driverless vehicles are perhaps the most prominent example of this trend. Fully 94% of Americans have some awareness of the effort to develop driverless vehicles, and roughly two-thirds of the public anticipates that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century – with 9% predicting that this will occur in the next 10 years [1]."}

For instance, the automated criminal risk score is seen as more fair than the personal finance score, with 50% finding it fair compared to only 32% for the personal finance score [1]. This difference suggests that the public may perceive criminal risk scoring as more just or neutral, possibly due to its application in a legal context where fairness is a critical concern [3].\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, similar shares of the public believe these programs would be effective at doing the job they are supposed to do, with 54% thinking the personal finance score algorithm would do a good job at identifying good customers [5]. However, the personal finance score is a notable exception where the perception of fairness lags behind effectiveness, indicating a possible disconnect between what people think these systems can achieve and whether they believe they are fair [4].\n\nThe image3 shows that the effective-fair difference is most pronounced for the personal finance score, with a 22-point gap between effectiveness and fairness [3]. This implies that while many see these systems as effective, there is significant skepticism about their fairness, which could affect public trust. The image4 further illustrates this by showing that the personal finance score is perceived as the least fair among the four scenarios, with only 6% finding it very fair [4].\n\nThese differences in perceptions might imply that the public trusts systems that are used in contexts where fairness is a higher priority, such as parole decisions, more than those used in financial contexts. The image1 highlights that older age groups are more skeptical about the unbiased capability of programs, suggesting that age might influence perceptions of fairness and effectiveness [1].\n\nOverall, the public is relatively split on whether these programs would be effective, but there is a clear trend of skepticism regarding their fairness, especially for systems used in financial contexts. This skepticism could indicate a broader concern about the potential for bias and unfairness in automated decision-making systems [6]."}

For instance, while more Republicans than Democrats offer positive assessments of the U.S. response, only 22% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the U.S. has been more effective than other wealthy countries, whereas 34% say it has been less effective, and 42% say it has been about as effective. In contrast, 87% of Democrats and Democratic leaners view the U.S. response as less effective compared with other wealthy countries [1].\n\n![Less, About as, More](image1)  \nThis graph from Pew Research Center shows that Democrats/Lean Democrats are much more likely to rate the U.S. response as less effective compared to other wealthy nations (87%) than Republicans/Lean Republicans (34%). The total percentage of people who say the U.S. response has been less effective is 62%, with a significant portion of this being Democrats/Lean Democrats.\n\nPartisan divides also affect trust in institutions. Image2 shows that Democrats/Lean Democrats have higher levels of trust in hospitals and medical centers (87%) compared to Republicans/Lean Republicans (90%), although this is slightly lower than the overall total of 88%. However, trust in public health officials such as those at the CDC is much lower among Republicans/Lean Republicans (53%) compared to Democrats/Lean Democrats (72%). Similarly, trust in local and state elected officials is also lower among Republicans/Lean Republicans [2].\n\nThe chart in image3 further illustrates these partisan differences. It shows that Democrats/Lean Democrats are more likely to believe that significantly reducing coronavirus infections to a comfortable level for reopening the economy is more effective for recovery, regardless of their county's death rate. Additionally, they are more likely to attribute increases in confirmed cases to more new infections rather than more tests [3].\n\nThese differences are not just about geographic variations but are largely driven by political affiliations. As stated in text quote [6], partisan divides in opinions about the pandemic and policies to address it continue to be far wider than the differences in opinion between those who live in places with higher health impacts and those who live in places with less impact.\n\nIn conclusion, partisan divides significantly affect perceptions of the COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions, with Democrats generally having more positive views of the U.S. response and higher trust in public health officials and institutions compared to Republicans."}

This trend is further supported by the image, which shows a bar chart comparing different generations and their self-identification rates, although the exact context of the percentages is unclear [image1]. \n\nAnother significant factor is the influence of language and cultural ties. The text notes that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, with a majority of both immigrant and U.S.-born Latinos holding this view [6]. This is visually represented in image5, where it is shown that a higher percentage of third or higher generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish, indicating a shift away from linguistic heritage as a marker of identity [image5].\n\nCultural and familial connections also play a role. Image2 provides a breakdown of reasons why some individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic, with mixed backgrounds and lack of cultural links being prominent factors [image2]. Additionally, image3 illustrates that among self-identified Hispanics, \"Country of origin/heritage\" is the most preferred term, followed by \"Hispanic/Latino\" and \"American\" [image3].\n\nThese trends suggest that as generations pass, the connection to Hispanic culture and language diminishes, leading to a greater identification with American identity.

This suggests that the USA consumes more energy per person than both China and Germany, which could contribute to higher CO2 emissions.\n\nIn terms of motor vehicle ownership, the USA has the largest share in global motor vehicle demand and a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people, as shown in image3 [3]. China, on the other hand, has a large share in global demand but a lower number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. Germany has a moderate share and relatively high motor vehicle rates per 1,000 people. This indicates that the USA has a higher number of vehicles per capita compared to China and Germany, which could lead to higher transportation-related emissions.\n\nThe combination of high energy consumption and vehicle ownership in the USA suggests a larger environmental footprint compared to China and Germany. However, the actual CO2 emissions per capita would depend on the type of energy used and the efficiency of vehicles.

This suggests that spatial positional encodings are crucial for maintaining high AP, especially in the encoder. Text [1] further supports this by noting that not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, whereas passing them in the decoder only causes a minor drop. This indicates that spatial positional encodings are more critical in the encoder than in the decoder.\n\nText [3] and [8] provide visual insights into how different slots in the decoder specialize in predicting boxes of various sizes and areas.

This is important for maintaining high AP even when dealing with rare classes or out-of-distribution data.\n\nText [9] explains the importance of each decoder layer in the DETR model, showing that AP improves significantly with each layer. This improvement is attributed to the self-attention mechanism allowing the model to inhibit duplicate predictions, which is crucial for maintaining high AP.\n\nText [10] presents the main results of the DETR model, showing that it outperforms existing methods in panoptic segmentation, particularly on stuff classes.

However, recall (orange line) remains relatively stable, suggesting that the model's ability to retrieve all relevant information is not greatly affected by the removal of knowledge elements. The F1-Score (green line) shows a moderate increase, reflecting a balance between precision and recall.\n\nThese changes imply that models can filter out incorrect information to some extent, which is beneficial for precision but does not significantly affect recall since the model can still identify the correct information when it is present. The stability of recall suggests that the model has some capability to recognize and cite the correct information even when parts of the knowledge are missing. This indicates that models can handle absent knowledge to a limited extent, but there is a clear trade-off between the explicitness of the question context and the irrelevance of the knowledge required by the question. ![Recall Stability](image3) \n\nThe implications of these changes highlight the importance of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts, as noted in text3.

First, the system uses a visual encoder to process the input image and generate an image embedding, as described in [10]. This embedding is then navigated through a previously constructed memory index to identify the top-k related images based on similarity. The retrieved categories are then used as a preliminary filter to narrow down the vast possibilities to those most likely relevant, based on historical data and the semantic closeness of stored labels to the image content [10].\n\nIn the context of object detection datasets, the system employs additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring to help the MLLMs understand the objects of interest. As shown in image4, the image is first cropped based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resized to a fixed proportion. Non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest are blurred to direct the MLLMs' focus toward the relevant objects, facilitating their identification in object detection tasks [8].\n\nOnce the image embeddings are processed and the relevant objects are identified, the system retrieves the top-k category names from the memory, as detailed in [4]. These retrieved class names are then passed to the MLLMs, which use their advanced linguistic and semantic analysis capabilities to rank these class names based on contextual appropriateness with the input image. This ranking process is crucial for achieving accurate and contextually aware classification predictions, as illustrated in image1 and image2.\n\nThe integration of the multimodal retriever with the MLLMs allows the system to leverage the strengths of both approaches, enhancing the few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies. This combination not only addresses the inherent limitations in fine-grained recognition but also preserves the model’s comprehensive knowledge base, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language recognition tasks [2].\n\n![Reranking class names for zero-shot object recognition](image2)\n![Two-part pipeline for the RAR process](image3)"}

For instance, the results in Table 2 clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. Comparing the second and third columns, we can see the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings. This indicates that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence [6].\n\n![{Alignment of word embeddings helps increase BLEU scores for all three tasks}](image3)\n\nHowever, the results in Table 4 show that somewhat surprisingly, the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages [8]. This suggests that while alignment might help in certain scenarios, it is not universally effective.\n\nAnother study highlights that aligning the embedding spaces between the source and target languages may be beneficial, as it would allow the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between the source and target. To test this hypothesis, they adopted the approach proposed by Smith et al. (2017) to learn orthogonal transformations that convert the word embeddings of multiple languages to a single space and used these aligned embeddings instead of independent ones [4].\n\nFrom Table 5, we can see that the BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT do generally follow this hypothesis. As we move to very different languages, RU and HE see larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts FR and IT. This can be largely attributed to the observation from the previous section that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; RU and HE have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger [5].\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can have a positive impact on BLEU scores, particularly when the source and target languages are more similar, but the effectiveness can vary depending on the specific language pair and the size of the training data."}

This is supported by [9], which shows that the gain in BLEU score is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. \n\nLanguage similarity also plays a significant role. [10] suggests that the gain from pre-training may be larger when the source and target languages are more similar, as semantic neighborhoods will be more similar between the two languages. This is evident in [6], where the similarity of GL/PT is the highest while BE/RU is the lowest, indicating that the effect of pre-training is more pronounced for similar language pairs.\n\nTraining set size influences the effectiveness of pre-training as well.

For example, when translating a female nurse versus a male receptionist, systems tend to perform better with the former, demonstrating a clear bias.\n\n![Gender classification breakdown](image1)\n\nThis bias is further illustrated in [3], where it is noted that four popular commercial systems and two academic models are significantly prone to gender-biased translation errors across eight target languages. The image1 shows that the distribution of gender classifications across different datasets (Winogender, WinoBias, and WinoMT) highlights the presence of gender bias in these translations.\n\nThe accuracy of these translations varies by language and system. For instance, [8] mentions that most systems perform poorly on preserving the gender of entities from the original English sentence, except for German, where three out of four systems achieve their best performance. This may be due to the similarity between German and English.\n\n![Translation service accuracy and error metrics](image2)\n\nThe image2 provides a detailed breakdown of accuracy and error metrics for different translation services across various languages.

This reduction is consistent with the Corporation's strategy to prioritize capital spending in a range of $16 billion to $19 billion for 2021, as noted in text quote [3]. The decrease in Capex can be attributed to industry conditions in 2020 that led to lower realized prices for the Corporation’s products, resulting in substantially lower earnings and operating cash flow compared to 2019, as described in text quote [4].\n\nRegarding taxes, ExxonMobil's income tax expense decreased significantly from $5.3 billion in 2019 to a benefit of $5.6 billion in 2020, as shown in the table ![Taxes for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018](image4). This relative benefit is driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020. The effective tax rate dropped from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020 due primarily to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. Additionally, total other taxes and duties decreased from $33.2 billion in 2019 to $28.4 billion in 2020, as mentioned in text quote [10].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes include a reduction in capital expenditures, which may affect the Corporation's ability to invest in new projects and maintain its operations, and a decrease in tax expenses, which could improve liquidity and financial condition.

The reserve for credit losses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [7].\n\nCard Member receivables also saw an increase, with total receivables rising to $53.6 billion in 2021 from $43.7 billion in 2020. However, the reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in outstanding receivable balances [2].\n\nComparing these changes with network volumes and card member spending, the table shows that network volumes increased by 24% in 2021 and decreased by 18% in 2020.

For instance, in Latin America (LatAm), beverage sales accounted for only 10% in all three years, while food/snack made up the remaining 90%. This suggests a strong focus on food/snack in LatAm, which could influence net revenue and operating profit due to higher volume sales or different pricing strategies.\n\nIn Europe, beverage sales were 55% in 2020 and 2019, down from 50% in 2018, indicating a possible shift towards more food/snack offerings. This change might reflect market trends or strategic adjustments in product mix, affecting both revenue and operating profit.\n\nFor AMESA, the percentage of beverage sales decreased from 40% in 2019 to 30% in 2020, while food/snack increased correspondingly. This shift could be attributed to changing consumer preferences or operational strategies, impacting net revenue and operating profit.\n\nIn APAC, beverage sales remained steady at 25%, with food/snack making up the rest. The consistent distribution might indicate a stable market or a well-established product mix that contributes to stable revenue and profit figures.\n\nThe table also shows that PepsiCo's overall distribution remained consistent at 45% beverage and 55% food/snack, suggesting a strategic focus on food/snack across the company. This could be a factor in maintaining or adjusting operating profit margins, as food/snack might have different cost structures and pricing strategies compared to beverages.\n\n![Net revenue and operating profit for different divisions of a company over three years (2018, 2019, and 2020)](image4)\n\nLooking at the net revenue and operating profit data, there is a notable increase in operating profit from 2018 to 2020, primarily driven by net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring and impairment charges. However, this growth was partially offset by increases in operating costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The distribution of beverage and food/snack categories likely plays a role in these changes, as the mix of products can affect revenue generation and cost management.\n\nFor example, the higher proportion of food/snack in certain regions might lead to higher volume sales, contributing to increased net revenue. Conversely, the lower proportion of beverage sales in some regions could result in lower revenue from high-margin products, affecting operating profit. The strategic distribution of beverage and food/snack categories thus influences the financial performance of each division, reflecting both market demands and internal strategies."}

This dramatic increase was primarily due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which required significant capital. The table shows that the acquisition financed €12,087 million in cash inflows, with the net effect being a positive figure of €10,961 million after accounting for other financing activities like borrowings and dividends. Additionally, the issuance of new shares to finance the Varian acquisition contributed to the increase in financing activities.\n\n![Siemens Healthineers Financial Activities](image4)\n\n**Cash flows from investing activities** decreased from €-1,912 million in 2020 to €-14,140 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly due to the large outflow associated with the acquisition of Varian, which amounted to €12,228 million. The table indicates that this was the primary factor driving the increase in outflows, as well as additional investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, which added €117 million to the outflows. These investments were largely related to capacity expansions and maintaining the company's competitive edge.\n\n![Siemens Healthineers Financial Activities](image4)\n\nThe key factors driving these changes were the acquisition of Varian, which significantly impacted both financing and investing activities, and the company's strategic investments in intangible assets and infrastructure to support growth and innovation."}

This represents a substantial improvement, with the loss in 2019 being reduced by a large margin in 2020.\n\nThe contributing factors to this change can be attributed to several elements. First, **text9** mentions that in 2020, the company's net income attributable to common stockholders was $721 million, representing a favorable change of $1.58 billion compared to the prior year. This indicates a significant increase in profitability. Additionally, **text10** highlights an increase in stock-based compensation expense, which was partially offset by a decrease in customer promotional costs, facilities-related expenses, and sales and marketing activities. The rise in stock-based compensation was due to a rapid increase in market capitalization and updates to the business outlook.\n\nFurthermore, **text4** notes that net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests increased by $54 million, or 62%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower activities from new financing fund arrangements.

These losses were primarily related to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment and were recorded in research and development costs [3].\n\nThe impact of these changes on the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment is evident in the figures provided. For instance, the carrying amount of intangible assets not yet being amortised was DKK 9,607 million in 2020, up from DKK 3,380 million in 2019, primarily due to patents and licences related to research and development projects [4]. However, the impairment tests conducted in 2020 and 2019 indicated that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable, leading to the recognition of impairment losses [4].\n\nFurthermore, the depreciation of property, plant, and equipment also shows a trend. The total depreciation for 2020 was DKK 964 million, compared to DKK 852 million in 2019 [2]. This reflects the continued depreciation of assets over their useful lives, as well as the potential for impairment losses affecting the net carrying amounts [8].\n\nIn summary, the depreciation and impairment losses have increased from 2019 to 2020, impacting the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment through higher expenses and the recognition of impairment losses."}

This is further corroborated by the image5, which shows a significant drop in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, representing a -44.4% change.\n\n![Interest and Other Investment Income](image5)  \nThe decline in interest income is also linked to the low short-term interest rates that prevailed through 2021, as mentioned in [2]. The image1 provides insight into the asset allocation, showing that cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills were $90,688 thousand in 2021 compared to $67,082 thousand in 2020. This indicates a shift towards holding more liquid assets, which may have contributed to lower interest income due to the lower yields on these instruments.\n\nAdditionally, the decrease in net investment income is reflected in the image5, where pre-tax net investment income dropped from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021, a -5.0% change. This decline is consistent with the text quote [3], which notes that after-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020, negatively affected by declines in interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\nThe asset allocation strategy, as shown in image1, reflects a focus on maintaining ample liquidity and safety over yield, which aligns with the company's approach to managing short-term investments.

This was attributed to a one-time effect from risk provisions and the closing of the transaction, which had a positive impact. Furthermore, supported by the positive revenue development and the first-time earnings contribution from Varian, adjusted EBIT increased by 40% from the prior-year period, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.4% for fiscal year 2021 compared to 15.5% in the prior year.

Specifically, the change in sales prices resulted in an increase of $16,965 million, which is a major factor in the overall increase in EBITDA.\n\n![Change in Sales Prices](image1)  \nThis increase was due to higher prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, and nickel, among others.

The significant factors affecting these changes include strong cash flow generation, strategic share repurchases, and dividend increases, as well as reorganization efforts within the Analog segment that did not impact financial statements.\n\n![Balance sheet remained robust](image4)  \nThis image shows a table with numerical data that likely represents the company's financial status, including cash and short-term investments, which were robust at the end of 2020.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we can see that in 2020, the company had a strong cash flow, with free cash flow at 38 percent of revenue, and approximately 109 percent of free cash flow was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases of $2.6 billion reduced outstanding shares by 1.4 percent, and the quarterly dividend rate increased 13.3 percent, indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders. These actions are part of TI’s capital management strategy.\n\nAdditionally, the company reorganized its product lines within the Analog segment in 2020, which simplified its business structure but did not affect its previously reported consolidated financial statements or reportable segment results. This reorganization likely contributed to more efficient operations and potentially better financial performance.\n\nThe company's net income for 2020 is reflected in the balance sheet, showing that the company ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $6.6 billion, indicating strong financial health. The retained earnings would have increased due to net income and would have been affected by dividend distributions and stock repurchases, which are significant factors in the company's financial strategy.\n\nIn summary, the company's retained earnings and net income increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by strong cash flow generation, strategic share repurchases, and dividend increases, as well as operational efficiencies from reorganization efforts."}

These factors, along with the overall financial performance, contributed to the increase in comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC.\n\nThe net income and comprehensive income attributable to Accenture PLC increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and favorable changes in other comprehensive income components."}

This increase is partly due to higher income from equity investments and a profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH, which rose by €420 million to €1,879 million. However, this was partially offset by increased expenses related to fees for the bridge facility and interest expenses for loans used to finance the acquisition of Varian.

In 2021, the company reported $\\S21.5$ billion of net income, compared with $\\S3.4$ billion in 2020. This increase was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Additionally, the provision for credit losses decreased due to continued improvements in the economic environment, leading to lower charge-offs and better portfolio credit quality.

Total loans (average and period-end) decreased as paydowns exceeded originations. Home Lending loan balances were also impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations.

However, increased working capital requirements partially offset these gains.\n\nFor the Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment, the operating profit in 2021 was $6 billion, in line with the company's targets. The segment's operating profit as a percent of total sales was 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. This indicates that while the segment's profit margin decreased slightly, the absolute value of the profit increased, reflecting strong free cash flow and effective cost management.\n\nIn terms of net cash provided by operating activities, the consolidated figure for 2021 was $7.20 billion, up $871 million from 2020. The ME&T segment also contributed positively to this figure, generating $6 billion in free cash flow in 2021, which was used to return $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Financial Products segment, while contributing less in terms of operating profit, also showed an improvement in its operating cash flow, with $1.42 billion in 2021 compared to $1.27 billion in 2020.\n\nOverall, Caterpillar's financial performance in 2021 showed significant improvements in both operating profit and net cash provided by operating activities compared to 2020, particularly in the consolidated and ME&T segments. These improvements were driven by strategic investments, effective cost management, and strong free cash flow generation."}

This is shown in ![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,056 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020](image3). The increase was driven by both current and prior year tax positions, with a net decrease from settlements and statute of limitations lapses.\n\nCommon share repurchases also increased from 22 million shares in 2019 to 14 million shares in 2020, as shown in ![Common share repurchases, shares: 14 million in 2020 and 22 million in 2019](image1). The average price per share decreased from $245.97 in 2019 to $300.58 in 2020, reflecting a more expensive repurchase in 2020. The aggregate cost of repurchases was $5,500 million in 2019 and $4,250 million in 2020, showing a significant reduction in the total cost of repurchases.\n\nThe implications for the company's financial position include a higher potential tax liability, which could impact the effective tax rate, and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to repurchases, which can improve earnings per share. However, the decrease in the aggregate cost of repurchases may indicate a lower cost basis or a change in repurchase strategy."}

The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, along with favorable price realization [10].\n\nThe sales volume increase is closely tied to changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories about $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 [9]. This indicates that dealers adjusted their inventory levels more significantly in 2020, which contributed to the higher sales volume in 2021.\n\n![Profit by Segment](image2)  \nThis table shows that the Construction Industries segment had a total sales of $5.736 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.228 billion or 27% compared with $4.508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand, along with favorable price realization [5]. Similarly, the Financial Products segment saw an increase of $53 million or 27% in segment profit [3].\n\nThe operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1.611 billion, an increase of $231 million or 17% compared with $1.380 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 [7]. Higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility were major contributors to this increase. However, higher manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses were more than offset by these factors [7].\n\n![Operating Profit Comparison](image4)  \nThis chart compares the consolidated operating profit between the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021. It shows that the operating profit increased from $1,380 million in 2020 to $1,611 million in 2021. The increase was driven by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income, despite higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses [7].\n\nIn summary, the sales volume and operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventories."}

The volatility of the share price is also noted as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota’s efforts [image1]. Additionally, individual performance evaluations are conducted, which are qualitative assessments of each director’s performance [image1].\n\nThe evaluation framework for Toyota includes two main criteria: consolidated operating income and the volatility of Toyota’s share price, each carrying equal weight of 50% [image3]. The consolidated operating income is evaluated based on the degree of attainment of the required income set in 2011 for Toyota’s sustainable growth, with a reference value of 1 trillion yen [image3]. The volatility of the share price is assessed through a comparative evaluation of the volatility of Toyota’s share price against the Nikkei stock average [image3].\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration system is designed to reflect the benefits of shareholders, with Toyota aiming to maintain and improve the consolidated payout ratio of 30% [7]. The company also engages in constructive dialogue with shareholders to encourage them to improve corporate value and achieve sustainable growth [9]. \n\nThe table in image2 provides a detailed breakdown of the remuneration for individuals receiving consolidated remuneration of one hundred million Japanese yen or more, including fixed and performance-linked components.

For instance, Lovisa has closed underperforming stores and continued to identify new sites for expansion [1]. The company has also focused on enhancing customer loyalty through initiatives like the global roll-out of piercing services into stores during FY20 [1].\n\n![{Lovisa's international store expansion strategy}] (image4)\n\nOne of the key achievements of Lovisa's international expansion strategy is the successful establishment of a portfolio of company-owned stores in various regions including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America [4]. Additionally, the company has supported franchised stores in several Middle Eastern countries [4]. The strategy also includes a focus on brand proliferation through social media and promotional activities that connect directly with the customer base [6].\n\nHowever, the expansion strategy has not been without challenges. The fast fashion jewellery sector is highly competitive, and while Lovisa has proven its ability to operate profitably internationally, it faces the challenge of changing customer preferences and the need to continuously innovate [7].

The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million (adjusted for currency) was driven by various factors, including the growth in financing receivables and the leverage of assets under contract by other IBM units, which generate stable revenue streams [4]. This suggests that IBM was expanding its asset base to support its financing operations, which could indicate increased investment in long-term projects or client assets.\n\n![Noncurrent assets and long-term debt](image2)\n\nLong-term debt also saw changes, with total long-term debt remaining relatively stable at $54,355 million in 2020 compared to $54,102 million in 2019 [2]. However, the debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt, and the terms of these loans are set to match the underlying financing receivables, ensuring alignment with the company's financial strategy [5].

However, the distribution across regions may have shifted slightly, as indicated by the different regional breakdowns in the two years.  \n\nThe reasons behind any changes in the geographical distribution could be multifaceted. One key factor is the impact of the pandemic, which significantly affected store operations in 2020 and 2021. The pandemic led to lockdown measures and restricted mobility, resulting in the closure of up to 90% of stores in the first quarter of 2020 and significant restrictions on store openings in the final months of 2020. This likely influenced the store distribution in 2021, as stores were closed or restructured.  \n\nIn 2021, Inditex focused on store optimisation activities, including the absorption of 578 stores, which suggests a strategic effort to streamline operations. This could have led to a reduction in the number of stores in certain regions or a reallocation of stores to more profitable areas. Additionally, the expansion into new markets and the continuation of store optimisation efforts in existing markets could have contributed to changes in the geographical distribution.  \n\nThe geographical distribution of stores in 2022 reflects the ongoing strategies of Inditex to manage its global presence effectively, balancing the need for market penetration with operational efficiency."}

These credits helped lower the overall provision for income taxes, as seen in the total provision figures for each year: $19,244 in 2015, $82,570 in 2014, and $58,671 in 2013. ![R&D Tax Credit Impact](image5)"}

However, the company was able to maintain a significant increase in net cash, as noted in text [10], which suggests that despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company managed to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to support its equity growth.\n\nIn summary, the cash flow from operating activities and changes in retained earnings played a significant role in affecting the total equity from July 2018 to June 2020, with the company showing an overall increase in equity during this period. ![Total Equity Growth](image3)"}

For instance, a significant majority of Republicans (72%) agree that it is important to get tougher rather than building a strong relationship with China on economic issues, compared to 37% of Democrats [3]. Similarly, a larger percentage of Republicans (53%) think of China, on balance, as an enemy of the U.S., compared to 20% of Democrats [3].\n\nIn terms of specific issues, four problems stand out for being ones that half or more describe as very serious: cyber attacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights [8]. The image4 shows that concern about these issues has generally increased over the past year, with percentages for each issue increasing from 2020 to 2021 [4].\n\nOverall, the top concerns Americans have about China are human rights and the economy, with other significant concerns including cyber attacks, job losses, and China's growing military and technological power."}

However, the population began to decline after 1890, with numbers fluctuating slightly before stabilizing around 13,330 in 1900 [3]. By 2000, the population had increased again to 9,403 [3]. This trend is reflected in the table showing population data for various census years [image3].\n\nHistorical factors that influenced these changes include the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad and the Homestead Act. The Transcontinental Railroad, completed in less than three years, transformed Nebraska from a thinly populated corridor into a booming agricultural state [9]. The Homestead Act provided settlers with 160 acres of land, encouraging westward migration and contributing to the growth of the county [9]. Additionally, the arrival of various ethnic groups, including Danes, Swedes, Irish, and Germans, led to the establishment of communities and religious institutions such as St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg [7] ![The image shows a church building with a tall steeple topped by a cross.

However, when aligned embeddings were used, the score improved slightly to 12.1, indicating that alignment can play a role in enhancing translation quality [image1].\n\nIn contrast, for PT → EN, the BLEU scores remained relatively stable, with unaligned embeddings yielding a score of 30.8 and aligned embeddings resulting in a score of 30.6, showing a minimal change [image1]. This suggests that for some language pairs, the effect of pre-training might be less pronounced.\n\nFor AZ → EN, pre-training had a positive effect, with the BLEU score increasing from 2.0 to 2.1 when using aligned embeddings [image1]. This indicates that pre-training can be beneficial, especially for lower-resource languages.\n\nThe results from Table 2 highlight that pre-training word embeddings in the source and/or target languages can increase BLEU scores. Specifically, pre-trained source language embeddings showed a more significant increase in BLEU scores compared to pre-trained target language embeddings, suggesting that the majority of the gain comes from better encoding of the source sentence [6].\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translation tasks from Portuguese, Turkish, and Russian to English shows that pre-training can result in higher BLEU scores, particularly when the training data is limited. The gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the training set size increases [image2].\n\nOverall, pre-training can have a positive impact on BLEU scores, especially for lower-resource languages and when the training data is limited.

The process is detailed in [7], where the algorithm starts with a broad outlook and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers.\n\nIn contrast, **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level for comparison [3]. This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones, which can offer greater flexibility by retrieving information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question [1]. As depicted in image2, the collapsed tree approach is illustrated as a single layer where nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity until reaching a threshold number of tokens [2].\n\nThe difference in approach is visually represented in image2, where **Tree Traversal Retrieval (A)** is shown as a step-by-step traversal through the tree layers, while **Collapsed Tree Retrieval (B)** is depicted as a flattened structure where nodes are compared on a single level. ![Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image2)"}

Additionally, [6] states that our initial query not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin on CIFAR-10-LT.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 shows that on CIFAR-10-LT, the \"hard-to-contrast\" strategy leads slightly, with \"Easy-to-contrast\" and \"Easy-to-learn\" also showing strong performance. However, it is noted that \"easy-to-learn\" and \"hard-to-learn\" strategies require ground truths, which are not always available in active learning scenarios.\n\nImage4 provides further insight, showing that for CIFAR-10, while random selection starts out strong, the active learning methods start to catch up or outperform as the number of images increases beyond the lower budget scenario. Although this is for CIFAR-10, it suggests that active learning strategies can outperform random selection under certain conditions.\n\nBased on the information provided, the \"hard-to-contrast\" strategy is explicitly stated to outperform random selection on CIFAR-10-LT.

We observe only marginal improvements with respect to ELMo alone (No R-GCN in Table  3 ) in both the unmasked and masked setting suggesting that a GCN operating over a naive entity graph would not add much to this task and a more informative graph construction and/or a more sophisticated parameterization is indeed needed.\n\n![{The table compares the performance of models with and without different relation types.}] (image1)\n\n[9] Next, we ablate each type of relations independently, that is, we either remove connections of mentions that co-occur in the same document ( DOC-BASED ), connections between mentions matching exactly ( MATCH ), or edges predicted by the coreference system ( COREF ). The first thing to note is that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. This is mostly because i) the majority of the connections are indeed between mentions in the same document, and ii) without connecting mentions within the same document we remove important information since the model is unaware they appear closely in the document. Secondly, we notice that coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role. Though it may be surprising for coreference edges, recall that the MATCH heuristic already captures the easiest coreference cases, and for the rest the out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable. Still, modelling all these different relations together gives our Entity-GCN a clear advantage. This is our best system evaluating on the development. Since Entity-GCN seems to gain little advantage using the coreference system, we report test results both with and without using it. Surprisingly, with coreference, we observe performance degradation on the test set. It is likely that the test documents are harder for the coreference system.\n\n![{The table shows the performance of different models with and without relation types.}] (image1)\n\n[9] The first thing to note is that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections.

The graphs are con- structed by selecting the most conﬁdent entity spans and linking these nodes with conﬁdence- weighted relation types and coreferences. The dynamic span graph allows coreference and re- lation type conﬁdences to propagate through the graph to iteratively reﬁne the span rep- resentations.

Object queries are learned positional encodings that serve as initial inputs to the transformer decoder. These queries are transformed through multiple multi-head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention mechanisms, allowing the model to globally reason about all objects together using pairwise relations between them. The object queries are then decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network, resulting in $N$ final predictions, where $N$ is the number of objects to be detected [5].\n\n![Object Queries in DETR](image3)\n\nThe use of object queries allows the DETR model to predict object locations and classes directly without the need for many hand-designed components like non-maximum suppression or anchor generation [7]. This approach simplifies the detection pipeline and enables the model to achieve competitive performance on tasks such as object detection and panoptic segmentation [4].\n\nThe DETR model's ability to process global information through self-attention mechanisms contributes to its superior performance on large objects compared to other methods like Faster R-CNN [4]. This is because the self-attention mechanism allows the model to consider the entire image as context when making predictions [5]."}

This robustness highlights the reliability of the fine-tuning strategy. ![Fine-Tuning Dataset Impact](image5) [5] \n\nIn contrast, in-context learning, while flexible and requiring less specialized data preparation, does not match the performance gains achieved through fine-tuning.

According to the text, when a model is re-trained on adversarial distractors, it can recover much of its original accuracy. For example, the F1 score of single-paragraph BERT drops from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 when tested on adversarial distractors, but increases to 60.10 F1 when re-trained on these distractors [4]. This indicates that adversarial training can improve the model's ability to handle certain types of questions.\n\n![Adversarial Distractors](image7)  \nThis image illustrates the process of selecting adversarial distractors for training. The diagram shows how the BERT model is used to select paragraphs that are least likely to contain the answer, which are then used as distractors for training. This process helps the model become more robust to different types of questions.\n\nAdditionally, when the model is trained on adversarial distractors and tested on the original distractors, it performs better than when it is tested on the same distractors without adversarial training. This is shown in Table 4, where the model's accuracy on adversarial distractors is higher when it has been re-trained on them [4].\n\n![Table 4: F1 Scores for Different Settings](image4)  \nThis table provides a detailed comparison of the F1 scores for different settings.

The model then designs a slot gate to handle special types of values, where for non-categorical slots, a two-way linear mapping is used to find text spans, and for categorical slots, the most plausible values are selected from the picklists based on the contextual representation [3].\n\n![DS-DST model architecture](image3)\n\nFurthermore, the model employs strong interactions between the dialog context and domain-slot pairs, which is crucial for effective dialogue state tracking.

The Problem Formulator uses language processing models (LLMs) to convert natural language problems into symbolic representations, identifying key entities, facts, and rules. As shown in the image, this step involves translating complex problems into structured formats that can be understood by symbolic solvers.\n\nOnce the problem is symbolically represented, the Symbolic Reasoner performs logical inference using methods tailored to the type of problem. For example, logic programming is used for rule-based problems, first-order logic provers for logical entailment, and constraint optimization for problems involving constraints. This stage ensures that the reasoning is deterministic and faithful, as it relies on established logical frameworks.\n\nFinally, the Result Interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into natural language, making the solution comprehensible. This process is demonstrated in the image with examples like electricity conduction, language model popularity, and determining the oldest vehicle, where each scenario follows the same three-step structure.\n\nBy integrating LLMs with symbolic solvers, LOGIC-LM achieves more accurate and transparent reasoning compared to purely language-based approaches."}

To account for the distinct nature of various NLP tasks that may require different semantic features, we compare SWEM-based models with existing recurrent and convolutional networks in a point-by-point manner. Speciically, we consider 17 datasets, including three distinct NLP tasks: document classification (Yahoo news, Yelp reviews, etc.), natural language sequence matching (SNLI, WikiQA, etc.) and (short) sentence classification/tagging (Stanford sentiment treebank, TREC, etc.). Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered.\n\n![SWEM vs CNN accuracy across subspace dimensions](image3)\n\n[9] To gain a deeper understanding regarding the modeling capacity of word embeddings, we further investigate the problem of sentence matching, including natural language inference, answer sentence selection and paraphrase identification. The corresponding performance metrics are shown in Table 5. Surprisingly, on most of the datasets considered (except WikiQA), SWEM demonstrates the best results compared with those with CNN or the LSTM encoder. Notably, on SNLI dataset, we observe that SWEM-max performs the best among all SWEM variants, consistent with the findings in Nie and Bansal (2017); Conneau et al. (2017), that max-pooling over BiLSTM hidden units outperforms average pooling operation on SNLI dataset. As a result, with only 120K parameters, our SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of 83.8%, which is very competitive among state-of-the-art sentence encoding-based models (in terms of both performance and number of parameters) 1 .\n\n![SWEM-max vs other models on sentence matching tasks](image4)\n\n[4] Many deep learning architectures have been proposed to model the compositionality in text sequences, requiring a substantial number of parameters and expensive computations. However, there has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the added value of sophisticated compositional functions. In this paper, we conduct a point-by-point comparative study between Simple Word-Embedding-based Models (SWEMs), consisting of parameter-free pooling operations, relative to word-embedding-based RNN/CNN models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered.\n\n[5] We begin with the task of categorizing documents (with approximately 100 words in average per document). We follow the data split in Zhang et al. (2015b) for comparability. These datasets can be generally categorized into three types: topic categorization (represented by Yahoo! Answer and AG news), sentiment analysis (represented by Yelp Polarity and Yelp Full) and ontology classification (represented by DBpedia). Results are shown in Table 2. Surprisingly, on topic prediction tasks, our SWEM model exhibits stronger performances, relative to both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures, this by leveraging both the average and max-pooling features from word embeddings. Specifically, our SWEM-concat model even outperforms a 29-layer deep CNN model (Conneau et al., 2016), when predicting topics. On the ontology classification problem (DBpedia dataset), we observe the same trend, that SWEM exhibits comparable or even superior results, relative to CNN or LSTM models.\n\nThe SWEM-max model achieved the highest accuracy on the TREC dataset. It performed comparably to other SWEM variants on this task."}

With GPT-3.5, our method outperforms standard LLM on all datasets, with an average improvement of  $39.2\\%$ . This highlights the benefit of combining LLMs with external symbolic solvers for logical reasoning. L OGIC -LM also improves CoT by a large margin of   $18.4\\%$   on average, showing that offloading the reasoning to symbolic solvers greatly improves faithfulness compared with pure language-based reasoning with CoT.\n\n![{The image shows a graph comparing the accuracy of different models with increasing reasoning depth on the Proof Writer dataset.}](image2)\n\n[7] In L OGIC -LM, multi-step logical reasoning is delegated to external symbolic solvers, thereby transitioning the challenge of LLM from  problem-solving  to  problem representation . Ideally, the com- plexity of formally representing a problem state- ment in logical form should remain relatively con- stant, regardless of whether the questions require simple or complex reasoning. The trends in Fig- ure  3  validate this assumption. The performance of Standard  and    $C o T$   declines precipitously with the escalation of problem complexity. However, this trend is less prominent for L OGIC -LM, indicating that the robust reasoning capabilities provided by external solvers substantially mitigate performance degradation for complex reasoning problems.\n\n![{This table compares the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on various datasets: ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, Logical Deduction, and AR-LSAT.}](image3)\n\n[3] 2.

This aligns with the assertion that the main en- hancement of GPT-4 lies in its ability to carry out complex reasoning ( OpenAI ,  2023 ). Although this may indicate that the logical reasoning capability can be boosted by scaling up the LLM, we observe that GPT-4 still makes numerous unfaithful reason- ing errors.

To ensure fair com- parisons, we use the same in-context examples for all models. For reproducible results, we set the temperature to 0 and select the response with the highest probability from LLMs. Since all examples are formed as multiple-choice questions, we eval- uate model performance based on the accuracy of selecting the correct answer.\n\n![{The image is a line graph with accuracy on the y-axis and rounds on the x-axis.

According to the table, the input low and high voltages (VIL, VIH) for the 8751H are specified, as well as the output low and high voltages (VOL, VOH). These parameters define the thresholds for logical 0 and 1 inputs and the minimum and maximum voltages that can be driven on output pins.\n\nFor the 8751H, the input low voltage (VIL) is specified as -0.5V to +0.8V, while the input high voltage (VIH) is specified as +2.0V to +21.5V. The output low voltage (VOL) is specified as 0V to 0.4V, and the output high voltage (VOH) is specified as 2.0V to 21.5V. These values indicate the range of voltages that can be considered as a logical 0 or 1 for inputs and the minimum and maximum voltages that can be driven on output pins.\n\nComparing these specifications with those for other related models, such as the 8751BH and 8752BH, we find that the input and output voltage specifications are similar, but with some differences. For example, the input high voltage (VIH) for the 8751BH and 8752BH is specified as +2.0V to +13.0V, which is lower than that of the 8751H. Additionally, the output high voltage (VOH) for the 8751BH and 8752BH is specified as 2.0V to 13.0V, which is also lower than that of the 8751H.\n\nThese differences in voltage specifications reflect the different operating conditions and requirements of the various microcontroller models.

The Analytics Value Chain, as described in [4], emphasizes the importance of moving data through a series of stages—from collection, analysis, decision-making, to impact. It highlights that only the final stage, impact, should be credited, as intermediate steps do not contribute meaningfully to the outcome. This aligns with the idea that data must be transformed into value through a structured process.\n\nOn the other hand, the Levels of Analytics, as illustrated in image2, provide a framework for understanding the progression from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling. It starts with Standard Reports, which answer \"What happened?\" and moves up to Forecasting and Predictive Modelling, which consider \"What if these trends continue?\" and \"What will happen next?\" This progression reflects an increase in intelligence and business value, showing how analytics can evolve from descriptive to prescriptive.\n\nThe table in image1 further clarifies the distinction between Reporting and Analysis. Reporting is descriptive and backward-looking, while Analysis is prescriptive and forward-looking. This distinction is important because it shows how data can be used not just to describe what has happened, but also to understand why it happened and what can be done about it.\n\nTogether, the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics complement each other by providing a comprehensive view of the data transformation process. The Value Chain ensures that data is used effectively to drive impact, while the Levels of Analytics provide a structured approach to achieving that impact through a series of increasingly sophisticated analytical techniques. This combination is essential for transforming data into actionable insights and value, as seen in the flowchart in image4, which shows how data is transformed into value through reporting, analysis, action, and finally, value.\n\n![Analysis and Impact](image4)  \n![Levels of Analytics](image2)"}

However, the MQL to SAL conversion rate is only 1.50%, which is much lower, indicating a significant drop-off at this stage.

For example, the conversion rate from contacts to leads is 2-5%, which is lower than the lead to MQL rate, but this is expected because the lead to MQL stage is more specific and targeted. The conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is 4-8%, which is higher than the 1.50% seen in image4, suggesting that the MQLs in image4 may not have been properly qualified or may have faced other challenges in moving to the next stage.\n\nThe conversion rate from SALs to SQLs is 45-75%, which is much higher than the 83.08% in image4, indicating that the SALs in image4 were effectively qualified.

Reporting is descriptive, focusing on what has happened, while analysis is prescriptive, aiming to understand why something happened and what should be done next.

Reporting involves raising questions through data, leading to reports, dashboards, and alerts, whereas analysis goes further by answering these questions and providing findings and recommendations [1].\n\nAs we move from business intelligence to business analytics, the progression reflects an increase in both business value and the degree of intelligence involved. Standard reports address the question of \"What happened?\" and ad-hoc reports delve into \"How many, how often, where?\" [3]. As we advance, query drilldowns help identify \"Where exactly is the problem?\" and alerts determine \"What actions are needed?\" [3]. Statistical analysis explores \"Why is this happening?\" and forecasting considers \"What if these trends continue?\" [3]. Predictive modeling predicts \"What will happen next?\" and optimization evaluates \"What's the best that can happen?\" [3]. This progression is visually represented in the diagram showing the shift from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, with each stage contributing to greater business value and intelligence [3].\n\nThe flowchart illustrating the data-driven process further emphasizes this progression.

During G₁, the cell grows and increases its cytoplasm. In the S phase, DNA replication occurs, doubling the genetic material. G₂ is a period of growth and preparation for mitosis [7]. The Mitotic Phase includes **mitosis**, which is the division of the nucleus, and **cytokinesis**, the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two daughter cells [10]. \n\n![Cell Cycle Diagram](image1)  \nThis image illustrates the cell cycle, showing the phases of interphase and the mitotic phase, with arrows indicating the progression through the cycle.\n\nDuring interphase, the cell undergoes growth and prepares for division. The S phase is crucial as it is when chromosomes duplicate [3]. This duplication ensures that each new cell receives an identical set of chromosomes. The process of chromosome duplication is a key part of the cell cycle, as it allows for the accurate distribution of genetic material during cell division [4].\n\n![Interphase Cell](image2)  \nThis image shows a cell during interphase, with different structures stained to highlight various components of the cell, including the nucleus and cytoskeletal elements.\n\nIn the mitotic phase, the cell divides its nucleus through mitosis.

For instance, the **AF-S (single)** focus mode is ideal for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus on a subject that doesn't move, as indicated in image1 [1]. Conversely, **AF-C (continuous)** is suited for moving subjects, allowing the camera to track motion and maintain focus, which is crucial for capturing dynamic scenes [1].\n\nWhen it comes to metering modes, the **Matrix Metering Mode** is designed to measure light across the entire frame, making it suitable for natural landscapes where the lighting is even and varied [5]. On the other hand, the **Center Metering Mode** is best for portraits, as it focuses on the light near the center of the screen, which is typically where the subject's face is [5]. The **Spot Metering Mode** is useful for specific focus areas, such as a subject's eyes, allowing for precise control over exposure and focus [5].\n\nIn low-light conditions, the **AF assist light** function, depicted in image2 [2], can be toggled on to help with focusing, especially when using the front camera to record videos.

According to [4], the process involves tracking how many of your MQLs convert into SALs, which is a key step in the lead nurturing journey. In [image4], the conversion rate from MQL to SAL is shown as 1.50%, which is quite low. This suggests that while many leads are marked as marketing qualified, only a small fraction are accepted by sales, highlighting potential issues in the qualification process or misalignment between marketing and sales teams.\n\nIn contrast, [image5] provides cross-industry average conversion rates, where the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is reported as 45-75%, which is significantly higher than the 1.50% observed in [image4]. This discrepancy indicates that the dataset in [image4] might be specific to a particular industry or company, possibly with different criteria for what constitutes a sales-ready lead. The higher conversion rate in [image5] suggests a more efficient process where marketing qualified leads are effectively identified and passed to sales.\n\nThe implications of these differences are substantial. A low conversion rate from MQL to SAL, as seen in [image4], could indicate that marketing is not accurately qualifying leads, or that sales teams are not efficiently screening leads. On the other hand, a higher conversion rate, as in [image5], suggests a well-coordinated effort between marketing and sales, leading to better alignment and more effective lead management. Therefore, understanding the context and specific factors within each dataset is crucial for interpreting the conversion rates and improving the overall sales funnel efficiency."}
