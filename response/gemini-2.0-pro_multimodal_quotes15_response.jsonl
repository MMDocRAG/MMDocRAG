[10]\n*   These increases were partially offset by performance-related declines within net income, an increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million, and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million [10].\n*   Cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion in 2020, an increase of $3.4 billion compared to 2019. [6]\n*  The key drivers for this as mentioned earlier were, increase in cash provided by receivables and Payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions , partially offset by performance related declines in net income. [6, 10]\n*  Additionally, based on the non-GAAP adjustments for 2020, there were positive impacts from acquisition-related adjustments ($1,454 million) and retirement-related adjustments ($908 million), with a minor negative impact from U.S. tax reform impacts (-$110 million) and spin-off related charges ($21 million).\n![image3](image3)\n\n**Investing Activities:**\n\n*   Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million [5].\n*   This was primarily due to a $32,294 million decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, largely because of the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year [1, 9].\n*   This decrease was partially offset by a $6,245 million decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables [1, 9].\n*   Net cash used in investing activities of $3.0 billion decreased $23.9 billion compared to the prior year. [9]\n\n**Financing Activities:**\n\n*   Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019, representing a year-to-year change of $18,763 million [8].\n*  Total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million. [2]\n\n**Overall Impact on Net Change:**\n*   The table shows the data for Net cash provided by operating, investing and financing activates, in the year 2020 and 2019:\n![image2](image2)\n\nIn summary, IBM's net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was a positive $5,361 million in 2020, compared to a negative $3,290 million in 2019.\n"}

Adult smokers also down-traded following price increases and due to the pandemic's impact on consumption patterns [5].\n    *   **Canada:** Deconsolidation of RBH.

[5] This surge was primarily driven by two congressional acts passed in 1862: the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act. [9] The Homestead Act, in particular, spurred a \"great tide of emigration for the west and especially Nebraska,\" by offering 160 acres of land to settlers who met certain conditions. [9]\n\n![Table showing population change in Hamilton County from 1870 to 2000](image3)\n\nAs a direct result, Hamilton County's population grew from a mere 130 in 1870 to 8,267 by 1880, and it peaked at 14,096 in 1890. [5] This table illustrates the dramatic population increase in the late 19th century, followed by a gradual decline throughout the 20th century. [5]\n\nThe construction of the Union Pacific Railroad across Nebraska also played a crucial role, transforming the state \"from a thinly populated corridor of westward expansion into a booming agricultural state.\" [9] The railroad facilitated the transport of goods and people, boosting the agricultural economy and attracting settlers. [9]\n\nFollowing the peak in 1890, the county's population slowly declined. [5] This decline can be attributed, in part, to the trend of farm consolidation. As farming became mechanized, the number of farms decreased while the average farm size increased. [4] Fewer farm operators were needed on larger land areas. [4]\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000 were characterized by a sharp increase in the late 19th century due to the Homestead Act and the railroad, followed by a gradual decline in the 20th century, influenced by factors like farm consolidation.\n"}

Here's a breakdown of the main components and their functions:\n\n1.  **Multimodal Retriever:**\n    *   **Function:** This component is responsible for querying a large multimodal external memory to find information relevant to the input [8]. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions [1].\n    *   **Process:** It encodes and stores a large volume of image/text embeddings. It optimizes retrieval speed through index construction techniques, specifically using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for dimensionality reduction [7, 8].\n    *    The retriever is depicted as processing input images through an image encoder, creating embeddings, and storing them in a database with a feature index and labels, with capability of Image-Image and Image-Text K-NN `![Multimodal Retriever and Retrieving & Ranking Process](image3)`.\n\n2.  **Memory Construction:**\n    *   **Function:** A multimodal memory is constructed using the multimodal retriever [6]. This memory stores embeddings and associated category information.\n    *   **Process:** The retriever creates and stores explicit memory for different categories that extend beyond the immediate context window [9].\n\n3. **Retrieval Process**\n   *   The retrieval process utilizes a large multi-modal external memory or database.  The input is the given image at the inference stage, that the approach retrieves the top-  $k$ class names most similar to the image [1].\n      * To speed up the the retrieval, the usage of HNSW(Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm reduces the vector dimension from    $d$   into  $\\frac{d}{9}$ [7].\n4.  **Ranking by MLLMs:**\n    *   **Function:** After retrieval, MLLMs rank the retrieved candidate results to make the final prediction [1, 4].\n    *   **Process:** Retrieved category labels and image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs. The MLLMs use their internal knowledge and the retrieved information to rank the candidates [4].\n    *   **Prompting:** Prompts are used to merge the input image with the retrieved category information, guiding the MLLMs to rank the candidates based on similarity [5]. A ranking prompt example illustrates how an image of a Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan is processed, with the MLLM ranking potential matches and identifying the correct category: `![Ranking Prompt Example](image4)`.\n\n5. **Pre-processing for Object Detection Datasets:**\n   *   For object detection, images are processed distinctly, enhancing MLLM's understanding of the objects [3]. The method includes *cropping* bounding box regions to a fixed size and *blurring* non-target areas to focus on relevant objects [3].\n\n    *   An illustration shows the object detection process, extracting image embeddings by cropping and blurring: `![Object Detection with Cropping and Blurring](image5)`.\n6. The pipeline includes retrieving the top-k similar results and ranking them using MLLM. [9].\n\nThe main components of the RAR pipeline for multimodal retrieval are the multimodal retriever, which creates and stores multimodal embeddings, and the MLLMs, which rank the retrieved results to make final predictions.\n"}

[4]\n3.  **T Cell Recognition**: A CD8+ T cell recognizes and binds to the Pf peptide-Class I complex on the infected liver cell through its CD8 receptor.\n![Illustration of CD8+ T cell interacting with an infected liver cell.](image1)\n4.  **Immune Response Activation**:\n    *   The CD8+ T cell releases IFN-γ (Interferon-gamma), which plays a role in the immune response against the parasite.\n    *   The interaction also involves Fas and FasR molecules, contributing to the activation pathway.\n5.  **Parasite Elimination**: The CD8+ T cell releases Perforin and Granzymes. These molecules induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the infected liver cell, leading to the death of the parasite. [4]\n\nThe immune system targets malaria parasites by CD8+ T cells recognizing infected liver cells and inducing apoptosis, thus eliminating the parasite.\n"}

For example, the first hot dog consumed provides a utility of +10, while the second provides only +4, and by the fourth, the utility is negative (-1) [4]. This implies that in a normal scenario, a person would stop consuming hot dogs when the marginal utility starts to decline significantly or becomes negative.\n\nHowever, the dynamic changes entirely in a competitive context.\n![Joey Chestnut at a hot dog eating contest, illustrating a competitive context where standard diminishing marginal utility does not apply.](image5)\nIn this image , the situation is that of a hot dog eating contest, featuring Joey Chestnut. Here, the typical pattern of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply in the same way due to the competitive element [5]. The utility isn't just about the satisfaction from eating hot dogs but also about winning the competition [10]. Even though personal satisfaction (consumption utility) might decrease with each hot dog eaten, the potential utility from winning (competitive utility) can increase or remain high. The table included in the image illustrates the \"Differential outcome,\" where consuming the 64th, 65th, and 66th hot dogs provides significant positive utility (+5000, +10000, +1, respectively) because of the competitive value of each additional hot dog consumed for winning the competition.\n\nFocus, or the lack of variety, can have different utility outcomes. While standard economic thinking suggests that variety is beneficial because it prevents the decline in satisfaction associated with diminishing marginal utility, focus can be advantageous in competition [3, 10]. This is due to that focused practice can enhance skills and improve both the experience and outcomes of the activity [7].\n\nFocus leads to mastery, which in turn can increase the enjoyment and potential rewards from the activity, especially in competitive settings [8].\n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption suggests a decrease in satisfaction with each additional unit consumed, in competitive contexts, the utility can increase due to the added value of winning, thus altering the typical consumption pattern.\n"}
