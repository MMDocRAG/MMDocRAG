While adults under 30 are split on whether the government is doing enough or going too far, older age groups increasingly believe that the government should prioritize security over civil liberties [8]. ![The table shows that older age groups are more likely to believe the government should prioritize security over civil liberties](image4)  This difference in opinion is also apparent when considering political affiliations. In 2015, 71% of Republicans felt the government wasn't doing enough to combat terrorism [3].  ![The graph shows that Republicans are more likely than Democrats or Independents to believe the government should prioritize security over civil liberties](image3) This contrasts with Democrats, where opinions are more divided, especially among liberal Democrats who are equally concerned about government overreach and security [7].  Overall, while the perception of government efforts to combat terrorism has declined across all demographics since 2001, the preferred balance between security and civil liberties remains a point of contention across different age groups and political ideologies [6]. How have opinions on government anti-terrorism efforts among different age groups evolved over time, and how do these opinions compare across political affiliations?  Older age groups and Republicans are more likely to prioritize security over civil liberties, while younger generations and Democrats hold more diverse views. \n"}

This partisan gap is further highlighted by concerns about the extent of U.S. involvement. Republicans are significantly more likely to worry about the U.S. not taking sufficient action against ISIS (75%), while only 18% fear excessive involvement.

Only 27% of Republicans believe the government is effectively reducing the terrorist threat, a significant drop from 63% at the beginning of the year [6].

In contrast, automated scoring of individuals up for parole, while still subject to skepticism, shows a more balanced perception, with 49% finding it effective and 50% considering it fair [3]. This suggests that public trust in automated systems hinges on factors beyond just effectiveness, with fairness being a critical factor. Overall, while automated systems demonstrate potential in various domains, the disparity between perceived effectiveness and fairness, particularly in sensitive areas like personal finance, highlights a significant barrier to public trust.  The public's concern about fairness, as evidenced by their skepticism towards personal finance scores and the potential for bias in algorithms [6], suggests that for these systems to gain widespread acceptance, developers must prioritize fairness and transparency alongside effectiveness. In conclusion, despite varying levels of perceived effectiveness across different automated systems, the lack of trust stemming from fairness concerns, particularly in areas like personal finance, poses a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of such technologies. \n"}

In contrast, only 28% of the foreign-born and 24% of the third or higher generation share this viewpoint.  [2] This suggests that the second generation, born and raised in the U.S., might experience a unique perspective that allows them to leverage their bicultural upbringing as an advantage. ![The image is a bar chart showing the levels of connection among different groups to their Hispanic heritage.](image1) Interestingly, the feeling of connection to their heritage is strongest among foreign-born Hispanics (82%) and decreases with each generation, with only 44% of the third or higher generations feeling connected. This decline in feeling connected aligns with the decreasing identification as \"Hispanic or Latino\" across generations, indicating a potential shift in the understanding and experience of Hispanic identity over time.

From the breadth perspective, the prior benchmarks are heavily focused on daily knowledge and common sense. The covered image format is also limited. Our benchmark aims to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. In the depth aspect, the previous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, our benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge.  MMMU, constituting 11.5K questions, is divided into a few-shot development set, a validation set, and a test set. [7] The few-shot development set includes 5 questions per subject, and the validation set, useful for hyper parameter selec- tion, contains approximately 900 questions, while the test set comprises  $10.5 \\mathrm{K}$  questions. MMMU is designed to mea- sure three essential skills in LMMs: perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our aim is to evaluate how well these mod- els can not only perceive and understand information across different modalities but also apply reasoning with subject- specific knowledge to derive the solution. ![The table shows the statistics of the MMMU dataset, including the number of questions, disciplines, image types, question formats, and difficulty levels.](image2) [8] To this end, we introduce MMMU: a comprehensive benchmark designed for college-level multi-discipline mul- timodal understanding and reasoning.

This high performance can be seen in `![Performance metrics of BERT and other models on original dataset](image5)` which shows the Max performance of BERT to be 0.770. However, this result was found to be due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the original dataset [8]. To mitigate this, an adversarial dataset was constructed by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point [2]. This process of creating adversarial examples is illustrated in `![Comparison between original and adversarial viewpoints concerning Google's monopoly status](image3)`, where the claim about Google being a harmful monopoly is negated, and the warrant is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWhen BERT models were trained and validated on this adversarial dataset, their performance dropped significantly [6].  This is evident in Table 4, which presents the results for BERT Large on the adversarial test set, showing that BERT's peak performance reduced to 53% [1, 6]. `![Performance metrics of different BERT models on adversarial test set](image4)` further reinforces this observation, as the maximum accuracy achieved by BERT on the adversarial set is only 0.533, with mean and median performance hovering around 50%.

[7] Conversely, open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece) using the pass-through strategy display higher sensitivity, especially for attacks like swaps, drops, and key errors. [8] This difference arises because pass-through treats each unique character combination separately, leading to a wider range of predictions for perturbed words. \n\nExamining WER, the background backoff strategy generally yields lower error rates compared to pass-through and neutral, particularly in open vocabulary models.

Minimum risk-based capital  ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital,  Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2  capital). Capital standards require certain adjustments to, and  deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these  ratios.  The financial institution determines its capital ratios under both the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approach, as stated in [4] Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the  standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market  risk RWA (“Standardized Approach”) and (ii) the applicable  advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk  and operational risk RWA (“Advanced Approach”). The  credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches  differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation  of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced  Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and  risk weights.  Looking at the Regulatory Capital Ratios for both years, we can observe some changes in the capital ratios and risk-weighted assets of the financial institution. ![Regulatory Capital Ratios and Risk-Weighted Assets](image1)  Credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily driven by market volatility and the acquisition of E*TRADE.

The increase was also driven by  Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and  Institutional Securities business segments and an increase in  Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value  gains. In addition, credit risk RWA under the Advanced  Approach increased for CVA, mainly due to increased  exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility.  Market risk RWA also saw an increase in 2020 due to higher market volatility, impacting both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. [6] Market risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the  Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an  increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher  market volatility.  However, operational risk RWA actually decreased in 2020 under the Advanced Approach due to a decline in litigation-related losses. [2] The decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced  Approach in 2020 reflects a decline in the frequency and  severity of litigation-related losses.

However, the Downstream segment's earnings remained relatively stable, increasing modestly from $\\mathbb{S}3,151$  million to $\\mathbb{S}3,314$ million  [8]. \n\nThis difference in earnings growth can be attributed to the nature of each segment's business. Upstream earnings are heavily influenced by crude oil prices, which are determined by global market forces beyond Chevron's control [7]. The substantial increase in Upstream earnings in 2021 suggests a favorable rise in crude oil prices compared to 2020. \n\nIn contrast, Downstream earnings depend on margins in refining, manufacturing, and marketing petroleum products [4]. These margins can be volatile and are influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, crude oil prices, and operational disruptions [4]. The relatively stable Downstream earnings in 2021 and 2020 might indicate relatively consistent refining margins during this period. \n\nAdditionally, at the end of 2021, Chevron had classified $768 million worth of assets as \"Assets held for sale,\" primarily associated with Upstream operations anticipated to be sold within the next year [2]. This classification suggests potential divestitures in the Upstream segment, which could further impact its asset values in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron Corporation's Upstream segment experienced substantial earnings growth in 2021 compared to 2020, likely driven by favorable crude oil price movements, while its Downstream segment's earnings remained relatively stable.

Conversely, consumer loans decreased, largely due to a decline in residential mortgage – first lien portfolios. This decrease is likely a result of loan paydowns spurred by the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) [1].  The financial entity's deposit structure also underwent notable shifts. Total deposits increased from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, representing a 6% rise. ![The table shows a breakdown of deposits in millions of dollars for two different years, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

[10] As of December 31, 2020, an investment of $100 made in Amgen common stock on December 31, 2015, would have grown to $162.76. ![The line graph showcases a five-year cumulative total return comparison between AMGN, SPX, BTK, and DRG from 2015 to 2020.](image2)  In comparison, the S&P 500 index showed a more consistent upward trajectory, with the same investment reaching $203.12 by the end of 2020. [10] This indicates that while Amgen provided a positive return, it fell short of the broader market performance represented by the S&P 500 during the same period. [10] Amgen has been actively repurchasing its own shares. [8] While the company intends to continue this practice along with paying dividends as a way to return capital to stockholders, the actual timing and amount of these repurchases are influenced by various factors. [8] These factors include capital needs for strategic moves, financing options, debt obligations, credit rating, tax and corporate law changes, business model adjustments, and Board of Directors' decisions.  ![The table tracks the value of $100 invested on December 31, 2015, across different securities and their value at the end of each subsequent year through 2020.](image4)  Furthermore, share repurchases are also affected by Amgen's cash position, stock price, and blackout periods restricting such activities.

[2] The decrease in share repurchases might indicate a shift in the company's financial strategy, perhaps towards conserving cash or prioritizing other investments. The company's objective for share repurchases is to optimize its capital structure and cost of capital. [5] However, the company's decision to increase its quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 per share in June 2020, up from $4.32, demonstrates their commitment to returning value to shareholders. [1] This dividend payout, along with the substantial, albeit reduced, share repurchases, suggests a focus on balancing investments in growth with returning value to shareholders.  The company had $1.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, which could affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

Looking at specific changes in risk components, [6] credit risk RWA saw an uptick in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. This increase was primarily attributed to a surge in Derivatives exposures due to market volatility and an increase in Investment securities, largely stemming from the E*TRADE acquisition.

[9] The arrival of the Union Pacific Railroad during this period further facilitated migration and economic development. [9] However, after reaching its peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population has slowly declined.

[3] Despite a brief increase in the 1980s, the county’s population in 2000 was still lower than its historical high point.  The shift towards larger-scale farming practices and mechanization, beginning in the early 20th century, contributed to this decline. [4] As farms consolidated and required less labor, many people left rural areas in search of new opportunities. The consolidation trend continues, with the number of farms decreasing while their average size increases.

[9] This suggests that while there's a reasonable level of agreement among annotators, indicating some consistency in judging Chameleon's performance, the fact that unanimous agreement isn't overwhelmingly frequent might point to the subjectivity inherent in evaluating chatbot responses, especially when those responses are fairly similar. The data implies a moderate level of inter-annotator reliability, which is not uncommon in subjective evaluation tasks. This highlights the challenges of relying solely on relative human evaluations for definitively concluding the superiority of one model over another, especially when differences in performance are potentially subtle. This pattern holds true even when comparing against the base versions of Gemini and GPT-4V, without augmented images. [2] This suggests that the observed agreement levels are likely more reflective of the inherent nature of the evaluation task and the closeness in performance between Chameleon and the baseline models. This highlights the need for a balanced approach when evaluating models like Chameleon, incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative human judgments to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations. The fact that there isn't a single model that directly corresponds to Chameleon's capabilities further emphasizes this need.

This process involves encoding image features and indexing them for efficient retrieval, creating an external memory bank (M) of embeddings.  To optimize retrieval speed, an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index is implemented, reducing the dimensionality of the embeddings and enabling faster k-nearest neighbor searches [7]. This retrieval process is crucial for quickly finding relevant information from a large dataset. \n\nDuring the inference stage, the system takes an input image and retrieves the top-k most similar category labels from the memory bank using the multimodal retriever [1, 6].  These retrieved candidate categories, along with the input image embedding, are then passed to the MLLM. ![The image is a visual example of a ranking prompt for few-shot image classification.](image4) The MLLM then ranks these categories based on their relevance to the input image [4]. Using a ranking prompt that combines the image with retrieved category information, the MLLM leverages its internal knowledge to make a final prediction about the image's category [5]. This ranking process ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification, especially for fine-grained recognition tasks where subtle differences are important. Additionally, this approach is adaptable for object detection tasks. In this case, the image undergoes pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring to focus on specific objects within the image. ![The image is a diagram illustrating a system for object recognition on detection datasets, featuring two main sections](image5)  The cropped regions are then used for embedding and retrieval, allowing the system to identify multiple objects within a single image [3]. \n\nOverall, the RAR pipeline effectively integrates a multimodal retriever and a ranking system powered by MLLMs, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of visual recognition tasks, especially for fine-grained and few-shot learning scenarios [2, 10]. ![The table compares the performance of different methods across various datasets.](image1) ![This table compares the performance of different models on various datasets using two metrics: cACC and sACC.](image2) The main components of the RAR pipeline are a multimodal retriever for efficient retrieval of relevant information and a ranking system utilizing MLLMs for accurate and context-aware classification. \n"}

As described in [4], images in these datasets often contain multiple objects of various sizes, some dominant and others less so. To address this, a cropping technique is applied, focusing on the regions defined by the proposal bounding box coordinates.  ![The diagram illustrates how pre-processing techniques like cropping and resizing assist in zero-shot recognition for object detection tasks using multimodal retrieval methods.](image2) This isolates individual objects, preventing the model from being overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire image. \n\nFollowing cropping, the extracted regions undergo resizing to a uniform scale. This standardization ensures that all objects are represented with consistent dimensions, regardless of their original size in the source image.  Furthermore, the diagram highlights the importance of highlighting the object of interest within its bounding box.

This targeted focus aids in improving the accuracy of object identification, especially in cases where the object might be small or positioned less prominently within the image. \n\nThese pre-processing steps – cropping, resizing, and blurring – significantly contribute to the efficiency of the subsequent embedding and retrieval stages in the zero-shot recognition system. By providing the model with standardized, focused representations of individual objects, the system can better align them with textual class descriptions, even without prior visual training on those specific objects, as indicated in [2]. \n\nIn conclusion, the pre-processing steps of cropping, resizing, and blurring are essential for enhancing the effectiveness of the zero-shot object recognition system. \n"}

This suggests that providing more explicit context, as seen in the specific questions [9], leads to better performance.  ![The image is a line graph titled \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence.” It shows the relationship between the number of knowledge elements removed and three metrics: precision, recall, and F1-Score.](image2) The effectiveness of \"Conscious Incompetence\", where models identify missing information, is highlighted as the coverage of attribution sources decreases [3].  Furthermore, the study acknowledges the limitations of using ChatGPT for text quality evaluation due to potential bias towards its own generation style [5]. The parameter size also plays a crucial role in text-citation alignment, with larger models like GPT-4 achieving higher alignment scores [6]. Overall, GPT-4 exhibits stronger performance in citation-related tasks, particularly in alignment and correctness.  Providing specific context improves performance for both models.  However, the study acknowledges limitations in text evaluation methodology and points to the need for further research. GPT-4 performs better in citation tasks, especially with specific context, while both models benefit from specific settings in text evaluation. \n"}

These programmes have specially-designed curricula and are delivered through a schedule of lectures/ seminars and tutorials [1].  ![The image is a table listing various academic programs with information on the duration for full-time and part-time study, as well as the mode of study.](image1) Without sacrificing the necessary breadth and depth of the multi-disciplinary nature of the life sciences, we offer you a highly personalised roadmap in which the most recent scientific developments are taught, and social and bioethical issues are discussed. The programme offers three areas of specialisation in: Chemistry, Clean Energy Physics, Environmental Biology [7]. ![The image is an overview of Master's and Doctoral programmes divided into three main categories: Research, Coursework, and Doctoral Programmes.](image4) The answer is **MA (Humanities Education), MSc (Exercise & Sport Studies), MSc (Life Sciences)**. \n"}

This transition often involves converting a Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) to a Sales Accepted Lead (SAL).  ![{The image shows a series of data metrics related to sales and marketing performance including conversion rates between stages}](image4) illustrates a MQL to SAL conversion rate of 1.50%. This is significantly lower than the cross-industry average conversion rate of 45-75% for SALs, which represents leads accepted by sales  ![{The image displays cross-industry average conversion rates at various stages of a sales funnel}](image5). This discrepancy highlights the potential difficulty in effectively transitioning leads between marketing and sales teams,  A low MQL to SAL conversion rate suggests that marketing may be qualifying leads too early in the sales cycle, or that there is a misalignment between sales and marketing criteria for a sales-ready lead.  In contrast, a high conversion rate suggests effective lead nurturing and alignment between the two teams. The implications of these differences can significantly impact overall sales effectiveness and revenue generation. A low MQL to SAL conversion rate suggests that improvements are needed in lead nurturing, qualification processes, or alignment between marketing and sales. Conversely, a high conversion rate indicates a well-oiled sales and marketing machine. In conclusion, the MQL to SAL conversion rate is a critical metric for evaluating sales and marketing alignment and effectiveness. \n"}

The dishwasher may not start for several reasons: a blown fuse, the power supply being turned off, low water pressure, or the door not being closed properly [3]. You can try replacing the fuse, ensuring the dishwasher is turned on, checking the water supply, or making sure the door is closed securely. If water is not being pumped from the dishwasher, the drain hose may be twisted, the filter could be clogged, or even your kitchen sink could be clogged [3].  ![This table provides troubleshooting tips for common dishwasher problems.](image3) You may also experience issues with the dishes not being cleaned properly. This could be due to not using enough detergent, items blocking the spray arms, or dirty filters [5].  ![The table provides troubleshooting solutions for common dishwasher issues.](image5) There is a risk of water squirting out if you open the door while the dishwasher is operating [9].
