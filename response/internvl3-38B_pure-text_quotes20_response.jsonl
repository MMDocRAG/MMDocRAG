However, the text also notes that opinions about the parties' traits are deeply divided along partisan lines, with overwhelming shares of both parties' supporters believing their own party has good policy ideas [8].\n\nTo determine which party holds the highest total percentage, we can look at the combined percentages for good policy ideas and high ethical standards. The Democratic Party has 50% for good policy ideas and 42% for high ethical standards, totaling 92%, while the Republican Party has 50% for good policy ideas and 41% for high ethical standards, totaling 91%. Thus, the Democratic Party holds a marginally higher total percentage.\n\nRegarding attentiveness to news about congressional elections, the text states that 62% of Democrats say they have followed news about the elections at least fairly closely, which is about the same as conservative Republicans at 60% [4]. However, the image quotes provide more detailed insights. Image4 shows that among different demographic groups, liberals (who are more likely to be Democrats) follow the news the most closely, with a NET total of 62% [![Liberals follow the subject the most closely](image4)].

To find the gap between male seniors who use the internet and those who have broadband at home, we need to consider the percentage of male internet users and the overall broadband adoption rate.\n\nFirst, calculate the percentage of male seniors who use the internet:\n- 39% of internet users aged 65+ are male [4].\n\nNext, consider the overall broadband adoption rate among all seniors:\n- 47% of seniors have a high-speed broadband connection at home [11].\n\nSince the survey indicates that 59% of seniors are internet users, and 39% of these users are male, we can infer that the percentage of male seniors who use the internet is:\n- 39% of 59% = 0.39 * 59% ≈ 23.01%.\n\nThe gap between male seniors who use the internet and those who have broadband at home is then:\n- 47% (broadband adoption) - 23.01% (male internet users) = 23.99%.\n\nThus, the gap is approximately **23.99%**.\n\n![Demographic data showing internet and broadband usage among seniors](image4)"}

However, views on driverless vehicles and robot caregivers show a more balanced mix of worry and enthusiasm [1].\n\nMost Americans are familiar with the idea that automation could impact employment, with 85% having heard or read about it, and 77% considering it realistic [2]. Among those who have heard a lot about this concept, 20% find it extremely realistic, and 47% express some level of enthusiasm, though this enthusiasm is still lower than the worry [3][4]. The survey also indicates that 77% think it's realistic that robots and computers might perform many human jobs, with 20% describing this as extremely realistic [8].\n\nWhen considering potential outcomes, Americans anticipate more negative than positive effects. For instance, 76% believe inequality between the rich and poor will worsen, while only 25% think the economy will create many new, better-paying jobs [image1].

Image4 further illustrates these low grades, highlighting the widespread dissatisfaction with these institutions.\n\nThe negative campaign environment also affected voter self-assessment, with only 40% giving themselves an A or B, the lowest since 1996 [11]. This self-criticism aligns with the broader negative perceptions of the campaign's conduct. Additionally, the emotional aftermath of the election, as shown in image5, reveals that 53% of voters felt uneasy and 51% hopeful, while Clinton voters predominantly felt uneasy (90%), sad (77%), and scared (76%) [8]. These emotions underscore the divisive and negative impact of the campaign on voter sentiment.\n\nIn summary, the pervasive negativity of the 2016 campaign directly correlated with voters' low evaluations of political entities, media, and even themselves, creating a cycle of dissatisfaction and division. The data and visual evidence collectively demonstrate that the campaign's negativity significantly shaped voter perceptions and emotional responses.\n\n**Answer:** Voter perceptions of political entities in the 2016 election were overwhelmingly negative, influenced by the highly negative campaign environment, as evidenced by low grades for parties, media, and voters themselves, and heightened emotional responses."}

Among Trump voters, feelings of \"happy\" and \"surprised\" were predominant, with 96% expressing hopefulness and 74% feeling proud [5]. This optimism is evident in the survey data, where \"happy\" was the most frequently mentioned reaction, alongside surprise at the election outcome [2]. In contrast, Clinton voters predominantly felt \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" and \"disgusted,\" with 90% reporting unease, 77% sadness, and 76% fear [5][10].

The image showing survey data on public perception [image1] indicates that Trump received an A or B from only 30% of voters, with an average grade of C-, reflecting a generally negative assessment. Similarly, the Democratic and Republican parties received low grades, with the Republican Party scoring a D+ and the Democratic Party a C-, highlighting widespread dissatisfaction with political actors. The image illustrating emotional reactions [image2] further supports this, showing that while Trump voters felt hopeful and proud, Clinton voters were overwhelmingly shocked and disappointed.\n\nThe perception of mudslinging was also a significant factor. Text [7] notes that 92% of voters felt there was more negative campaigning than in past elections, a sentiment reinforced by the graph in image6, which shows a sharp increase in the perception of mudslinging in 2016 compared to previous years. This negative campaigning likely contributed to the heightened unease and fear among Clinton voters, as well as the general dissatisfaction with political entities, as seen in image1.\n\nIn summary, the emotional divide between Trump and Clinton voters is closely tied to their perceptions of Trump's performance and the highly negative nature of the campaign, with Trump voters expressing hope and pride, while Clinton voters felt shocked and uneasy, reflecting broader dissatisfaction with the political process."}

Among Trump voters, the most common reactions were \"happy\" and \"surprised,\" with 97% expressing happiness and 60% surprise at the outcome [12][6][7]. This suggests that while many Trump supporters were pleased with the result, a substantial portion were not entirely confident in his victory, as reflected in the surprise expressed by 60% of them [2][3]. In contrast, Clinton voters predominantly felt \"shocked,\" \"disappointed,\" and \"disgusted,\" with 93% expressing unhappiness and 87% surprise [10][12]. The high level of surprise among Clinton voters indicates a widespread expectation that she would win, as evidenced by the 87% who were taken aback by the result [2][3]. This disparity underscores a significant gap in pre-election expectations, with Clinton supporters largely anticipating a victory that did not materialize, while Trump supporters, though largely pleased, also showed a notable level of uncertainty about the outcome.\n\n![The image shows a bar chart comparing the levels of surprise among different voter groups, with Clinton voters being more surprised than Trump voters](image6)\n\nThe emotional divide is further illustrated by the specific reactions captured in surveys. For instance, while \"happy\" was the dominant response among Trump voters, many also acknowledged surprise, highlighting a mix of elation and unexpectedness [7]. On the other hand, Clinton voters' predominant feelings of shock and disappointment reflect a sense of disbelief and letdown, with many noting their surprise or disbelief at Trump's win [10]. This contrast in reactions not only highlights differing emotional responses but also suggests divergent pre-election sentiments and the extent to which the outcome defied expectations for each group. The data on surprise, particularly the 87% of Clinton voters who were surprised, underscores a significant miscalculation in the perceived likelihood of Trump's victory among his opponents [2][3].\n\n![The image shows a bar chart with emotional reactions, where \"Uneasy\" and \"Sad\" are prominent among voters](image4)\n\nOverall, the emotional reactions reveal that while Trump voters were largely content with the outcome, a notable portion were not entirely certain of his win, as indicated by the surprise expressed.

According to Pew Research Center, by two-to-one, Americans are now more concerned that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) than that these policies have restricted civil liberties (28%) [1]. This concern has risen by seven percentage points since January, reflecting a growing skepticism about the government's effectiveness [1]. Evaluations of the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 attacks, with 52% saying the government is doing not too well or not at all well, compared to 46% who believe it is doing very or fairly well [2]. This represents a 26-point drop from January when 72% rated the government's efforts positively [2].\n\nThese perceptions vary significantly by political affiliation. Democrats remain the only group where a majority (64%) still believes the government is doing at least fairly well, though this is down from 85% in January [3]. Independents' positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%, and just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well, a sharp decline from 63% at the beginning of the year [3]. The shift is particularly pronounced among conservative Republicans, whose positive ratings have plummeted from 59% in January to just 18% today [11]. Among Republicans, 71% now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January and 33 points since 2013 [7]. This trend is also seen among Democrats, though less dramatically, with 54% now expressing concern that policies are insufficient, up 16 points since 2013 [5].\n\nAge also plays a crucial role in these perceptions. Older adults (50 and older) are more likely to give the government low marks, with 57% saying it is not doing well, compared to 46% of younger adults (18-29) who believe the government is performing adequately [6].

While 59% of older adults use the internet, which is significantly lower than the 86% of all adults [6], their device ownership also lags behind. For instance, only 18% of older adults own a smartphone, compared to 91% of all adults owning a cell phone [image1]. This highlights a gap in smartphone adoption, as most older adults have basic cell phones rather than smartphones [7]. Additionally, 27% of older adults own a tablet or e-reader, which is comparable to the 18% owning a smartphone, contrasting with the general population where smartphones are more prevalent [4][image6]. \n\nInternet usage frequency among older adults is notable: 71% go online daily or almost daily, with an additional 11% accessing the internet 3-5 times a week [5][image3]. This regularity is slightly lower than younger age groups but still indicates a significant presence online for those who do use the internet. However, the adoption rates vary by age, education, and income. For example, older adults aged 65-69 are more likely to go online (74%) and have broadband (65%) compared to those aged 80+ (37% online, 21% broadband) [image2][image7]. Similarly, higher education and income levels correlate with greater internet and broadband access among older adults [image2].\n\nDespite these trends, older adults who use social networking sites are more frequent socializers, with 81% interacting daily or near-daily, compared to 71% of online non-SNS users and 63% of non-internet users [12]. This suggests that while device ownership and internet access are lower, those who do engage online are active users. Overall, older adults face challenges in adopting new technologies, with many needing assistance to learn new devices [3], which may explain the slower adoption rates compared to the general population [8][image4]. \n\nIn summary, older adults have lower device ownership and internet usage rates than the general population, but those who do use the internet tend to do so regularly, with significant variation based on age, education, and income. ![Device ownership and internet usage among older adults lag behind the general population](image1)"}

This highlights a broader skepticism about algorithmic fairness, especially in contexts involving personal freedom and justice.\n\nFor job-related systems, automated video analysis of interviews is viewed as effective by 39% but fair by only 33%, a 6-percentage-point difference [image8]. The image reveals that 67% find it unacceptable, with 14% citing unfairness and 13% noting that not everyone interviews well [image5]. Automated resume screening shows a smaller gap, with 47% seeing it as effective and 43% as fair, suggesting slightly higher trust but still significant reservations about removing the human element [7][image8].\n\nThese differences imply that public trust in automated systems is heavily influenced by context. Systems perceived as impacting personal autonomy or privacy, like the personal finance score, face greater scrutiny. Meanwhile, those in legal contexts, such as parole scoring, are met with concerns about nuance and individuality. Overall, the data underscores a need for transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making to build trust [6][7][image4]. \n\nIn summary, the public is wary of algorithms that lack transparency or human oversight, particularly when they affect personal freedoms or are seen as biased. This context-dependent skepticism highlights the importance of addressing fairness concerns to enhance trust in automated systems."}

This partisan divide is stark and reflects broader trends in political polarization.\n\nWhen it comes to long-term success, 65% of Republicans expect Trump to be successful, compared to only 3% of Democrats [6][8]. This contrasts with previous presidents, such as Obama and Bush, where a larger share of the public was uncertain about their success at comparable points. For example, in Obama's third year, nearly half (47%) said it was too early to tell if he would be successful, while for Trump, only 23% felt the same [2][5]. This indicates a shift in public readiness to judge Trump's legacy early on.\n\nEconomic impact is another area of division. Overall, 40% think Trump's policies have improved the economy, but this view is heavily skewed by party lines.

In 2022, nearly six-in-ten Hispanic voters (57%) said abortion was very important, up from 42% in March, reflecting the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion [2]. The economy remains the top issue, with 80% of Latino registered voters considering it very important [12].\n\nDemographic factors also influence preferences. For instance, Latino voters who consider their Hispanic identity extremely or very important are more likely to support Democratic candidates (60%) compared to those for whom it is less important (38%) [6]. This is further illustrated in image4, which shows that Latino registered voters favor Democratic candidates by 53% to 28% for Republicans, with 18% undecided or supporting another candidate. Among those for whom Latino identity is extremely important, 60% prefer Democrats, while 21% prefer Republicans [4].\n\nPerceptions of the parties' engagement with Latino voters also differ. Image2 and image3 highlight that a majority of Latino voters believe the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes (71%) and cares about them (63%), compared to the Republican Party's 45% and 34%, respectively. Among Democratic-leaning voters, 81% feel the Democratic Party works hard to earn Latino votes, while only 35% feel the same about the Republican Party [image3]. This perception aligns with the overall trend of Latino voters favoring Democrats, as seen in image4.\n\nThe evolution of issue importance is evident in image6, which shows abortion's rise from 42% to 57% in importance, while the economy remains the top issue at 80%.

This aligns with the image showing that Black respondents are most likely to report discrimination, with 62% compared to 13% of whites [image1]. Black STEM workers also perceive their race as a barrier to success, with 40% believing it has made it harder for them to succeed, compared to 5% of whites [image1]. Additionally, 57% of Black STEM workers feel their workplace pays insufficient attention to diversity, and only 37% believe opportunities for promotion and advancement are fair [3][image1].\n\nIn contrast, gender-based discrimination in STEM fields is also prevalent, especially for women. Women in STEM jobs are more likely than men to report experiencing discrimination due to their gender, with 50% of women reporting such experiences compared to 19% of men [12]. The image illustrates that women in male-dominated STEM environments face higher rates of gender-related discrimination, with 78% experiencing it compared to 44% in more balanced workplaces [image3]. Women in computer jobs, for instance, report significantly higher rates of discrimination (74%) compared to men (16%) [image8]. Furthermore, women in STEM are more likely to feel the need to prove themselves and perceive less attention to gender diversity in their workplaces [image3][image8].\n\nWhile both racial and gender discrimination are significant issues, the data suggests that Black STEM workers experience higher rates of racial discrimination, and women in STEM, particularly in male-dominated fields, face substantial gender-based challenges.

Text quote [11] mentions rapid growth in these areas, which aligns with the observed ridership increases. This growth is further supported by the map in image1, which focuses on the geographic area around Palo Alto and Redwood City, indicating these regions' significance in the transit network. The crowded train interior depicted in image2 illustrates the strain on current capacity, with passengers standing due to limited seating. This overcrowding is echoed in text quotes [4] and [9], which both note that trains are crowded. Additionally, the map in image4 shows the rail route from San Francisco to Gilroy, emphasizing the high demand along this corridor, particularly in areas like Palo Alto and Mountain View. The table in image6 provides specific data on train capacities, showing that many trains are operating at or near maximum load, especially during high season, which exacerbates the capacity issues. The busy transportation hub in image7 further underscores the high volume of passengers, likely contributing to the overcrowding on trains. The need to double Caltrain ridership from 60,000 to 120,000 daily trips by the next decade [10] suggests that current infrastructure is insufficient to meet growing demand, necessitating solutions like grade separations and increased funding [8].

China, in contrast, has a much lower energy consumption per capita at 597 kg oil equivalent. This suggests that the USA has a higher per capita CO2 footprint, likely due to higher energy use, including transportation.\n\nMotor vehicle ownership, as depicted in the bubble chart [image3], shows the USA with the largest bubble, indicating a high number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people and a significant share of global motor vehicle demand. China, despite having a large share in global demand, has fewer vehicles per 1,000 people. Germany also has a moderate share and relatively high vehicle ownership. This disparity implies that while China is increasing its vehicle demand, its per capita ownership is still lower than that of the USA and Germany.\n\nThe transportation sector's contribution to CO2 emissions is substantial, accounting for 24% of total emissions globally [image2]. Given the USA's high per capita energy consumption and vehicle ownership, its transportation sector likely contributes significantly to its overall CO2 emissions. Germany, with moderate vehicle ownership and lower energy consumption per capita, might have a more balanced impact, while China's growing demand could lead to increased emissions as vehicle ownership rises.\n\nThese trends suggest that the USA faces a greater challenge in reducing per capita emissions due to its high energy use and vehicle ownership, whereas China's environmental impact from transportation is expected to grow with increasing motorization. Germany, with its established vehicle market and lower per capita energy consumption, may have more manageable emissions per capita but still faces challenges in reducing overall emissions due to its industrial and transportation sectors. Addressing these disparities will require targeted policies, especially in the USA and China, to mitigate environmental impacts effectively. \n\nIn summary, the USA has the highest CO2 emissions per capita and motor vehicle ownership, implying a significant environmental impact, while China's growing demand poses future challenges, and Germany's moderate ownership suggests a balanced but still substantial contribution to emissions."}

This growth aligns with the broader trend of increasing mobile subscribers in Indonesia, which had 240 million subscribers by early 2014 and continued to grow throughout the year [8]. However, the ARPU for Telkomsel, like other operators, faced challenges during this period. The decline in ARPU was influenced by several factors, including a price war initiated by the government, which forced operators to reduce tariffs [6][7]. Additionally, the shift towards data-based communication methods, such as instant messaging and VoIP, led to reduced usage of traditional voice and SMS services, further impacting ARPU [9][10]. The image showing Telkomsel's subscriber metrics highlights its dominance in the market, with a substantial number of data users (63.5 million) and smartphone users (35.4 million) [image6]. This transition to data usage, while initially causing a short-term decline in ARPU, was expected to stabilize as users enrolled in larger data plans due to increased mobile internet consumption [5].

This indicates a strong presence in the market, likely due to their extensive network coverage and partnerships with smartphone vendors, as Telkomsel partnered with 17 Android vendors [3]. The shift towards data-based services like IM and VoIP reduced SMS and voice usage, leading to a decline in ARPU for these services [4][7]. However, the initial drop in data ARPU was expected to be compensated by increased data consumption and larger data plans as users adopted more mobile internet usage [5].\n\nThe ARPU trends for both companies showed a decline, particularly in voice and SMS, as illustrated by the line graph in image1, where Voice and SMS ARPU declined steadily from 2013 to 2015, while Mobile Data ARPU initially fell but began to rise after 2015.

The competitive landscape, with CDMA operators pressuring GSM operators to reduce tariffs, also contributed to the ARPU decline [8].

This conclusion is supported by multiple pieces of evidence from both text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, it is noted that VAAL tends to be biased towards certain classes, particularly in long-tail distributions. For instance, in the Organ AM NIST dataset, VAAL prefers selecting data from the femur-right and platelet classes while largely ignoring minority classes like lung, liver, and monocyte [6]. This bias is also observed in other datasets, where VAAL fails to cover minority classes effectively, leading to poor label diversity [1][4][10]. The text emphasizes that most active querying strategies, including VAAL, suffer from selection bias, which is mitigated by enforcing label diversity [2][4][7].\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate this point. In image3, the bar charts for OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST show that VAAL has a lower performance compared to other strategies, indicating its inability to select a diverse set of classes. Image7 specifically highlights that VAAL has a lower entropy (2.800) compared to the Random strategy (3.154), reflecting a less balanced class distribution. Additionally, image2 shows that VAAL's performance improves with label diversity, suggesting its original form lacks sufficient diversity.\n\nIn summary, VAAL's tendency to focus on majority classes and neglect minority ones results in poor label diversity, making it the querying strategy with the worst performance in this regard across the datasets examined.\n\n**Answer:** VAAL yields the worst label diversity generally on all the datasets."}

Initially, the user's natural language input is encoded into a continuous vector using a bidirectional LSTM utterance encoder [2]. This encoding captures the semantic meaning of the user's utterance, which is then combined with the encoding of the previous system action to update the dialogue state in a dialogue-level LSTM [3]. The dialogue state maintains a continuous representation of the conversation, tracking the user's goals and context [10].\n\nBased on this updated state, the system uses a policy network to determine the next action, which is conditioned on the dialogue state, the estimated user goals, and the encoding of any query results from a knowledge base [3][5]. The policy network emits a dialogue act, such as \"confirm date,\" which specifies the action and slot type [1]. This system action is then used to generate a natural language response via a template-based natural language generator (NLG) [6]. The NLG replaces delexicalized tokens in a template with values from the user's goal or knowledge base entities, depending on the action [6].\n\nFor instance, if the system action is \"request(time),\" the NLG will generate a response like \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" by filling in the appropriate slot values [6]. The architecture ensures that each component, from utterance encoding to response generation, is part of an end-to-end differentiable model, allowing the entire system to be trained together [4]. This integrated approach enables the system to produce contextually appropriate and task-oriented responses efficiently.\n\n![The image depicts a proposed architecture for an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system, showing the flow from user input through encoding, dialogue state tracking, policy network, and natural language generation](image6)\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, updating the dialogue state, determining the next action with a policy network, and producing a natural language output using a template-based generator."}

For refuted claims, the most common reason is incorrect calculation results, accounting for 41.7% of cases, followed by incorrect approximation words at 33.33%, and claims that are partially right at 10.0% [3]. These reasons highlight the challenges posed by numerical inaccuracies and ambiguities in scientific claims. For NEI claims, insufficient evidence in the table is the leading factor at 33.3%, with a significant portion also lacking open-domain knowledge (25.0%) and closed-domain knowledge (15.0%) [5]. Additionally, vague pronouns and omitted specific information contribute to NEI classifications [6].\n\nThese reasons significantly impact model performance in zero-shot 3-class classification.

InstructGPT tends to classify supported and refuted claims as NEI, showing a pattern of \"less confident\" predictions, while GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, often misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted [7]. This difficulty is further compounded by the complexity of claims requiring extensive reasoning and domain knowledge, leading models to default to the safer NEI category [8].

InstructGPT tends to be \"less confident,\" frequently classifying supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information), as seen by the high percentages of NEI predictions for both supported (26.8%) and refuted (23.6%) claims. In contrast, GPT-4 exhibits overconfidence, incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted, with significant percentages of NEI claims predicted as supported (10.3%) and refuted (8.5%).\n\nThe performance differences can be attributed to the types of errors each model makes. InstructGPT struggles with distinguishing between verifiable claims and those that lack sufficient information, as indicated by its confusion matrix. This aligns with the error analysis in the text, which highlights challenges such as table grounding and ambiguity in claims. For instance, grounding errors, where the model incorrectly associates data with table cells, and ambiguity errors, where claims contain vague expressions, are prevalent issues.

The dynamic weight adjusting strategy (DSC) is particularly effective in addressing the imbalance, as it consistently achieves the highest F1 scores across datasets [9], [11]. \n\nIn sentiment analysis tasks, such as those on the SST datasets, the dice loss (DL) and DSC perform slightly worse than cross-entropy (CE) in terms of accuracy [2], indicating that these losses are not as effective for accuracy-oriented tasks. However, for named entity recognition (NER) tasks, DSC shows significant improvements. For example, on the Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 dataset, BERT-MRC+DSC achieves the highest F1-score [image1], and on the English OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, it improves the F1-score by +0.96 over the base BERT-MRC model [image7]. This suggests that DSC is adept at handling class imbalance, which is a common issue in NER tasks.\n\nThe hyperparameter tuning of the Tversky index (TI) further highlights the importance of balancing false-negatives and false-positives. On the Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 dataset, the highest F1-score is achieved with α=0.6, while for English QuoRef, α=0.4 yields the best results [10], [image4]. This flexibility in TI allows for task-specific optimization, enhancing performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\nOverall, the dynamic weight adjusting strategy (DSC) consistently outperforms other techniques, especially in imbalanced scenarios, as evidenced by its superior F1 scores across multiple datasets and tasks [9], [11], [image3], [image6]. This indicates that DSC effectively mitigates the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples, a critical issue in data-imbalanced NLP tasks [7], [8].\n\n**Answer**: Different data augmentation techniques impact BERT models by altering dataset balance, with +positive improving performance and +negative worsening it.

This balanced dataset was further augmented to maintain the same distribution, resulting in 458,477 examples [1]. However, when negative augmentation was applied, the dataset became imbalanced with 79% negatives and 21% positives [7]. The impact of these augmentations on model performance varied significantly.\n\nIn the context of the MRC task, the proposed DSC loss function showed substantial improvements over BERT and XLNet, particularly in terms of F1 and EM scores. For instance, on SQuAD v1.1, DSC outperformed XLNet by +1.25 in F1 and +0.84 in EM [2]. Similarly, on QuoRef, DSC achieved 87.65 in EM and 89.51 in F1, surpassing XLNet by +1.46 and +1.41 respectively [2]. This indicates that DSC is particularly effective in improving performance on these metrics.\n\nThe results in Table 8 [4] highlight that positive augmentation (+positive) generally outperforms the original dataset, while negative augmentation (+negative) underperforms, likely due to increased imbalance. The DSC loss consistently performed the best across datasets, especially on imbalanced data, achieving minor improvements on +positive and significant gains on +negative datasets [5]. This aligns with the expectation that DSC helps more in imbalanced scenarios.\n\nFor the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets, the Tversky index (TI) hyperparameters (α and β) played a crucial role. The highest F1 on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 was 84.67 with α=0.6, while for QuoRef, it was 68.44 with α=0.4 [6]. This demonstrates the sensitivity of performance to these hyperparameters across different datasets.\n\nIn sentiment classification tasks, BERT+CE achieved the highest accuracy on SST-2 and SST-5, with BERT+DL and BERT+DSC performing slightly worse [10].

According to the text, COMET-RANK, a novel neural framework, consistently outperforms traditional metrics like BLEU in most language pairs. For instance, in Table 1 [4], COMET-RANK shows strong correlations with human judgments, outperforming BLEU and other baselines in seven out of eight language pairs. This is further supported by the results in Table 2 [11], where COMET-RANK achieves the highest scores in five out of seven language pairs with English as the target, indicating its effectiveness in capturing translation quality beyond lexical matching.\n\nThe inclusion of the source language in COMET-RANK's architecture, as described in Figure 2 [5], enhances its ability to optimize the embedding space, minimizing the distance between better hypotheses and anchors (source and reference). This architectural advantage is reflected in the performance improvements observed when references are included, as shown in image4, where COMET-RANK (ref. only) scores improve significantly when references are added, especially in reverse language pairs (e.g., cs-en, de-en, fi-en, tr-en).\n\nIn contrast, BLEU, a classic n-gram matching metric [6][7], relies on counting matching n-grams between the hypothesis and reference, which often fails to capture semantic similarity. This limitation is evident in image1, where BLEU scores are generally lower compared to COMET-RANK across language pairs like en-cs, en-de, en-fi, en-gu, en-kk, en-lt, en-ru, and en-zh. The bolded highest scores in the table indicate that COMET-RANK frequently outperforms BLEU, highlighting its superior performance.\n\nFurther analysis in image3 and image5 shows that COMET-RANK maintains higher Kendall Tau scores across different sets of top MT systems, even as the number of systems decreases. This trend is consistent across both directions (language X to English and English to language X), demonstrating COMET-RANK's robustness. In image5, COMET-RANK (cyan line) consistently outperforms BLEU (red line), which shows a downward trend, reinforcing its effectiveness in ranking translation quality.\n\nIn summary, COMET-RANK leverages neural frameworks and source inclusion to achieve higher correlations with human judgments, outperforming BLEU across most language pairs.

BERT models, as shown in the text [5], demonstrate significant gains over previous models like Radford et al. (2018) and achieve state-of-the-art results on various tasks. The BERT_LARGE model, in particular, consistently outperforms others across tasks such as CoLA, QNLI, and RTE, as illustrated in image5, which highlights its superior performance compared to CNN Base, CNN Large, and BPE Large. For instance, BERT_LARGE achieves higher accuracy on SST-2 and RTE, indicating its effectiveness in capturing contextual nuances.\n\nIn contrast, CNN models, while competitive, show varying performance. The CNN Large model, as seen in image5, performs well on SST-2 and MRPC but lags behind BERT_LARGE on tasks like CoLA and RTE. The text [3] notes that while the CNN base model matches STILTs in aggregate performance, it falls short on sentence-pair tasks like MRPC and RTE, similar to BERT. This suggests that BERT's bidirectional context modeling, which captures both left and right context, provides an advantage in understanding complex sentence relationships.\n\nImage6 further supports these findings by showing that BERT models, especially BERT_LARGE, maintain higher average scores across tasks, even when trained on different datasets. The CNN models, while robust, do not surpass BERT's performance, particularly on tasks requiring deep contextual understanding. Additionally, the cloze-driven training regime of BERT, as mentioned in [1], is more effective than separate left and right token prediction, contributing to its edge in tasks like RTE.\n\nHowever, the CNN models' strengths lie in their efficiency and scalability. The BPE Large model, despite having more parameters, does not outperform CNN Large significantly, as noted in [3], and is faster to train, as shown in image7. This efficiency could be beneficial in scenarios where computational resources are limited.\n\nIn summary, BERT models excel in tasks requiring nuanced contextual understanding due to their bidirectional architecture and cloze-style training, while CNN models offer efficiency and competitive performance in certain tasks.

The text highlights that fine-tuning, where task-specific architectures are fine-tuned with different learning rates, provides the biggest gain compared to other stacking methods [5]. This is supported by the image showing that \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieves the highest F1 scores on both development and test datasets, outperforming \"CNN Large + ELMo\" and \"ELMoBASE\" [image5][image6]. \n\nFurthermore, the cloze-driven training regime is more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately, contributing to improved performance [1].

For instance, when using a single encoder for multiple source languages, aligning embeddings helps increase BLEU scores for all tasks, as it simplifies the learning process by placing word embeddings in similar vector spaces [2]. This is particularly useful in multilingual systems where the model can learn more effectively if the embeddings are aligned, allowing it to treat the languages similarly [6]. However, in bilingual scenarios, the necessity of alignment is less clear. The text suggests that a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary, as gains or losses are often insignificant [7]. This implies that while alignment can be helpful in some cases, it might not always lead to significant improvements.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 provides a table that compares different training setups, including an \"align\" column. For the language pairs GL + PT and AZ + TR, the \"align\" metric shows the highest scores, indicating that alignment can enhance performance. For example, GL + PT evaluated on GL shows an \"align\" score of 22.4, which is higher than the \"pre\" score of 20.8, suggesting that alignment improves BLEU scores in this case. Similarly, AZ + TR evaluated on AZ shows an \"align\" score of 7.5, which is higher than the \"pre\" score of 5.9. This supports the idea that alignment can be beneficial, especially when dealing with multiple languages in a single model.\n\nHowever, image3 presents a different perspective. It shows BLEU scores for various language pairs with and without alignment. For GL → EN, alignment results in a slight decrease (12.8 to 11.5), while for PT → EN, the change is minimal (30.8 to 30.6). For AZ → EN, there's a slight increase (2.0 to 2.1), and for RU → EN, a small improvement (21.1 to 21.4). This mixed impact aligns with the text's conclusion that alignment may not always be necessary, as the gains are often insignificant [7].\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can improve BLEU scores in some translation tasks, particularly in multilingual settings, but its effectiveness varies.

From the data, we observe that pre-training yields larger BLEU score improvements for language pairs with lower baseline scores, such as RU and HE, compared to more linguistically similar pairs like FR and IT [1]. This suggests that pre-training is particularly beneficial when there is substantial room for improvement, aligning with the hypothesis that systems with larger headroom see greater gains [1]. \n\nThe role of training set size is evident in the trend where pre-training is most effective when the baseline system is moderately effective, typically with a BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4]. This indicates that a certain level of data is necessary for pre-training to take effect, but once this threshold is met, pre-training can substantially boost performance. For instance, the improvement in BLEU scores is more pronounced at smaller training set sizes, as shown in the graphs where pre-trained models outperform standard models, especially when data is limited [image2].\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a crucial role. Pre-training tends to be more effective for more linguistically similar translation pairs. For example, the improvement in BLEU scores for GL/PT, which are highly similar, is greater than for BE/RU, which are less similar [11]. This aligns with the hypothesis that semantically similar languages benefit more from pre-trained embeddings due to more consistent semantic neighborhoods [3]. \n\nIn multilingual systems, aligning embedding spaces further enhances performance, as seen in the table where aligning embeddings improves BLEU scores for all tasks, particularly when a single encoder is used for multiple languages [11]. This is because aligned embeddings allow the model to learn more effectively from shared data across languages [11]. \n\nAdditionally, pre-training improves the translation of low-frequency words, as demonstrated by the F-measure analysis showing better performance for less frequent vocabulary [7][image4]. This is particularly useful for low-resource languages, where rare words are more common [6]. \n\nIn summary, pre-training boosts translation accuracy, with greater effects in low-resource scenarios and for linguistically similar languages. Training set size and language similarity are key factors, with pre-training being most impactful when baseline systems are moderately effective and when languages share linguistic features. \n\n**Answer:** Pre-training improves translation accuracy more in low-resource and linguistically similar language pairs, with greater gains when training data is limited but sufficient for basic language capture."}

As noted in the text [4], replacing ELMo with GloVe and removing R-GCN results in a loss of 8.0 points in accuracy, highlighting the critical role of R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relational context. This is further supported by the table in image4, which shows that the \"No R-GCN\" configuration performs worse than the full model in both unmasked (62.4 vs. 68.5) and masked (63.2 vs. 71.6) settings. The R-GCN's ability to leverage relational information is crucial for multi-hop reasoning, as confirmed by the performance drop when it is absent.\n\nNext, the absence of relation types (as seen in image4 under \"No relation types\") leads to marginal improvements over ELMo alone, suggesting that a naive graph structure without distinguishing edge types does not add much value.

This is further supported by the performance degradation observed when coreference is included in the test set, indicating that the test documents might be more challenging for the coreference system [8].\n\nIn the masked setting, coreference links are less critical because all mentions of an entity are replaced with a unique identifier (e.g., MASK1), making exact matching sufficient for coreference resolution. This is reflected in the performance metrics, where the model performs better in the masked setting overall, as coreferred mentions are labeled identically, simplifying the task [5].

CorefProp, while beneficial for entity extraction, has a smaller effect on SciERC due to the uniform generic labeling of pronouns [1][5]. However, it significantly improves pronoun performance in ACE05, where disambiguation requires cross-sentence context [12]. Image4 illustrates that DyGIE without CorefProp slightly reduces entity F1 scores, indicating its contribution to entity extraction [4]. Conversely, RelProp substantially enhances both entity and relation extraction, particularly in sentences with multiple entities, as shown in image6, where DyGIE outperforms DyGIE-RelProp in relation F1 scores across varying entity counts [8][9].\n\nImage5 confirms DyGIE's dominance across datasets like ACE04, ACE05, SciERC, and WLPC, achieving the highest entity and relation scores. For instance, on ACE05, DyGIE's entity F1 is 88.4 and relation F1 is 63.2, outperforming other models [5]. Image8 further details that while DyGIE without CorefProp excels in relation extraction, the full DyGIE model maintains the highest entity F1 scores, underscoring the balanced impact of both propagation layers [8].\n\nOverall, DyGIE's dynamic span graph approach, coupled with CorefProp and RelProp, enables effective information extraction by leveraging broader context, leading to state-of-the-art results across diverse domains and tasks."}

For instance, in the ACE05 dataset, disambiguating entity classes for pronominal mentions requires cross-sentence context, and DyGIE's coreference layer improves pronoun performance by 6.6% [3]. This improvement is evident in the results where DyGIE outperforms other models on datasets with coreference annotations, such as ACE04-O and ACE05-O, achieving F1 scores of 84.7 and 82.9 respectively, compared to previous state-of-the-art models [9]. \n\n![DyGIE achieves the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets](image5) highlights that DyGIE surpasses other systems on ACE04-O and ACE05-O, which have coreference annotations, indicating the model's effectiveness in leveraging these annotations.

This is further supported by image2, which shows that SWEM-concat and SWEM-hier are among the top performers across multiple datasets, indicating their effectiveness in capturing relevant features for topic prediction and ontology classification [1]. The hierarchical pooling in SWEM-hier is especially beneficial for tasks requiring spatial information, as seen in its strong performance on the DBpedia dataset [2].\n\nIn sentiment analysis tasks, however, CNN models often outperform SWEM variants. For example, on the Yelp Polarity and Yelp Full datasets, CNN and LSTM models achieve higher accuracies, suggesting that these models better capture the nuances in sentiment through their compositional functions [1]. This aligns with the findings in image3, where CNN and LSTM models lead in tasks like SST-1 and SST-2, highlighting the importance of word-order features in shorter texts [5].\n\nWhen evaluating model complexity and parameter efficiency, SWEM models are notably more parameter-efficient. Image5 illustrates that SWEM achieves higher accuracy than CNN at lower subspace dimensions, indicating that SWEM requires fewer parameters to reach a decent solution [10]. This efficiency is further emphasized in image8, where SWEM's accuracy stabilizes quickly with increasing subspace dimensions, whereas CNN requires more dimensions to achieve similar performance [9].\n\nThe sparsity of SWEM-max embeddings, as shown in image7, suggests that SWEM relies on a few key words for predictions, which can be advantageous in tasks where specific terms are critical. However, this sparsity might limit its effectiveness in tasks requiring richer semantic information, such as short sentence classification [3].\n\nOverall, SWEM models excel in document classification due to their efficient pooling strategies and lower computational complexity, while CNN models are more effective in sentiment analysis and tasks requiring detailed word-order information. The choice between SWEM and CNN should consider the nature of the task and the importance of word-order features."}

However, this high performance was found to be due to the model's reliance on exploiting cue words, particularly \"not,\" in the warrants [2]. When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, where claims are negated and labels inverted to mirror the distribution of cues across both labels, BERT's performance dropped dramatically to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median scores at 50% [6][8].

Firstly, QCT revenues surged by 64% due to increased demand for 5G products, reflecting a recovery from COVID-19 impacts, alongside higher automotive and IoT revenues [10]. Additionally, QTL revenues grew by 26% due to increased sales of 3G/4G/5G-based products [10]. The acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion also contributed to strategic advancements in high-performance processors and SoC technologies, expected to integrate into QCT products [7][10]. Furthermore, QSI earnings before income taxes increased by $927 million, primarily from higher net gains on investments [10].\n\nHowever, comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,964 million, a decrease from $5,305 million in 2020 [7]. This reduction is largely due to net unrealized losses on derivative instruments and foreign currency translation losses, which were $53 million and $40 million respectively in 2021, compared to gains in the previous year [7]. Other comprehensive income also saw a decline due to net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and other losses [7].\n\n![Financial data showing net income and comprehensive income for 2021, 2020, and 2019](image7)\n\nIn summary, while net income significantly increased due to robust revenue growth and strategic acquisitions, comprehensive income was impacted by unfavorable financial market conditions and currency fluctuations."}

This increase was primarily due to growth in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which rose from $79,854 million to $86,664 million, and unearned premiums, which increased from $21,395 million to $23,512 million. Additionally, notes payable and other borrowings in the \"Insurance and Other\" segment decreased slightly from $41,522 million to $39,272 million, while the \"Railroad, Utilities, and Energy\" segment saw a minor reduction in notes payable and other borrowings from $75,373 million to $74,990 million.

According to the financial data, net income increased from $4,350 million in 2016 to $5,185 million in 2020, indicating a steady rise in profitability over the five-year period [9]. This growth in net income is accompanied by a significant increase in total assets, which grew from $20,609 million in 2016 to $37,079 million in 2020. The substantial rise in total assets suggests that Accenture has been investing in its business, expanding its operational capabilities, and possibly acquiring new assets or businesses to support its growth strategy [8].\n\nThe increase in net income attributable to Accenture plc also supports this trend, rising from $4,112 million in 2016 to $5,108 million in 2020. This indicates that the company has been effectively managing its operations to enhance shareholder value. Additionally, the growth in cash and cash equivalents from $4,906 million in 2016 to $8,415 million in 2020 highlights improved liquidity and financial flexibility, enabling the company to pursue strategic initiatives and investments [8].\n\nThe company's ability to maintain and grow its net income despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the text, underscores its resilience and adaptability. For instance, while revenues experienced a decline in the second half of fiscal 2020, the company managed to sustain its financial performance through strategic adjustments, such as shifting to remote work and focusing on high-demand services like digital transformation and cloud technologies [1][3]. This adaptability likely contributed to the continued growth in net income and assets.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in shareholders' equity from $7,555 million in 2016 to $17,001 million in 2020 reflects the company's strong financial health and its ability to generate returns for shareholders. The reduction in long-term debt, net of current portion, from $24 million in 2016 to $54 million in 2020, although a slight increase, indicates prudent debt management, which supports financial stability [8].\n\nOverall, the trends in net income"}

By 2019, this ratio increased to 75.5%, reflecting higher operating costs relative to revenue. However, in 2020, the ratio improved to 68.3%, suggesting a reduction in operating expenses relative to revenue compared to 2019. This improvement could be attributed to cost-cutting measures or increased revenue generation, aligning with the strategic actions mentioned in the text to address underperformance and optimize efficiency [2][7].

Firstly, higher sales volume played a significant role, as end-user demand for equipment and services increased across various segments. This is supported by the text, which mentions that the increase was due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services, along with the impact from changes in dealer inventories [10]. Additionally, favorable price realization contributed to the growth, as noted in the text [10]. The text also highlights that dealer inventories decreased by $2.9 billion in 2020 but only by $100 million in 2021, indicating a shift in inventory management that positively impacted sales [11].\n\nThe image2 provides a visual representation of these factors, showing that the sales volume increased by $7,563 million, price realization by $932 million, and currency impacts by $671 million, all contributing to the overall revenue growth from $41,748 million in 2020 to $50,971 million in 2021. This aligns with the text's emphasis on these components [10].\n\nFurthermore, the text indicates that favorable currency impacts, particularly related to the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar, also contributed to the increase in sales volume [8]. The image1, which displays financial data by geographic regions, supports this by showing year-over-year revenue growth in various segments and regions, reinforcing the impact of regional demand and currency fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, the main factors were higher sales volume due to increased end-user demand, favorable price realization, and positive currency impacts, as well as changes in dealer inventories.

According to the text, medical costs in 2020, 2019, and 2018 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $880 million, $580 million, and $320 million, respectively [2]. This indicates that the company adjusted its estimates downward for prior periods, reducing reported medical costs in the current year.\n\nLooking at the detailed breakdown in image1, the reported medical costs for the current year increased from $145,723 million in 2018 to $160,276 million in 2020. However, the inclusion of favorable development for prior years reduced the total reported medical costs to $159,396 million in 2020, compared to $145,403 million in 2018. This adjustment reflects more accurate estimates as more complete claim information became available.\n\nFor medical payments, the total payments for the current year rose from $127,155 million in 2018 to $139,974 million in 2020. Additionally, payments for prior years increased from $16,567 million in 2018 to $19,556 million in 2020. The total medical payments thus increased from $143,722 million in 2018 to $159,530 million in 2020. Despite the increase in payments, the medical costs payable at the end of the period slightly rose from $19,891 million in 2018 to $21,872 million in 2020, indicating ongoing adjustments and settlements.\n\nIn summary, while the reported medical costs and payments increased from 2018 to 2020, the favorable development adjustments played a crucial role in moderating the impact on the company's financials.

However, in 2020, capital expenditures decreased to $16 billion, primarily due to reduced spending on growth projects and lower global project spending [12]. This reduction was part of a broader effort to strengthen liquidity amid challenging industry conditions, which included issuing $23 billion in long-term debt and implementing cost reductions [2]. The decrease in capital expenditures is evident in the breakdown of expenditures, where both capital and other expenditures fell from $5,245 million in 2019 to $4,476 million in 2020, as shown in the table in image6. This reduction in spending aligns with the company's strategy to prioritize cash flow and manage financial risks.\n\nRegarding taxes, ExxonMobil's tax landscape also shifted notably.

By 2020, total taxes dropped to $22.8 billion, with income tax expense becoming a benefit of $5.6 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17% [9].

The GAAP earnings per share-diluted decreased by 20% from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020, while the Non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted, which excludes strategic gains and charges, decreased by 23% from $7.84 to $6.05 [image1]. The strategic gains of $0.26 per share in 2020 helped mitigate some of the decline, but the overall performance was negatively affected by the revenue decreases and increased expenses, such as franchisee support and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses [11].\n\nIn summary, the revenue declines in both company-operated and franchised segments, especially in the International Operated Markets, led to a significant reduction in earnings per share, both GAAP and Non-GAAP, from 2019 to 2020. The strategic gains provided some relief, but the overall impact of the pandemic on operations was substantial.\n\n![Reconciliation of earnings per share showing a 20% decrease in GAAP and 23% in Non-GAAP](image1)"}

According to the text, these assumptions are based on historical data and market conditions. For instance, the risk-free interest rates are tied to U.S. Treasury yields, expected volatilities consider both historical and implied volatility from exchange-traded options, and expected dividend yields are based on actual cash dividends paid. The expected life of options is determined by historical exercise patterns, with the weighted-average remaining contractual life at the end of 2020 being 6.6 years, as detailed in the image quotes. ![Stock options data including shares outstanding, exercise prices, and intrinsic values](image2) ![Assumptions for stock options including risk-free rates, volatility, and expected life](image4) \n\nIn contrast, future minimum lease payments are contractual obligations that the company must fulfill, representing a more concrete financial commitment. As of December 31, 2020, the total future minimum lease payments amounted to $5,046 million, with payments spread over several years, as shown in the image. ![Future minimum lease payments for 2021-2025 and thereafter](image6) \n\nThe stock option assumptions are forward-looking and involve estimates that can fluctuate with market conditions, whereas lease payments are fixed obligations based on existing contracts. This distinction highlights the difference between contingent liabilities (stock options) and committed liabilities (lease payments). The company's approach to stock options involves modeling potential future scenarios, while lease payments are a known expense over the lease terms. \n\nIn summary, the assumptions for stock options involve probabilistic estimates influenced by market factors, while future minimum lease payments represent fixed, contractual commitments."}

According to the text, the U.S. upstream segment reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, a substantial increase from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020, driven by higher realizations, absence of impairments, and asset sales gains [4]. Similarly, the international upstream segment's earnings rose to $8.5 billion in 2021 from a loss of $825 million in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments, though offset by higher taxes and depreciation [7]. The U.S. downstream segment also improved, reporting earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to a loss of $571 million in 2020, mainly due to higher margins and sales volumes [12]. These improvements in earnings likely contributed to an overall increase in net income.\n\nRegarding return on stockholders' equity, while specific figures are not provided in the text quotes, the financial data in the images suggest changes. Image2 shows a table with financial data over three years, including 2021, 2020, and 2019, with bold numbers highlighting 2021's figures. The total for 2021 is 37,498, compared to 42,628 in 2020 and 44,679 in 2019, indicating a decrease in total financial metrics, which could impact return on equity. However, the increase in net income from the upstream and downstream segments suggests a potential improvement in return on stockholders' equity despite the overall decrease in total financial figures.\n\nIn summary, Chevron's net income improved significantly from 2020 to 2021 due to better performance in upstream and downstream operations, while the return on stockholders' equity may have seen a positive change, though specific metrics are not directly provided. \n\n![Financial data comparison showing a decrease in total metrics from 2020 to 2021](image2)"}

The primary factors contributing to this decline include significant net strategic gains in 2020 from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which reduced the company's ownership by about 6% [1]. These gains were partially offset by other comprehensive losses, particularly in foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges. In 2020, foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in a net loss of $104.1 million, compared to gains in the previous years, due to unfavorable currency movements [7]. Additionally, cash flow hedges showed a net loss of $123.3 million in 2020, contrasting with gains in 2019 and 2018. The net income itself decreased to $4,730.5 million in 2020 from $6,025.4 million in 2019 and $5,924.3 million in 2018, reflecting operational challenges, likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on restaurant operations [8].

According to the text, operating income for Sandoz decreased by 12% in USD and 14% in constant currencies, dropping from USD 2,334 million in 2020 to USD 2,064 million in 2021 [2]. This decline was primarily attributed to the ongoing effects of the pandemic, which led to delays in cancer care and a weak flu season that dampened generics sales [2]. Additionally, the text highlights that the pandemic's impact was still apparent in Oncology and Sandoz, contributing to the reduced performance [2].\n\nLooking at the core operating income, the segment's performance also declined. The core operating income margin decreased from 24.2% of net sales in 2020 to 21.4% in 2021, reflecting a 12% decrease in USD and a 14% decrease in constant currencies [2]. This reduction aligns with the broader challenges faced by the generics industry during the pandemic, as well as the strategic adjustments being made to position Sandoz for long-term leadership [4].\n\nThe image data provides further insights. Image2 shows that Sandoz's operating income decreased from USD 2,334 million in 2020 to USD 2,064 million in 2021, confirming the text's figures [image2]. Similarly, image3 indicates a significant increase in operating income for the overall company, but Sandoz's performance lagged, with a 12% decrease in USD and a 14% decrease in constant currencies [image3]. Image6 breaks down Sandoz's product categories, revealing that while Biopharmaceuticals saw a 10% increase in sales, Retail Generics and Anti-Infectives experienced declines, contributing to the overall decrease in operating income [image6].\n\nIn summary, the Sandoz segment's financial performance declined in 2021 due to pandemic-related disruptions and challenges in generics sales, despite some growth in biopharmaceuticals. The strategic review initiated by the company aims to address these issues and position Sandoz for future growth [4].\n\n![Sandoz operating income decreased by 12% in USD and 14% in constant currencies](image2)"}

In 2019, it was $7,683 million, which dropped to $7,145 million in 2020, and further to $6,674 million in 2021 [image7]. This decline was primarily due to lower interest income and a decrease in average card member loan balances. Specifically, interest income decreased from $9,414 million in 2019 to $7,391 million in 2021, while interest expense also decreased from $1,731 million in 2019 to $717 million in 2021 [image7]. The reduction in interest income was partly offset by lower interest expenses, but the net effect was a decrease in net interest income. Additionally, the decrease in average card member loan balances contributed to this trend, as noted in the data [image6].\n\n**Card Member Receivables:**\n- Card member receivables saw a significant increase from 2020 to 2021. In 2020, total receivables were $18.7 billion, which rose to $22.4 billion in 2021 [image5]. This increase was driven by higher outstanding balances, particularly in the U.S., where receivables grew by 24% from $11.9 billion in 2020 to $14.7 billion in 2021. However, the net write-off rates improved, with the U.S. principal-only write-off rate dropping from 1.3% in 2020 to 0% in 2021, and the 30+ days past due rate decreasing from 0.4% to 0.4% [image5].

This substantial growth was primarily driven by the profit for the year, which was RMB 4,176 million in 2020 [8]. Additionally, other comprehensive income, including fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences, contributed to the increase [7].\n\n- **Total Comprehensive Income for the Year** rose from RMB 5,268 million in 2019 to RMB 8,100 million in 2020. This increase was largely due to a significant rise in fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, which jumped from RMB 1,031 million in 2019 to RMB 5,219 million in 2020. Currency translation differences also played a role, although they were negative in 2020, the overall impact was less severe compared to the gains from financial assets [8].\n\nThe financial statements highlight that the company's profitability and comprehensive income were positively influenced by strong growth in music subscription revenues and effective management of financial assets, despite challenges in the macro environment and increased competition [3][5]. The intercompany service fees and investments between the VIEs and PRC subsidiaries, as detailed in the notes, were eliminated at the consolidation level, ensuring that these transactions did not affect the reported comprehensive income [1][4].\n\n![The table shows changes in equity, including an increase in Retained Earnings and Total Comprehensive Income from 2019 to 2020](image6)\n\n![The table details the profit for the year and comprehensive income, showing significant increases in 2020](image8)\n\nIn summary, the increase in Retained Earnings and Total Comprehensive Income from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to higher profits and favorable changes in the fair value of financial assets, reflecting the company's operational success and financial management strategies."}

This trend is evident from the detailed breakdown of the components contributing to the total provision, as seen in the tables from image1 and image3.\n\nFrom image1, we observe that the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate remained consistent at 21.0% across the three years, but the actual provision for income taxes increased due to changes in other components. For instance, the health insurance tax, which was $552 million (3.5%) in 2018, increased significantly to $626 million (3.0%) in 2020. Additionally, the share-based awards—excess tax benefit decreased from a negative $161 million in 2018 to $130 million in 2020, indicating a reduction in tax benefits from these awards. The foreign rate differential also became less negative, moving from $203 million (-1.3%) in 2018 to $164 million (-0.8%) in 2020, suggesting a narrowing gap between foreign and domestic tax rates.\n\nImage3 provides a further breakdown into current and deferred provisions.

Noncurrent liabilities also increased from $5,351 million in 2019 to $7,789 million in 2020, an increase of $2,438 million. This overall rise in liabilities is reflected in the total debt figures, which decreased slightly from $21,729 million in 2019 to $21,204 million in 2020, as shown in image2. The decrease in total debt, despite the increase in liabilities, can be attributed to the reclassification of certain borrowings as long-term debt due to the company's ability to refinance them using the Five-Year Facility, as mentioned in text [2] and [4]. Specifically, $611 million of euro-denominated commercial paper and $290 million of 2021 Yen Notes were classified as long-term debt in 2020, supported by the availability of the Five-Year Facility. This strategic reclassification helped maintain liquidity and credit ratings while managing debt obligations.

In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, mainly related to the conversion of employee share-based awards, whereas in 2019, these benefits were $475 million, primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to tax examination resolutions [3][8][12]. The decrease in net discrete tax benefits from $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020 contributed to the rise in the effective tax rate.\n\nDuring the same period, total compensation expenses increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, as indicated in image1. This increase was driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives due to higher revenues, and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by lower compensation from carried interest [1]. The growth in compensation expenses, particularly in Wealth Management, which rose from $760 million in 2019 to $1,000 million in 2020, aligns with the overall increase in deferred cash-based compensation and investment performance impacts [6][7]. The firm's investments to hedge deferred compensation obligations, as noted in text [7], also influenced these expenses, though timing differences between investment gains and deferred compensation recognition were generally not material to income before taxes.\n\nIn summary, the rise in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 was influenced by reduced tax benefits, while compensation expenses increased due to higher revenues and investment-linked payouts, reflecting the firm's financial performance and compensation strategies during this period."}

This growth was lower than the increase in billed business, which grew by over 5% to $1.09 trillion, primarily due to strength in Goods and Services spending [10]. The credit loss reserves for card member loans decreased in 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in outstanding loan balances [11].

This distribution can influence revenue stability and growth, especially considering shifts in consumer behavior and market dynamics.\n\nLooking at net revenue changes, image1 shows that the United States had a steady increase from $37,148 million in 2018 to $40,800 million in 2020, while Mexico and Russia saw declines. This could be linked to regional market conditions and the balance of beverage vs. food/snack sales. For instance, the U.S. has a balanced mix (45% beverage), which might provide more resilience compared to regions like LatAm, which rely heavily on food/snack sales.\n\nOperating profit changes are detailed in image2. For example, FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) saw operating profit growth, which might be attributed to its strong food/snack portfolio. In contrast, PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) also grew, reflecting the stable beverage demand. The text mentions that operating profit was affected by COVID-19 charges, with PBNA and FLNA being particularly impacted by the loss of major customers like Walmart [3]. This highlights how reliance on specific product categories can affect profitability during disruptions.\n\nImage5 provides insights into depreciation and amortization, which can impact operating profit. For instance, Europe's high depreciation costs ($350 million in 2020) might pressure operating profit, despite its beverage-heavy sales. Meanwhile, APAC's lower depreciation ($91 million in 2020) could support profit margins in a region with a 75% food/snack focus.\n\nIn summary, the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 are influenced by the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories.

In 2021, cash inflows from financing activities surged to €11,839 million, a stark contrast to the €-249 million outflow in 2020. This substantial increase was largely due to the financing of the Varian acquisition, which brought in €12,087 million [5]. Additionally, the company received €10 billion in borrowings and an extra €850 million from the Siemens Group to support this acquisition [9]. These inflows were partially offset by repayments of matured loans totaling €730 million and €300 million [9].\n\nOn the investing side, cash outflows rose dramatically to €14,140 million in 2021, up from €-1,912 million in 2020. The primary driver was the payout for the Varian acquisition, which accounted for a significant portion of the outflows [6]. Furthermore, investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment increased by €117 million, reflecting capacity expansions and enhancements aimed at boosting competitiveness and innovation [6][8].\n\nThe table in image3 highlights these shifts, showing a substantial increase in cash flows from financing activities and a sharp rise in investing outflows. The acquisition of Varian was a pivotal factor, influencing both financing inflows and investing outflows. Additionally, the company's focus on capital expenditures for intangible assets and infrastructure, as noted in text quote [8], contributed to the increased investing outflows. Overall, the acquisition and strategic investments were the key factors driving the changes in cash flows between the two years.\n\n![Cash flow changes with significant financing inflows and investing outflows](image3)"}

This positive trend was driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Net Income Improvement**: The net income attributable to common stockholders increased dramatically from a loss of $(1,063) million in 2018 to a profit of $862 million in 2020. This improvement was largely due to operational efficiencies and increased revenues, as seen in the revenue growth across various segments like automotive sales and energy generation and storage. The operating margin also improved from a negative value to 6.3% in 2020 [3], contributing to higher net income.\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment**: The foreign currency translation adjustment, which is part of other comprehensive income, showed a significant gain of $399 million in 2020 compared to losses of $(42) million in 2018 and $(28) million in 2019. This adjustment reflects the positive impact of exchange rate changes on the company's foreign operations [8].\n\n3. **Reduction in Noncontrolling Interests**: The comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests increased by $54 million in 2020, primarily due to lower activities from new financing fund arrangements [5]. This reduction in the share of income allocated to noncontrolling interests further boosted the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders.\n\n4. **Stock-Based Compensation**: While stock-based compensation expenses increased by $499 million in 2020, primarily due to the 2018 CEO Performance Award and higher equity award values [1], the overall impact on comprehensive income was offset by operational gains and other factors.\n\n5. **Settlement of Litigation**: A reduction of $43 million in operating expenses from the settlement of securities litigation related to the SolarCity acquisition also positively impacted the financial results [1].\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the significant improvement in comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders from 2018 to 2020, culminating in"}

Excluding the $1.8 billion from the Olympics, revenue still increased by 11.0% due to higher distribution and advertising revenue. Additionally, Peacock's revenue grew significantly from $118 million in 2020 to $778 million in 2021 [1]. This aligns with image2, which shows an 8.1% increase in direct-to-consumer revenue and a 24.6% increase in advertising revenue for the segment, contributing to the overall revenue growth.\n\nFor the Sky segment, image8 provides specific financial data. Revenue decreased from $(2,006) million in 2020 to $(3,048) million in 2021, representing a 51.9% increase in the negative revenue, which suggests a worsening financial position. This is further supported by text quote [9], which mentions an increase in Sky segment expenses due to higher direct network costs, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. The significant increase in operating costs and expenses (59.0%) in image8 also indicates challenges in managing costs, impacting the revenue negatively.\n\nIn summary, the NBCUniversal Headquarters segment saw a substantial revenue increase due to the Olympics and Peacock's growth, while the Sky segment experienced a significant decline in revenue, exacerbated by rising costs.\n\nThe revenue in the NBCUniversal Headquarters segment increased by 20.3% from 2020 to 2021, while the Sky segment's revenue decreased by 51.9% over the same period."}

However, **IBM Z** saw a slight increase of 1.9% (1% adjusted) [11]. This aligns with the detailed breakdown in image7, which shows the revenue changes for each category within Systems.\n\nIn terms of **pre-tax income**, the Systems segment reported a significant decrease of 36.0% year to year, primarily due to workforce rebalancing charges [8]. This is reflected in image1, which highlights a drop from $701 million in 2019 to $449 million in 2020, a 36.0% decrease.\n\nLooking at **regional performance**, total revenue decreased by 4.6% year to year, with the Americas experiencing a 6.0% decline (4.8% adjusted), Europe/Middle East/Africa a 3.3% decline (4.7% adjusted), and Asia Pacific a 3.5% decline (4.3% adjusted) [7].

For 2021, the amortization of intangible assets and impairments were added back to the IFRS operating income to arrive at the core operating income. Specifically, the amortization of intangible assets was adjusted by $3,528 million, and impairments by $619 million, which together contributed to a substantial increase in core operating income. This is evident in the detailed adjustments provided in the table for 2021, where these items were added back to the IFRS operating income of $10,688 million, resulting in a core operating income of $15,215 million. ![Amortization and impairments significantly increased core operating income in 2021](image8)\n\nIn 2020, similar adjustments were made. The amortization of intangible assets and impairments were also added back to the IFRS operating income. For instance, the amortization of intangible assets was adjusted by $366 million, and impairments by $255 million, leading to a core operating income of $2,334 million from an IFRS operating income of $1,043 million.

According to [10], the fair value of these instruments is based on quoted market prices if an active market exists. If not, a valuation methodology is used. The text also mentions that deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges are transferred to the income statement within the next 12 months [9]. \n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 and image6 provide detailed data on derivative financial instruments. Image2 shows that derivative financial instruments as part of financial assets at fair value through the income statement increased significantly from DKK 188 million in 2019 to DKK 2,332 million in 2020. This substantial increase suggests a higher reliance on derivatives for hedging or speculative purposes. Image6 further breaks down these instruments, indicating that both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges are used, with notable changes in contract amounts and fair values between the two years. \n\nThe increase in derivative financial instruments likely reflects strategic financial management to hedge against market risks, such as currency fluctuations. However, the significant rise in their value could also indicate higher volatility or changes in market conditions, impacting the income statement through recognized gains or losses [8]. \n\n**Cash Flow Changes:**\n\nCash flow changes are crucial for understanding the company's liquidity and operational efficiency. Image4 provides a detailed breakdown of working capital changes and cash flow adjustments. The table shows that the cash flow change in working capital was a negative DKK 4,353 million in 2020, compared to DKK 3,388 million in 2019. This increase in negative cash flow is primarily driven by higher outflows in inventories, trade receivables, and other receivables and prepayments. \n\nThe text quote [12] explains that cash from operating activities adjusts income statement items to a cash basis, considering changes in working capital. The negative cash flow change suggests that the company's working capital requirements increased, possibly due to higher inventory levels or slower collection of receivables. This impacts the cash flow statement by reducing the net cash from operating activities, which in turn affects the company's liquidity position.\n\n**Impact on Financial Statements:"}

This decrease was primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases. The text also mentions that SG&A expenses were impacted by higher write-offs of certain information technology assets and expenses related to granting employees one additional day of paid time off [9]. The image quotes provide specific figures for SG&A expenses:\n\n- **image7** shows SG&A expenses as:\n  - 2022: $19,779 (8.88% of net sales)\n  - 2021: $18,537 (9.65% of net sales)\n  - 2020: $16,387 (10.04% of net sales)\n\nThis indicates a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales over the three years, aligning with the text's explanation of improved efficiency and cost management.\n\n**Interest Income and Other, Net:**\n\nThe text mentions that interest income increased in 2022 due to higher global interest rates and foreign-currency transaction gains [3].

According to the financial summaries, the total financial debt at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 was €4,969 million, and by the end of the year, it had increased to €5,503 million, reflecting a rise of €534 million [4]. This increase is primarily attributed to cash flows and non-cash changes, including acquisitions and foreign exchange rate effects.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the total financial debt continued to grow. The beginning balance for fiscal year 2021 was €5,503 million, and by the end of the year, it had risen to €14,315 million, marking an increase of €8,812 million [6]. This substantial growth can be attributed to various factors, including the financing activities related to the acquisition of Varian, as noted in the financial data [12]. The significant rise in liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities, which increased from €2,982 million in 2020 to €11,708 million in 2021, played a major role in this increase [2]. Additionally, the market value of forwards for hedging foreign currency liabilities also became more negative, moving from -€92 million in 2020 to -€498 million in 2021, indicating increased hedging activities [2].\n\nThe detailed breakdown in the financial summaries shows that while loans from banks decreased slightly from €109 million to €92 million, lease liabilities increased from €458 million to €660 million, and liabilities to the Siemens Group surged from €4,936 million to €13,562 million [6]. These changes collectively contributed to the overall increase in total financial debt.\n\nIn conclusion, the total financial debt increased by €8,812 million from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, driven by significant financing activities and acquisitions, particularly the Varian acquisition, as well as changes in hedging strategies and liabilities to the Siemens Group. \n\n![Total financial debt increased significantly from €5,503 million to €14,315 million](image6)"}

According to the text, actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression, among others [4]. These assumptions are crucial as they directly influence the calculation of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and, consequently, the actuarial gains or losses.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the changes in financial assumptions resulted in actuarial losses of €26 million, compared to gains of €72 million in fiscal year 2020 [7]. This shift from gains to losses indicates that the financial assumptions used in 2021 were less favorable, leading to an increase in the DBO and thus higher actuarial losses. The sensitivity of the DBO to changes in these assumptions is further highlighted by the table in image7, which shows that changes in financial assumptions contributed to a decrease in actuarial gains by €26 million in 2021, a stark contrast to the €72 million gain in 2020. \n\nThe discount rate, a critical financial assumption, is determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds [4]. Image2 provides the discount rates for various currencies, showing an increase in the discount rate from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the euro. A higher discount rate typically reduces the present value of future obligations, but the impact can vary based on the specific plan structure and assumptions. The table in image1 illustrates the sensitivity of the DBO to changes in the discount rate, indicating that a decrease in the discount rate would increase the DBO, while an increase would decrease it. The data shows that a 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase the DBO by €271 million in 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020, suggesting heightened sensitivity in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the use of derivatives as part of a liability-driven investment approach to manage risks associated with the DBO is mentioned [7]. This strategy aims to align plan assets with the DBO, mitigating the impact of adverse changes in financial assumptions. However, the overall actuarial losses in 2021"}

This growth in net income directly contributed to the increase in retained earnings, a key component of shareholders' equity. The comprehensive income, which includes both net income and other comprehensive income (OCI), also grew over the period, from $3,730,974 in 2018 to $5,472,296 in 2020. This overall increase in comprehensive income indicates a positive financial performance, enhancing the company's equity position.\n\nThe components of other comprehensive income (OCI) varied across the years. In 2018, OCI was negative at $(481,387), primarily due to significant losses from foreign currency translation and cash flow hedges. By 2019, OCI improved slightly to $(264,406), with foreign currency translation losses continuing but offset by gains in cash flow hedges. In 2020, OCI turned positive at $278,740, driven by gains in foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans, which improved the overall OCI. These fluctuations in OCI components influenced the total comprehensive income and, consequently, the shareholders' equity.\n\nThe changes in shareholders' equity, as detailed in the Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity Statements, reflect these trends.

Dividend income, however, increased slightly from $4,525 million in 2019 to $5,060 million in 2021, offsetting some of the decline in interest income [3][7].\n\nOverall, while premiums earned in key segments like Property/Casualty showed robust growth, net investment income faced challenges due to reduced interest rates, impacting overall financial performance.\n\n**Answer:** Premiums earned in Property/Casualty increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, while Life/Health and Periodic Payment Annuity showed mixed trends.

This significant increase can be attributed to several factors, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which contributed to the growth in certain revenues [10]. Additionally, the revenue from the Americas region, which accounted for about 96% of total revenue, saw substantial growth, increasing from $9,445 million in 2019 to $12,051 million in 2020, further supporting the overall revenue growth ![Revenue by Region](image3).\n\nRegarding unearned revenue, the beginning balance for fiscal year 2020 was $8,564 million, and it ended at $10,662 million, indicating an increase of $2,098 million. This growth in unearned revenue suggests that the company invoiced more in advance of revenue recognition, possibly due to increased customer commitments and renewals. The unearned revenue is influenced by factors such as seasonality and the timing of renewals, as noted in the text [11]. The contribution from contract assets also increased from $13 million in 2019 to $101 million in 2020, reflecting more revenue recognized over time as services are delivered ![Unearned Revenue Details](image5).\n\nThe implications of these changes include a stronger financial position, with higher unearned revenue indicating future revenue recognition potential. However, the increase in unearned revenue also means that the company has obligations to deliver services or products in the future, which could be subject to economic risks such as bankruptcies or regulatory changes [1]. The growth in total revenue and unearned revenue suggests robust customer demand and successful business expansion, particularly from acquisitions like Tableau, which likely contributed to the higher contract values and future revenue recognition ![Revenue by Product](image8)."}

Specifically, the issued capital increased from €1,075 million to €1,128 million, and the capital reserve grew from €13,476 million to €15,818 million [3][4][7][10]. Additionally, the company repurchased treasury shares, which increased from €36 million to €240 million, reflecting the use of capital reserves for share-based payment programs [7][8]. The equity ratio declined from 76% to 55% mainly due to increased loan liabilities, but this was offset by the capital increase [7].\n\nRegarding cash flows from operating activities, Siemens Healthineers AG saw a substantial increase from €1,928 million in 2020 to €2,933 million in 2021. This improvement was largely attributed to the payment of the profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH and income from equity investments, despite higher income taxes paid [2][12]. The cash flows from operating activities were also influenced by the profit transfer from Siemens Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG, which contributed positively to the overall cash inflow [2]. The significant rise in operating cash flows reflects the company's enhanced operational performance and effective management of its financial activities during the fiscal year [6][12].\n\nIn summary, the total equity increased by €3,828 million, and cash flows from operating activities rose by €1,005 million from 2020 to 2021, indicating strong financial growth and operational efficiency for Siemens Healthineers AG.\n\n![Equity details showing significant increase in 2021](image4)\n![Cash flows from operating activities showing substantial increase in 2021](image6)"}

However, this was partially offset by new volumes at NaKika and Odyssey and tariff increases on Delta. Additionally, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million, primarily from equity earnings related to acquisitions of Explorer and Colonial, and higher distributions from Poseidon [5]. Interest income rose by $19 million due to financing receivables from the Norco Assets, while interest expense decreased by $3 million due to lower rates, though this was partially offset by additional borrowings [4].

This change is attributed to reduced capital expenditures, which decreased from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of the Houma tank expansion and Zydeco projects [2]. Additionally, there were no contributions to investments in 2020, which contributed to the positive cash flow from investing activities.\n\nIn summary, the decrease in operating income was largely due to pandemic-related challenges and operational costs, but was mitigated by strategic investments and interest income.

The image quotes provide specific figures for Level 2 assets. According to image6, the total Level 2 assets for 2022 are $561, calculated as $529 + $34 - $2. For 2021, the total is $408, calculated as $393 + $17 - $2. This indicates an increase in Level 2 assets from 2021 to 2022, with a difference of $153.\n\nRegarding long-term debt, text quote [11] states that the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $6,033 at the end of 2022 and $7,692 at the end of 2021.

This improvement was primarily driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for legal provisions [3][9]. Specifically, the increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items contributed significantly to the rise in free cash flow [3][5]. Additionally, the company benefited from lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year [3][5][9]. However, this growth was partially offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment for the in-license of tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. [3][9].\n\nThe financial statements also highlight that net cash flows from operating activities increased to USD 15.1 billion in 2021 from USD 13.6 billion in 2020, further supporting the rise in free cash flow [5]. This increase was mainly due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and divestment gains, alongside reduced legal provisions [5]. The table in image5 confirms these figures, showing net cash flows from operating activities at USD 15,071 million for 2021 and USD 13,650 million for 2020, aligning with the reported free cash flow figures [image5].\n\nFurthermore, the change in marketable securities, commodities, time deposits, and derivative financial instruments increased by USD 14.0 billion in 2021, driven by cash generated through operating activities and proceeds from the divestment of an investment in Roche, partially offset by dividend payments and treasury share purchases [7][image6]. This substantial increase in marketable securities and related instruments also contributed to the overall improvement in free cash flow.\n\nIn summary, the main contributing factors to the increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021 were higher adjusted operating income, reduced legal provisions, and proceeds from divestments, despite the offsetting effect of the tislelizumab payment. The financial data in image5 and image6 corroborate these findings, illustrating the significant growth in operating cash flows and changes in marketable securities that underpinned the free cash flow improvement.\n\nThe free cash flow increased by 14% from 2"}

According to the data, in 2021, the changes in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million, while in 2020, they contributed to a gain of €72 million [1]. This shift from a gain to a loss in financial assumptions is a key factor in the overall actuarial results. Additionally, the discount rate, which is a critical financial assumption, increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 [6]. A higher discount rate generally reduces the present value of future pension obligations, which can lead to actuarial gains. However, the negative impact from other financial assumptions in 2021 outweighed this effect, leading to a total actuarial loss of €22 million, compared to a gain of €67 million in 2020 [1].\n\nThe table in image1 illustrates these changes, showing that while experience gains and losses improved slightly (from -€2 million in 2020 to €12 million in 2021), the significant decline in financial assumptions drove the overall actuarial loss in 2021. The increase in the discount rate, as detailed in image6, suggests that the company's pension obligations were recalculated with a higher rate, which typically would reduce the liability. However, the adverse changes in other financial assumptions, such as investment returns or mortality rates, likely offset this benefit, resulting in the net loss observed.\n\nIn summary, the combination of adverse changes in financial assumptions and the impact of the increased discount rate led to a substantial decrease in total actuarial gains, turning them into losses in 2021 compared to the previous year. This highlights the sensitivity of actuarial valuations to changes in key assumptions and market conditions.\n\n![Actuarial gains and losses for 2021 and 2020](image1)"}

However, the foreign income before taxes increased from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, as shown in the image1. This substantial rise in foreign income could be due to various factors, including market expansion or improved performance in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThe foreign tax provision, as detailed in image4, shifted from a benefit of $407 million in 2019 to a provision of $518 million in 2021. This change indicates that the company moved from a net tax benefit to a net tax expense in foreign jurisdictions. The increase in foreign income likely contributed to this shift, as higher income would naturally lead to higher tax liabilities unless offset by deductions or credits.\n\nAdditionally, the company has significant unrecognized tax benefits, with $1.9 billion recorded to other liabilities as of September 26, 2021 [2]. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits is expected to continue in fiscal 2022 due to higher withholding taxes in Korea, which might not significantly impact the income tax provision but could affect cash flows [2]. This suggests that the company is managing potential tax liabilities in foreign jurisdictions, which could influence its cash management and investment strategies.\n\nThe company also has a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, reflecting uncertainties in utilizing foreign net operating losses [9]. This indicates cautious financial planning, as the company is reserving for potential tax benefits that may not be realized, impacting its effective tax rate and financial flexibility.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the company's financial strategy could include:\n\n1. **Tax Planning**: The company may need to reassess its tax planning strategies to optimize the use of foreign tax credits and manage the increased foreign tax provision.

The table in image4 shows that the balance at the beginning of 2021 was $603.0 billion. Throughout the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion, outflows of $(96.8) billion, and a market impact of $11.6 billion. However, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, resulted in a substantial outflow of $(587.1) billion, leading to a year-end balance of $0.

According to the text, the company's total assets increased from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, as shown in the selected balance sheet data. This growth in assets reflects the company's continued investment in debt securities and loans, which aligns with their liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives [1]. The increase in total loans, particularly in commercial loans, was driven by higher demand and increased originations, while consumer loans decreased due to paydowns and transfers to loans held for sale [3]. This shift in loan composition indicates a strategic focus on commercial lending to capitalize on market opportunities.\n\nThe sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) on November 1, 2021, marked a significant strategic move. The sale resulted in net gains of $674 million, which positively impacted the company's financial position [5]. Prior to the sale, WFAM contributed to asset-based fees through managing various asset classes, including equity, alternative, and fixed income [4]. The table in image8 shows that WFAM's assets under management decreased significantly in 2021 due to the sale, with a substantial outflow of $587.1 billion. This reduction reflects the divestiture and its impact on fee-generating activities, prompting the company to focus more on core banking operations and other fee-generating segments.\n\nThe financial data in image4 highlights the changes in key balance sheet components, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities. The amortized cost of these securities increased, indicating active portfolio management to meet capital and risk objectives [8]. The decrease in net unrealized gains on these securities was driven by higher interest rates, which affected the fair value of the portfolio [6]. This adjustment in the debt securities portfolio underscores the company's efforts to manage interest rate risk and optimize yield.\n\nOverall, the strategic divestiture of WFAM and the reallocation of assets into debt securities and commercial loans reflect a shift towards strengthening core banking activities and managing financial risks more effectively. The company's financial strategy appears to prioritize capital management and risk mitigation, as evidenced by the repositioning of the AFS and HTM portfolios and the focus on commercial lending growth.\n\nIn summary, the changes in total assets and the sale of WFAM assets under management led Wells Fargo"}

According to the text, adjusted profit before tax was significantly lower in 2020, with a decrease of 74% compared to 2019, primarily due to higher expected credit losses (ECL) and lower revenue [1]. The increase in ECL reflected the global impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly in the UK and Asia, and specific charges in sectors like oil and gas [9]. Adjusted revenue, however, saw a slight increase of £0.4 billion, partly due to intersegment eliminations and changes in revenue allocation [2][3].

This growth helped offset the impact of lower global interest rates and adverse credit adjustments. Conversely, Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) revenue decreased by 4% due to reduced lending balances and fees, particularly in Hong Kong and the UK, though wider margins in the UK and Latin America partially mitigated this decline [7][image6]. Global Banking revenue also fell by 2%, reflecting lower real estate and structured finance income, though capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending showed growth [12][image6].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends. ![Net operating income increased slightly from 2019 to 2020](image1) shows a 3% rise in net operating income, aligning with the text's mention of a £0.4 billion revenue increase.

According to the text, total loans increased slightly from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, reflecting a $7,757 million increase [4][8][12]. This increase was driven by growth in commercial loans, particularly in the commercial and industrial segment, due to higher loan demand and increased originations, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [8]. Conversely, consumer loans decreased, mainly due to paydowns in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio and the transfer of loans to loans held for sale [8].\n\nExamining the image data, image4 confirms the increase in total loans, with commercial loans rising from $478,417 million to $513,120 million and consumer loans decreasing from $409,220 million to $382,274 million. This shift suggests a strategic focus on commercial lending, possibly capitalizing on business recovery post-pandemic.\n\nOn the deposit side, total deposits increased by 6% from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million [3][7][10]. However, there was a notable decline in time deposits and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, down 41% and 44% respectively [3][10]. Image3 illustrates this trend, showing a significant reduction in time deposits from $49,775 million to $29,461 million and non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits from $35,157 million to $19,783 million. This reduction aligns with actions taken to manage under the asset cap, such as decreasing brokered CDs and non-U.S. deposits [10].\n\nThe entity's strategy appears to involve managing liquidity and risk by reducing uninsured deposits and focusing on core deposits like noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which increased by 13% [3][10]. This approach may aim to improve capital efficiency and reduce reliance on volatile funding sources.

Mars' net income, however, increased slightly from $154 million in 2018 to $114 million in 2020, a decrease of $40 million. \n\nSeveral factors might have influenced these changes. The text mentions the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market conditions, which could have affected revenues and expenses for both entities [1]. Additionally, changes in operating expenses could have played a role. For instance, Amberjack's total operating expenses increased from $47 million in 2018 to an unspecified amount in 2020, while Mars' expenses rose from $87 million in 2018 to an unspecified amount in 2020.

This measure, defined as net income before noncontrolling interests, taxes, interest, depreciation, and amortization, among other items [3], is crucial for evaluating operational strength and performance [4]. \n\nIn the Cable Communications segment, capital expenditures increased due to investments in scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partially offset by reduced spending on customer premise equipment [5]. This strategic focus on infrastructure likely supported long-term growth but may have impacted short-term Adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in operating costs and expenses in 2021, excluding COVID-19 related costs, contributed positively to Adjusted EBITDA [7]. However, increased expenses in programming and technical support in 2021 partially offset these gains [11].\n\nThe Media segment saw revenue increases in 2021, particularly in advertising, driven by market recovery post-COVID-19 [8][12]. However, programming and production costs rose, affecting Adjusted EBITDA [11]. The Theme Parks segment benefited from a market recovery but faced increased operating costs due to the delayed start of sporting events [6][10].

The adjusted revenue for GBM increased, primarily driven by a strong performance in Global Markets, which offset the impact of lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments [1]. This increase was supported by a decrease in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR), reflecting effective risk management [1]. The Global Markets segment saw a significant rise in revenue, with FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) revenue increasing by 33% to $6,278 million, driven by substantial growth in Foreign Exchange and Credit [image1]. Equities revenue also rose slightly, while Securities Services experienced a decline [image1]. Global Banking, however, faced a 2% decrease in revenue due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income, though capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending grew [7].\n\nFor the Corporate Centre, the financial performance varied. The table in image2 shows that net operating income increased by 3% to $15,303 million in 2020, while operating expenses decreased by 3% to $9,264 million, contributing to a slight decline in profit before tax by 7% to $4,830 million [image2]. The change in expected credit losses and other impairment charges surged to $(1,209) million, reflecting heightened provisions due to economic uncertainties [image2]. Image4 further highlights improvements in the Corporate Centre, with net operating income improving by 60% to $(262) million, driven by reductions in expected credit losses and operating expenses [image4].\n\nOverall, the key financial performance measures indicate that while Global Markets thrived, the Corporate Centre faced challenges in managing credit losses, yet still showed operational efficiency improvements.

This decline was largely attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, reflecting the impact of declining short-term interest rates over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, which persisted into 2021 [12]. The company maintained substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, but the low interest rates resulted in significantly lower interest income [12]. \n\nExamining the asset allocations, the table in image6 shows that cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million at the end of 2020 to $90,688 million at the end of 2021. This increase in cash holdings aligns with the strategy of prioritizing safety over yield, as noted in the text [12]. However, the decrease in fixed maturity securities from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 suggests a reduction in investments that might have contributed to lower interest income. Despite the decline in interest income, dividend income increased slightly by 3.5% to $5,060 million in 2021 from $4,890 million in 2020, partially offsetting the drop in interest income [7]. The overall pre-tax net investment income decreased by 5.0% to $5,649 million in 2021, reflecting the combined effects of these changes [7].\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income was mainly due to lower interest rates affecting short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, while the asset allocation showed an increase in cash holdings and a decrease in fixed maturity securities, reflecting the company's focus on liquidity and safety. \n\n![The table shows a decrease in fixed maturity securities and an increase in cash holdings between 2020 and 2021](image6)"}

In the Middle East & Africa, the total market shipment volume decreased by 13.3%, with cigarettes down 12.3% and heated tobacco units plummeting by 61.5% [6][7][image6]. This decline was largely due to lower total market demand and specific factors like distributor inventory movements and adult smoker down-trading following price increases in Turkey [7]. The net revenues in this region, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 21.7%, primarily driven by lower cigarette, heated tobacco unit, and IQOS device volumes in PMI Duty Free, as well as reduced cigarette sales in South Africa and Turkey [3]. A favorable pricing variance, especially in the GCC and North Africa, partially offset these declines [3].\n\nIn Latin America & Canada, net revenues, excluding currency, decreased by 15.5% due to lower cigarette volumes in Argentina and Mexico, though Brazil showed some resilience [10]. Operating income, excluding currency, fell by 35.2%, mainly from unfavorable volume/mix and lower distribution fees, but was partly offset by pricing improvements and cost reductions [11][image1]. The financial summary for this region shows a total net revenue decline of 23.6%, with a significant volume/mix impact of $(1,001) million, while operating income dropped by 39.1% [image1].\n\nSouth & Southeast Asia experienced a 17.2% decrease in total shipment volume, with cigarettes down 17.2% and heated tobacco units not available for comparison [image5].

This growth was primarily due to higher intermodal shipments, both international and domestic, fueled by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments, and e-commerce activity. The volume increase in consumer products reflects a recovery from the pandemic's impact, which had previously led to lower volumes in 2020 [5].\n\nFor industrial products, operating revenues increased by 5.0% in 2021 to $5.3 billion from 2020 [6]. This was supported by a 5.4% rise in volumes, mainly attributed to improvements in the U.S. industrial economy, particularly in the construction and building sectors. However, this was partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector. The overall volume increase indicates a rebound in industrial activity post-pandemic disruptions.\n\nThe data from image6 further illustrates these trends, showing a 7.7% increase in consumer products volumes from 5,266 to 5,673 cars/units and a 5.4% increase in industrial products volumes from 1,622 to 1,709 cars/units between 2020 and 2021.

According to the text, unallocated revenues in fiscal 2019 were primarily from licensing revenues resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers, totaling $4,723 million [5]. By 2020, these revenues decreased to $1,841 million, largely due to licensing revenues from Huawei and new global patent license agreements [5]. In 2021, unallocated revenues further declined to $54 million, indicating a substantial reduction in non-segmented revenue sources [5]. This trend suggests a shift towards more segmented revenue recognition, aligning with the company's operational adjustments and strategic focus.\n\nIn terms of unallocated expenses, the data shows a notable increase in unallocated research and development expenses from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021 [6]. This rise could be attributed to increased investment in R&D activities not directly tied to specific segments, possibly linked to the acquisition of NUVIA and its associated costs. Additionally, unallocated selling, general, and administrative expenses rose from $413 million in 2019 to $538 million in 2021, reflecting ongoing overhead costs not allocated to specific segments [6].\n\nComparing these changes to the net assets acquired during the NUVIA acquisition, the company paid $1.1 billion for NUVIA, with net assets acquired amounting to $1,264 million, including $247 million for in-process research and development (IPR&D) and $885 million for goodwill [4][12][image4]. The acquisition's impact on unallocated expenses is evident in the increased R&D expenses, as the company integrates NUVIA's technology and workforce. The IPR&D value, expected to be completed by fiscal 2023, aligns with the future revenue recognition patterns mentioned in text [1], where remaining performance obligations are expected to be recognized over the next five years.\n\n![Financial data across different regions for 2019, 2020, and 2021](image1) illustrates the regional revenue distribution, showing a significant increase in total revenues from 2019 to 2021, which may partially offset the decline in"}

In terms of free cash flow, the company reported a significant increase. According to the cash flow data, net cash provided by operating activities rose from $9.6 billion in 2019 to $10.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower tax payments and pension contributions [7]. This increase in operating cash flow contributed to a rise in free cash flow, which grew by 15% to $6.4 billion in 2020 from $5.6 billion in 2019, as shown in the table in image6. The company uses free cash flow for acquisitions and shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases [5]. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, PepsiCo maintained its commitment to returning cash to shareholders, with dividends and share repurchases totaling approximately $5.9 billion [6].\n\nRegarding contractual commitments, image2 outlines the company's obligations, highlighting long-term debt, operating leases, and other commitments. The table shows that long-term debt obligations total $40.3 billion, with significant payments due from 2022 onwards, particularly in 2026 and beyond. Additionally, the one-time mandatory transition tax under the TCJ Act amounts to $3.2 billion, spread out until 2026.

According to the text, the reported profit before tax decreased by 34% to $8.8 billion, while adjusted profit before tax fell by 45% to $12.1 billion [7]. This decline was primarily due to higher expected credit losses (ECL) and other credit impairment charges, which increased by $6.1 billion to $8.8 billion, reflecting the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy [7][11][12]. Additionally, reported revenue decreased by 10% to $50.4 billion, partly offset by higher revenue in Global Markets [7].\n\nThe net operating income also saw a reduction, with adjusted operating expenses decreasing by $0.3 billion or 3%, mainly from cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay [6]. However, these savings were not enough to counteract the significant rise in ECL and the overall revenue drop. The text highlights that the Global Markets segment performed strongly, with revenue growth of 27% driven by increased volatility and client activity, particularly in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) and Equities [3][9]. Despite this, other areas like Global Banking faced challenges, with revenue decreasing by 2% due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income [1][3].\n\nThe image data further supports these trends. Image2 shows that the net operating income increased slightly from 2019 to 2020, but the significant rise in expected credit losses and other impairment charges (over 200% increase) heavily impacted the profit before tax, which decreased by 7% [image2].

According to the text, ExxonMobil's share of equity decreased by $34.5 billion to $157.2 billion in 2020 [10]. This reduction was primarily due to losses amounting to $22.4 billion and distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends totaling $14.9 billion [10]. Additionally, foreign exchange translation effects of $1.8 billion for the weaker U.S. dollar increased equity, while a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves reduced it [10]. \n\nThe image of the shareholders' equity table (image7) provides a structured view of these changes, showing the components of equity such as common stock, earnings reinvested, accumulated other comprehensive income, and common stock held in treasury. The table outlines the opening and closing balances for each year, highlighting the impact of net income/loss, dividends, and other comprehensive income on the equity. Specifically, the decrease in total equity is evident from the closing balance figures, which dropped from $191.7 billion in 2019 to $157.2 billion in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the financial data in image5 shows a comparison of total figures for 2020 and 2019, with the total equity summing up to $332,750 million in 2020 and $362,597 million in 2019, confirming the overall decline. The table in image4, which details cash flows, also supports this by showing significant net losses in operating activities in 2020, contributing to the reduced equity.\n\nIn summary, the key factors contributing to the decrease in total equity from 2019 to 2020 were substantial losses and dividend payments, partially offset by foreign exchange effects and changes in postretirement benefits. \n\n![The table shows a decrease in total equity from 2019 to 2020](image5)"}

Revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion in 2021, with Adjusted EBITDA rising 6.0% to $5.7 billion [10]. This growth was driven by various factors, including the recovery from COVID-19 impacts, increased sales of Sky Glass televisions, and the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics [1][6]. However, expenses also rose due to investments in content and strategic initiatives, partially offsetting the revenue gains [3].\n\nIn terms of customer relationships, the number of total customer relationships slightly decreased from 23,280 thousand in 2019 to 23,027 thousand in 2021, with a net loss of 198 thousand in 2021 [image5]. Despite this decline, average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased by 8.7% from 2020 to 2021, reflecting rate adjustments and changes in service offerings [image8][5]. This increase in revenue per customer helped offset the decline in the number of customer relationships.\n\nThe Media segment saw a 20.3% revenue increase to $22.8 billion, driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue, though Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 18.0% due to costs associated with Peacock and other investments [6]. The Studios segment benefited from a return to full production capacity, with revenue up 16.2% to $9.4 billion [6]. Theme Parks revenue surged 141.2% to $5.1 billion as parks reopened post-COVID, contributing positively to financial performance [6].\n\nHowever, challenges persisted, such as reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy, which affected revenue and customer relationships [11]. Despite these challenges, overall revenue trends and strategic investments in content and technology, like Peacock and Sky Glass, supported NBCUniversal's financial growth during this period.\n\nIn summary, while customer relationships faced slight declines, revenue growth from strategic investments and market recovery drove NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2019 to 2021."}

According to the data, the amortization expense was $360 million in 2020, decreased to $318 million in 2021, and further reduced to $312 million in 2022 [image7]. This decline indicates a reduction in the amortization of intangible assets, which could be due to the completion of the useful life of certain assets or a decrease in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets with determinable lives.\n\nLooking ahead, the estimated amortization expense is projected to continue decreasing over the next five years. The table in image8 outlines the expected amortization expenses as follows: $316 million in 2023, $305 million in 2024, $288 million in 2025, $268 million in 2026, and $258 million in 2027. This trend suggests that the company anticipates a gradual reduction in amortization expenses, likely reflecting the continued amortization of existing intangible assets and possibly the completion of their useful lives.\n\nThe decrease in amortization expenses could impact the company's financial statements by reducing the expense recognized each year, potentially improving net income. However, it also indicates that the company may need to invest in new intangible assets to maintain or grow its asset base in the future.

Despite this, the company's sales volume and turnover increased significantly, with cigarette sales rising by 19.64% to 10593 million cigarettes and turnover reaching Rs. 1077 crore [7]. The company also saw a substantial increase in export earnings, with the FOB value of exports rising to Rs. 52.47 crore from Rs. 10.99 crore in the previous year, driven by a significant increase in cigarette exports to Rs. 19.2 crore [9]. This growth in exports highlights the company's ability to capitalize on international markets.\n\nHowever, the potential for tobacco export earnings is much higher. ![India could increase its export earnings sevenfold with just a 5% share of the global tobacco trade](image3) suggests that India's current export earnings of Rs. 930 crore could potentially reach Rs. 7000 crore, indicating a vast untapped market. This potential is further emphasized by the company's current global market share of only 0.7% of the USD 30 billion annual global tobacco trade. \n\nThe company's strategy should focus on leveraging its existing export momentum to tap into this potential. By enhancing its market presence and exploring new international markets, the company could significantly boost its revenue. Additionally, the company's efforts in developing innovative products and restructuring its tea business to achieve positive cash flows [5] demonstrate its adaptability and strategic focus on profitability. The launch of new brands and the increase in market share to over 11% [10] also indicate a strong domestic position, which can be complemented by aggressive export strategies. \n\nIn summary, while the 2002-2003 financial results reflect challenges domestically, the substantial export growth and the immense potential in global markets suggest that expanding export operations could be a key strategic direction for the company to enhance its financial performance."}

This growth reflects the Firm's continued investment in deferred compensation programs, which are linked to performance and market conditions [2]. The total recognized compensation expense also rose significantly over the same period, from $1,126 million in 2018 to $1,878 million in 2019, and then to $2,119 million in 2020.

According to text quote [5], net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates. This decline is further supported by image2, which shows a significant overall net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, while interest expense decreased by $5,627 million over the same period. This indicates that the decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expense, leading to a substantial reduction in net interest income.\n\nIn contrast, from 2018 to 2019, image2 shows an increase in total interest income of $4,452 million and an increase in interest expense of $714 million. This suggests that the net interest income improved during this period, as the increase in interest income was greater than the increase in interest expense. The organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in image1, with its segments like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets, plays a crucial role in these financial dynamics. For instance, the Consumer Banking segment, which includes deposits and consumer lending, saw a decrease in net interest income due to lower rates, as highlighted in text quote [9]. Image5 further illustrates this by showing a decline in net interest income for both deposits and consumer lending within Consumer Banking from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThe Global Markets segment, which includes Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets, and Equity Markets, might have been affected differently, as these areas are sensitive to interest rate changes and market conditions. The overall downturn in net interest income from 2019 to 2020 reflects the broader economic impact of COVID-19, as mentioned in text quote [2], which led to lower interest rates and increased credit losses.

This decrease was primarily driven by a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a 44.4% reduction [4]. The decline in interest income was attributed to lower short-term interest rates and reduced income from fixed maturity securities [4]. However, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, a 3.5% rise, partially offsetting the decline in interest income [5].\n\nThe asset composition of the insurance business also saw notable changes. The total invested assets increased from $363,117 million at the end of 2020 to $446,277 million at the end of 2021, a 22.9% increase [3]. This growth was largely due to a substantial rise in equity securities, which grew from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, a 24.3% increase [3]. Conversely, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, a 19.4% decline [3].

The significant growth in equity securities could enhance potential long-term returns but also increases exposure to market volatility, as evidenced by the substantial unrealized gains in equity securities [7]. The decline in fixed maturity securities aligns with the reduced interest income, indicating a strategic reallocation away from fixed-income assets.

According to the text, the interest rate risks associated with these contracts are no longer significant due to their short duration as of December 31, 2021 [8]. However, the fair values of these contracts are still affected by changes in interest rates, as well as other factors like the creditworthiness of the issuer and market conditions. The image7 data illustrates this sensitivity: for December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of equity index put option contracts from $99 million to $94 million, while a 300 basis point increase would reduce it to $84 million. This shows that higher interest rates generally lead to a decrease in the fair value of these contracts, reflecting the inverse relationship between interest rates and the present value of future liabilities.\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt, the effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021 are significant.

In 2021, there were pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion, compared to pre-tax losses of $1.0 billion in 2020. This shift is also reflected in image1, which shows that non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings was $955 million in 2021, a stark contrast to a loss of $764 million in 2020. This indicates that favorable currency exchange rates in 2021 positively impacted net earnings, while unfavorable rates in 2020 led to losses.\n\nIn summary, higher interest rates decrease the fair value of equity index put option contracts, and the impact of non-U.S. denominated debt on net earnings improved significantly from 2020 to 2021 due to favorable currency exchange rates.\n\n![Interest rate impact on equity index put option contracts](image7)  \n![Non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings](image1)"}

This resulted in a substantial decrease from the 7.2 percent effective tax rate in 2019 [7].

In 2019, the U.S. downstream reported earnings of $1,559 million [1]. However, in 2020, there was a loss of $571 million, which was a stark contrast to the previous year [1]. By 2021, the earnings rebounded to $2,389 million, marking a substantial increase [1]. This recovery was primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales, which contributed $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and increased sales volumes of $470 million [4]. Despite these positive factors, higher operating expenses of $150 million partially offset the gains [4]. Additionally, the easing of travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 14 percent increase in total refined product sales, further boosting earnings [5].\n\nIn contrast, the international downstream sector experienced a decline in earnings over the same period. In 2019, international downstream earned $922 million [8]. By 2020, this figure dropped to $618 million, and in 2021, it further decreased to $525 million [8]. The decrease in 2021 was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million [11]. However, a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million between periods partially mitigated these losses [11].\n\n![Earnings in millions of dollars for U.S. downstream from 2019 to 2021](image1)\n![Earnings in millions of dollars for international downstream from 2019 to 2021](image8)\n\nIn summary, the U.S. downstream sector's earnings improved significantly from 2019 to 2021 due to higher margins, increased sales volumes, and contributions from CPChem, while the international downstream sector faced earnings declines primarily due to lower margins and higher expenses, despite positive foreign currency effects."}

For uncertain tax positions, the balance decreased significantly from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020. This reduction was primarily due to a $249 million tax benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, as well as other reductions and expirations of the statute of limitations [11]. The interest payable also decreased from $44 million in 2019 to $8 million in 2020, reflecting the resolution of some tax positions [image8].\n\nRegarding fair value assets and liabilities, the total assets measured at fair value saw a decrease in certain categories. For instance, money market funds dropped from $1,213 million in 2019 to $886 million in 2020, and mutual funds decreased from $272 million to $18 million. However, U.S. government agency and treasury securities increased from $2,338 million to $4,394 million, indicating a shift in investment strategy [image3].

Despite this, Cloud & Cognitive Software experienced a 12.4% decrease in pre-tax income year-over-year, while Global Business Services saw a slight increase of 1.3% [image4][image6].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these financial results. For Cloud & Cognitive Software, the decline in pre-tax income was driven by the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, ongoing investments in strategic areas, and lower income from IP partnership agreements [7]. Additionally, the gross profit margin decrease of 1.0 percentage points was attributed to these acquisition-related adjustments [image4].

The drop in Argentina was due to adult smokers switching to ultra-low-price brands and retail out-of-stock issues, while Colombia and Mexico faced lower total market demand and market share losses [12].

The working capital requirements were influenced by COVID-19-related inventory build-ups and excise tax timing [8]. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020, mainly due to reduced capital expenditures and the RBH deconsolidation impact [11]. \n\nThe financial performance in Latin America & Canada also showed a significant increase in operating income, up by 100% from 2019 to 2020, despite a 22.9% decrease in net revenues [5].

Small Business period-end loan balances were also impacted by a decline in PPP loans. This trend is supported by image2, which provides detailed balance sheet data showing declines in various loan categories from 2020 to 2021, such as Home Lending and Small Business loans. For example, Home Lending loans decreased by 10% from 2020 to 2021, and Small Business loans decreased by 14% over the same period.\n\nConversely, total deposits increased due to higher liquidity and savings from government stimulus programs and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic [11].

Additionally, net card fees grew consistently throughout 2021, up 11 percent year-over-year, reflecting new card acquisitions and high retention rates [2]. However, net interest income declined by 3 percent due to higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [2]. This decline is further supported by image7, which shows a decrease in average Card Member loans from 2019 to 2021 in both U.S. and international segments, leading to lower net interest income and adjusted net interest income over the period. The table in image7 highlights that while the U.S. segment consistently had higher amounts, both segments saw a reduction in average loans, affecting the net interest yield on average Card Member loans.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income was partially offset by a 21 percent increase in discount revenue, driven by commercial billed business recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic [9]. Despite the decline in net interest income, total revenues net of interest expense increased by 17 percent year-over-year, with double-digit growth in non-interest revenue lines [2]. This growth is evident in image2, which shows a 24 percent increase in non-interest revenues from 2020 to 2021, contributing to a 14 percent rise in total revenues net of interest expense. Furthermore, provisions for credit losses decreased, resulting in a net benefit due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, as indicated in text [4] and image2, where provisions for credit losses turned negative in 2021, reflecting reserve releases.\n\nThe company maintained strong financial performance, achieving record Card Member spending and returning $9 billion to shareholders [8]. However, the reduction in net interest income and average loans suggests a shift in revenue focus towards non-interest sources, such as fees and commissions, which were bolstered by higher travel-related revenues [2]. This strategic shift, combined with improved credit quality, helped mitigate the impact of declining interest income, as seen in the net benefit from credit loss provisions in image2 and image4.\n\nIn summary, while average Card Member loans and net interest income decreased from 2019 to 2021, the company's financial performance remained robust due"}

However, the dividend payout of €856 million in 2021 also reduced unappropriated net income, though this was offset by the overall net income increase [4].\n\nOn the liabilities side, the company's net debt (including pensions) surged from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021, reflecting a substantial increase in financial obligations. This was largely due to the acquisition of Varian, which required significant financing. The table in image1 highlights that liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities rose dramatically from €2,982 million in 2020 to €11,708 million in 2021, indicating increased borrowing to support the acquisition. Furthermore, long-term financial debt increased from €314 million to €457 million, and short-term financial debt rose from €167 million to €225 million [image1].\n\nThe increase in current liabilities is also evident, with remaining current liabilities growing from €1,936 million in 2020 to €3,104 million in 2021. This includes higher other current financial liabilities (€263 million in 2021 vs. €93 million in 2020) and current provisions (€356 million in 2021 vs. €270 million in 2020) [image2].

This issuance was used to redeem $850 million of 4.900% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series C, and $750 million of 5.200% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series B [10]. The net cash used in financing activities in 2021 was primarily driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends, and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares [1]. \n\nThe cash flows from financing activities in 2021 show a net cash used of $14,933 million, reflecting the significant outflows from share repurchases and debt repayments, but also including the inflows from the issuance of preferred shares [image3]. The issuance of preferred shares in 2021 contributed to the financing activities by providing cash, which offset some of the outflows. \n\nIn terms of shareholders' equity, the issuance of preferred shares increased the preferred shares component, while the redemption reduced it. As of December 31, 2021, the number of preferred shares issued and outstanding was 1,600 shares, consistent with the previous year [image4]. The total shareholders' equity decreased from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, partly due to the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) [image4]. The issuance and redemption activities affected the preferred shares balance, but the overall impact on equity was moderated by other factors such as retained earnings and comprehensive income adjustments.\n\nIn 2020, the company also engaged in similar activities, with the issuance and redemption of preferred shares impacting the cash flows and equity. The issuance of preferred shares in 2020 would have provided cash inflows, while redemptions would have led to cash outflows, as seen in the financing activities section for that year [image3].

According to the financial statement in image1, the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity are detailed for both years. The table highlights the components of current and non-current assets, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, and long-term assets. While the exact figures for total assets are not specified in the description, the structure indicates a comprehensive overview of asset changes, which can be analyzed for trends.\n\nFor cash flow from operating activities, text quote [1] states that net cash provided by operating activities increased to $7.18 billion in 2021 from $4.05 billion in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher profit adjusted for non-cash items, such as higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for these compensations. However, increased working capital requirements, particularly changes in inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset these gains. The favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses helped mitigate some of the negative impacts on cash flow.\n\nImage2 provides a detailed breakdown of cash flow activities, showing net cash provided by operating activities for the consolidated segment. This aligns with the text, confirming the significant rise in operating cash flow. The table also outlines investing and financing activities, which, while not directly related to the question, provide context for overall cash management.\n\nThe implications of these changes suggest improved operational efficiency and profitability, as evidenced by higher cash generation from operations. This could enhance the company's ability to fund its operations, invest in growth opportunities, and maintain liquidity. However, the increased working capital requirements indicate potential challenges in managing inventory and receivables, which might necessitate closer monitoring to ensure sustained cash flow health.\n\nIn summary, the consolidated segment experienced a substantial increase in both total assets and operating cash flow from 2020 to 2021, reflecting improved operational performance and profitability, with potential implications for enhanced liquidity and investment capacity, though working capital management remains a consideration.\n\n![Financial statement showing assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for 2021 and 2020](image1)\n![Summary of cash flow information for 2021 and 2020](image2)"}

According to the financial statements, total assets decreased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, a reduction of $2,819 million. This decline is primarily attributed to a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $32,965 million to $22,028 million, and a reduction in investment securities from $21,631 million to $2,591 million. Additionally, there was a decrease in other assets from $17,679 million to $17,244 million. These reductions were partially offset by increases in card member loans and receivables, which rose from $68,029 million to $85,257 million and from $43,434 million to $53,581 million, respectively [image1].\n\nOn the liabilities side, total liabilities decreased from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021, a decrease of $2,012 million. This reduction was mainly due to a decline in long-term debt from $42,952 million to $38,675 million and a decrease in other liabilities from $27,234 million to $30,497 million. However, customer deposits slightly decreased from $86,875 million to $84,382 million, and accounts payable increased from $9,444 million to $10,574 million [image1].\n\nThese changes in assets and liabilities are closely tied to the entity's comprehensive income and cash flows. The comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, which includes net income of $8,060 million and other comprehensive loss of $50 million. The other comprehensive loss primarily resulted from foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized debt securities losses, which align with the decrease in investment securities and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash flows [image2].

The net operating income for WPB decreased by 12% from 2019 to 2020, reflecting a challenging year marked by reduced customer activity and increased credit risk [10].

However, CMB supported customers' liquidity needs and grew deposit balances, indicating some resilience. The specific figures for CMB's net operating income and profit before tax are not directly provided in the text quotes, but the overall adjusted profit before tax for the entire bank was £1.9 billion, down 74% from 2019, suggesting that both segments contributed to this decline [5]. \n\nImage7 provides a detailed breakdown of adjusted revenue across different segments, showing that Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM) within CMB saw a 30% revenue decrease due to lower interest rates, while Retail Banking and Wealth Management (now part of WPB) also experienced declines in net interest and non-interest income [3, 9].

However, heated tobacco unit shipments surged by 57.9%, driven by higher market share and significant growth in countries like Germany, Italy, and Poland [8]. This shift is evident in the market share data, where brands like HEETS saw a substantial increase from 2.5% to 4.2%, offsetting declines in traditional cigarette brands like Marlboro and L&M [image2].\n\nIn Eastern Europe, the total shipment volume remained relatively stable with a slight increase of 0.2%, despite a 7.1% drop in cigarette shipments [image8]. This stability was largely due to a 55.3% rise in heated tobacco unit shipments, notably in Russia and Ukraine, which compensated for the decline in cigarette sales [11].

This change can be broken down as follows:\n\n- **2018 to 2019**: The gross unrecognized tax benefits rose from $1,056 million to $1,423 million. This increase was primarily due to gross increases from current year tax positions ($512 million) and prior year tax positions ($2 million), partially offset by gross decreases from prior year tax positions ($96 million), settlements ($46 million), and statute of limitations lapses ($5 million) [image4].\n\n- **2019 to 2020**: The gross unrecognized tax benefits further increased to $1,829 million.

The loss of asset-based fees from WFAM, as mentioned in text [5], directly affected noninterest income. The company's noninterest income increased overall in 2021 due to gains from the sales, but the absence of fees from WFAM's AUM would have reduced this income stream [4].

Meanwhile, interest expense also decreased, particularly in loans and federal funds purchased, by $14,120 million. However, the decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expense, leading to a net decrease in net interest income. \n\nAdditionally, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual partially offset the impact of lower rates [6]. The text also mentions that higher deposit growth invested in long-term securities increased asset sensitivity, affecting the balance sheet's response to interest rate changes [2]. This sensitivity, combined with the reduced income from lower rates, contributed to the overall decline in net interest spread.\n\nIn summary, the main contributing factors to the change in net interest spread were the reduction in interest rates, which disproportionately affected interest income, and the strategic deployment of deposits into securities, which influenced asset sensitivity and income generation. The net result was a narrower net interest spread due to the outpacing decrease in interest income compared to interest expense."}

However, in 2020, the total dividends declared were $15,866,000, with a single rate of 15.0 cents per qualifying ordinary share [5][image5]. This represents a decrease in the total dividend amount from $33,781,000 in 2019 to $15,866,000 in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the business, which led to a deferral and reduction in the franking percentage of the interim dividend [4][10]. The interim dividend of 15.0 cents per share, initially announced for payment in April 2020, was deferred to September 2020, and the franking percentage was reduced to 50% due to lower tax payments during the financial year [4][10].

According to the data, the gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million at the end of 2019 to $1,829 million at the end of 2020. This increase was primarily due to current year tax positions adding $416 million and prior year tax positions adding $120 million, partially offset by decreases from prior year tax positions of $130 million. The company anticipates a decrease in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [6], which suggests potential future reductions in tax liabilities.\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company repurchased 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million, compared to 22 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million. The decrease in the number of shares repurchased and the higher average price per share in 2020 indicate a reduction in the scale of repurchases, possibly reflecting strategic shifts or market conditions [7]. The Board authorized shares remaining for repurchase were 58 million as of December 31, 2020, down from 72 million in 2019, indicating ongoing utilization of the repurchase program [11].\n\nThese changes suggest that while the company maintained its commitment to share repurchases, the scale and cost per share increased, potentially impacting cash reserves.

This trend is supported by image2, which shows substantial increases across various applications, such as Oil and Gas (21% increase) and Industrial (23% increase), reflecting heightened demand. Additionally, image8 highlights that sales volume contributed $2,049 million to the overall sales and revenue increase, underscoring its substantial impact.\n\nOperating profit also improved, rising from $1.380 billion in Q4 2020 to $1.611 billion in Q4 2021, a 17% increase [12]. This growth was driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, despite increased manufacturing and SG&A/R&D expenses. Image4 illustrates that sales volume contributed $687 million to the operating profit increase, while price realization added $507 million. However, unfavorable manufacturing costs, primarily due to higher labor and freight expenses [1], reduced profitability. Despite these costs, the net restructuring income from the sale of a facility helped offset some expenses, contributing to the overall profit margin improvement.\n\nRegional sales also played a role, with North America and EAME experiencing significant growth due to higher end-user demand and inventory changes [2][4]. For instance, North America sales increased 29% [2], and EAME sales rose 24% [4], both influenced by improved dealer inventory management and increased demand.

The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis also decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent. This decline is reflected in the detailed financial data provided in image1, which shows net interest income for Deposits at $13,739 million in 2020, down from $16,904 million in 2019, and for Consumer Lending at $10,959 million in 2020, down from $11,254 million in 2019.

According to the text, cash dividends are part of the financing activities that affect cash flow. In 2021, Chevron paid cash dividends, which would reduce its cash and cash equivalents, impacting its cash flow from financing activities. The specific amount of cash dividends paid can be found in the financial statements, but the text does not provide the exact figure. However, dividends reduce retained earnings, which is a component of stockholders' equity. This reduction in retained earnings directly affects the equity structure by decreasing the total equity attributable to Chevron Corporation's stockholders.\n\n**Treasury Stock Transactions:**\nTreasury stock transactions involve the repurchase or issuance of a company's own shares. These transactions affect both the equity structure and cash flow. When a company repurchases its shares, it reduces the number of outstanding shares and decreases cash, impacting the cash flow from financing activities. Conversely, issuing treasury shares would increase cash. The text mentions that treasury stock is accounted for at cost, and changes in treasury stock are reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet. Image5 provides detailed information on treasury stock activity, showing movements in treasury shares and their impact on outstanding shares. In 2021, Chevron likely repurchased shares, as indicated by the increase in treasury stock at cost, which would have reduced cash and decreased stockholders' equity.\n\n**Impact on Equity Structure:**\n- **Cash Dividends:** Reduce retained earnings, thereby decreasing total stockholders' equity.\n- **Treasury Stock Transactions:** Repurchasing shares reduces the number of outstanding shares and decreases stockholders' equity (treasury stock is a contra-equity account).\n\n**Impact on Cash Flow:**\n- **Cash Dividends:** Outflow in financing activities, reducing net cash provided by (or used for) financing activities.\n- **Treasury Stock Transactions:** Outflow in financing activities if shares are repurchased, further reducing net cash provided by (or used for) financing activities.\n\n**Evidence from Images:**\n- **Image5** shows changes in treasury stock and common stock share activity, indicating the impact on equity components and outstanding shares.\n- **Image6** provides a breakdown of cash flow activities, including financing activities where cash dividends and treasury stock transactions are recorded."}

This is highlighted in the pie chart where the red segment shows WPB's contribution [![WPB's contribution to adjusted profit before tax is 34%](image3)]. The financial performance data reveals a significant decline in overall profitability for HSBC in 2020, with adjusted profit before tax falling by 45% to $12.1 billion compared to 2019 [1][9]. This decline was largely due to lower revenue and higher expected credit loss (ECL) charges, which were directly linked to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic [9]. \n\nThe detailed financial data shows that net operating income decreased by $3,552 million (14%) from 2019 to 2020, and the change in expected credit losses and charges increased significantly by $1,507 million (112%) [![Financial data showing a decrease in net operating income and increase in ECL charges](image1)]. Despite these challenges, WPB's performance was relatively resilient, with its adjusted profit before tax accounting for more than 146% of the Group's total profits, underscoring its strategic importance [8].

The company's growth strategy focuses on opening new stores in both Australia and overseas, with a key driver being the continued international roll-out of company-owned stores and supporting franchised stores in various regions [3]. This strategy is evident in the steady increase in the total number of stores, which grew from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, as shown in the table in image8. The expansion into new territories, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, France, the USA, and the Middle East, among others, has been a critical component of this growth. \n\nLovisa has successfully operated profitably in these international territories, establishing a portfolio of company-owned stores and franchised stores in multiple countries. The company's ability to identify and secure quality retail store sites in high pedestrian traffic areas, typically in AA, A, or B grade shopping centers, has facilitated quick and cost-effective store roll-outs [4]. This approach, combined with a refined global store model featuring a target 50 square meter floor space and a homogenized layout, has allowed Lovisa to efficiently expand its presence. \n\nThe company's strategy also involves exploring new markets through pilot programs and advising shareholders upon successful completion, ensuring opportunities are capitalized on and scale is achieved [3]. This proactive approach to market entry, as described in text quote [11], has enabled Lovisa to remain nimble and opportunistic, accelerating plans to enter new markets when opportunities arise. The table in image2 outlines the international expansion strategy, highlighting the focus on leveraging existing territories, capitalizing on large international markets, and targeting one new trial territory annually, which aligns with the observed growth in store counts.\n\nFurthermore, Lovisa's focus on enhancing existing store performance by optimizing the store network and closing underperforming locations has contributed to the overall increase in store count in new territories [12]. The global rollout of piercing services into stores during FY20 aimed to enhance customer loyalty, further supporting the expansion strategy. \n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy, characterized by strategic market entry, efficient store roll-outs, and performance optimization, has led to a significant increase in store counts across new territories from 2016 to 2020, as evidenced by the data in image8. \n\n"}

Under AASB 16, the Group adopted a single, on-balance sheet accounting model for lessees, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for its lease obligations [4]. This change required the Group to recognize lease liabilities at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 July 2019 [9]. The initial recognition of lease liabilities on the balance sheet led to a significant increase in liabilities, as seen in the financial data for 2020. \n\n![The table shows the financial impact of AASB 16 on lease liabilities, with a balance of $167,154 thousand at 28 June 2020](image1) highlights the transition effects, where the balance at 1 July 2019 was $0, and after recognizing the lease liability on initial application, it adjusted to $143,621 thousand. Additions during the period and re-measurements further increased the liability, resulting in a total lease liability of $167,154 thousand by 28 June 2020. This reflects the capitalization of lease obligations that were previously off-balance sheet under the old accounting standards.\n\nAdditionally, the Group no longer recognized provisions for operating leases deemed onerous, as noted in ![The table explains the change in accounting treatment for operating leases, moving from provisions to lease liabilities](image2). Instead, payments under these leases are now accounted for within the lease liability, aligning with the new standard's requirements. This change simplified the accounting for onerous leases by eliminating the need for provisions based on sub-lease arrangements and focusing on the lease liability itself.\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, the Group calculated obligations using expected future increases in wage and salary rates, including related on-costs, and discounted them using high-quality Australian corporate bond rates [10]. The consolidated employee benefit liabilities increased slightly from $4,054 thousand in 2019 to $4,092 thousand in 2020, as shown in ![The table shows employee benefit liabilities, with a slight increase from 2019 to 2020](image3).

This goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities, as mentioned in text [1] and [6]. Additionally, the allocation included developed technology and customer relationships, with specific fair values and useful lives detailed in image7, where developed technology was valued at $215 million with a 4-year useful life, and customer relationships at $61 million with an 8-year useful life. The total net assets acquired for ClickSoftware were $134 million, as shown in image1.\n\nIn contrast, the Salesforce.org acquisition involved a one-time cash payment of $300 million to the Foundation, as stated in text [5]. The financial results of Salesforce.org contributed approximately $228 million in total revenues in fiscal 2020, but the transaction also resulted in a non-cash charge of $166 million due to the favorable terms of the reseller agreement, as noted in text [4]. The net assets acquired for Salesforce.org are not explicitly detailed in the provided images, but the financial impact is reflected in the pretax loss of $(503) shown in image2, which contrasts with the positive total revenues of $689.\n\nA similarity between the two acquisitions is the inclusion of goodwill, though the amounts differ significantly.

However, when adjusting for items affecting comparability, the core non-GAAP measure provides a clearer picture of the underlying performance. The core, non-GAAP measure for PBNA would account for adjustments such as restructuring and impairment charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and merger and integration charges, which are detailed in the financial tables [5][8].\n\nFor instance, the table in image5 shows adjustments for mark-to-market net impact, restructuring and impairment charges, and inventory fair value adjustments, which are applied to each segment, including PBNA. These adjustments help to isolate the core operational performance by removing one-time or non-recurring items. Specifically, the table in image6 highlights the impact of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and organic growth, which are key factors influencing the reported GAAP measure. The organic % change for PBNA was 2%, indicating that after adjusting for these factors, the segment experienced a modest growth [6].\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides a comprehensive view of how adjustments like pension-related settlement charges and other non-recurring items affect the transition from GAAP to non-GAAP measures.

This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, despite higher net earnings excluding non-cash charges [6]. The table in image4 shows that net cash provided by operating activities was $9,812 million in 2020, down from $10,090 million in 2019. This reduction in operating cash flows indicates tighter cash generation from core business operations.\n\nInvesting activities saw a decrease in net cash used, with a reduction of $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [2]. This improvement was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH in 2019, partially offset by higher cash collateral for derivatives [2]. Image1 confirms this, showing capital expenditures of $602 million in 2020, a decrease from $852 million in 2019. The reduced investment spending helped conserve cash.\n\nFinancing activities, however, showed an increase in net cash used of $0.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [3].

The Annual Total Remuneration for each director is determined based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance evaluations [1][2][11]. This structure ensures that remuneration reflects the company's financial health and market perception, as well as the personal contributions of each executive.\n\nThe consolidated operating income serves as a key performance indicator, with a significant weight of 50% in the evaluation framework [7][11]. This metric assesses the degree to which Toyota achieves its required income for sustainable growth, with a reference value of 1 trillion yen and an evaluation result of 150% for the current fiscal year [7]. This indicates strong performance, directly influencing the performance-linked portion of remuneration. Additionally, the volatility of Toyota's share price, also weighted at 50%, is compared against the Nikkei stock average, providing a benchmark for evaluating shareholder value creation [5][7]. This dual focus ensures that remuneration is tied to both operational success and market valuation.\n\nShareholder value is further emphasized through Toyota's commitment to maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 30%, prioritizing stable dividends and strategic investments in growth areas like environmental technologies [9]. The financial data from 2017 to 2021 shows consistent dividend payments and share repurchases, with a total shareholder return ratio averaging around 41%, reflecting a commitment to returning value to shareholders [image1].

This information is also detailed in the same table in image2. The decrease in both amortisation and lease finance costs suggests a reduction in the Group's lease-related expenses over the period. \n\nFurthermore, the text quotes provide context for these changes. According to [3], the Group recognises lease liabilities and rights of use assets at the inception of the lease, which are then amortised over the lease term. The decrease in amortisation charges could be due to fewer new leases being added or changes in lease terms, such as renegotiations or closures, as mentioned in [9], where the Group applied practical expedients for rent concessions linked to COVID-19, which might have affected the lease liabilities and related expenses. \n\nThe total lease liabilities, as shown in image3, also decreased from 6,152 million euros at 31/01/2021 to 5,824 million euros at 31/01/2022, indicating a reduction in the overall lease obligations. This aligns with the decrease in amortisation and finance costs, suggesting a strategic adjustment in lease management or the impact of the pandemic-related concessions. \n\nIn summary, the amortisation charge for the Right of Use decreased by 78 million euros, and the lease finance cost decreased by 28 million euros from 2020 to 2021, reflecting a reduction in lease-related expenses. \n\n![Amortisation and lease costs decreased from 2020 to 2021](image2)"}

According to the text, total sales and revenues rose to $50.971 billion, a 22% increase from 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization [2][9]. The increase in sales volume was driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories by about $2.9 billion in 2020 but only by $100 million in 2021, indicating a stabilization in inventory levels [9][10]. Price realization also contributed positively, with favorable impacts from currency changes, particularly the stronger Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, and British pound [1][3][12].\n\nThe segments showing the most significant improvements were Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Construction Industries saw a 31% increase in sales to $22.106 billion, driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization [3]. Resource Industries experienced a 26% increase to $9.963 billion, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization [6][8]. Energy & Transportation also grew, but at a slower 16% rate, reaching $20.287 billion [11][12].\n\n![Sales and revenue changes from 2020 to 2021](image5) illustrates the breakdown of revenue increases, highlighting the substantial contributions from sales volume and price realization.

Net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, mainly due to lower rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income also declined by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a decline in service charges and lower card income due to decreased client activity [2]. This decline in net income is further supported by the data in image6, which shows a substantial drop in net income for both Deposits and Consumer Lending segments, with Total Consumer Banking net income falling from $12,962 million in 2019 to $6,507 million in 2020. Additionally, image2 highlights a 28% decrease in net income for the overall Consumer Banking segment, aligning with the text's explanation of increased provisions and higher expenses.\n\nIn contrast, the **GWIM** segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, experienced a different trajectory. MLGWM revenue decreased by 5% to $15.3 billion, primarily driven by lower interest rates, but this was partially offset by higher market valuations and positive assets under management (AUM) flows [7]. Bank of America Private Bank revenue decreased by 4% to $3.3 billion, also due to lower interest rates [12]. However, image7 provides a detailed breakdown showing that while MLGWM revenue declined from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020, client balances increased significantly, with total client balances rising from $3,047,792 million to $3,349,804 million. This indicates that despite revenue declines, GWIM maintained growth in client assets, suggesting resilience in client engagement and market conditions.\n\nOverall, Consumer Banking faced more pronounced challenges in maintaining revenue and net income due to external factors like lower interest rates and increased credit"}

According to the text, actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions such as discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression, which are crucial for determining the defined benefit obligation (DBO) [3]. The sensitivity of the DBO to changes in these assumptions is highlighted, with a 10% reduction in mortality rates leading to a €110 million increase in the DBO as of September 30, 2021 [4]. This sensitivity analysis underscores the volatility in the DBO due to actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe table in image4 shows actuarial gains and losses for 2021 and 2020. In 2021, changes in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million, compared to a gain of €72 million in 2020. Additionally, changes in demographic assumptions led to a loss of €8 million in 2021, compared to a loss of €3 million in 2020. These figures indicate that adverse changes in assumptions, particularly financial ones, negatively impacted the DBO in 2021.\n\nThe discount rates, as shown in image2, increased slightly across all currencies from 2020 to 2021. For example, the discount rate for the euro rose from 0.9% to 1.0%, and for the U.S. dollar from 2.4% to 2.7%. Higher discount rates generally reduce the present value of future obligations, but the table in image7 illustrates that a decrease in the discount rate (which would increase the DBO) has a substantial impact.

According to the text and image quotes, the RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches in 2020. Specifically, Credit Risk RWA increased due to higher market volatility and acquisitions, while Market Risk RWA rose primarily due to increased Regulatory VaR from higher market volatility. Operational Risk RWA decreased under the Advanced Approach due to a decline in litigation-related losses [1][8][12][3].\n\nThe increase in RWA is detailed in image3, which shows that Credit Risk RWA rose by $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach.

This stagnation contrasts with the International Operated Markets, which saw a 13% decrease in 2020, compared to a 3% increase in 2019 [image5].

The International segment's struggles were exacerbated by higher marketing support costs and incremental COVID-19 expenses, including employee-related costs and personal protective equipment [4][6]. Additionally, the International segment faced challenges from lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses and higher restaurant closing costs [6].\n\nThe U.S. segment, however, maintained stability due to positive sales performance in the second half of 2020, driven by strategic marketing investments and growth in delivery services [10]. Despite this, the overall revenue decrease in the U.S. was partly offset by increased support for marketing initiatives, such as the free Thank You Meals for first responders and healthcare workers [5][8].\n\nThe total restaurant margins also reflected these trends, with franchised margins dropping from $9,455 million in 2019 to $8,519 million in 2020, and company-operated margins decreasing from $1,660 million to $1,158 million [image1]. The fixed nature of franchised margin expenses, like lease and depreciation costs, contributed to the margin declines, while company-operated margins were hit by variable costs related to COVID-19 [11].\n\nIn summary, the U.S. segment showed resilience with stable revenues, while the International Operated Markets faced significant declines due to pandemic-related disruptions.

This decrease is primarily due to the higher accumulated depreciation and amortization, which rose from $723 million to $955 million [5]. Similarly, the overall net value of PP&E decreased from $10,396 million in 2019 to $12,747 million in 2020, with accumulated depreciation increasing from $3,734 million to $5,117 million [3].

This consistent growth in net income directly contributed to the increase in retained earnings, a key component of shareholders' equity. Additionally, comprehensive income, which includes other comprehensive income (OCI) components like foreign currency translation adjustments, defined benefit plans, and cash flow hedges, also played a crucial role. In 2020, comprehensive income was $5,472,296, reflecting positive OCI components such as foreign currency translation gains of $197,696 and defined benefit plan gains of $57,100, offsetting some losses. The table in image2 shows these figures, highlighting how both net income and comprehensive income collectively boosted shareholders' equity. The balance sheet in image1 further illustrates the growth in total assets and equity, with total shareholders' equity rising from $29,789,880 in 2019 to $37,078,593 in 2020. The changes in shareholders' equity are detailed in image7, where net income and comprehensive income are explicitly noted as contributors to the equity increase, alongside adjustments for share transactions and dividends.

According to text quote [1], Wells Fargo announced the sale of WFAM in February 2021 and completed the sale on November 1, 2021. This sale, along with the sale of the Corporate Trust Services business, led to the transfer of associated goodwill to the Corporate segment. The sale of WFAM resulted in a net gain of $269 million, as noted in text quote [7]. \n\nThe sale's impact is evident in the balance sheet data. Text quote [3] mentions that Corporate includes assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets, which were managed under a transition services agreement until June 2022. This indicates that while the sale was completed, some administrative responsibilities continued, affecting the reported figures.\n\nExamining the balance sheet data from image1, we see a detailed comparison of financial positions across 2021, 2020, and 2019. The table highlights changes in various categories, including total loans and total assets. Specifically, total loans increased slightly from 2020 to 2021, as shown in image3, which aligns with text quote [11] mentioning an increase in cash and restricted cash due to deposits from operating segments, partially offset by declines in available-for-sale debt securities and loans due to the student loan portfolio sale.\n\nImage5 provides a focused view of WFAM assets under management, showing a significant outflow of $587.1 billion due to the sale on November 1, 2021.

This expansion involved opening stores in key international markets such as the United Kingdom, France, the USA, and exploring franchise opportunities in the Middle East and Vietnam. The strategy emphasizes securing premium retail locations with high pedestrian traffic, as highlighted in text [8], which allows for quick and cost-effective store roll-outs, typically taking only 14 days to fit out a new store.\n\nKey achievements include the successful establishment of company-owned stores in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, alongside franchised stores in the Middle East and Vietnam [9]. The company has also streamlined its global supply chain, with over 56% of its product moved through the China warehouse, enhancing efficiency and maintaining operating speed [2][10]. Additionally, Lovisa has focused on enhancing existing store performance by optimizing its store network and closing underperforming locations, as well as rolling out in-store piercing services to boost customer loyalty [11].\n\nHowever, the strategy has faced challenges such as the highly competitive fast fashion jewelry sector, with low barriers to entry and ever-changing customer preferences [2]. The company mitigates these risks by employing a product team of over 20 people to stay ahead of trends and ensure market demand is met [6]. The global retail leasing market, impacted by COVID-19, has also been closely monitored to identify opportunities [12]. Financially, while gross margins saw a slight dip in FY20 to 77% from 80% in FY19 and FY18, as seen in image3, the company maintained strong growth in revenue, increasing from $25.5 million in FY2011 to $242.2 million in FY2020 [4].

According to the text, net interest income (NII) for 2020 was $27.6 billion, a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared with 2019 [9]. This decrease was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, although it was partly offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by $170.1 billion or 8.8% [9]. The reduction in NII was further influenced by the impact of lower market interest rates, particularly in Asia and North America, as noted in the fourth quarter of 2020 [8]. Interest income for the year decreased by $12.9 billion or 24%, mainly due to the fall in the yield on AIEA by 84 basis points, while interest expense decreased by $2.9 billion year-on-year, driven by lower market interest rates and growth in interest-bearing customer accounts [4][11].\n\nThe net interest margin (NIM) for 2020 was 1.32%, 26 basis points lower than in 2019, reflecting the reduction in the yield on AIEA and the favorable impacts of significant items and foreign currency translation differences [2]. The NIM for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 1.22%, down 34 basis points year-on-year, mainly due to Asia and the impact of lower market interest rates [12]. These declines in NII and NIM contributed to a reduction in net operating income before credit provisions, as the organization faced challenges in maintaining profitability amid falling interest rates.\n\nThe overall profitability was further affected by an increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which led to a reported profit before tax decrease of 34% to $8.8 billion [1]. Adjusted profit before tax also decreased by 45% to $12.1 billion, indicating a significant impact on the bottom line.

This decrease was primarily driven by a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a 44.4% reduction [9]. The decline in interest income was attributed to lower short-term interest rates and reduced income from fixed maturity securities. Despite this, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, a 3.5% rise, which partially offset the decline in interest income [6]. The effective income tax rate also decreased slightly from 15.3% in 2020 to 14.9% in 2021, but this had a minimal impact on the overall net investment income [6].\n\n**Railroad Operating Earnings:**\nRailroad operating earnings increased from $17,462 million in 2020 to $19,943 million in 2021, a 14.2% rise [5].

The gross carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets also increased slightly from $445 million in 2019 to $456 million in 2020, but the higher accumulated amortization led to a lower net carrying amount.

In 2018, the total was $1,126 million, which increased to $1,878 million in 2019, and further to $2,119 million in 2020 [11]. This growth reflects increases in both discretionary incentive compensation and formulaic payouts, particularly in Wealth Management, driven by higher revenues and investment performance [3]. The distribution across business segments in 2020 highlights that Wealth Management had the highest expenses at $1,000 million, followed by Institutional Securities at $851 million, and Investment Management at $268 million [12]. The increase in Wealth Management expenses is notably linked to the E\\*TRADE acquisition and higher revenues [3]. Additionally, the table in image1 shows that Wealth Management's compensation expenses more than doubled from 2018 to 2020, indicating a substantial focus on this segment. The overall rise in compensation expenses aligns with the firm's expansion and performance improvements, as seen in the increased assets under management and net revenues [1][5][7]. The deferred cash-based awards and return on referenced investments also contributed to the compensation expenses, with a notable increase in returns from 2018 to 2020, as detailed in image5. This trend underscores the firm's reliance on performance-based compensation structures, which are further supported by the projected future compensation obligations outlined in image2. \n\nIn summary, the total recognized compensation expenses increased from $1,126 million in 2018 to $2,119 million in 2020, with the majority of expenses concentrated in Wealth Management in 2020."}

This reflects a growth of approximately $178 million, indicating an expansion in the company's lease commitments. Correspondingly, the operating lease liabilities also increased, with current liabilities rising from $158 million to $189 million and long-term liabilities from $639 million to $785 million, totaling a $177 million increase in liabilities. The weighted average remaining lease term remained constant at 7 years, but the discount rate slightly decreased from 3.1% to 2.8%, suggesting a potential reduction in the cost of borrowing or changes in market conditions. These changes in lease assets and liabilities are indicative of the company's increased leasing activities, possibly due to strategic investments or expansions, which are reflected in the financial statements as higher lease obligations and associated expenses.\n\nRegarding inventories, image6 provides a detailed breakdown. The total inventory increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020, a rise of $664 million. This growth is distributed across all categories: finished goods increased by $399 million, work in process by $84 million, and raw materials by $181 million. The substantial increase in inventory levels could be attributed to higher production volumes or strategic stockpiling in response to market conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which might have influenced supply chain dynamics. This increase in inventory is reflected in the financial statements as higher current assets, impacting working capital and potentially affecting liquidity ratios.\n\nThe financial implications of these changes are evident in the cost of sales and operating cash flows. As noted in text quote [2], the year-over-year increase in cost of sales in 2020 was partly due to higher sales volumes and acquisition-related charges, including inventory fair value adjustments from the Cytiva Acquisition, which added $457 million to the cost of sales. This aligns with the inventory growth observed in image6, suggesting that the increased inventory levels were partly driven by acquisitions and higher production to meet"}

According to the text, the liability for uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020 [1]. This reduction was primarily due to a $249 million tax benefit from the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, which also led to the reversal of $46 million in accrued interest [1]. This settlement directly contributed to a decrease in liabilities, thereby positively affecting the net deferred tax asset.\n\nThe deferred tax assets before valuation allowance decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, mainly due to reductions in deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards, accrued expenses, and stock compensation [4]. However, the valuation allowance also decreased by $1 million, from $180 million in 2019 to $179 million in 2020, indicating a slight improvement in the likelihood of realizing these assets [9]. This reduction in valuation allowance further supported the net deferred tax asset.\n\nThe deferred tax liabilities also decreased significantly from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020, primarily due to lower liabilities related to property, plant, and equipment, and international earnings [4]. This substantial reduction in liabilities had a notable positive impact on the net deferred tax asset.\n\nThe net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020, reflecting the combined effect of these changes in both assets and liabilities. The decrease in liabilities, particularly from the settlement of uncertain tax positions, and the slight reduction in valuation allowance, were key factors in this increase.\n\n![Table showing changes in tax positions and their impact on net deferred tax asset](image1)  \n![Deferred tax assets and liabilities for 2020 and 2019](image4)  \n![Net deferred tax asset for 2020 and 2019](image5)\n\nIn summary, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020, driven by a significant reduction in uncertain tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities, along with a slight decrease in valuation allowances."}

This substantial increase in shareholding indicates a strong commitment to the company, potentially reflecting confidence in its future performance. \n\nIn terms of remuneration, image6 provides a detailed breakdown of S Fallscheer's compensation. The table shows that S Fallscheer's total remuneration increased from FY19 to FY20, with notable components including salary and fees, performance-based payments, and share-based payments. The increase in share-based payments aligns with the significant purchase of shares, suggesting that a portion of their remuneration was reinvested into the company. \n\nAdditionally, image4 and image5 detail the performance rights and options granted to S Fallscheer. In FY20, S Fallscheer was granted 956,328 performance rights valued at $3,000,000, which vested on 3 July 2022. This indicates a long-term incentive structure, aligning their interests with the company's performance over multiple years. The vesting of these rights, combined with the direct purchase of shares, enhances S Fallscheer's stake in the company, potentially increasing their financial position if the company's share price appreciates.\n\nThe implications of these changes are twofold: firstly, the increased shareholding and vested options position S Fallscheer to benefit from any future growth in the company's value, enhancing their financial security.

For coal, fluctuations in prices and volumes directly affect earnings. For instance, the Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, primarily due to lower price impacts and reduced volumes, which decreased EBITDA by US$168 million [2]. Additionally, increased maintenance costs and stripping volumes at Queensland Coal contributed to higher controllable cash costs, rising by US$102 million [2]. The report highlights that Queensland Coal unit costs are projected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by higher diesel prices, though efficiency improvements are expected to offset some costs [3]. However, uncertainty around coal import restrictions in China complicates medium-term guidance.\n\nFor nickel, the financial impact is also substantial. The Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance and contractor costs [9]. Despite these gains, unfavorable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs due to higher nickel prices partially offset these benefits [9]. The report notes that the average realized sales price for nickel rose to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021, benefiting from strong demand and supply disruptions [6].\n\nThe financial impact of commodity price changes is quantified in the report, showing that a US$1 per tonne decline in iron ore or a US$1 per barrel decline in oil would affect profit after taxation by US$163 million and US$24 million, respectively [4]. Similarly, a US$1 per tonne increase in metallurgical coal prices impacts profit after taxation by US$24 million and underlying EBITDA by US$35 million, while a US¢1 per pound increase in nickel affects both by US$1 million [5].

In 2019, the variable lease expenses were $32,113,000, while in 2020, they dropped to $404,000. This substantial reduction can be attributed to the adoption of AASB 16, which required the capitalization of lease liabilities and the recognition of depreciation and interest costs instead of operating lease expenses. As a result, the variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities were recognized in the statement of profit or loss, leading to a lower reported expense in 2020 compared to the previous year.

According to the data, net income decreased from $8,394 million in 2018 to $7,264 million in 2020, indicating a decline over the three-year period. This reduction can be attributed to various factors, including increased operating expenses and changes in other financial metrics. For instance, research and development expenses rose from $3,737 million in 2018 to $4,207 million in 2020, and selling, general, and administrative expenses also increased, which likely contributed to the lower net income [6][image6].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes both net income and other comprehensive income (OCI), also decreased from $8,313 million in 2018 to $6,807 million in 2020. The OCI component, which encompasses items like foreign currency translation adjustments, cash flow hedges, and available-for-sale securities, saw significant fluctuations. In 2020, OCI was a loss of $457 million, primarily due to losses on cash flow hedges and available-for-sale securities, compared to gains in 2019 and 2018. This shift suggests increased volatility in these areas, possibly due to market conditions or changes in the company's investment strategies [3][image3].\n\nThe decrease in comprehensive income and net income could indicate challenges in maintaining profitability amidst rising operational costs and market-related losses. However, the company's total revenues increased from $23,747 million in 2018 to $25,424 million in 2020, reflecting growth in product sales and other revenues, which is a positive sign of expanding business activities [8][image6]. The company's ability to manage these increases in revenue while facing operational and market challenges highlights its resilience. Additionally, the cash flow from operating activities improved, providing a strong cash position that could support future investments and operations [7].\n\nOverall, while the decline in net and comprehensive income suggests some financial pressures, the company's revenue growth and operational cash flow improvements indicate ongoing efforts to enhance its financial stability and adapt to changing market conditions."}

This was a significant decrease from the $8.562 billion returned in 2019 and $8.503 billion in 2018, as shown in image7. The decrease in returns was largely due to reduced treasury stock purchases, with only $874 million spent in 2020 compared to $4,980 million in 2019 and $5,247 million in 2018. Despite this, the company maintained its dividend payments, increasing the quarterly dividend by 3% to $1.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting confidence in its cash flow strength [6].\n\nThe company's focus on returning capital to shareholders through dividends is also reflected in the consistent dividend increases over the years, with the 2020 annual dividend of $5.04 per share, up from $4.73 in 2019 and $4.19 in 2018, as detailed in image7.

According to the text, discount revenue grew by 21 percent [2], reflecting a substantial rebound in commercial billed business, which also increased by 21 percent [2]. This recovery was further supported by a 24 percent increase in worldwide network volumes, which reached 2019 levels [3]. The growth was particularly strong in the U.S., where network volumes increased by 27 percent, and non-U.S. volumes rose by 17 percent [5]. Additionally, the average discount rate slightly increased to 2.30 percent in 2021 from 2.28 percent in 2020, influenced by a shift in spending mix towards higher T&E-related volumes [1]. The text also highlights that global T&E spend grew by 59 percent year-over-year, indicating a steady recovery throughout 2021 [3]. This aligns with the financial summary in image1, which shows a significant increase in non-interest revenues from $14,632 million in 2020 to $18,157 million in 2021, a 24 percent rise, with discount revenue being a key contributor. Image2 further supports this by detailing the substantial increase in total revenues net of interest expense, reaching $42,380 million in 2021 from $36,087 million in 2020, driven by higher discount revenue. The overall improvement in network volumes and spending patterns, especially in T&E, were pivotal in driving the increase in discount revenue during this period.\n\n![Financial summary showing a 24% increase in non-interest revenues from 2020 to 2021](image1)\n![Table showing total revenues net of interest expense increased to $42,380 million in 2021 from $36,087 million in 2020](image2)\n\nIn summary, discount revenue increased by 21 percent from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to pandemic recovery, higher network volumes, and a shift in spending mix towards T&E-related activities."}

The decrease can be attributed to various factors, including changes in current liabilities and long-term debt. For instance, current liabilities decreased from $33,132 million in 2021 to $33,081 million in 2022, and long-term debt decreased from $23,099 million in 2021 to $22,848 million in 2022.

The Board emphasizes that the structure for Shane Fallscheer includes a mix of fixed base remuneration and long-term incentives with challenging hurdles to ensure a strong linkage between shareholder value creation and remuneration [7]. Specifically, Shane's remuneration package is maintained with a fixed base remuneration of $1,500,000, and additional long-term incentives (LTI) are granted during the year [11]. This approach is designed to attract, retain, and reward highly capable individuals while ensuring a clear link between performance and remuneration [6].\n\nIn contrast, the remuneration structure for Chris Lauder reflects a different balance. The text indicates that the Board has maintained the same remuneration package for Shane, with no change to his fixed base remuneration, suggesting a more stable fixed component for Shane compared to Chris [11]. The image data further illustrates these differences: ![Shane Fallscheer has 33% fixed and 67% at-risk remuneration, while Chris Lauder has 67% fixed and 33% at-risk](image3). This indicates that Shane's remuneration is more heavily weighted towards at-risk components, such as long-term incentives, which are tied to performance metrics like EBIT growth [2]. For example, the performance rights/options granted to Shane Fallscheer across different financial years show significant values and vesting conditions, as seen in ![Performance rights/options granted to Shane Fallscheer and Chris Lauder with varying values and vesting dates](image1). Shane's FY19 LTIP, for instance, is valued at $8,000,000, with no forfeiture, highlighting the substantial at-risk component linked to performance [10].\n\nAdditionally, the performance-based incentive structures outlined in the images show that incentives are exercisable based on EBIT growth targets.

This substantial increase reflects a total growth of $15,698 million over the three-year period. The growth can be attributed to various factors, including net cash provided by operating activities, which increased by $3.54 billion to $5.94 billion in 2020 from $2.40 billion in 2019 [11], and cash inflows from financing activities such as the issuance of common stock and stock options [7].

These components show fluctuations in their balances, actuarial gains or losses, reclassifications, and tax impacts, reflecting the company's financial adjustments and market conditions during these years. For instance, the foreign currency translation adjustments are influenced by exchange rate changes, as mentioned in text [2], which are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, gains from cash flow hedges, as noted in text [11], are reclassified into earnings, impacting the net loss over time.\n\nRegarding property and equipment values, image4 illustrates a significant increase in both gross and net values from 2019 to 2020. The gross property and equipment value rose from $3,347,195 to $3,859,299, primarily driven by increases in computers, related equipment, and software, as well as leasehold improvements. The net property and equipment value also increased from $1,391,166 to $1,545,568, despite higher accumulated depreciation. This growth aligns with the company's investments in technology and infrastructure, supporting its operational needs and expansion.\n\nIn summary, the accumulated other comprehensive loss components saw adjustments due to foreign currency translation and hedge reclassifications, while property and equipment values grew significantly, reflecting strategic investments in technology and facilities.\n\n![Table showing financial data for accumulated other comprehensive loss over fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020](image7)  \n![Table showing property and equipment values as of August 31, 2019, and August 31, 2020](image4)"}

Specifically, equity underwriting revenues rose on higher volumes, primarily in secondary block share trades, initial public offerings, and follow-on offerings [6]. Fixed income underwriting revenues also increased on higher volumes, particularly in investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuances, although this was partially offset by lower event-driven investment grade loan activity [6]. \n\nThe image data further supports this trend. Image7 shows that equity underwriting revenues increased by 81% from 2019 to 2020, reaching $3,092 million in 2020 compared to $1,708 million in 2019. Fixed income underwriting revenues grew by 10%, from $1,913 million in 2019 to $2,104 million in 2020.

Several factors contributed to this change:\n\n1. **Increase in Revenue**: Revenue grew by 3.1% from 2020 to 2021, driven by increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, and video revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue [10]. This growth in revenue directly impacts cash flow from operations.\n\n2. **Decrease in Income Tax Payments**: The decrease in income tax payments in 2021 was primarily due to tax deductions from the senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion, more than offsetting higher taxable income from operations [4].\n\n3. **Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities**: The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by increases related to theme park operations. The timing of amortization and payments for film and television costs, along with increased production spending and sporting events, also influenced this change [9].\n\n4. **Proceeds from Investments**: The increase in proceeds from investments and other activities in 2021 was mainly due to higher cash distributions from equity method investments [3].\n\n5. **Operating Income and Depreciation**: Operating income increased from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, and depreciation and amortization expenses rose slightly, contributing to higher cash flow [6].\n\n6. **Interest Payments**: Payments of interest remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from $3,878 million in 2020 to $3,908 million in 2021, which had a minimal impact on the overall change [6].\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the significant increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2020 to 2021.\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021](image6)"}

This turnaround was primarily driven by higher revenues and other income, which rose from $94,692 million in 2020 to $162,465 million in 2021, reflecting increased sales and operating revenues [4]. Additionally, the absence of impairments and write-offs, which had negatively impacted 2020, contributed to the improved financial performance [1][10][11].

In 2019, the operating income was distributed with 41% in one segment, 48% in another, and 11% in the last segment. By 2020, the distribution shifted to 45%, 39%, and 16% respectively. This shift indicates a reallocation of operating income, with one segment increasing its share while others decreased. The decline in operating income across segments was primarily due to sales declines, especially in the International Operated Markets, which faced significant challenges from COVID-19. Additionally, increased marketing support and higher operating expenses contributed to the changes. The U.S. segment saw a decrease in operating income due to higher marketing costs and restaurant closing expenses, while the International Operated Markets experienced a substantial decline due to COVID-19-related sales drops and increased expenses. The International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment showed a slight increase in revenue but still faced margin pressures. Overall, the changes in operating income distribution highlight the company's efforts to manage costs and adapt to the pandemic's impact while maintaining strategic investments in growth areas. \n\n![Operating income distribution changed from 41%, 48%, 11% in 2019 to 45%, 39%, 16% in 2020](image6)"}

This increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables, as noted in text [10]. The sales of receivables, including financing receivables of $3,076 million, contributed significantly to this growth. Additionally, payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals of approximately $600 million under the U.S. CARES Act and other programs provided further cash inflows. However, these gains were partially offset by increased workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million and a net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million [1]. This robust operating cash flow indicates improved operational efficiency and effective management of receivables.\n\n**Investing Activities**: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23,908 million, from $(26,936) million in 2019 to $(3,028) million in 2020. This substantial reduction was largely due to the absence of the Red Hat acquisition in 2020, which had consumed $32,294 million in 2019 [9]. The wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations also contributed to a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables of $6,245 million.

Total sales for the segment rose from $10,570 million in Q4 2020 to $13,097 million in Q4 2021, a 24% increase [5]. This growth was primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, as noted in the text [4]. The sales volume increase was influenced by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, particularly in mining, heavy construction, and quarry and aggregates [4]. Additionally, changes in dealer inventories contributed to the sales growth, with dealers increasing inventories in Q4 2021 compared to a decrease in Q4 2020 [3].\n\nOperating profit for the segment increased from $1,380 million in Q4 2020 to $1,611 million in Q4 2021, a 17% rise [2].

Additionally, the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics contributed to revenue growth, with distribution revenue increasing due to contractual rate increases and Peacock's performance [8]. The text also notes that the Sky segment experienced revenue growth, driven by various factors including increased sales of Sky Glass televisions [5].\n\nThe waterfall chart in image2 visually supports these findings, showing that the NBCUniversal segments contributed the largest increase in revenue, with a $6,788 million boost, followed by the Cable Communications segment with a $1,450 million increase, and the Sky segment with a $1,285 million rise. These contributions collectively led to the overall revenue increase from $72,971 million in 2020 to $81,764 million in 2021. Similarly, image7 provides another waterfall chart that aligns with this data, highlighting the NBCUniversal segments' significant contribution of $7,108 million and the Cable Communications segment's $4,277 million increase, further confirming the text's assertions.\n\nThe table in image1 also illustrates the percentage changes in revenue for each segment, with NBCUniversal showing a 6.9% increase and Sky a 11.4% increase, reinforcing the text's emphasis on these segments' growth.

The increase in gross value reflects additional investments in software development, while the higher amortization expense indicates ongoing recognition of the cost of these assets over their useful lives. \n\n![The table shows an increase in the net value of capitalized software from 2019 to 2020](image2)"}

The table in image7 provides a detailed breakdown of these expenses and benefits over the years:\n\n- **2022**:\n  - Stock-based compensation expense: $33\n  - Tax benefits: $1\n  - Net expense: $12\n  - Adjustments: $(12), $(6)\n  - Final net: $16\n\n- **2021**:\n  - Stock-based compensation expense: $30\n  - Tax benefits: $2\n  - Net expense: $2\n  - Adjustments: $(0), $(1)\n  - Final net: $33\n\nThe increase in stock-based compensation expense from $30 in 2021 to $33 in 2022 suggests a higher allocation of stock-based incentives, potentially to attract or retain talent. The related tax benefits also rose slightly, indicating effective tax planning. However, the net expense decreased from $33 in 2021 to $16 in 2022, possibly due to more efficient tax strategies or changes in accounting treatments [9].\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that stock-based compensation was allocated to segments starting in 2022, reflecting a strategic decision to evaluate segment performance more comprehensively [12]. This change could indicate a focus on aligning compensation with segment-specific goals and performance metrics.\n\nThe valuation allowances for foreign tax credits also increased from $214 in 2021 to $313 in 2022, primarily due to carry-forward limitations [7]. This suggests caution in realizing future tax benefits, possibly due to uncertainty in foreign tax environments.\n\nOverall, these changes may indicate a strategic shift towards leveraging stock-based compensation to align employee incentives with company growth, while managing tax liabilities through careful planning and segment-specific performance evaluation. The adjustments in net expenses highlight efforts to optimize financial outcomes despite rising compensation costs.\n\n**Answer**: The company increased stock-based compensation expenses and related tax benefits from 2021 to 2022, reflecting a strategic focus on talent retention and tax efficiency, while managing net expenses through adjustments, indicating a balanced approach to financial"}

In 2021, the company operated a total of 6,477 stores, with a breakdown of 5,413 company-managed and 1,064 franchise locations across different regions, including Spain, Rest of Europe, Americas, and Rest of the World [image1]. By 2022, the total number of stores increased to 6,829, with company-managed stores rising to 5,736 and franchises to 1,093 [image8]. This indicates a net increase in both company-managed and franchise stores, particularly in regions like the Americas and Rest of the World, where franchise numbers grew significantly.\n\nThe increase in store numbers can be attributed to Inditex's active store optimization activities in 2021, which included 226 new openings and 130 refurbishments, with 57 enlargements [1]. These activities were part of a broader strategy to streamline operations, focusing on absorbing stores at the end of their useful life and recuperating sales through local shops and online channels [12]. The company's decision to absorb between 1,000 and 1,200 stores over 2020 and 2021 aimed to enhance efficiency and adapt to changing market conditions, especially post-pandemic recovery [12].\n\nAdditionally, the pandemic's impact in 2020, which led to significant store closures and restrictions, likely influenced the strategic expansion in 2021 and 2022. As lockdown measures eased, Inditex capitalized on the recovery by opening new stores in 40 markets, contributing to the increased geographical spread [1]. The company's focus on optimizing store locations and formats, as well as the acquisition of subsidiaries to expand its brand presence, further supported these changes [2, image2, image4].\n\nOverall, the geographical distribution shift reflects Inditex's strategic response to post-pandemic market dynamics, emphasizing store optimization, regional expansion, and the integration of acquired subsidiaries to strengthen its global footprint. \n\n**Answer:** The geographical distribution of Inditex's stores expanded from 6,477 in 2021 to 6,829 in 2022, driven by store optimization activities, post"}

According to the financial data, net earnings increased from $12,382 million in 2018 to $14,239 million in 2019, and further to $15,769 million in 2020 [10]. This consistent rise in net earnings reflects the company's ability to manage its operations effectively, despite challenges such as reduced care volumes due to COVID-19, which partially offset revenue increases in OptumHealth [4]. The company's diversified business model, with its two main segments—Optum and United Healthcare—contributed to this growth, driven by organic expansion and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery [2].\n\nComprehensive income, which includes net earnings and other comprehensive income or loss, also showed a positive trend. In 2018, comprehensive income was $10,865 million, rising to $14,821 million in 2019, and reaching $15,533 million in 2020 [10]. The main factors influencing these changes were fluctuations in unrealized gains or losses on investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. For instance, in 2020, the company reported net unrealized gains on investment securities of $805 million, after tax, compared to $933 million in 2019 and a loss of $227 million in 2018 [10]. Additionally, foreign currency translation losses were a significant factor, amounting to $983 million in 2020, compared to $271 million in 2019 and $1,242 million in 2018 [10]. These financial metrics highlight the impact of market conditions and currency fluctuations on the company's overall financial performance.\n\nThe company's ability to recognize premium revenues based on estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, and its participation in CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology, which adjusts premiums based on health severity and demographic factors, also played a role in stabilizing and enhancing its financial outcomes [5][9]. Furthermore, the audit of the financial statements confirmed their conformity with U.S. GAAP, providing assurance on the accuracy of these reported figures [7].\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's net earnings and comprehensive income increased from 2"}

According to the financial data, the net income was $4,029 million in 2019, decreased to $2,539 million in 2020, and then increased significantly to $5,727 million in 2021. This trend reflects the impact of various factors, including the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the cash flow statement where the cash provided by operations increased due to the recovery of business operations [3]. The significant rise in net income in 2021 can also be attributed to strong consumer demand and effective management of working capital, as evidenced by the decrease in inventories and increases in accounts payable and receivables [3]. Additionally, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on income before taxes in 2021 contributed positively to the overall financial performance [8][9]. The detailed breakdown of net income and other comprehensive income over the three years is illustrated in the table from image8, which shows the substantial improvement in net income from 2020 to 2021 despite losses in other comprehensive income components like foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedges. \n\n![Net income and comprehensive income data for 2019, 2020, and 2021](image8)"}

This increase suggests that IBM continued to invest in long-term resources, which could support future growth initiatives, particularly in areas like hybrid cloud and AI, as mentioned in the text [10]. The growth in noncurrent assets aligns with the company's strategic focus on enhancing its technological capabilities and infrastructure.\n\nLong-term debt slightly increased from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020 [4]. However, this slight rise is within the context of a broader deleveraging strategy. The text notes that total debt decreased by $1,361 million (adjusted for currency) from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by new issuances of $8,982 million [3]. This indicates that IBM is actively managing its debt portfolio, reducing overall leverage while maintaining necessary funding levels for strategic investments.\n\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased by $1,621 million (adjusted for currency) from 2019 to 2020 [1]. This increase could reflect changes in obligations such as deferred tax liabilities or pension obligations, which are often part of long-term financial planning. The growth in noncurrent liabilities, despite the overall debt reduction, suggests that IBM is managing its financial obligations while focusing on strategic refinancing and risk management, as evidenced by the use of hedging instruments to mitigate foreign currency risks [6].\n\nThe company's financial strategy appears to be centered on maintaining liquidity and flexibility. IBM has over $14 billion in cash and equivalents, supporting its ability to operate at a single A credit rating and continue deleveraging [5].

This change can be attributed to several factors, including the reinstatement of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2020, which added $626 million to the provision [2][11]. Additionally, the effective tax rate increased from 22.3% in 2018 to 24.0% in 2020, reflecting changes in tax laws and the impact of the tax provision adjustments.

The net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $9,478 million, for 2019 it was $10,090 million, and for 2020 it was $9,812 million, as shown in the cash flow table [image5]. This indicates a decrease from 2019 to 2020, but an increase from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was influenced by factors such as higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, despite higher net earnings [3]. Additionally, the operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of trade receivables sold, which remained outstanding with unaffiliated financial institutions [5][11].

The decline in 2020 was driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory [4]. ENBREL has been losing market share consistently, and this trend was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the growth rate of the rheumatology market [4]. Additionally, the approval of biosimilar versions of ENBREL in 2019 and ongoing patent litigations have intensified competition [9].

By December 31, 2020, the total ACL had risen to $1,130 million, with $739 million for loans and $391 million for lending commitments [2][11]. This substantial increase reflects the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment, driven by actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends and uncertainties related to COVID-19 [2][11]. The adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $131 million increase in the allowance for credit losses, primarily affecting employee loans [5]. Additionally, gross charge-offs of $103 million were partially offset by recoveries of $8 million, while provisions for credit losses added $733 million [2][11]. The base scenario for ACL models assumed a continued economic recovery supported by fiscal and monetary policies, with U.S. GDP being the most sensitive input [2][11]. The table in image2 illustrates these changes, showing the effect of CECL adoption, charge-offs, recoveries, and provisions, leading to the final ACL balance of $1,130 million in 2020. The increase in ACL was also influenced by higher risk factors such as borrower financial strength, industry conditions, and economic outlook, as detailed in text quote [3].

For instance, in April 2002, the high was 390.00 Rupees and the low was 340.00 Rupees, while by March 2003, the high dropped to 329.00 Rupees and the low to 286.00 Rupees. This indicates a general downward trend in GPI's stock prices over the period. Similarly, the BSE Sensex also shows variability, with its high and low prices fluctuating but generally trending downward as well. For example, in April 2002, the Sensex had a high of 397.00 and a low of 320.00, and by March 2003, the high was 334.90 and the low was 310.00. This suggests that both GPI and the BSE Sensex experienced a decline in value over the year, with GPI showing a more pronounced drop in its closing range [image6].\n\nSecondly, the normalized index performance provides a comparative view. The line graph shows GPI's performance fluctuating between a high of 106 and a low of 84, while the BSE Sensex ranged between 98 and 84. Both indices experienced similar trends, with GPI slightly outperforming the Sensex at certain points, particularly in mid-2002, but both generally moving in tandem. This indicates that GPI's stock performance was closely aligned with the broader market index, with some periods of divergence where GPI's normalized index was higher than the Sensex, suggesting relative outperformance [image4].\n\nIn summary, both GPI and the BSE Sensex exhibited a downward trend from April 2002 to March 2003, with GPI showing a more significant decline in its stock prices. However, the normalized index performance indicates that GPI occasionally outperformed the Sensex, reflecting its relative resilience compared to the broader market during certain periods. \n\n![Comparison of GPI and BSE Sensex performance](image4)"}

This reflects a substantial investment aimed at addressing the immediate needs arising from the pandemic.\n- **Implementation Methods:** These projects are implemented both directly and through various agencies. For instance, the table shows that some COVID Relief projects are executed directly by the organization, while others are managed through implementing agencies like Setu Charitable Trust and National Health and Education Society. This dual approach allows for both direct intervention and leveraging specialized agencies to reach broader or more targeted populations.\n\n**Rural Development Projects:**\n- **Financial Expenditure:** The financial expenditures for Rural Development Projects are generally lower, with amounts ranging from ₹0.14 crore to ₹2.09 crore per project, as seen in the table. This indicates a more distributed approach with multiple smaller projects aimed at various rural areas.\n- **Implementation Methods:** All Rural Development Projects are implemented indirectly through agencies, as shown in the table. Agencies such as Sanjeevani Institute for Empowerment & Development and BAIF Development Research Foundation are involved, emphasizing a collaborative approach with established organizations to ensure effective execution in rural settings.\n\nIn summary, COVID Relief projects involve higher financial outlays and a mix of direct and agency-based implementation, while Rural Development Projects are characterized by smaller, more numerous expenditures and rely entirely on indirect implementation through specialized agencies. \n\n![Details of various CSR projects including COVID Relief and Rural Development](image1)\n![Table showing Rural Development Projects with financial and implementation details](image3)"}

Additionally, quote [10] mentions that merchandise costs were impacted by higher-than-usual inflation, which affected net sales and gross margin.\n\n2. **Gasoline Price Impact**: While higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230 and 481 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021 (quote [11]), the gross margin percentage was negatively affected because gasoline generally has a lower gross margin compared to non-gasoline products (quote [12]).\n\n3. **COVID-19 Related Wage Changes**: The cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19 positively impacted gross margin by five basis points (quote [5]), but this was partially offset by a one-time charge related to granting employees additional paid time off.\n\n4. **Foreign Currency Fluctuations**: Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176, primarily affecting the Other International segment (quote [5]).\n\n5. **Segment Performance**: All segments experienced a decrease in gross margin percentage, with the U.S. segment also negatively impacted by a LIFO charge and the Other International segment by increased rewards (quote [3]).\n\n6. **Sales Mix Shifts**: The increase in sales from warehouse ancillary and other businesses, which have lower margins, contributed to the overall decrease in gross margin percentage (quote [4]).\n\nIn summary, the gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022 due to higher merchandise costs, inflation, lower-margin gasoline sales, foreign currency impacts, and changes in sales mix."}

In 2020, the currency translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes, were a gain of $1,213 million, while in 2021, they were a loss of $664 million [image2]. This shift from a gain to a loss indicates a negative impact on comprehensive income due to foreign exchange rate movements. \n\nComprehensive income for 2021 was $13,436 million, which is lower than the $11,598 million in 2020 [image2]. The decrease in comprehensive income can be partially attributed to the negative currency translation adjustments in 2021. Additionally, the table shows that the net income attributable to Comcast Corporation was $13,833 million in 2021, compared to $10,701 million in 2020, reflecting an overall improvement in net income despite the adverse currency translation adjustments [image2].\n\nThe company's hedging strategies, as described in the text, involve using foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to manage foreign exchange risk. However, the pre-tax gains and losses related to these hedges are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income. In 2021, there were gains of $760 million, but after tax, the net effect was a loss of $664 million, indicating that the tax impact offset some of the gains [7].

The comprehensive income for 2021 was $13,436 million, down from $11,598 million in 2020, with the currency translation adjustments contributing to this change.\n\n![The table shows financial data including currency translation adjustments and comprehensive income for 2021 and 2020](image2)"}

This significant rise can be attributed to several key factors:\n\nFirstly, the income from associated companies saw a substantial increase to USD 15.3 billion in 2021 from USD 673 million in 2020, primarily due to the gain of USD 14.6 billion recognized on the divestment of the investment in Roche [2]. This divestment was a major contributor to the overall increase in earnings.\n\nAdditionally, the net income of the Group increased by USD 24.0 billion, which significantly boosted the earnings per share [4]. The table in image7 highlights that the net income rose substantially from USD 8,071 million in 2020 to USD 24,018 million in 2021, a 198% increase, further supporting this point.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's equity increased by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at the end of 2021, partly due to the net income and favorable fair value adjustments on financial instruments [3][4]. This increase in equity also positively impacted the earnings per share.\n\nThe share buyback program, where Novartis repurchased 30.7 million shares for USD 2.8 billion, reduced the total number of shares outstanding by 21.9 million, thereby increasing the earnings per share [10]. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding directly contributed to the higher earnings per share figure.\n\nLastly, the table in image1 shows that the core net income increased by 7% in USD, aligning with the overall increase in earnings per share. The combination of these factors—divestment gains, increased net income, equity growth, and share repurchases—collectively led to the significant rise in basic earnings per share.\n\n![The table shows a 202% increase in basic earnings per share from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

According to the financial statement, non-current assets increased from DKK 63,156 million in 2019 to DKK 79,113 million in 2020, primarily driven by a substantial rise in intangible assets from DKK 5,835 million to DKK 20,657 million. This surge in intangible assets is largely attributed to acquisitions, such as Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. and Emisphere Technologies Inc., which contributed to a decrease in free cash flow by DKK 16.3 billion [5]. The impairment tests for these assets were based on management's projections and the net present value of future cash flows, reflecting strategic investments in research and development [1].\n\nThe increase in non-current assets was accompanied by a rise in total equity, which grew from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020. This growth in equity was partly due to retained earnings increasing from DKK 57,817 million to DKK 63,774 million, reflecting higher net profits and effective management of cash flow hedges. The implementation of an amendment led to a reserve for cash flow hedges, with a net impact on retained earnings, though total equity remained stable [2]. Additionally, the company's equity structure was adjusted to recognize right-of-use assets in line with IFRS 16, affecting comparative figures [9].\n\nOverall, the significant investment in intangible assets and the growth in retained earnings strengthened the company's financial position, indicating a strategic focus on long-term growth and innovation.

The company's debt structure, combined with its substantial credit facilities, suggests a balanced approach to managing financial liabilities, ensuring access to capital while maintaining a stable cost of borrowing. Additionally, the company's ability to meet covenants, such as the consolidated EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 12.6 to 1.0, as noted in text [7], further supports its financial stability and strategic management of debt obligations.

According to the text, this decline was due to lower loan balances driven by weak demand, a lower interest rate environment, and other factors such as the sale of the student loan portfolio and unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results [5]. The net interest income for 2021 was $4,960 million, down from $6,134 million in 2020, reflecting a substantial drop [3]. This decrease is also evident in the income statement data provided in image3, which shows net interest income dropping from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, a reduction of $1,174 million.\n\nRegarding total loans, the data indicates a decrease across various sectors. Image1 highlights that total loans (average) decreased by $30,199 million or 14% from 2020 to 2021. Specifically, commercial and industrial loans decreased by $22,867 million (-16%), commercial real estate loans by $5,202 million (-10%), and lease financing and other loans by $2,130 million (-13%) [1]. This trend is consistent with the text, which mentions lower loan demand and higher paydowns as contributing factors [2]. \n\nIn contrast, image4 shows a different perspective, indicating an increase in total loans (period-end) by $39,918 million or 16% from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. However, this period-end data contrasts with the average data, suggesting variability in loan activity throughout the year.\n\nOverall, while net interest income declined due to lower loan balances and interest rates, the changes in total loans varied by sector, with some segments experiencing decreases in average balances but increases in period-end balances, reflecting dynamic market conditions and client behavior.\n\n**Answer:** Net interest income decreased from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, primarily due to lower loan balances and interest rates"}

This decline is reflected in the detailed breakdown provided in image1, which shows commercial nonaccrual loans decreasing from $4,779 million to $2,376 million, a reduction of $2,403 million. The outflows, particularly from payments, sales, and other sources, contributed to this decrease. In contrast, consumer nonaccrual loans increased from $3,949 million to $4,836 million, primarily driven by an increase in residential mortgage – first lien nonaccrual loans as customers exited COVID-19 accommodation programs, as mentioned in text [9]. Image1 also illustrates this increase, with inflows in consumer nonaccrual loans rising from $2,616 million to $3,281 million, and outflows not offsetting the inflows sufficiently.

This area is complex due to the competitive pricing pressures and product discounting trends in the US healthcare environment, which require significant judgement and estimation by Management [1][8]. The key accounting estimates involve the calculation of provisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to various entities such as government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, and Managed Care organizations. These provisions are based on historical experience and specific terms in individual agreements, with unsettled rebates recognized as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain [3][9].

Specifically, the sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018 led to a reduction in product development costs related to this franchise [1][3]. Additionally, there was a $25 million increase in the capitalization of development costs, mainly driven by the timing of Blizzard’s game development cycles [3]. This suggests that some development costs were deferred rather than expensed immediately, contributing to the overall decrease in reported expenses.\n\nFurthermore, the text mentions a decrease in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of the King acquisition, which also impacted the product development costs [2]. The decrease in software amortization and royalties from Activision, particularly from the Destiny franchise, was another factor, partially offset by royalties from Call of Duty: Mobile [2][7]. These combined factors contributed to the overall reduction in product development expenses.\n\nThe image data supports these findings. Image8 shows that product development costs decreased from $1,101 million in 2018 to $998 million in 2019, a reduction of $103 million, which aligns with the textual explanations of reduced expenses due to the Destiny franchise and changes in capitalization practices. The consistent percentage of consolidated net revenues (15% in both years) further highlights the targeted reductions in specific areas rather than a broad decrease across all development activities.\n\nIn summary, the main factors were the sale of Destiny publishing rights, reduced amortization expenses, and changes in capitalization timing, particularly for Blizzard’s projects.\n\n![Product development costs decreased by $103 million from 2018 to 2019](image8)"}

According to the financial data, retained earnings decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, a reduction of $386 million. This decline is primarily attributed to the net income of $8,060 million in 2021, which was offset by cash dividends paid and the repurchase of common shares, as detailed in the equity section changes. Additionally, the company's comprehensive income for 2021 was $8,010 million, which includes net income and other comprehensive (loss) income components. The other comprehensive (loss) income for 2021 was $(50) million, driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized debt securities losses, net of tax, which negatively impacted accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The AOCI decreased from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021, mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized debt securities losses.

According to the consolidated cash flow statement in image1, the net cash from operating activities was adjusted to remove the impact of AASB 16, resulting in a net cash flow of $48.1 million. This indicates strong operational cash generation, which is crucial for sustaining and growing the business. Additionally, capital expenditure of $25.6 million was primarily directed towards new store openings and refurbishments, reflecting strategic investments in the business infrastructure.\n\nThe changes in retained earnings, as detailed in image4, show a starting balance of $43,352 thousand in July 2018, with adjustments due to profit, changes in accounting policy, and dividends over the period. Retained earnings are a key component of equity, representing profits reinvested in the business rather than distributed as dividends. The table in image4 highlights that retained earnings increased over the period, contributing positively to the total equity, which rose from $45,242 thousand to $58,368 thousand by June 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the consolidated statement of profit or loss in image3 reveals a decrease in operating profit from $52,484 thousand in 2019 to $25,667 thousand in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Despite this, the company managed to maintain a net cash position of $20.4 million at the end of the financial year, as noted in text quote [3], which helped in sustaining equity levels. The deferred dividend payment mentioned in text quote [12] also indicates prudent cash management, preserving cash flow for operational needs.\n\nIn summary, the operational cash flows supported the business during challenging times, while changes in retained earnings, driven by profits and dividend policies, contributed to the overall increase in total equity. The combination of these factors ensured that the company maintained a positive equity position despite the disruptions caused by COVID-19.\n\n![Consolidated cash flow statement showing net cash from operating activities](image1)\n![Consolidated financial statement showing changes in retained earnings](image4)"}

According to the text, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using enacted statutory tax rates and adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change [12]. The company's deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022, primarily due to reductions in loss and other carryforwards, pension and other retiree benefits, and capitalized research & development [5]. Specifically, loss and other carryforwards decreased from $1,030 million to $914 million, and pension and other retiree benefits decreased from $1,476 million to $740 million. This reduction in deferred tax assets could indicate a decrease in future tax benefits, potentially affecting the company's ability to offset taxable income in future periods.\n\nOn the liabilities side, total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. Significant increases were seen in goodwill and intangible assets, from $5,761 million to $5,783 million, and other retiree benefits, from $645 million to $1,031 million [7]. The increase in liabilities, particularly in goodwill and intangible assets, suggests higher future tax obligations related to these items. Additionally, the unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions increased from $111 million to $439 million, indicating potential future taxable gains.\n\nThe net effect of these changes is a widening gap between deferred tax liabilities and assets, which could lead to higher future tax expenses. This shift impacts the company's financial position by potentially increasing future tax liabilities and reducing the deferred tax assets available to offset taxable income. However, the company's management believes that the ultimate outcomes of tax positions will not have a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations, or cash flows [11]. The adjustments in deferred tax positions are reflective of ongoing tax audits and changes in tax laws, which the company monitors and adjusts for accordingly [6].\n\n![Deferred tax assets and liabilities for 2021 and 2022](image6)  \n![Deferred tax liabilities for 2021 and 2022](image7)  \n\nIn"}

According to the text, the vesting of the First Tranche 2019 Performance Share Units is contingent on the 2019 OI being at least 90% of the 2019 AOP OI Objective. If this threshold is met, the number of shares vested is calculated based on the ratio of the actual OI to the AOP OI Objective, with a maximum of 125% of the target number of shares [2]. The text also mentions that the Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust performance objectives by substituting or combining OI metrics from different business units [3][12].\n\nThe image ![Vesting conditions based on Non-GAAP OI criteria](image8) provides a structured overview of these conditions, specifying that vesting for each of the first three full years depends on the Business Unit’s Non-GAAP OI not being more than 15% less than the AOP objective. This aligns with the text's emphasis on performance-based vesting, where the actual number of shares vested can vary based on performance relative to the set objectives. The table in the image outlines that vesting is contingent on meeting these financial conditions, reinforcing the text's explanation of performance-based vesting schedules.\n\nIn summary, restricted share units vest over the first three years if the Non-GAAP OI for each respective year meets or exceeds 90% of the AOP OI Objective, with adjustments possible by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares vested is determined by the performance factor, up to a maximum of 125% of the target."}

In 2018, the company-operated margins were $1,747 million, which dropped to $1,660 million in 2019, and further declined to $1,158 million in 2020. This represents a substantial reduction over the three-year period, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on sales, as noted in the text [1] and [4], which highlighted sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment. Additionally, the text [11] mentions that the decrease in operating margin percent for 2020 was driven by a decline in sales and higher operating expenses.\n\nCurrency translation had a minor impact on these margins.

In 2019, the currency translation cost was $(51) million, and in 2018, there was a small benefit of $4 million.

The partisan divide was stark, with 13% of Republicans and 41% of Democrats saying his policies had not much effect [6]. This reflects broader partisan differences in evaluating Trump's presidency, as seen in the image comparing perceptions of presidential success across different administrations, where Trump's \"too early to tell\" percentage was notably lower than his predecessors [image2]. The image also highlights the partisan split in views on Trump's success, with Republicans largely optimistic and Democrats pessimistic [image2]. Thus, in the year when 23% thought it was too early to judge Trump's success, 29% felt his economic policies had not much effect.\n\n**Answer:** In the year when 23% thought it was too early to tell if Trump was a successful president, 29% believed his economic policies had not much effect."}

In 1998, the majority of investments were in the Seed stage, accounting for 78% of the total, with only 18% in Early Stage and 4% in Mid-Stage. By 2007, there was a notable decrease in Seed investments to 10%, while Early Stage investments increased to 74%, and Mid-Stage investments rose to 16%. This shift reflects a strategic pivot towards later-stage funding, likely driven by the need for more capital-efficient investments and a focus on scaling companies that had already demonstrated some traction. The change is visually represented in the 3D bar chart, where the Early Stage and Mid-Stage categories are highlighted with yellow arrows, indicating their growing prominence. This transition aligns with the broader trend of European venture capital moving away from early-stage risk and towards more mature companies, as evidenced by the improved performance of post-bubble vintages starting in 2004/2005. The scarcity of VC money in Europe has also driven up capital efficiency and hit rates, as investors became more selective due to limited funding availability. This strategic shift is crucial for understanding the evolving dynamics of European venture capital, where funds are now better performing and more focused on scaling established businesses rather than high-risk early-stage ventures. \n\n![Shift in investment focus from Seed to Early and Mid-Stage](image2)"}

This alignment has remained relatively stable over the past few years [7]. However, the perception of differences between the parties is significant. A majority of all Hispanics (45%) believe there is a great deal of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties, with similar views held by both Democratic-leaning (47%) and Republican-leaning (48%) Latinos [image8]. This perception of stark differences may influence their party identification, as many feel the parties have distinct approaches to issues important to them.\n\nThe economy remains the top issue for Latino registered voters, with 80% considering it very important in their voting decisions, followed closely by health care (71%), education (70%), and gun policy (66%) [2]. The importance of abortion has notably risen, with 57% now considering it very important, up from 42% in March, reflecting the impact of recent Supreme Court decisions [8].

Since the text doesn't provide this directly, we can use the overall broadband adoption rate for seniors (47%) as a proxy for men, acknowledging that the actual rate for men might be slightly lower. The gap between internet use (65%) and broadband adoption (47%) is:\n\n65% - 47% = 18%\n\nThus, the percentage gap is **18.0**.\n\n![Internet and broadband usage decreases with age](image2)"}

Germans tend to have a more favorable opinion of these organizations compared to Americans. For instance, about seven-in-ten Germans favor the EU, while only about half of Americans share this view [8]. This divide is particularly stark, with Germans showing notably higher approval ratings for the EU than Americans [4]. Similarly, while there is greater consensus on the UN and NATO, Germans still tend to think more highly of these organizations than Americans [8]. \n\nLooking at the EU, the approval ratings highlight this disparity. The image shows that 69% of Germans approve of the EU, compared to 51% of Americans, resulting in an +18% difference [image4]. This indicates a stronger support for the EU among Germans. The same pattern is observed with NATO, where 57% of Germans approve, compared to 52% of Americans, with a +5% difference [image4]. \n\nFurthermore, the image illustrates that Germans are more likely to view the U.S. as an important partner, whereas Americans are less inclined to see Germany in the same light [image7]. This suggests that while both countries recognize the importance of NATO, Germans place a higher value on the EU and NATO than Americans do. \n\nIn summary, Germans generally have a more favorable view of the EU and NATO compared to Americans, with approval ratings reflecting a significant gap in perceptions of these international organizations. \n\n![Germans have higher approval ratings for the EU and NATO compared to Americans](image4)"}

However, the data also shows that most Independents lean toward one party or the other. In 2018, 17% leaned Democratic, 13% leaned Republican, and only 7% had no lean [2][9]. This suggests that while the number of Independents has risen, the majority still have partisan leanings, which can influence their voting behavior and political views.\n\n![The percentage of people identifying as Democrats has remained relatively stable, while Republicans have slightly decreased, and Independents have grown from 33% to 38%](image4)\n\nAmong Independents, moderates continue to make up the largest share, with 43% describing themselves as moderate, 29% as conservative, and 24% as liberal [11].

However, the share of Independents who lean Republican has increased, with 51% now identifying as conservatives, up from 42% in 2000 [7]. Similarly, among Democratic-leaning Independents, the gap between moderates and liberals has narrowed, with 45% moderates and 39% liberals in 2018, compared to 50% and 30% in 2000 [4].

As the world's population grows, it leads to increased demand for resources and energy, which in turn exacerbates environmental issues. The image titled \"Global Challenges\" lists \"Increasing world population\" as one of the key facts on the left side, alongside other factors like increasing energy demand and limited energy supplies. This growth is also linked to rising pollution from human activities such as driving, farming, and manufacturing, which contribute to environmental degradation and health problems [7].\n\n2. **Increasing Energy Demand**: With a growing population, the demand for energy naturally increases. This is evident in the image that outlines \"Global Challenges,\" where \"Increasing energy demand\" is noted as a critical fact. The rising energy needs put pressure on existing resources and lead to higher emissions, contributing to problems like the greenhouse effect and global warming [3][11].\n\n3. **Limited Energy Supplies**: The same image emphasizes \"Limited energy supplies\" as another fact. This limitation forces reliance on non-renewable resources, which are finite and contribute to environmental harm. The graph in image3 shows a decline in crude availability after 2000, highlighting the strain on energy resources [3][11].\n\n4. **Environmental Effects of Energy Use**: The environmental impact of energy consumption is a major challenge. The image lists this as a fact, and it is supported by the text discussing how activities like driving increase pollutants, leading to health issues such as respiratory problems and global warming [2][4][9]. The graph in image3 also illustrates the continuous rise in CO₂ emissions, underscoring the environmental consequences of energy use [3][11].\n\nThese facts are interconnected, as seen in the image that outlines the consequences of these challenges, including the need for new technologies and efficient energy use to mitigate their impact. The increasing number of vehicles, as shown in image2 and image6, further exacerbates these challenges by contributing to higher emissions and resource consumption [8][10].\n\nIn summary, the four concrete facts of global challenges are increasing world population, increasing energy demand, limited energy supplies, and environmental effects of energy use. ![Global Challenges include increasing population, energy demand, limited supplies, and environmental impacts](image1)"}

Among self-identified Hispanics, the closer individuals are to their immigrant roots, the more likely they are to identify as Hispanic. For instance, nearly all immigrant adults from Latin America or Spain (97%) consider themselves Hispanic, and second-generation adults (the U.S.-born children of at least one immigrant parent) have a high self-identification rate of 92% [3].

This economic downturn has impacted public confidence, with the percentage of Americans seeing the U.S. as the leading economic power declining from 59% in March to 52% [1]. This decline is particularly notable among Democrats, who have become significantly less likely to see the U.S. as the top economy: 54% held this view in March, compared to 44% today [6]. Republicans, on the other hand, have maintained more stable views, though still showing a slight decrease [6].\n\nThe partisan divide in views on China's economic role has also widened.

This rapid growth was largely due to the Homestead Act of 1862, which provided settlers with 160 acres of land if they built a permanent structure and lived on it for five years [5]. The act spurred a massive influx of pioneers, transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural state. The Transcontinental Railroad, completed in 1869, further facilitated westward expansion by providing efficient transportation [5]. \n\n![Population data showing significant growth from 1870 to 1890](image2)\n\nDespite these early gains, the population began to decline after 1890, dropping to 13,330 by 1900 and continuing to fall through the mid-20th century [1]. This decline was partly due to the challenges faced by homesteaders, as nearly half of those who filed claims failed to secure land titles [5]. Additionally, the mechanization of agriculture led to farm consolidation, reducing the number of farms and altering rural life [6]. By 1997, Hamilton County had 697 farms averaging 507 acres, up from 179.7 acres in 1920 [6]. \n\n![Map of Hamilton County highlighting key communities and transportation routes](image3)\n\nThe county also saw shifts in population distribution due to economic changes and transportation patterns.

According to the data, older Americans are more likely to support such limitations. For instance, among those aged 50 and older, roughly seven-in-ten (70%) favor limiting Chinese students, while nearly two-thirds (66%) of those aged 18 to 29 oppose the idea. This generational divide is evident in the survey responses, where younger adults are more inclined to oppose restrictions, whereas older adults show stronger support. This trend aligns with broader attitudes toward China, where older Americans express more negative sentiments and concerns about China-related issues. For example, 58% of those aged 50 and older consider limiting China’s power a top priority, compared to 39% of those under 50 [9]. Additionally, older adults are more likely to describe China as an enemy, with 49% of those aged 65 and older holding this view, compared to just 20% of those under 30 [10]. These age-related differences highlight a generational gap in perceptions of China and its students in the U.S. educational system.\n\n![Survey results show generational differences in support for limiting Chinese students](image1)\n\nIn summary, age plays a crucial role in shaping opinions on limiting Chinese students, with older Americans more supportive of restrictions compared to younger adults."}

This bipartisan sentiment was reflected in the data showing that 59% of Republicans and Republican leaners wanted their leaders to work with Obama, while 36% wanted them to “stand up” to the new president [9]. Additionally, 52% of Obama voters supported appointing Republicans to his cabinet, which was double the share of Trump backers who favored Democrats in his cabinet in 2016 [3]. The overall positive sentiment is also evident in the perception of improved partisan relations, with 55% of Obama voters expecting improvements [11].\n\nBy 2016, however, the landscape had shifted. While 59% of all voters believed Democratic leaders should work with Trump to get things done, even if it meant disappointing their supporters, the partisan divide was stark.

In contrast, only 32% of Democrats or those leaning Democratic supported working with Trump, with 65% favoring standing up to him on important issues [7]. This reflects a significant decrease in Democratic support for cooperation compared to 2008, where 78% of Obama voters wanted leaders to work with Republicans [1].

The chart depicts a trend where the red segment decreases and the orange segment increases over the years. In 2011, the red segment is 83%, and in 2014, it is 54%. Assuming the red segment represents those who believe traditional values are outdated, the increase in this group from 2011 to 2014 would be calculated as follows:\n\n- In 2011: 83%\n- In 2014: 54%\n\nThe change is 54% - 83% = -29 percentage points. However, this seems counterintuitive since the text suggests an increase in those embracing modern values. It's possible the red segment represents those who disagree with the statement that traditional values are outdated. If the orange segment represents those who agree, then:\n\n- In 2011: 17% (orange)\n- In 2014: 46% (orange)\n\nThe increase would be 46% - 17% = 29 percentage points.\n\nThus, the percentage of respondents who believe traditional values are outdated increased by 29 percentage points from 2011 to 2014.\n\n![Trend of decreasing red segment and increasing orange segment from 2011 to 2014](image4)"}

Americans, for instance, tend to give high marks to South Korea and Germany for their handling of the outbreak [1]. This sentiment is reflected in the belief that the U.S. can learn from these nations. According to the survey, a significant majority of Americans think the U.S. can learn at least a fair amount from other countries about ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with fewer than two-in-ten believing the U.S. can learn not too much or nothing at all [9]. This belief is more prevalent among those with higher education levels and among liberal Democrats compared to conservative Republicans [5][8].\n\nWhen evaluating specific countries, the data shows that respondents are more likely to think the U.S. can learn from Germany and South Korea. For example, 70% of those who believe the U.S. can learn from other countries say Germany is handling the outbreak well, compared to 48% of those who think the U.S. can learn little or nothing from abroad [4]. This pattern is also evident in the perception of South Korea, where similar percentages hold [6]. The partisan divide is less pronounced for these countries compared to the U.S. and China, though Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to view both South Korea and Germany positively [11].\n\n![Trust levels among different political groups for the WHO, EU, and Chinese government](image2) highlights the varying levels of trust in international entities, but it doesn't directly address the learning potential from specific countries.

The chart shows that 70% of respondents believe the U.S. can learn from Germany, and 70% from South Korea, indicating these countries have the highest perceived learning potential. In contrast, fewer believe the U.S. can learn from China, with only 36% holding this view, reflecting the lower trust in China's handling of the outbreak [1].\n\nIn summary, Germany and South Korea are perceived as the countries from which the U.S. can learn the most, with the highest percentages of respondents believing in their effective management of the pandemic. This aligns with the broader trend where education and political affiliation influence these perceptions, with higher education levels and liberal Democrats more likely to endorse learning from other nations [5][8].\n\n**Answer:** Germany and South Korea have"}

While the provided text and image quotes do not explicitly mention specific STEM majors or their pay levels, they do highlight significant gender disparities in experiences and perceptions within STEM fields, particularly in computer jobs.\n\nFrom the text quotes, it is clear that women in computer jobs report higher rates of gender discrimination and pay inequities compared to other STEM fields. For instance, women in computer jobs are more likely to experience discrimination (74% vs. 50% of all women in STEM) and pay inequities (46% vs. 29% of all women in STEM) [7]. Additionally, women in computer jobs are more likely to perceive gender discrimination as a major problem in the tech industry (43% vs. 31% of men) [8]. These findings suggest that computer-related fields may have a notable gender gap in both employment experiences and pay perceptions.\n\nImage2 supports this by showing that women in male-dominated STEM workplaces, which are common in computer-related fields, report higher incidences of gender discrimination (78%) and sexual harassment (27%) compared to women in more balanced or women-dominated environments.

In contrast, Pop music's lower catalog stream share implies that its market dynamics are more focused on current releases, aligning with the text that Pop is mainly driven by current music [1]. This difference highlights how Rock fans are more likely to engage with older material, while Pop fans prioritize new releases. \n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that streams are 70% catalog [9], which aligns with Rock's higher catalog stream share, reinforcing its dominance in this area. The image also shows that Rock's total activity is 68%, with streams contributing significantly to this, whereas Pop's total activity is 36% [![Rock has a higher catalog share in streams compared to Pop](image3)]. This indicates that Rock's market dynamics are more reliant on its extensive catalog, while Pop's success is more dependent on new releases. \n\nIn summary, the higher catalog stream share for Rock compared to Pop reflects a market where Rock's back catalog remains popular, while Pop's market is more dynamic and focused on current hits. \n\nRock's catalog stream share is 82%, while Pop's is 58%, indicating Rock's stronger catalog presence and Pop's focus on current releases."}

This rapid growth was likely driven by the influx of settlers and the establishment of agricultural communities, as noted in the early history of the county [10]. Following the peak in 1890, the population began to decline, dropping to 13,330 in 1900 and continuing to fall through the early 20th century [2].

Image1 corroborates these findings, indicating that 43% of black respondents believe the recruitment process is fair, compared to 78% of white respondents, and 37% believe promotion opportunities are fair, compared to 75% of white respondents.\n\nThese disparities extend to concerns about workplace diversity. Black STEM workers are more likely to feel that their workplaces pay too little attention to increasing diversity, with 57% expressing this concern, compared to 15% of white respondents [11]. Image1 supports this, showing that 57% of black respondents feel insufficient attention is paid to diversity, highlighting a significant gap in perceptions between racial groups.\n\nOverall, the data and visual evidence from image1 clearly demonstrate that blacks in STEM jobs face higher rates of discrimination and have markedly different perceptions of fairness in workplace processes compared to their white counterparts.

For instance, in the GL→EN translation, pre-training leads to a substantial gain of up to 11 BLEU points, highlighting its effectiveness in improving translations for languages with limited data [2]. This is evident in Table 6, where pre-training helps capture rarer vocabulary and grammatically correct sentences, as seen in the successful translation of terms like \"chris\" and \"big lawyer\" [1]. \n\nIn contrast, higher-resource languages like PT→EN show more modest gains, around 3 BLEU points, indicating that pre-training is especially useful when baseline performance is low [2]. The table in image3 illustrates these differences, with bold numbers emphasizing notable improvements, particularly for GL→EN under \"pre\" conditions [3].\n\nMoreover, the similarity between source and target languages plays a role. For example, image2 shows that language pairs with no common family, like HE→PT, see larger improvements (+8.9) compared to more similar pairs like ES→PT (+7.0), suggesting that pre-training helps bridge gaps in dissimilar languages [9]. \n\nThe alignment of embedding spaces also enhances performance. Image4 demonstrates that aligned embeddings improve scores for some pairs, like RU→EN (+0.3), by simplifying the encoder's task in multilingual systems [10]. Image5 further supports this, showing that alignment boosts scores in multilingual setups, such as GL + PT evaluated on GL, where the \"align\" column reaches 22.4 [5].\n\nAdditionally, pre-training's benefit is more pronounced with smaller training datasets. Image7's graphs show that the BLEU gain from pre-training is higher at smaller training sizes, reinforcing the idea that it compensates for data scarcity [7].

Generate-then-Rank involves generating multiple outputs and selecting the best one, while Feedback-Guided Decoding uses continuous feedback loops to refine outputs iteratively [5][12]. This method is particularly useful for tasks requiring real-time adjustments, such as proof generation [6].\n\nPost-hoc correction occurs after the output is generated, allowing for diverse feedback types and more flexible refinement. The survey highlights three strategies: Self-Correction, Correction with External Feedback, and Multi-Agent Debate, as depicted in Figure 4. This approach is advantageous for incorporating detailed feedback without altering model parameters, making it practical for deployment [1][2][5]. The table in image3 summarizes various post-hoc methods, detailing their feedback sources, formats, and applications, indicating a wide range of studies in this area [3][9].\n\nWhile all strategies are covered, the survey emphasizes post-hoc correction for its flexibility and practicality, especially in deploying large language models. The detailed categorization and examples suggest that post-hoc correction has a significant number of representative papers, focusing on diverse feedback mechanisms and iterative refinement processes. The image5 further illustrates these strategies, showing cycles of generation, review, and refinement, which aligns with the survey's emphasis on post-hoc methods for their adaptability and effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\nIn conclusion, **post-hoc correction** has the most representative papers in the survey, as it encompasses a variety of methods and applications, leveraging diverse feedback sources and iterative refinement processes."}

This performance is notably close to the average untrained human baseline, which raises questions about the nature of BERT's learning in argument comprehension. However, further analysis indicates that this high accuracy can be attributed to BERT exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuine understanding. For instance, when tested on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these cues, BERT's performance drops significantly to 53%, aligning more closely with random guessing. This suggests that BERT's initial high accuracy is not indicative of true comprehension but rather reliance on specific patterns in the data.\n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial test set](image5) shows that when trained and evaluated on adversarial data, BERT's maximum accuracy drops to 0.533, highlighting the impact of eliminating spurious cues. Additionally, ![Table 1](image1) confirms that BERT (Large) achieves a maximum test set accuracy of 77% in its best run, though this is skewed by degenerate training cases. The median performance, a better measure, is 71.2%, still influenced by the presence of these cues. Thus, while BERT (Large) reaches 77% in its peak run, this result is not representative of robust argument comprehension.\n\nIn summary, the test set accuracy of BERT (Large) in its best run is **77%** [1], but this performance is largely due to exploiting statistical cues rather than understanding arguments."}

In the single-task model (Figure 1a), there is a single decoder that attends to the encoder's hidden states to generate the output sequence. This setup is straightforward, where the decoder focuses on the encoder's representations to produce the target sequence [11].\n\nIn contrast, the multitask model (Figure 1b) features two separate decoders, each with its own attention mechanism. Both decoders share the same encoder but attend independently to the encoder's hidden states. This means each decoder operates on the encoder's output to generate its respective target sequence, allowing the model to handle two tasks simultaneously [12]. This setup is beneficial for tasks like speech transcription and translation, where different aspects of the input need to be processed separately but share a common encoding [4].\n\n![The multitask model has two decoders attending to the encoder's states, unlike the single-task model with one decoder](image6)\n\nThe multitask architecture enables joint training of related tasks, potentially improving performance by leveraging shared representations from the encoder.

The main components are outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Image Encoder**: This component extracts feature embeddings from input images, transforming visual data into a format that can be processed and compared within the system [1][9]. The embeddings capture the essential visual characteristics of the images.\n   - **Feature Index**: The embeddings are stored and indexed for efficient retrieval. This involves creating a structured index that allows for quick access to relevant embeddings based on similarity [7][9]. The use of techniques like the HNSW algorithm helps in reducing dimensionality and speeding up the retrieval process.\n   - **Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$)**: This external storage holds the indexed embeddings, providing a repository of multimodal data that can be queried during the retrieval phase [1][9]. It acts as a memory bank that retains information for various categories beyond the immediate context window of the MLLMs.\n\n2. **Retrieving Process**:\n   - Utilizes k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to find the most similar image or text embeddings from the memory. This step is crucial for identifying potential candidates that match the input query [1][9]. The retrieval process is designed to efficiently fetch relevant information from the vast memory bank, ensuring that the most pertinent data is presented to the MLLMs for further processing.\n\n3. **Retrieving & Ranking**:\n   - **Inference Stage**: At this stage, an input image is encoded into embeddings, which are then used to retrieve the top-k similar categories from the memory [1][2][11]. This step bridges the gap between the input and the stored knowledge.\n   - **Ranking**: The retrieved categories are sent to the MLLMs, which rank them based on their relevance to the input image. The MLLMs leverage their internal knowledge and the retrieved information to make a final prediction [2][6][11]. This ranking process refines the initial retrieval results, enhancing accuracy and context-awareness.\n\n4. **Final Prediction**:\n   - The MLLMs output the predicted label after ranking the retrieved categories.

According to the text, LLMs exhibit greater proficiency in handling hard samples compared to SLMs, yet they underperform on easy samples [2]. This suggests that LLM reranking is particularly beneficial for challenging instances that require external knowledge or complex reasoning, which aligns with the hypothesis that LLMs excel on hard samples [6]. The filter-then-rerank paradigm, which uses SLMs to filter and LLMs to rerank, is designed to capitalize on this strength by reranking only the hard samples identified by SLMs [4][5][7][12].\n\n![Performance comparison with and without LLM reranking](image6) illustrates this effect. The graph for FewNERD shows that when LLM reranking is applied (blue line), there is a noticeable improvement in micro-F1 scores for samples with lower confidence scores (indicating harder samples). Conversely, for samples with higher confidence scores (easier samples), the performance without LLM reranking (pink line) remains stable or even outperforms the reranked results. This visual evidence supports the conclusion that LLM reranking enhances performance on hard samples but may not be as effective for easy samples, as the LLMs might introduce errors or overcomplicate straightforward cases [2].\n\nFurthermore, the quantitative results in [8] and [11] confirm that reranking a small fraction of hard samples leads to substantial performance boosts. For FewNERD, the filter-then-rerank method achieves significant F1 gains, especially on hard samples, which are characterized by lower confidence scores. This targeted approach minimizes latency and budget costs while maximizing the benefits of LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging instances.\n\nIn summary, LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance on the FewNERD dataset primarily for hard samples with lower confidence scores, while its impact on easy samples is less pronounced or even detrimental. The filter-then-rerank paradigm effectively leverages this dynamic to enhance overall performance with minimal additional cost."}

Similarly, for relation extraction, relation propagation is iteratively applied, and the best results are also obtained at the second iteration (M=2) [3][8]. The right graph in image5 shows that the Relation F1 score reaches its maximum at two iterations, suggesting that further iterations do not enhance performance.\n\nThe dynamic span graph framework allows for the propagation of coreference and relation confidences through the graph, iteratively refining span representations.

Tree Traversal Retrieval operates by starting at the root of the tree and progressively selecting the most relevant nodes layer-by-layer based on cosine similarity to the query embedding. This method begins with a broad perspective, considering higher-level summaries, and narrows down to more specific details as it descends through the tree. By adjusting the depth \\( d \\) and the number of nodes \\( k \\) selected at each layer, it allows for control over the specificity and breadth of the retrieved information [8][9]. For example, the tree traversal method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes, then considers their children at the next layer, repeating this process until reaching the leaf nodes, ultimately concatenating the text from all selected nodes to form the retrieved context [8].\n\nIn contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval simplifies the search by flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer, evaluating all nodes simultaneously [10]. This approach considers nodes across all layers collectively, retrieving the most relevant ones based on their cosine similarity to the query vector until a threshold number of tokens is reached [10]. The collapsed tree method offers greater flexibility, as it searches through all nodes at once, providing information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, which is particularly advantageous for questions requiring varying levels of detail [3]. \n\n![Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval mechanisms](image3) illustrates these methods: Tree Traversal (A) traverses the tree layer-by-layer, while Collapsed Tree (B) collapses the tree into a single layer for retrieval.

This difference in training time can be attributed to the efficiency of the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) approach, which, as mentioned in the text, trains much faster than character CNN models [4]. The BPE model's faster training time is likely due to its more efficient encoding method, which reduces the complexity and computational load compared to the CNN models. Additionally, the BPE model's architecture and optimization choices, such as the use of 16-bit floating point precision and optimized inter-GPU communication, contribute to its quicker training process [4]. The table also highlights that while the CNN Large model has more parameters and blocks than the CNN Base, it requires more training time, reflecting the increased computational demands of a larger model. However, the BPE Large model, with its optimized training setup, achieves a balance between model size and training efficiency.\n\n![Comparison of model parameters, updates, and training time](image8)\n\nIn summary, the BPE Large model has the shortest training time of 4.5 days, followed by the CNN Base at 6 days, and the CNN Large at 10 days."}

This means that the long-term user preferences are used to set the initial state of the GRU, which then processes the short-term browsing history to capture recent interests. As shown in the framework for LSTUR-ini, the user embedding derived from past click history is directly used to initialize the GRU cells, which sequentially process the encoded news information from the user's recent browsing history. The final user representation is the last hidden state of the GRU network. This approach leverages the long-term preferences to guide the short-term interest modeling, potentially providing a more informed starting point for the GRU to understand the user's current interests. ![LSTUR-ini initializes the GRU with long-term user embeddings](image2)\n\nOn the other hand, LSTUR-con concatenates the long-term user representation with the short-term user representation to form a unified user vector. In this method, the long-term user embedding is combined with the short-term representation obtained from the GRU processing of recent news clicks. The combined vector is then used to compute the relevance score for candidate news. This approach retains all information from both long-term and short-term representations, aiming to capture a comprehensive user profile. The framework for LSTUR-con illustrates this concatenation step, where the user-level embedding from click history is merged with a fixed user embedding before being processed alongside the news encodings. ![LSTUR-con concatenates long-term and short-term user embeddings](image2)\n\nBoth methods aim to enhance news recommendation by integrating long-term and short-term user interests, but they differ in their integration strategy: initialization versus concatenation. The experimental results suggest that both methods are effective, with LSTUR-con showing more stable performance, likely due to its ability to retain all information from both representations.

This process involves querying, retrieving relevant information, generating a response, and then judging whether further iterations are needed based on a threshold or predefined number of steps. This method is particularly useful for refining context and ensuring that the generated output is as accurate and comprehensive as possible through repeated cycles of retrieval and generation. ![Iterative retrieval alternates between retrieval and generation to refine context](image2)\n\nRecursive retrieval, on the other hand, focuses on gradually refining the user query and decomposing complex problems into sub-problems. It employs query transformation and decomposition to systematically optimize ambiguous parts of the query, making it especially effective in complex search scenarios where initial queries may not fully capture the user's needs. This approach allows for continuous learning and adaptation, often resulting in improved search outcomes by iteratively solving sub-problems and refining the query based on retrieval results. ![Recursive retrieval refines queries and decomposes problems iteratively](image2)\n\nAdaptive retrieval introduces flexibility by enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine when external knowledge retrieval is necessary. It can decide when to stop retrieval and generation, using special tokens to guide the process. This method enhances efficiency and relevance by dynamically assessing the need for additional information, thus streamlining the retrieval process and reducing redundancy. ![Adaptive retrieval decides when to retrieve based on context](image2)\n\nIn summary, Iterative retrieval enhances context through repeated cycles, Recursive retrieval refines queries and decomposes problems, and Adaptive retrieval optimizes the retrieval process by dynamically assessing information needs.

Other models, such as BiDAF and FastQA, also show improved performance after filtering, but the document-cue model's drop is particularly pronounced, underscoring its reliance on these biases. The comparison with other baselines like TF-IDF and majority-candidate-per-query-type, which have lower initial scores (43.8% and 41.2% respectively) [1], further emphasizes the document-cue model's initial strength and vulnerability to bias [image1]. After filtering, these baselines also improve, but the document-cue model's adjusted performance aligns more closely with them, demonstrating the effectiveness of the filtering process in creating a fairer evaluation environment [8].\n\n![Document-cue model's high initial accuracy and significant drop after filtering](image1)"}

This is because phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different levels of negativity, and LSTM models can capture these nuances through their recurrent transition functions. In contrast, SWEM models, which ignore word-order, struggle with such subtleties.\n\nText quote [9] further supports this by explaining that shuffling the words in the training set (to remove word-order features) and testing on the original order can help assess the importance of word-order. The results, as shown in image4, indicate that for the Yelp dataset, performance drops significantly when the training set is shuffled, confirming that word-order matters for sentiment analysis. This is consistent with the findings in text quote [11], which notes that word-order does not contribute much to topic categorization or textual entailment but is vital for sentiment analysis.\n\nImage4 provides empirical evidence: the Yelp Polarity dataset shows a noticeable drop in accuracy from 95.11 (Original) to 93.49 (Shuffled), while the Yahoo dataset remains relatively stable (72.78 vs. 72.89), and SNLI also shows minimal change (78.02 vs. 77.68). This suggests that word-order is particularly important for sentiment tasks like Yelp, where the sequence of words can alter the sentiment conveyed.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [12] notes that the LSTM model's performance on the shuffled Yelp dataset is close to SWEM's results, implying that the primary advantage of LSTM over SWEM in sentiment analysis is its ability to capture word-order features.\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly enhances sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models by allowing them to capture the nuanced relationships between words, which is critical for understanding sentiment orientations. This is evident from the performance drops observed in sentiment tasks when word-order is disrupted, as shown in image4 and supported by the text analysis. \n\n**Answer:** Word-order information is crucial for sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as it allows them to capture nuanced relationships between words, which is essential for understanding sentiment orientations. This is supported by performance drops in sentiment tasks when word-order is disrupted, as shown in image4 and text quotes ["}

According to the text, DSGAN introduces an adversarial learning framework that improves the ability to filter out false positives from noisy distant supervision datasets. This is achieved by training a generator to produce true positive samples and a discriminator to classify these samples, with the goal of reducing the discriminator's performance while improving the generator's accuracy in identifying true positives [1][2][12]. The framework is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to different architectures, such as CNN and PCNN models, leading to consistent performance gains [1][11].\n\nEmpirical results show that models incorporating DSGAN, like CNN+ONE+DSGAN and PCNN+ATT+DSGAN, achieve higher precision and recall compared to their counterparts without DSGAN. For instance, the PR curves in ![DSGAN improves precision-recall performance](image4) and ![DSGAN enhances PCNN performance](image6) demonstrate that DSGAN configurations maintain higher precision across varying recall levels. Additionally, the table in ![DSGAN boosts model performance](image8) quantifies these improvements, with bolded values indicating enhanced performance metrics and low p-values confirming statistical significance. The accuracy trends in ![Discriminator accuracy decline](image5) further illustrate that DSGAN effectively collapses the discriminator, validating the generator's robustness in identifying true positives.\n\nOverall, DSGAN's adversarial training process refines the dataset by redistributing false positives, leading to cleaner training data and improved relation extraction accuracy across different models. This is evidenced by the higher AUC values and significant p-values in the comparative evaluations [11][12].

According to the text, when repetition control is applied, the question-asking rate drops from the expected 100% to 79.67% [6]. This reduction occurs because the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram` discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, which includes common question-forming bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [6]. To mitigate this, an additional setting `z=10 (boost)` is introduced, where `extrep bigram` is not used during beam search but is applied afterward to rerank candidates. This adjustment allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with slightly increased external bigram repetition [6].\n\n![Question-asking control levels with and without repetition control](image2)\n\nThe image shows a line graph where the \"Question-controlled CT with repetition control\" line (purple) reaches a lower maximum percentage near 80% compared to the \"Question-controlled CT\" line (blue), which approaches 100%.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this high performance was largely due to the model's reliance on these cues rather than genuine understanding of argument comprehension [6]. When tested on the adversarial dataset, which mirrors the distribution of statistical cues over both labels, BERT's performance dropped to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median scores at 50%, indicating random accuracy [3][5]. This reduction demonstrates that the adversarial dataset effectively neutralizes the cues, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [5].\n\nIn contrast, other models like BoV and BiLSTM also showed reduced performance on the adversarial dataset, but their baseline accuracies were already lower than BERT's, and they did not exhibit the same level of cue exploitation [3][5]. The adversarial dataset thus serves as a critical tool for assessing true comprehension capabilities, as it forces models to rely on understanding rather than statistical shortcuts [2][3]. The architecture of the models, as depicted in ![Model architecture with logits and softmax](image2), suggests that BERT's ability to exploit subtle cues is more pronounced, which is why the adversarial transformation has a more dramatic effect on its performance [12].\n\nThe comparison of performance metrics in ![Performance metrics for different models](image5) and ![Adversarial performance metrics](image6) further illustrates this point. BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset aligns with random guessing, whereas other models, while also affected, do not show the same sharp decline from their original performance [5][6]. This underscores the importance of adversarial datasets in evaluating the robustness of models and highlights the need for more rigorous testing to ensure that high performance is not merely a result of exploiting dataset biases [3][5].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial transformation reveals that BERT's initial high performance was largely due to exploiting spurious cues, and it significantly reduces its accuracy to random levels, whereas other models, though also affected, do not show the same extent of performance drop. This transformation is crucial for a fair assessment of argument comprehension abilities across models."}

However, when \\( p \\) becomes too large, performance declines, as the useful information in LTUR is not effectively incorporated [7].

By leveraging the rich contextual embeddings from the BiLSTM, the model can effectively refine span representations, enhancing its performance in tasks such as entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution. The iterative propagation of information across the graph, as illustrated in the diagram, builds upon these initial token-level representations to incorporate broader contextual information, ultimately improving the model's ability to capture complex semantic relationships within the text.\n\nIn summary, the sentence-level BiLSTM is integral to the DYGIE model as it provides the initial contextualized token embeddings necessary for span enumeration and subsequent graph-based information propagation."}

This improvement is consistent across different rungs of difficulty, with CAUSALCoT outperforming vanilla GPT-4 in all three rungs, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling increasingly complex queries [5]. \n\n![Performance comparison of models across different rungs](image7) highlights these improvements, showing CAUSALCoT achieving the highest accuracy in each rung, especially in Rung 3, where the complexity is highest. Additionally, CAUSALCoT excels in handling anti-commonsensical and nonsensical data, improving by 9.65 points on the anti-commonsensical subset compared to the original GPT-4 [3]. This indicates that CAUSALCoT is particularly beneficial for unseen data, addressing the data contamination problem common in LLM evaluations.\n\nThe fine-grained error analysis in ![Error analysis across different steps](image2) reveals that while GPT-4 performs well in extracting causal graphs (Step 1), it struggles with formal causal reasoning in Steps 3 and 5. CAUSALCoT mitigates these weaknesses, as evidenced by the improved scores in these steps. The heatmap in ![Heatmap of query type helpfulness](image3) further illustrates how different query types support each other, suggesting that CAUSALCoT's structured approach aids in leveraging these relationships effectively.\n\nIn summary, CAUSALCoT not only boosts overall accuracy but also enhances GPT-4's ability to handle diverse and complex causal reasoning tasks, making it a valuable enhancement for improving LLM performance in formal reasoning domains."}

Leaf nodes are typically the endpoints of these relations, where no further connections extend from them.\n\nIn the provided image description, the knowledge graph connects Orazio Gentileschi and Artemisia Gentileschi with various attributes such as occupation, style, and place of birth. The arrows in the graph represent the relationships between these entities and their properties. For instance, the arrow from Orazio Gentileschi to \"painter\" indicates his occupation, and the arrow from Artemisia Gentileschi to \"Baroque\" indicates her association with the Baroque style.\n\nUpon examining the image, we observe that some arrows point to leaf nodes, which are the specific attributes like \"painter\" or \"Baroque.\" However, the arrows that connect the entities to their citizenship (e.g., \"Italian\") also point to leaf nodes. The key distinction lies in identifying any arrows that might point to intermediate nodes rather than leaf nodes. In this case, all arrows seem to point directly to leaf nodes, as they represent direct attributes or classifications without further branching.\n\nTherefore, based on the description, there are no relation arrows in Figure 1 that do not point to specific leaf nodes.

Amazon-AWS derives 17% of its energy from renewables and 30% from coal, while Microsoft uses 32% renewables and 31% coal. This means Microsoft has a slightly higher renewable energy usage and a comparable coal dependency to Amazon-AWS. \n\nThe implications of these distributions on CO2 emissions are significant. Higher coal usage typically results in greater carbon emissions due to coal's high carbon intensity. Since Amazon-AWS and Microsoft both rely heavily on coal, their CO2 emissions are likely substantial. However, Microsoft's slightly higher renewable energy percentage could lead to marginally lower emissions compared to Amazon-AWS. \n\nThe U.S. breakdown of energy sources, which is comparable to Amazon-AWS, suggests that the CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour for these services might be similar to the national average, as noted in [5].

For instance, when R-GCN is removed, the model's accuracy drops by 8.0 points compared to when it is included with GloVe embeddings [3]. This highlights the importance of R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relational context, which is essential for the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, the text notes that without R-GCN, the model's performance is lower than that of the Coref-GRU model, emphasizing the unique contribution of R-GCN to the model's capabilities [3].\n\nIn the masked setting, the impact is even more pronounced. The text mentions that replacing ELMo with GloVe and removing R-GCN results in a significant drop in performance, with the model essentially guessing randomly due to the lack of context and coreference resolution [8]. This is further supported by the image quotes, particularly image4, which shows a table of model performances. The \"GloVe w/o R-GCN\" row in the table indicates a drastic drop in accuracy to 11.6 in the masked setting, compared to 51.2 in the unmasked setting, underscoring the critical role of R-GCN in handling masked data where coreference resolution is not applied [4].\n\nAdditionally, the text highlights that the model's performance without R-GCN is lower than when using a naive graph construction (No relation types), suggesting that the R-GCN's ability to leverage relational information is vital for the task [6].

The study highlights that the filter-then-rerank paradigm consistently improves performance by leveraging the strengths of both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, SLMs act as filters to identify difficult samples, which are then reranked by LLMs using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to enhance accuracy.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that the filter-then-rerank approach yields an average F1 gain of 2.4% across multiple few-shot information extraction (IE) tasks. This improvement is achieved by reranking only a small subset of hard samples, which significantly boosts performance despite the limited number of samples reranked. For instance, Table 3 in the study shows that with InstructGPT as the reranker, the method provides an average F1 gain of 2.4% without SLM ensemble (Lines 4 vs. 7), confirming the effectiveness of LLM reranking.\n\n![Performance comparison of filter-then-rerank on TACREV](image1) illustrates the performance of GPT-4 and InstructGPT on the TACREV dataset before and after applying the filter-then-rerank method. For InstructGPT, the performance improves from 33.8 to 43.4, a gain of 9.6, which aligns with the reported average improvement.

Word-level embeddings provide semantic representations of words, which are essential for understanding the meaning and context of words in a sentence. However, word embeddings alone may not capture morphological variations or subword information, which is where character-level embeddings come in. Character-level embeddings allow the model to handle variations in word forms, such as capitalization patterns and morphological changes, which are important for identifying named entities accurately. \n\nFor instance, the hierarchical CRF model described in the text [12] includes a character-level neural network, either an RNN or a CNN, to capture subword information. This is particularly useful for languages with rich morphology or for handling out-of-vocabulary words. By concatenating the character representation with the word embedding, the model can leverage both the semantic meaning of the word and its structural characteristics. This dual approach enhances the model's ability to recognize named entities by providing a more comprehensive representation of each word.\n\n![The model architecture includes both character and word embeddings, enhancing NER performance by capturing subword and semantic information.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that during NER model training, unnormalized word embeddings are used because they convey frequency information, which is important for identifying named entities that appear less frequently in the corpus [3]. This combination of word and character embeddings, along with the use of self-attention mechanisms, helps the model achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance in cross-lingual settings with lower resource requirements [8]. The self-attention mechanism further allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input, improving its understanding of word relationships and context.\n\nIn summary, using both word-level and character-level embeddings enables the model to effectively capture both semantic and subword information, leading to improved performance in NER tasks."}

In 2010, the concept of a \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" was introduced, which conceptualized semantic vectors for words across different time spans, allowing for the quantitative comparison of word meanings over time [1]. This foundational work laid the groundwork for subsequent research.\n\nBy 2011, the Google Ngrams corpus became a pivotal resource, enabling researchers to explore semantic changes by comparing word meanings across decades. This dataset spurred the field of \"culturomics,\" as it provided a large-scale view of language evolution [12]. The following year, in 2012, the challenge of \"Word epoch disambiguation\" was addressed, focusing on identifying the time periods to which specific word contexts belong, highlighting the need for precise temporal analysis [3].\n\nIn 2013, the shift towards \"Prediction-based models\" began, with methods like Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) gaining prominence. These models improved the accuracy of capturing semantic shifts by leveraging prediction-based word embeddings [10]. The year 2014 saw the widespread adoption of \"Word embeddings,\" exemplified by tools like word2vec, which further enhanced the ability to model word meanings dynamically [10].\n\n2015 was marked by the development of \"Models alignment,\" which involved finding temporal equivalents for words across different periods, such as aligning \"Obama\" in 2015 with \"Trump\" in 2017, demonstrating the application of cross-time alignment techniques [3]. The use of large corpora like the New York Times (NYT) and the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) in 2016 allowed for more nuanced analysis of semantic changes, with yearly and decade-long slices providing granular insights [8].\n\nIn 2017, several critical insights emerged. Researchers identified \"Laws of semantic change,\" such as the \"law of prototypicality,\" which posits that words with higher prototypicality are less likely to undergo semantic shifts [6]. Additionally, it was noted that local measures were more effective for detecting cultural shifts, and the English Gigaword corpus was employed to study cultural semantic drift related to armed conflicts [8].

According to the text, removing the abstract from the input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance [8]. This suggests that the abstract provides critical contextual information that aids in capturing document-level relatedness. Conversely, adding author names as an input, along with the title and abstract, actually hurts performance. This could be due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them, or because tokenization using Wordpieces might split author names into sub-words that are not semantically related [8]. Additionally, adding venue information slightly decreases performance on most tasks, except for document classification, where it makes sense as venues are expected to have high correlation with document content [8].\n\nThe image `![Table showing performance metrics for different SPECTER configurations](image1)` illustrates these findings. The table shows that the base SPECTER model performs best overall. Removing the abstract (\"− abstract\") leads to lower scores across all metrics, confirming the importance of the abstract. Adding author information (\"+ author\") results in a decrease in performance, aligning with the text's explanation. Including venue information (\"+ venue\") improves the CLS (classification) metric but slightly reduces performance in other areas, which is consistent with the text's observation that venues are more relevant for classification tasks.\n\nFurthermore, the text highlights that the citation-based pretraining objective is critical for SPECTER's performance; removing it and using a vanilla SciBERT results in decreased performance on all tasks [3]. This underscores the importance of leveraging citation information for document-level representation learning in scientific documents.\n\nIn summary, the abstract is crucial for performance, while author names and venues have mixed impacts depending on the task. The inclusion of hard negatives and the use of SciBERT as the base model are also vital for SPECTER's effectiveness [2].

This method can lead to a more precise but potentially biased distribution due to reliance on ground truth labels, which might not fully capture the model's understanding of the data. Conversely, the pseudo-label-based map (image1 part c) uses the model's predictions to determine confidence, which is a label-free approach and better suited for active learning scenarios. \n\nThe pseudo-label map is designed to identify hard-to-contrast data, which are typically located in areas of medium confidence and higher variability. This suggests that the pseudo-label map may exhibit a larger confidence variance because it reflects the model's uncertainty across different clusters, capturing a broader range of data characteristics without manual intervention.

The results in ![Adversarial test performance](image5) confirm that BERT's performance on this dataset is essentially random, with mean scores around 50%, supporting the conclusion that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension [9][12].\n\nIn summary, BERT's test performance is high on the original dataset due to exploiting statistical cues, but it drops to random levels on the adversarial dataset, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods. \n\nBERT's test performance is significantly higher on the original dataset but drops to random levels on the adversarial dataset, indicating reliance on spurious cues rather than true comprehension."}

According to the text, the collapsed tree approach consistently outperforms tree traversal, offering greater flexibility by evaluating all nodes simultaneously rather than layer-by-layer [6]. This flexibility allows the collapsed tree to retrieve information at the appropriate level of granularity for a given question, which is crucial for maintaining relevance and comprehensiveness [2]. The text also notes that the collapsed tree method was found to be superior on the QASPER dataset subset, leading to its selection for further experiments [5].\n\nThe image ![Collapsed tree outperforms tree traversal across context lengths](image8) visually supports this finding, showing that the collapsed tree method achieves higher F1 scores across different context lengths, peaking at 2000 tokens.

This aligns with the text's explanation that tree traversal maintains a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details, which may not adapt as effectively to varying question requirements [6].\n\nFurthermore, the text emphasizes that the collapsed tree's ability to flatten the multi-layered tree into a single layer for comparison enhances its efficiency and effectiveness [4]. While the collapsed tree requires cosine similarity search on all nodes, advancements in libraries like FAISS can mitigate computational challenges [7]. The qualitative study using the Cinderella fairytale also highlights RAPTOR's advantage in selecting nodes from different layers, matching the question's detail level, which is a key strength of the collapsed tree approach [2].\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree method consistently achieves higher F1 scores across different context lengths due to its ability to retrieve information at the correct granularity, as evidenced by both the image and text evidence. The tree traversal method, while offering control over specificity and breadth, does not adapt as effectively to varying question needs, resulting in lower performance.\n\n**Answer:** The collapsed tree method consistently achieves higher F1 scores across different context lengths compared to tree traversal, as it allows for more flexible retrieval of information at the appropriate level of granularity."}

The exam covers the entire recruiting life cycle, emphasizing the importance of effective network searching alongside job posting skills [6]. Understanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings is highlighted as a fundamental skill, even with next-gen tools that simplify searching [4]. This aligns with the need to master search techniques, as seen in the Venn diagram example [7], which illustrates how Boolean logic can refine candidate searches. For instance, the search string \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" [2] would target individuals skilled in both Engineering and Java but exclude those in managerial roles, as depicted in the Venn diagram where overlapping sections represent combined skills [image7]. The diagram shows subsets like \"E\" for Engineering and Java, and \"G\" for all three categories, excluding those labeled as \"Manager\" [image7]. Additionally, the certification curriculum stresses the importance of optimizing actions in LinkedIn Recruiter, such as using the Talent Pipeline to source talent efficiently [9], and mastering tools for organization and collaboration [image4]. The image of the certification advertisement [image3] underscores the structured learning path available, while the puzzle image [image2] metaphorically represents the problem-solving aspect of recruiting. By focusing on these areas, candidates can enhance their efficiency and impact in talent acquisition, as evidenced by success stories from certified professionals [12]. \n\nIn summary, candidates should concentrate on search techniques, talent pipeline management, and effective use of LinkedIn tools, with Boolean logic being a critical component for precise candidate identification. ![Venn diagram illustrating skill intersections](image7)"}

This indicates how efficiently the device can dissipate heat to the ambient environment and to its case, respectively. On the other hand, the 8751BH, which is an EPROM version, might have different thermal characteristics due to its manufacturing process and package type. The table in image5 shows that the 8751BH could have a θja of 46°C/W and a θjc of 15°C/W, suggesting slightly higher thermal resistance compared to the 8051AH in certain configurations. \n\nThese differences are important for designers to consider, as they affect the device's ability to manage heat under various operating conditions. Higher thermal resistance values mean the device may require additional cooling measures or careful thermal design to maintain reliable operation. \n\n![Thermal resistance data for various parts](image5)\n\nIn summary, the 8051AH generally has lower thermal resistance values compared to the 8751BH, indicating better heat dissipation capabilities. However, specific values can vary based on the package type and configuration, as detailed in the thermal resistance table."}

Homologous chromosomes, which are pairs of chromosomes that are similar in size, shape, and genetic content, align at the metaphase plate. This alignment is crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes during the subsequent stages of meiosis. The chromosomes are held in place by the spindle fibers, which attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each homologous pair, reducing the chromosome number by half, as mentioned in text [5]. \n\nThe alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate is a critical step for ensuring genetic diversity, as it allows for the independent assortment of chromosomes. This is further supported by the diagram in image2, which illustrates the metaphase I stage, showing homologous chromosomes positioned centrally, ready to separate. Additionally, the diagram in image6 highlights the metaphase plate and the alignment of chromosomes, emphasizing the importance of this stage in maintaining the correct distribution of genetic material.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of tetrads during prophase I, where homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through crossing over, is a precursor to metaphase I. This process is depicted in image6, where sites of crossing over are shown, leading to genetic recombination. The chromosomes, consisting of sister chromatids connected by a centromere as illustrated in image3, are now fully condensed and visible under a microscope, as described in text [9].\n\nIn summary, Metaphase I is characterized by the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, attachment to spindle fibers, and preparation for their separation in the next phase, ensuring the reduction of chromosome number and genetic diversity.\n\n![Metaphase I: Homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate](image2)  \n![Chromosomes align along the metaphase plate](image6)  \n![Chromosomes with sister chromatids connected by a centromere](image3)"}

In telophase, the nuclear membrane begins to re-form around the separated sets of chromosomes, which have moved to opposite ends of the cell. This reformation marks the end of mitosis, as the chromosomes are now enclosed within their respective nuclei. The nucleoli also reappear, indicating the resumption of normal cellular functions [2][8][11]. \n\nCytokinesis follows closely, where the cytoplasm divides to form two daughter cells. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms at the cell's midpoint, as shown in the image depicting the contracting ring of microfilaments [image6]. This furrow deepens until the cell splits into two. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle from vesicles containing cell wall material, which grows outward to divide the contents into two cells [10]. \n\nThe image illustrating telophase and cytokinesis highlights these processes, with colors indicating different cellular components like chromosomes and the mitotic spindle [image8]. The metaphase plate and spindle fibers, visible in another image, play crucial roles in aligning and separating chromosomes during earlier stages, ensuring accurate distribution during telophase [image2][image4][image7]. \n\nThus, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear membrane re-forms, nucleoli reappear, and the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.\n\n![Cell undergoing telophase and cytokinesis, with reformation of nuclear membranes and division of cytoplasm](image8)"}

Gregor Mendel discovered that parents pass heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [4]. In a monohybrid cross, such as the one involving purple and white flowers, the parental generation consists of homozygous dominant (PP) and homozygous recessive (pp) plants [11]. When these plants produce gametes, the homozygous PP plant contributes only P alleles, while the homozygous pp plant contributes only p alleles [image1]. The F1 generation, resulting from the cross, is heterozygous (Pp) and displays the dominant purple phenotype [image4].\n\nIn the F2 generation, the heterozygous F1 plants (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles [image1]. When these gametes combine, the offspring exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white, and a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp [image4]. This segregation of alleles demonstrates Mendel's law of segregation, where each parent contributes one allele to the offspring, leading to the reappearance of the recessive trait in the F2 generation [11]. The image illustrates this process, showing how dominant (P) and recessive (p) alleles interact to produce the observed ratios [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the concept of dominant and recessive alleles is further clarified by images showing different traits, such as earlobes [image2] and freckles [image5], where dominant traits (e.g., free earlobe, freckles) mask recessive traits (e.g., attached earlobe, no freckles) in heterozygous individuals. The chromosome representation in image3 highlights the presence of dominant alleles, reinforcing how these alleles influence phenotypic expression. Pedigree charts, as shown in image6 and image7, trace the inheritance of traits through generations, illustrating how genotypes like Ff and ff are passed down, affecting phenotypes.\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the F2 generation's ratios by the segregation and independent assortment of alleles, resulting in predictable phenotypic and genotypic outcomes based on dominant and recessive interactions.\n\n![Mendelian inheritance diagram showing F1 and F2 generations](image1"}

This new legislation, replacing the older Libel and Defamation Act, introduces a more nuanced approach to defamation, emphasizing the protection of freedom of expression while addressing malicious publications. According to the Defamation Act, 2022, No. 15 of 2022, Section 18 outlines conditions under which publication in news media is privileged unless malice is proven. This means that media outlets are generally protected from defamation claims unless it can be demonstrated that they acted with malice. The law specifies that this privilege does not extend to illegal publications or those not in the public interest, ensuring a balance between freedom of the press and the protection of individuals' reputations. \n\n![The table provides information about defamation law in Belize](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the law is noted to be rarely enforced, as highlighted in the US State Department’s 2022 Report on International Religious Freedom. This suggests that while the legal framework exists, its practical application is limited, potentially reflecting a broader trend of prioritizing freedom of expression over strict enforcement of defamation laws. The shift to the Defamation Act, 2022, marks a move towards aligning with international standards that favor freedom of speech, provided it is exercised responsibly. \n\nIn summary, Belize's legal landscape for defamation has evolved to prioritize media privilege and public interest, with a focus on preventing malicious actions rather than broadly restricting speech, and this law is typically unenforced."}

This is depicted in image2, which outlines various techniques such as **Active stakeholder participation**, **High-level requirements specification**, and **Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)**. These methods ensure that the team captures the necessary details to build a solution that meets stakeholder expectations. For instance, **Active stakeholder participation** allows for real-time feedback and clarification, while **ATDD** focuses on creating executable tests that serve as specifications, aligning with the text quote [11] that emphasizes the use of acceptance tests over traditional documents.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Elicitation Methods' are more about the techniques used to extract and document these needs. Image4 highlights strategies like **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming** and **Look-ahead modeling**, which are part of the elicitation process. These methods help in breaking down complex requirements into manageable pieces, ensuring that the team understands the nuances of what stakeholders need. The text quote [6] mentions the importance of support for product owners in complex domains, which is facilitated by these elicitation methods, especially when stakeholders are geographically distributed.\n\nBoth strategies are interconnected. 'Needs Exploration' sets the stage by engaging stakeholders and defining the scope, while 'Elicitation Methods' provide the tools to delve deeper into specific requirements. For example, during the **Inception** phase shown in image3, initial requirements are gathered, and as the project progresses into **Construction**, techniques like **Look-ahead modeling** (from image4) help in refining these requirements iteratively. This iterative approach is supported by the text quote [12], which states that DAD provides a decision framework to tailor strategies contextually.\n\nIn summary, 'Needs Exploration' focuses on the broader engagement and initial capture of requirements, whereas 'Elicitation Methods' are the detailed techniques used to extract and clarify these needs. Together, they ensure that stakeholder requirements are thoroughly understood and effectively addressed throughout the agile development lifecycle. \n\n![Diagram illustrating various strategies for needs exploration](image2) ![Mind map on elicitation methods in agile project management](image4)"}

According to the text, a siloed approach is identified as the greatest barrier [4], where departments operate in isolation, leading to misaligned goals and a lack of cohesive strategy. This is supported by image6, which highlights that \"There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals\" as a significant challenge, with 52% of respondents citing this issue. Additionally, the lack of resources and technical infrastructure are also major hurdles, with 36% and 28% of respondents respectively noting these as barriers [6].\n\nFurthermore, the text emphasizes the importance of leadership commitment and guidance for sustainable growth across various business groups [8], indicating that management and cultural issues are critical. Image6 further underscores this by showing that siloed structures (\"We are too siloed by business line/product/brand\") are a common problem, affecting 46% of organizations. The absence of a unified approach to customer management is compounded by the difficulty in measuring the influence of activities on customer behavior, as noted by 27% of respondents [6].\n\nAnother key barrier is the over-reliance on quantitative metrics and the neglect of qualitative data, such as customer sentiment and engagement [2][7]. This is reflected in the text's mention of the need to balance quantitative and qualitative insights to understand customer behavior effectively [1][11]. The complexity of marketing metrics, where traditional methods fail to capture engagement and sentiment, exacerbates the challenge [1][2]. Image3 illustrates the common practice of attributing campaign performance to the last click (52%), which oversimplifies the customer journey and overlooks the influence of earlier interactions.\n\nLastly, the text stresses the importance of investing in people, skills, and processes, with 90% of efforts needing to focus on these areas [11]. This aligns with the need for a customer-focused approach, as seen in image2, where 44% of organizations prioritize customer focus over product/brand focus (35%). The lack of a 360-degree view of customer behavior and activities further hinders integration [2], as organizations often drown in data without actionable insights [2].\n\nIn summary, the major barriers include siloed organizational structures, lack of leadership commitment, insufficient resources and infrastructure, over-reliance on simplistic attribution models, and inadequate measurement of customer engagement.

For instance, if your arm is not at the same height as your heart, the measurement results may be lower [8]. Additionally, sitting cross-legged, on a low sofa, or in front of a low table can exert pressure on your abdomen, leading to higher measurement results [10]. It's crucial to ensure that your arm is steady, bent, and your palm is facing your chest with a naturally relaxed hand [9]. Avoid clenching your fist, as this can also impact the results. \n\n![Incorrect postures for blood pressure measurement](image4) illustrates various incorrect positions, such as placing the watch below the heart or in postures that apply pressure to the abdomen, which should be avoided. Furthermore, measuring while standing, lying down, or in a moving vehicle can lead to inaccurate readings [7]. Always rest for 5 minutes before starting the measurement and keep your body naturally relaxed [7]. \n\nIf you experience discomfort due to excessive airbag inflation, stop the measurement immediately to deflate the airbag or unfasten the strap [2]. Also, ensure the airbag and strap are correctly installed and suitable for your wrist size [10].

The process is divided into two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, while in meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. \n\nIn meiosis I, as depicted in image5, homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate and then separate, moving to opposite poles of the cell. This is shown in the blue box labeled \"MEIOSIS I: Homologous chromosomes separate\" [5]. The stages include prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I, where the key event is the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half [11]. This is further illustrated in image4, which highlights the alignment of chromosomes and the sites of crossing over, emphasizing the separation of homologous chromosomes [4].\n\nIn contrast, meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, similar to mitosis. Image6 shows the stages of anaphase II and telophase II, where chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles, forming two new nuclei [6]. The diagram and microscope images in image6 clearly depict the separation of sister chromatids, resulting in four haploid daughter cells, each with a single set of chromosomes [11]. This is also supported by image2, which illustrates the cleavage furrow and the formation of haploid daughter cells, emphasizing the completion of cell division [2].\n\nThe key difference lies in the type of chromosome separation: meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids. This is visually represented in image4, where the stages of meiosis I and II are labeled, showing the transition from homologous chromosome separation to sister chromatid separation [4]. Additionally, image3 provides a diagram of a duplicated chromosome, highlighting the sister chromatids connected by a centromere, which are the structures that separate during meiosis II [3].\n\nIn summary, meiosis I reduces the chromosome number by separating homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II ensures each daughter cell receives one chromatid from each pair, resulting in four genetically distinct haploid cells. This process is crucial for producing gametes, as shown in image2, where the final haploid cells are formed [5].\n\n**Answer:** Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number, while meiosis II separates sister chromat"}

In standard consumption contexts, this is evident in everyday scenarios, such as eating hot dogs. For instance, the first hot dog might provide a high level of satisfaction, but as more are consumed, the enjoyment diminishes, and eventually, consuming additional hot dogs could lead to negative utility due to discomfort or overindulgence. This is illustrated in image8, where the utility from each hot dog decreases significantly after the third, turning negative by the sixth hot dog. The table shows a clear pattern of diminishing returns, with the utility dropping from +10 for the first hot dog to -10 for the sixth [image8].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the dynamics can differ. Image1 provides a vivid example of this contrast. While the left side of the image shows diminishing marginal utility in a typical consumption scenario, the right side introduces a \"differential outcome\" where utility spikes dramatically at 64 hot dogs, from -50 to +5000. This spike represents a competitive goal, such as winning a hot dog eating contest, where the utility is not just about enjoyment but about achieving a specific target. The person holding the tray of hot dogs, labeled as tying a competitor in a championship, highlights how competitive goals can override the usual diminishing returns, turning a negative utility experience into a highly positive one due to the achievement of a competitive milestone [image1].\n\nThis distinction is further supported by text quote [2], which emphasizes that variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences, suggesting that in non-competitive settings, switching activities might be beneficial. However, in competitive scenarios, as noted in text quote [9], the cumulative effect of focus can be advantageous. The graph in image6 also underscores this by showing how early and focused practice hours lead to significant differences in skill levels among violinists, indicating that sustained focus in competitive contexts can lead to mastery and high utility despite diminishing returns in standard consumption [image6].\n\nIn summary, while standard consumption economics often sees diminishing marginal utility as a reason to diversify activities, competitive contexts can transform the utility curve through focused goals and achievements, turning what might otherwise be a negative experience into a highly rewarding one."}

Ecuador's export volume is likely one of the prominent bars, given its status as a major banana exporter. The chart's design uses proximity, grouping years close together to highlight trends over time. This visual grouping helps viewers perceive the data as a continuous pattern, making it easier to identify changes in export volumes. For instance, if Ecuador's bars show a consistent or increasing height over the years, it suggests a stable or growing export trend.\n\nIn contrast, ![Time spent on weekends in 2005 and 2010](image4) illustrates how time was spent on weekends using pie charts shaped like clock faces. The chart for 2005 shows that 35% of time was spent with family and friends, while in 2010, this decreased to 21%. The use of similarity in the pie chart design, with consistent segments for different activities, allows viewers to easily compare the two years. The reduction in the \"With family and friends\" segment from 35% to 21% indicates a significant shift in leisure activities.\n\nBy applying the law of proximity, both charts group related data points (years for exports, activities for weekend time) to create a coherent visual narrative. The law of similarity further aids in comparing trends by maintaining consistent visual elements across different data sets. Thus, while Ecuador's banana exports may show growth or stability, the time spent with family and friends decreased, reflecting a shift in societal behavior over the same period.\n\nIn summary, Ecuador's banana exports likely remained stable or increased, whereas time spent with family and friends decreased from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010."}

It consists of two main stages: interphase and the mitotic phase (M phase). Interphase is further divided into three sub-phases: G₁, S, and G₂. During the G₁ phase, the cell grows and increases in cytoplasm [2]. The S phase is crucial for DNA replication, where chromosomes duplicate [1][7]. In the G₂ phase, the cell continues to grow and prepares for division [2]. The mitotic phase includes mitosis, where the nucleus divides, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two daughter cells [4][12].\n\n![The cell cycle diagram shows interphase and mitotic phase with sub-phases](image1) illustrates this cycle, highlighting the progression from interphase to mitosis and cytokinesis. During interphase, chromosomes are duplicated in the S phase, as shown in ![Chromosomes are visible and duplicated during interphase](image8), where the nucleolus is also present, indicating ribosome assembly. As the cell enters mitosis, chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, as seen in ![Chromosomes condense during prophase](image4), and the mitotic spindle forms. The centromere, a critical structure for chromosome separation, is highlighted in ![Chromosome with centromere and segregation](image2), where sister chromatids are joined and later separate during division.\n\nIn prometaphase, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and microtubules attach to kinetochores, as depicted in ![Prometaphase with spindle attachment](image5). This ensures chromosomes are properly aligned and distributed to daughter cells. The entire process is cyclic, as shown in ![Stages of mitosis from interphase to prometaphase](image6), emphasizing the preparation and execution of cell division. Each stage and sub-phase is essential for maintaining genetic integrity and enabling cell proliferation.\n\nIn summary, the main stages of the cell cycle are interphase (G₁, S, G₂) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), each with specific functions critical for cell division."}
