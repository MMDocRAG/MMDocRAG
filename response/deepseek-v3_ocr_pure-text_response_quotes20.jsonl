The dialogue state, along with the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker \\( v_k \\), and the encoding of the query results summary \\( E_k \\), are passed to the policy network. The policy network then emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act, such as \"confirm date\" [5].\n\nThe emitted system action is used to formulate a natural language response by combining the outputs from the state tracker and the retrieved Knowledge Base (KB) entities. A template-based Natural Language Generator (NLG) is employed, where delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced with values from the estimated user goal or the KB entities, depending on the system action [6]. \n\nFor example, if the user requests information about a movie, the system might generate a query to the KB to retrieve relevant details, such as the movie title, time, and theater.

For example, on the QASPER dataset, RAPTOR’s hierarchical nodes enable it to synthesize information across NLP papers, outperforming BM25 by up to 10.2 points in F-1 scores [6]. ![RAPTOR outperforms BM25 and DPR across all language models on QASPER](image1)\n\nFurther, RAPTOR’s intermediate layers and clustering mechanisms enhance its retrieval accuracy. An ablation study on the QuALITY dataset demonstrates that the balanced tree-style encoding and summarization of contiguous chunks significantly improve performance over simpler methods [11]. This is reflected in RAPTOR’s accuracy improvements of at least 2.0% over BM25 and DPR across datasets like QuALITY and QASPER [3][5]. ![RAPTOR achieves higher accuracy on QuALITY and QASPER datasets](image5)\n\nFinally, RAPTOR sets new benchmarks when compared to state-of-the-art models. For instance, it achieves a 55.7% F-1 score on QASPER with GPT-4, surpassing CoLTS5 XL’s 53.9% [10]. This consistent outperformance across datasets and metrics underscores the effectiveness of RAPTOR’s structured retrieval approach. ![RAPTOR sets new benchmarks on QASPER compared to state-of-the-art models](image7) In summary, RAPTOR’s hierarchical tree structure and advanced clustering mechanisms enable it to outperform traditional retrieval methods and set new performance benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics and datasets."}

For example, the pair Galician-Portuguese (GL/PT), which shares high linguistic similarity, shows the largest gains, while the less similar pair Belarusian-Russian (BE/RU) shows minimal improvement or even a slight decrease [11]. This is because more similar languages have more aligned semantic neighborhoods, making pre-trained embeddings more effective [3].\n\n![Similar language pairs benefit more from pre-training](image5)\n\nIn summary, pre-training enhances translation accuracy, particularly for low-resource languages with moderate baseline performance, and it is more effective for language pairs with higher linguistic similarity."}

For instance, when DOC-BASED connections are removed (No DOC-BASED), the model's accuracy drops to 62.9% (unmasked) and 65.8% (masked) [7].

For instance, adding \"pretty\" to \"doctor\" in the sentence \"The pretty doctor asked the nurse to help her in the operation\" improved the likelihood of a female translation. Table 4 shows this improvement, with Spanish accuracy increasing from 53.1% to 63.5% [5]. ![Improvement in accuracy with added adjectives](image7)\n\nHowever, this method is impractical for general use as it assumes perfect coreference resolution and introduces artificial signals. Moreover, the overall performance of MT systems remains heavily biased, as shown in Table 2, where most systems struggle with gender accuracy across languages, with German being an exception due to its similarity to English [1]. ![Performance of MT systems on WinoMT corpus](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments can temporarily mitigate gender bias in specific cases, but they are not a comprehensive solution. These adjustments highlight the deep-rooted biases in MT systems, which require more robust, context-aware methods for accurate and unbiased translations."}

Single-hop models, such as single-paragraph BERT, achieve competitive performance (67.08 F1) on standard distractors, even outperforming some multi-hop models [6]. However, their accuracy declines sharply when tested on adversarial distractors (46.84 F1) or when filtering by entity type (40.73 F1) [1][4][10]. Re-training the model on adversarial distractors can partially recover this performance, increasing F1 to 60.10 [4].\n\nIn multi-hop QA tasks, single-paragraph BERT struggles with context-dependent and multi-hop questions, achieving near-chance accuracy on comparison questions [7]. Open-domain settings further exacerbate this issue, as standard TF-IDF retrieval often fails to retrieve necessary gold paragraphs, leading to lower F1 scores (39.12 with 500 distractors) [8]. However, providing gold paragraphs boosts performance to 53.12 F1, highlighting the critical role of evidence retrieval in multi-hop QA [8].\n\nEvaluation strategies also play a crucial role. For instance, humans can answer over 80% of multi-hop questions even when one gold paragraph is withheld, suggesting that current datasets may not fully necessitate multi-hop reasoning [6][11]. Additionally, adversarial distractors and entity type filtering can degrade model performance, as seen in Table 4, where the original model’s F1 drops to 40.73 under adversarial filtering [1][10].\n\n![Single-paragraph BERT achieves 67.08 F1 on standard distractors but drops to 46.84 on adversarial distractors](image2)  \n![Open-domain F1 increases from 39.12 to 53.12 when gold paragraphs are provided](image7)  \n![Entity type filtering reduces F1 to 40.73 for the original model](image8)\n\nIn summary, training on adversarial distractors and improving retrieval methods for multi-hop questions can enhance F1 scores, while entity type filtering and poor evidence retrieval significantly degrade performance."}

However, this performance was found to be entirely due to the exploitation of these cues, such as the presence of the word \"not\" in warrants [2].\n\n![The adversarial dataset mirrors the distribution of cues over both labels, eliminating spurious signals](image6)\n\nWhen evaluated on the adversarial dataset, where each data point has its claim negated and label inverted to eliminate these cues, BERT’s performance dropped to random levels, with a maximum test set accuracy of 53% [8][3]. This demonstrates that the original high performance was not due to genuine argument comprehension but rather to the exploitation of dataset-specific patterns. The adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation, aligning with the intuition that without understanding the underlying arguments, good performance should not be feasible [6].\n\n![BERT’s performance on the adversarial test set shows random accuracy, with a mean of 0.505 and max of 0.533](image3)\n\nFurthermore, models trained and validated on the original dataset performed worse than random on the adversarial set due to overfitting the cues [6]. However, models trained from scratch on the adversarial dataset also showed random performance, confirming the elimination of these cues [6]. This suggests that the adversarial dataset successfully neutralized the spurious signals, providing a more reliable benchmark for future research on argument comprehension [3][9].\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT’s original high performance on ARCT was misleading, as it relied on spurious cues rather than genuine understanding. The adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard for robust evaluation in future work on this task."}

This demonstrates the company’s ability to generate higher profitability while managing its share count effectively through discretionary share repurchases [10].\n\nCompensation cost recognition for stock options also played a role. At June 30, 2022, $166 million of compensation cost related to stock options and $216 million related to RSUs and PSUs had not yet been recognized, expected to be amortized over 1.5 and 1.6 years, respectively [6][11]. This deferred recognition indicates a gradual impact on future expenses rather than an immediate financial burden.\n\nOverall, the trends in stock-based compensation expenses and net earnings per share reflect Procter & Gamble’s focus on optimizing shareholder value through cost management, strategic share repurchases, and effective compensation practices. Despite slight fluctuations in compensation costs, the company maintained a steady upward trajectory in EPS, driven by consistent earnings growth and share count reduction."}

The bank’s internal risk-based capital models and regulatory capital requirements also influenced capital allocation across segments, further shaping the financial outcomes [1].\n\nIn summary, the major differences in net interest income and expense between 2019-2020 and 2018-2019 reflect the impact of lower interest rates and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as Bank of America’s segment-specific dynamics and capital allocation strategies."}

WPB was formed by combining Retail Banking and Wealth Management with Global Private Banking, and it continued to serve customers by keeping between 70% to 90% of branches open during the pandemic [7].\n\nThe financial performance data reveals a decline in WPB's revenue compared to the previous year. For example, net interest income in Retail Banking fell by 16%, and non-interest income decreased by 26% [image4]. Wealth Management also saw a 9% decline in revenue, with life insurance manufacturing dropping by 26% [image4]. This was primarily due to lower global interest rates and reduced credit card spending [10].\n\nDespite these challenges, WPB remained resilient, with its global presence and tailored services supporting customers with everyday banking needs and more sophisticated financial solutions [5]. Specifically, HSBC launched HSBC Pinnacle in mainland China to expand its wealth management and insurance services, aiming to hire 3,000 wealth professionals over four years [image6].\n\nIn summary, WPB contributed to HSBC’s adjusted profit before tax in 2020, reflecting resilience despite revenue declines driven by external economic pressures and strategic initiatives to support customer needs and growth ambitions."}

At 30 June 2019, retained earnings stood at $80.245 million, reflecting the Group’s profitability [image4]. However, by 28 June 2020, retained earnings decreased to $41.819 million. This decline was influenced by dividends paid during the year, which totaled $15.866 million, reducing the retained earnings balance [image4].\n\nTotal equity also changed due to other comprehensive income and transactions with owners. For instance, the profit for the year ended 30 June 2019 contributed $37.043 million to equity, while the profit for the year ended 28 June 2020 added $11.221 million. Additionally, transactions such as capital contributions and employee share schemes further influenced the equity balance [image4].\n\nIn summary, the cash flow from operating activities bolstered the Group’s liquidity, while changes in retained earnings, primarily due to dividend payments, reduced the equity balance. Together, these factors resulted in a total equity of $58.368 million at 28 June 2020, down from $83.767 million at 30 June 2019 [image4]."}

This shift indicates a larger liability position, which could imply a higher future tax burden or changes in tax-related assumptions and valuations.\n\n![Deferred tax assets and liabilities comparison from 2021 to 2022](image6)  \nThe decrease in deferred tax assets is primarily driven by reductions in pension and other retiree benefits, from $1,476 million in 2021 to $740 million in 2022, and in loss and other carryforwards, from $1,030 million to $914 million. These changes suggest adjustments in assumptions related to retirement benefits and tax carryforward utilization.\n\n![Deferred tax liabilities comparison from 2021 to 2022](image7)  \nThe increase in deferred tax liabilities is largely due to higher amounts for goodwill and intangible assets ($5,761 million to $5,783 million), fixed assets ($1,512 million to $1,542 million), and other retiree benefits ($645 million to $1,031 million). This reflects changes in the valuation of these assets or adjustments in tax-related estimates.\n\nThe net impact on the company’s financial position is a reduction in its overall deferred tax position, as liabilities grew more significantly than assets decreased.

In 1870, the population was just 130, but by 1880, it surged to 8,267, and peaked in 1890 at 14,096. This rapid growth was primarily driven by the Homestead Act of 1862, which encouraged westward migration by offering 160 acres of land to settlers who built permanent structures and resided there for five years. By 1900, nearly 69,000 people had acquired land in Nebraska under this act, the highest number in any state [5]. However, population growth began to decline steadily after 1890, reaching 13,330 in 1900, 9,982 in 1940, and fluctuating slightly to 9,403 by 2000 [1] ![Population trends in Hamilton County](image2).\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decline. The consolidation of farms due to mechanization reduced the need for small-scale farming, leading to fewer rural jobs. In 1900, Hamilton County had over 2,000 farms, but by the mid-1960s, this number had dropped to nearly 1,100, and by 2002, only 603 farms remained. Despite this decline, the average farm size increased from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002, reflecting the shift toward larger, more mechanized operations [6] ![Farm consolidation data](image8).\n\nAdditionally, changing transportation patterns and economic shifts affected small towns. Rail connections were crucial for town development, and communities without rail lines often disappeared. For example, the town of Hamilton, which briefly competed for the county seat, declined after the seat was established in Aurora, leading to the relocation of businesses and residents [10].\n\nEthnic settlements also played a role in shaping the population. Early settlers from Missouri, Iowa, and New England were later joined by immigrants from Germany, Sweden, and Russia, who formed distinct cultural enclaves. These groups established strong religious congregations, such as the Danish Lutheran Church in Kronborg, which served as community focal points [2][12].\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County’s population surged in the late 1800s due to the Homestead Act but declined afterward due to farm consolidation, economic shifts, and changing transportation patterns."}

The process then continues to the children of these nodes, selecting the top-k nodes at each subsequent layer based on similarity to the query vector. This continues until leaf nodes are reached, and the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context [7][8][9]. ![Tree Traversal Retrieval involves layer-by-layer node selection](image3)\n\n2. **Collapsed Tree Retrieval**: In contrast, this method flattens the hierarchical tree into a single layer, treating all nodes as if they are on the same level. Instead of traversing layer-by-layer, it evaluates all nodes simultaneously to find the most relevant ones based on the query. This approach offers greater flexibility by not being constrained by the tree’s hierarchical structure [10][11]. ![Collapsed Tree Retrieval flattens the tree for simultaneous node evaluation](image3)\n\nThe key difference lies in the traversal strategy: Tree Traversal Retrieval is hierarchical and selective, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval is flat and comprehensive, often outperforming the former by retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [3]. ![Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers greater flexibility and performance](image4)"}

The Hard-to-Contrast strategy effectively addresses the cold start problem by leveraging contrastive learning to select typical data without requiring labeled data initially [8]. This ensures that the initial query is both diverse and representative, reducing redundancy and including minority classes, which is crucial for improving model performance in subsequent learning cycles [10]. Additionally, this approach mitigates the risks of biased or outlier queries, which often hinder active learning progress [6].\n\n![Hard-to-Contrast reduces redundancy and includes minority classes](image6)\n\nIn summary, the Hard-to-Contrast strategy not only enhances model performance across active learning cycles but also provides a practical and effective solution for initial query selection, making it a strong baseline for active learning in image classification tasks [9]."}

This suggests that even in the masked setting, where entities are consistently referred to with a unique surface form, the R-GCN’s role in leveraging relational information remains important. \n\n![Performance comparison across different model configurations, including the impact of removing R-GCN](image4)\n\nOverall, the results highlight that the R-GCN component plays a significant role in enhancing the model’s ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, and its removal leads to a notable decline in accuracy in both unmasked and masked settings."}

Word-level embeddings capture semantic and contextual information, which is essential for understanding the meaning of words in a sentence. However, they may struggle with rare words or words not present in the training vocabulary. Character-level embeddings, on the other hand, are particularly useful for capturing subword information such as morphological variations, prefixes, suffixes, and capitalization patterns, which are crucial for identifying named entities like locations or organizations [6].\n\n![Character-level embeddings capture subword information crucial for NER](image3)\n\nBy combining both embeddings, the model can benefit from the semantic richness of word-level embeddings and the robustness of character-level embeddings to handle unknown or morphologically complex words.

This dual-level approach allows the model to generate context-sensitive representations of each word, improving its ability to identify and classify entities accurately [6]. \n\n![Bi-LSTM architecture combines word and character embeddings for NER](image3)\n\nIn summary, the combination of word-level and character-level embeddings provides a comprehensive representation of the input sequence, enhancing the model’s ability to handle diverse linguistic features and improve NER performance."}

Unlike image classification tasks where objects are typically large and centrally positioned, objects in detection datasets vary significantly in size and location. To address this, the system employs two key pre-processing techniques: **cropping** and **blurring** [8].\n\n![An illustration of pre-processing steps for object detection datasets](image8)\n\nFirst, the system **crops** the image regions based on the proposal bounding box coordinates, which isolates the objects of interest. This cropping ensures that the model focuses on the relevant parts of the image, even if the objects are small or off-center. After cropping, the regions are **resized** to a fixed proportion to maintain consistency in input dimensions [8].\n\nThe second step involves **blurring** the non-target areas surrounding the objects. This technique helps direct the model’s attention to the foreground objects while minimizing distractions from the background. By applying Gaussian blurring, the system retains enough contextual information to aid recognition without overwhelming the model with irrelevant details [7].\n\nThese pre-processing steps are particularly effective in zero-shot recognition tasks, as they adapt the input to better align with the model’s training and inference capabilities. For instance, the system achieves significant improvements in Average Precision (AP) metrics when these techniques are applied, as demonstrated in the results [7]. \n\nIn summary, pre-processing with cropping and blurring enhances the zero-shot recognition system by isolating and emphasizing the objects of interest, leading to more accurate and contextually aware predictions."}

Additionally, adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance.

Currently, the system is fragmented, leading to redundant and inefficient efforts in managing patient information [2]. This fragmentation is a major contributor to medical errors, which account for more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motorcycle accidents [3]. \n\n![Current system fragments patient information and creates redundant, inefficient efforts](image1)\n\nFuture systems aim to consolidate patient information, providing a unified foundation for healthcare operations [10]. This includes improved access to patient clinical information, which is essential for enhancing efficiency and reducing errors. For instance, physician access for clinical orders is currently at 57%, but this is expected to improve significantly [image1]. Additionally, technologies like single sign-on, bar code technology, and handheld PDAs are becoming more prevalent, enhancing the accuracy and speed of clinical orders [image2].\n\n![Future system will consolidate information and provide a foundation for unifying efforts](image2)\n\nKey HIT systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR), Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE), and enterprise-wide clinical information sharing are gaining traction. These systems not only streamline patient information management but also support point-of-care decision-making and digital archiving of medical images [image3].

For example, in the context of hot dog consumption, the first hot dog might provide a high utility of +6, but by the third hot dog, the utility drops to 0, and by the 66th hot dog, it becomes -50. This illustrates how enjoyment diminishes with excessive consumption [1].\n\n![Diminishing utility from hot dog consumption](image1) \n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the concept of focus and cumulative practice can alter the dynamics of diminishing marginal utility. For instance, in a competitive hot dog eating contest, the utility might initially drop with each additional hot dog consumed, similar to standard consumption. But as the contest progresses, the focus and practice of the competitor can lead to improved outcomes. The cumulative experience and skill gained from repeated practice can enhance both the experience and the results, potentially increasing utility even as consumption continues [11]. \n\n![Importance of focus in achieving mastery](image2)\n\nFor example, a highly trained competitor might endure the initial discomfort of consuming multiple hot dogs because their focus and practice have prepared them to perform better under such conditions, ultimately increasing their chances of winning and the utility derived from the competition [7]. This contrasts with standard consumption, where the utility would simply continue to decline without any compensatory benefits from focus or practice. \n\n![Practice enhances both enjoyment and outcomes](image7)\n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption leads to a steady decline in satisfaction, in competitive contexts, focused practice and skill accumulation can mitigate or even reverse this decline, leading to increased utility through improved performance and outcomes."}

This suggests that leads sourced organically through Google are much more likely to be accepted by sales teams compared to those from sponsorships, which have the lowest conversion rate. This disparity may be due to the higher intent and relevance of organic search traffic compared to leads generated through sponsorships, which may lack direct sales readiness.\n\n![Conversion rates and lead progression details](image4)  \nIn **Image 4**, the MQL to SAL conversion rate is **1.50%**, which is notably lower than the rates observed in **Image 5**. This could indicate differences in lead qualification criteria, sales team efficiency, or the quality of the leads being passed from marketing to sales. Such a low rate might suggest that many MQLs fail to meet the sales team's acceptance criteria, potentially due to misalignment between marketing and sales definitions of a qualified lead.\n\nImplications of these differences:\n1. **Lead Quality**: Higher conversion rates, as seen with organic leads, indicate better alignment between marketing efforts and sales requirements. Conversely, low rates suggest a need to reassess lead scoring or qualification processes.  \n2. **Sales and Marketing Alignment**: The significant variance in conversion rates highlights the importance of ensuring that marketing and sales teams share a unified understanding of what constitutes a qualified lead.  \n3. **Resource Allocation**: Insights from these metrics can help prioritize lead sources with higher conversion rates, optimizing marketing spend and efforts.  \n\nIn summary, the differences in MQL to SAL conversion rates across datasets underscore the need for continuous evaluation of lead quality, alignment between teams, and strategic resource allocation to maximize sales outcomes."}
