According to [3], about four-in-ten say each party has high ethical standards (42% for the Democratic Party and 41% for the GOP). These views are consistent with the findings from April 2017. Additionally, [5] indicates that independents are more likely than partisans to say neither party has \"high ethical standards.\" About a third of independents (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each), say neither party has high ethical standards.

While the GOP performs worse on this trait than the Democratic Party, the share of Americans who view the Republican Party as too extreme has declined since last June (from 54%).\n\nThe image quote `![image1](image1)` also illustrates these views on extremism, showing that 48% of respondents consider the Republican Party too extreme, compared to 42% for the Democratic Party.\n\nRegarding differences by educational attainment, [10] notes that among those with at least a college degree, 31% say \"high ethical standards\" does not describe the GOP or the Democratic Party; 43% say it describes one and not the other, and 17% think it describes both.

According to [6], a significant majority of Democrats (85%) do not like the way Trump conducts himself in office, with only 10% having mixed feelings and 5% liking his behavior. This view has remained largely unchanged since August. For Republicans, [3] indicates that only 38% say they like the way he conducts himself, while 45% have mixed feelings about it. This suggests a notable level of internal criticism within the Republican party.\n\nNext, looking at the ethical standards of the Trump administration, [1] states that about four-in-ten Americans rate these standards as excellent or good, while 58% say they are not good or poor. The current ratings are lower than those for other administrations dating back to Ronald Reagan’s in 1983.\n\nThe image data also provides insights into these changes:\n- ![Approval ratings for Trump's conduct](image2) shows that among Republicans and Republican leaners, there is a slight increase in those who like Trump's conduct from 31% in August 2017 to 38% in May 2018.\n- ![Ethical standards ratings](image3) illustrates that among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 86% rate the ethical standards as poor or not good, compared to 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners who rate them as poor or not good.\n\nIn summary, the data indicates that opinions among Democrats have remained consistently negative towards both Trump's conduct and the ethical standards of his administration. Among Republicans, there is some internal criticism but also a slight increase in approval of his conduct over time. Overall, the public perception, especially among Democrats, remains predominantly negative regarding both aspects.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: Opinions among Democrats have remained consistently negative, while Republicans show some internal criticism but a slight increase in approval of Trump's conduct over time."}

In contrast, for the 65+ age group, only 15% believe policies restrict civil liberties too much, while 71% believe they do not go far enough to protect the country.\n\nNow, let's compare these opinions across political affiliations. The line graph in image7 shows the percentage of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents who say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country from 2004 to 2015. We can see that there has been a significant increase in concern among all three groups, but the increase has been more pronounced among Republicans, as mentioned in text quote [5].\n\nIn summary, opinions on government anti-terrorism efforts have evolved over time, with an increasing concern that these policies do not go far enough to protect the country, particularly after 2013. This trend is observed across all age groups, although it is more pronounced among older adults. Additionally, this concern is more pronounced among Republicans compared to Democrats and Independents.\n![The percentage of people who believe that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country has generally increased over time, especially after 2013.](image6)\n[1]\n![The percentage of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents who say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country has increased over time, with a more pronounced increase among Republicans.](image7)\n[7]"}

Conversely, 60% of Democrats/leaning Democrats think the tariffs were bad for the U.S., compared to 25% of Republicans/leaning Republicans.\n\nMoreover, when asked about the effects of increased tariffs on goods from foreign countries, including from China, more say they were ultimately bad for the U.S. (44%) than good (30%), as depicted in image2. However, opinions differ based on political affiliation, with Republicans generally seeing tariffs as beneficial and Democrats viewing them negatively.\n\nIn summary, Republicans, especially conservatives, are more likely to see the benefits of tough trade policies and prefer getting tougher with China, whereas Democrats, particularly liberals, tend to view these policies negatively and favor building stronger relationships.\n![Republicans and Democrats have differing views on the impact of trade policies with China](image1)\n![Overall, more Americans view the impact of trade policies negatively](image2)"}

The line graph in image1 shows the percentage of internet users in each age group who use social networking sites, with the 18-29 age group reaching nearly 90% usage by 2013, while the 65+ age group only reached about 46% usage in the same year.\n\n![Seniors with higher education levels are more likely to adopt tablets and e-book readers](image7)\n\nIn summary, education level has a significant impact on the adoption of tablets and e-book readers among seniors, with higher education correlating with higher adoption rates. This trend is consistent with the broader pattern of technology adoption across different age groups, where younger and more educated individuals tend to adopt new technologies at higher rates."}

At the start of Barack Obama’s third year in office, nearly half (47%) said it was too early to tell whether he would be successful; 38% said this about George W. Bush and 43% about Clinton at comparable points. Image 8 provides a detailed comparison of these views for Trump, Obama, Bush, and Clinton, showing the significant differences in perceptions among partisans.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of Trump's presidency differ significantly among political affiliations, with Republicans generally having more favorable views on trust, ethical standards, economic impact, and long-term success compared to Democrats. These perceptions are also more polarized than those of previous presidents, indicating a deep divide in public opinion along party lines.\n![The chart shows a significant difference in trust levels between political affiliations, with conservatives being much more trusting of Trump compared to liberals.](image2)"}

According to [1], substantial shares of Latino partisans believe that the opposing party really cares about Latinos and works hard to earn their votes. This suggests a nuanced view where even those who lean towards one party may acknowledge the efforts of the other.\n\nThe data in image3 further illustrates this point. It shows that while a majority of Latino voters feel the Democratic Party works hard to earn their votes (71%), a significant minority (45%) also believes the Republican Party makes similar efforts. Similarly, when it comes to caring about Latinos, 63% of respondents feel the Democratic Party does so, compared to 34% for the Republican Party. These figures indicate that there is recognition across party lines of efforts to engage with Latino voters.\n\nNext, let's look at how these perceptions have been reflected in party affiliation trends. Image1 provides a clear visual representation of the percentage of Latino registered voters identifying with or leaning toward each party from 2019 to 2022. The graph shows a consistent trend where a larger share of Latino voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party compared to the Republican Party. Specifically, the Democratic Party has seen a slight increase from 62% in 2019 to 64% in 2022, while the Republican Party has remained relatively stable around 33%.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [2] states that Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%). This aligns with the data presented in image1 and reinforces the notion that despite some recognition of the Republican Party's efforts, the majority of Latino voters still lean Democratic.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is acknowledgment of both parties' efforts to engage with Latino voters, as shown in image3 and [1], the overall trend in party affiliation remains strongly in favor of the Democratic Party, as evidenced by image1 and [2]. Therefore, the perceptions of the parties' efforts have not significantly altered the predominant party affiliation among Latino voters over recent years.\n![Party identification trends among Latino registered voters](image1)"}

The pie charts [8] and [4] show the distribution of transactions across different categories, with Fashion, Footwear & Accessories leading at 35% of transactions, followed by Mobile, Tablets & Accessories at 9%. However, these figures do not directly indicate the gross margin contributions.\n\nGross margin contributions are typically higher for categories with higher profit margins, such as Electronics & Appliances or Jewelry, even if the transaction volume is lower. For instance, while Books have a high transaction volume at 21%, their profit margins may be lower compared to Jewelry, which has a smaller transaction volume but potentially higher margins.\n\nThe implications for the e-commerce supply and demand model are significant. E-commerce platforms must focus on categories that not only drive high transaction volumes but also contribute positively to overall profitability. This means balancing the portfolio to include high-margin categories even if they have fewer transactions. Additionally, platforms need to optimize their supply chain and logistics to efficiently handle the high-volume categories while ensuring competitive pricing and customer satisfaction.\n\nIn summary, while transaction volumes provide insight into popular categories, understanding gross margin contributions is crucial for sustainable growth in the e-commerce sector. Platforms should strategically manage their product mix to maximize both volume and profitability, thereby enhancing the overall supply and demand dynamics.\n![image4](image4)\n![image8](image8)"}

This diversity ensures that the dataset can evaluate models across a broad spectrum of real-world entities [5].\n\nSecondly, regarding the number of unique entities, the SnapNTell dataset contains 7,568 unique entities, which is notably higher compared to other datasets.

As smaller models have less capacity for complex reasoning, the performance of the end-to-end FLAN-T5 model decreases significantly with decreasing model size. However, this trend is less notable for ProgramFC. The high-level reasoning plan offered by reasoning programs substantially alleviates the demands on the subsequent sub-task solvers. Our results show that the program-guided model using FLAN-T5-small (80M parameters) as sub-task solvers can achieve comparable performance to the 137x larger FLAN-T5-XXL (11B) model with end-to-end reasoning for 4-hop claims [6].\n\nFor the observed retrieval recall differences between ProgramFC and one-step retrieval, we can refer to Figure 5 [8]. We measure the recall of the gold paragraphs for the top-10 retrieved paragraphs (recall @10). For ProgramFC, we combine the retrieved paragraphs of all steps and we consider the top-10 results. We can see in Figure 5 that ProgramFC outperforms one-step retrieval on all datasets, with the largest improvement of 37.1% on HOVER 4-hop.

However, Figure [3] demonstrates that ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5 across different model sizes, especially when the model size is small. This suggests that program-guided reasoning is particularly effective for smaller models.\n\nNext, we can see from Figure [6] that as the complexity of the claims increases, the proportion of semantic errors in the programs also increases, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent.

Codex shows a similar trend but reaches its peak performance with fewer demonstrations compared to ChatGPT [7].\n\nRegarding demonstration selection strategies, the bar chart in the third part of Figure 3 compares random sampling, sentence embedding, and EPR. Both ChatGPT and Codex perform better when using sentence embedding or EPR compared to random sampling, with sentence embedding being slightly superior [2].\n\nNow, let's compare the performance of ChatGPT and Codex with other models on the FewNERD dataset. Table 4 provides quantitative results showing the inference speed of different methods. ChatGPT and Codex have much slower inference speeds than SLMs like Roberta and T5 due to their larger parameter sizes and longer input contexts [3]. However, in terms of F1 score, as shown in image1, ChatGPT and Codex achieve higher scores than most SLMs under low-resource settings, particularly in the 1-shot to 20-shot range [1].\n\nIn summary, while different instruction formats have a minimal impact on the performance of ChatGPT and Codex, the number of demonstrations and the selection strategy do play significant roles. Compared to other models, ChatGPT and Codex demonstrate competitive performance on the FewNERD dataset, especially in low-resource settings, despite their slower inference speeds.\n![The performance of ChatGPT and Codex on the FewNERD dataset is influenced by the number of demonstrations and the selection strategy, with sentence embedding being the best choice.]()"}
{"q_id": 336, "model": "qwen-vl-max-latest_vlm", "in_tok": 7687, "out_tok": 991, "total_tok": 8678, "response": "To address the question regarding the most common reasoning steps and challenges encountered when verifying claims in the SciTAB dataset, we can analyze the provided information.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the types of reasoning involved in fact-checking claims in S CI T AB . The dataset defines 14 atomic reasoning types, as shown in Table [2] from text quote [10]. Among these, \"closed-domain knowledge\" and \"open-domain knowledge\" are specially designed for S CI T AB . Closed-domain knowledge refers to obtaining background information from the table caption or title, such as knowing that “Prod.” refers to “Productivity” from the table caption in Figure [1]. Open-domain knowledge refers to commonsense knowledge not presented in the table, such as the relationship between precision and recall. Given the designed reasoning types, we manually analyze 100 samples in S CI T AB , by annotating the graph of reasoning steps for verifying each claim. We identify 476 atomic reasoning steps from the 100 analyzed samples and show the proportion for each reasoning type in Table [2].\n\nThe most common reasoning steps identified in the dataset include:\n- Simple lookup: Retrieve the value for a specific cell.\n- Comparison: Compare two numbers.\n- Closed-domain knowledge: Extract information from context sentences in the table caption or article.\n- Open-domain knowledge: Extract additional information required by domain experts.\n- Commonsense knowledge: Extract commonsense knowledge necessary for claim verification.\n- Subtract: Perform subtraction of two numbers.\n- Divide: Perform division of two numbers.\n- Rank: Determine the rank of a set of numbers.\n- Different / Same: Determine if two numbers are different or the same.\n- Add: Calculate the sum of two numbers.\n- Max / Min: Retrieve the maximum or minimum number from a set of numbers.\n- Col / Rowname: Retrieve the column or row name from the table.\n- Trend same/different: Determine the trend for two columns or rows, whether they are the same or different.\n- Set check: Verify if a value belongs to a set of numbers.\n\nThe proportions of these reasoning steps are detailed in Table [6], which shows the distribution of reasoning types across the dataset.\n\nNext, let's consider the challenges encountered when verifying claims in the SciTAB dataset. One potential risk of model-generated claims is that they may lack diversity and exhibit the same pattern. For example, in the Sci-Fact ( Wadden et al., 2020 ) dataset where the refuted claims are generated by flapping the meaning of the original true claims, we found that out of 100 randomly sampled refuted claims, 85 simply negated the original claim by adding negation words such as “not” (more details in Appendix [C]). To evaluate the diversity of claims for our S CI T AB dataset, we randomly select 60 refuted claims and then manually annotate their reasons for refutation. Results are shown in Table [3] (top half). We find that S CI T AB exhibits a greater diversity in refuted claims compared to Sci-Fact. Besides common error types such as “incorrect calculation results” (41.7%), there are also unique types of errors that are more reflective of the complexities in real-world scientific claims. For example, 33.33% of the refuted claims contain “incorrect approximation words”, and 10.0% are cases where “the claim is partially right”, consistent with the fact that ambiguity and half-truths are common phenomena in scientific discourse. Additional examples of refuted claims are in Appendix [E].\n\nFurthermore, the NEI claims (bottom half; Table [3]) also exhibit diverse reasoning patterns. The two most common features for un verifiable claims are insufficient evidence in the table and the lack of background knowledge. The lack of closed-domain knowledge is another reason for NEI, where additional information in the paper is necessary to verify the claim. Other reasons include the use of vague pronouns (e.g., “it”, “this”) brings ambiguity to the claim. These distinct refuted and NEI reasoning types highlight the unique features of S CI T AB , making it a more comprehensive and realistic representation of the challenges faced in real-world scientific fact-checking.\n\nIn summary, the most common reasoning steps in the SciTAB dataset include simple lookup, comparison, closed-domain knowledge, open-domain knowledge, and commonsense knowledge. The challenges encountered include a lack of diversity in model-generated claims, common error types such as incorrect calculation results and incorrect approximation words, and diverse reasoning patterns for un verifiable claims, including insufficient evidence and lack of background knowledge.\n\n![Reasoning Graph](image1)\n\nThe image shows a reasoning graph for a specific claim in the SciTAB dataset, illustrating the various reasoning steps involved, including closed-domain knowledge, commonsense knowledge, simple lookup, and numerical reasoning."}

This wide range of disciplines ensures that the benchmark has a broad scope, which is essential for evaluating the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) across various domains. The detailed subject coverage and statistics are provided in Figure 3 [3], which shows the distribution of different subjects within each discipline.\n\nSecondly, the MMMU benchmark aims to assess expert-level multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities [3]. This means that the questions in the benchmark are designed to be challenging and require deep domain-specific knowledge and complex reasoning processes. The benchmark includes problems sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, ensuring that the questions are at a college-level difficulty [8]. The evaluation of LMMs on the MMMU benchmark reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4V and Gemini Ultra only achieve accuracies of 56% and 59%, respectively [12], indicating the high level of difficulty and the need for expert-level reasoning.\n\nThirdly, the MMMU benchmark covers 30 image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. [4]. This diverse range of image types ensures that the benchmark tests the perceptual capabilities of LMMs across various modalities. The distribution of different image types in the MMMU questions is displayed in Figure 96 [2], which shows that the dataset encompasses a diverse range of image types.\n\nFinally, the MMMU benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge [8]. This means that the questions in the benchmark not only test the ability of LMMs to perceive and understand information across different modalities but also their ability to apply reasoning with subject-specific knowledge to derive the solution. The benchmark features interleaved text-image inputs, where a model needs to jointly understand the images and text, often requiring recalling deep subject knowledge and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the distribution of subject areas in the MMMU dataset aligns well with its intended coverage of depth and breadth in reasoning and knowledge.

The evidence from the text and images will help us understand the impact.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we can see that different data augmentation techniques have varying impacts on the performance of BERT models. Specifically, [1] mentions that positive data augmentation outperforms the original dataset, while negative data augmentation underperforms. This is because positive data augmentation creates a balanced dataset, whereas negative data augmentation creates a more imbalanced dataset. However, despite creating a balanced dataset, negative data augmentation decreases the number of training data, resulting in inferior performances.\n\nThe image quotes provide empirical evidence to support these claims. Image 2 shows the performance of BERT models with different data augmentation techniques on the QQP dataset. We can see that +positive data augmentation improves the F1 score by 0.81, while +negative data augmentation decreases the F1 score by 0.19. This is consistent with the findings in [1].\n\nFurthermore, the text quotes also mention that the proposed dice loss (DSC) outperforms other losses on various datasets, including SST-2, SST-5, Chinese OntoNotes4.0, and English QuoRef MRC. This is supported by the results shown in Image 6 and Image 4. For example, on the SST-2 dataset, BERT+DSC achieves an accuracy of 94.84, which is higher than BERT+DL (94.37) and BERT+FL (94.86).

The table in image1 provides a comparison of these metrics for eight language pairs (en-cs, en-de, en-fi, en-gu, en-kk, en-lt, en-ru, en-zh). From this table, we can see that COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU in all language pairs, with significantly higher scores in most cases. For example, in the en-cs pair, COMET-RANK achieves a score of 0.603, while BLEU only reaches 0.364. This trend is consistent across all listed language pairs, indicating that COMET-RANK is more effective than BLEU in evaluating translation quality when English is the source language [1].\n\nNext, let's look at the performance of these metrics when English is not involved as either the source or target language. Image2 shows a comparison for three language pairs (de-cs, de-fr, fr-de). Here, we observe that COMET-RANK still outperforms BLEU in two out of the three language pairs (de-cs and fr-de), although the difference is less pronounced compared to the previous case. In the de-fr pair, both metrics perform similarly, with BLEU slightly outperforming COMET-RANK. This suggests that while COMET-RANK generally performs better, its advantage may be less significant when English is not part of the language pair [2].\n\nTo further understand the trends in their performance, we can refer to the line graphs in image5. These graphs plot the Kendall Tau score (τ) for different metrics, including COMET-RANK and BLEU, across various language pairs.

This suggests that GEM is more effective in maintaining the tracking ability of learned parameters, which helps achieve better performance for new domains.\n\nRegarding slot similarities and their effect on performance, the zero-shot analysis in Fig. 5 shows that knowledge about people, area, price range, and day slots are successfully transferred from other domains to hotel and restaurant domains. However, for unseen slots that only appear in one domain (e.g., parking, stars, internet in hotel; food in restaurant), the model struggles to track them correctly. This indicates that slot similarities play a crucial role in the transferability of knowledge across domains.\n\n![The TRADE model architecture includes an utterance encoder, a slot gate, and a state generator, which are shared across domains.](image1)\n\nIn summary, GEM outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting to new domain data, and slot similarities significantly impact the model's ability to transfer knowledge across domains."}

The table in image5 provides a comprehensive comparison of various decoding strategies used by COMET. The table includes metrics such as oEffect, oReact, oWant, xAttr, xEffect, xIntent, xNeed, xReact, and xWant, along with an average score for each method. The 'Human validation of gold ATOMIC' row serves as a benchmark for human performance.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that greedy decoding (n=500 per relation) achieves the highest average score of 77.53%, closely followed by beam search with 10 beams (n=5000 per relation) at 56.45%. These scores are significantly lower than the human validation score of 86.18%, indicating that while COMET's decoding methods perform well, they still lag behind human-level performance.\n\nNext, let's consider how variations in training data percentages affect the model's metrics. The table in image8 shows the impact of using different percentages of the training data on the perplexity (PPL), BLEU-2, N/T o, and N/U o metrics. The table includes results for 1% train, 10% train, 50% train, FULL (- pretrain), and FULL train.\n\nThe table reveals that as the percentage of training data increases, the PPL and BLEU-2 scores improve, indicating better performance. For example, the PPL decreases from 23.81 for 1% train to 11.14 for FULL train, while the BLEU-2 score increases from 5.08 for 1% train to 15.10 for FULL train. However, the N/T o and N/U o metrics do not show a consistent trend, suggesting that these metrics may be less sensitive to changes in training data size.\n\nIn conclusion, while COMET's decoding methods perform well, they still fall short of human-level performance. Additionally, increasing the amount of training data generally improves the model's performance, but the impact on certain metrics is less clear.\n![The graph illustrates the relationship between edit distance and both the percentage of novel tuples and classifier accuracy.

The table shows the WER for each model and backoff strategy across different attacks: swap, drop, add, key, and all.\n\nFor closed vocabulary models:\n- Pass-through has a WER of 11.3.\n- Background has a WER of 13.1.\n- Neutral has a WER of 11.3.\n\nFor open vocabulary models:\n- Pass-through has a WER of 30.3.\n- Background has a WER of 14.7.\n- Neutral has a WER of 11.3.\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the pass-through strategy generally results in higher WER for both closed and open vocabulary models, indicating poorer performance. The background and neutral strategies show lower WER, with the neutral strategy performing particularly well for open vocabulary models.\n\nNext, let's look at the scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between WER and sensitivity for different backoff strategies [3]. The plot shows that the neutral backoff strategy has the lowest sensitivity, which is expected as it returns a fixed neutral word whenever the ScRNN predicts an UNK, reducing the number of unique outputs it predicts. This is consistent with the findings from the table, where the neutral strategy also showed lower WER.\n\nIn summary, the sensitivity and WER differ significantly between closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies. The neutral backoff strategy appears to be the most effective, providing the lowest sensitivity and WER for both closed and open vocabulary models.\n\n![The neutral backoff strategy provides the lowest sensitivity and WER for both closed and open vocabulary models](image3)\n\nThe neutral backoff strategy provides the lowest sensitivity and WER for both closed and open vocabulary models."}

According to [8], Seq2Seq models tend to produce short sentences with more common words than humans. The RetNRef model improves this by doubling the use of rare words (with frequency less than 100) and making smaller gains for words with frequency less than 1000. However, it still does not match human statistics. The RetNRef ++ model, which boosts the use of the retrieval, performs better in this regard, making the statistics much closer to human ones.

Table 3 shows that RetNRef ++ has a high word overlap with the retriever output around half of the time, whereas Seq2Seq and RetNRef very rarely overlap with the retriever.

The table in image8 shows the average and year-end exchange rates for these currencies in 2020 compared to previous years.

Additionally, retained earnings grew significantly, contributing to the overall increase in shareholders' equity [4].\n\n2. **Changes in Liabilities**: The rise in liabilities can be attributed to increases in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as other policyholder liabilities. For instance, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $79,854 million in 2020 to $86,664 million in 2021 [1]. Furthermore, there were increases in accounts payable, accruals, and other liabilities, which also contributed to the higher total liabilities [1].\n\n3. **Impact of Investment Gains**: Investment gains and losses from changes in market prices of equity securities produced significant volatility in periodic earnings, impacting both liabilities and equity [1].\n\n4. **Debt Management**: There was a decrease in parent company debt outstanding, which went down by $1.3 billion from 2020 to 2021, largely due to foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt [5]. However, this decrease was offset by other liability increases.\n\n5. **Insurance Operations**: The insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings, which helped maintain strong capital strength and contributed positively to shareholders' equity [4].\n\nIn summary, the changes in liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. were driven by a combination of investment performance, underwriting results, and strategic financial management decisions.\n![Berkshire Hathaway's liabilities and shareholders' equity increased from 2020 to 2021](image1)"}

The increase in current liabilities is $2,137 million ($5,342 million - $3,205 million), and the increase in noncurrent liabilities is $2,438 million ($7,789 million - $5,351 million).\n\nNext, let's consider the changes in total debt:\n\n- **2019 Total Debt:** $21,729 million\n- **2020 Total Debt:** $21,204 million\n\nThe total debt decreased by $525 million ($21,729 million - $21,204 million) from 2019 to 2020.\n\nTo understand how these changes relate, we need to consider the components of total debt and liabilities. Total debt includes long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt, while total liabilities include both debt and other obligations such as accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenues.\n\nThe increase in liabilities, particularly noncurrent liabilities, suggests that the company may have taken on additional long-term obligations or had an increase in other long-term commitments. However, the decrease in total debt indicates that the company may have paid down some of its long-term debt or reclassified some debt as noncurrent.\n\nIn summary, while total liabilities increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, total debt decreased. This could be due to a combination of factors, including the reclassification of debt, the issuance of new long-term obligations, and the payment of existing debt.\n\n![Total liabilities and debt comparison](image3)\n\nThe total current and noncurrent liabilities increased by approximately $4.6 billion from 2019 to 2020, while total debt decreased by approximately $0.5 billion during the same period."}

This indicates a significant increase in cash inflows from financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nNext, let's examine the cash flows from investing activities. According to [6], cash outflows from investing activities increased by €12,228 million to €14,140 million. This was essentially based on the payout for the acquisition of Varian. Cash outflows also increased by €117 million due to additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. The increase was mainly a result of investments for capacity expansions.\n\nNow, let's verify this information with the data from image3. Image3 shows that cash flows from financing activities increased from -€249 million in 2020 to €11,839 million in 2021, confirming the significant increase mentioned in [5].

According to [6], revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil.\n\nThe earnings for the upstream and downstream segments are presented in the table on image6. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the total earnings for the upstream segment were $15,818 million, while the total earnings for the downstream segment were $2,914 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the total earnings for the upstream segment were $(2,433) million, while the total earnings for the downstream segment were $47 million.\n\nNext, let's look at the asset values.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the total assets for the upstream segment were $184,412 million, while the total assets for the downstream segment were $45,224 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the total assets for the upstream segment were $191,309 million, while the total assets for the downstream segment were $39,586 million.\n\nIn summary, the major differences in the earnings and asset values of Chevron Corporation's Upstream and Downstream segments for the years 2021 and 2020 are that the upstream segment had significantly higher earnings and asset values than the downstream segment in both years. However, the earnings for the upstream segment were negative in 2020, while the earnings for the downstream segment were positive.\n![the comparison of earnings and asset values for the upstream and downstream segments](image6)"}

According to [6], there were no transfers between the 'Active market data' and 'Directly or indirectly observable market data' categories during 2020, 2019, or 2018. This indicates that the valuation of derivative financial instruments remained consistent over these years. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. If an active market exists, the fair value is based on the most recently observed market price at the end of the reporting period [10].\n\nNow, let's examine the cash flow changes. The cash from operating activities converts income statement items from the accrual basis of accounting to cash basis. As such, starting with net profit, non-cash items are reversed and actual payments included. The change in working capital is also taken into account, as this shows the development in money tied up in the balance sheet [12]. The image4 provides a detailed breakdown of the cash flow changes in working capital for 2020 and 2019.\n\n![The total derivative financial instruments increased from DKK 50,455 million in 2019 to DKK 63,390 million in 2020](image6)\n\nFrom the analysis of the derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes, we can see that the company's financial statements are affected by both the valuation of derivative financial instruments and the changes in cash flow.

This indicates a reduction in impairment losses in 2019.\n\nThe table in image5 shows the detailed breakdown of cost, additions, disposals, amortization/depreciation, and impairment losses for various asset categories for both 2019 and 2020. For intangible assets, the impairment losses for the year increased from DKK 982 million in 2019 to DKK 350 million in 2020. However, the amortization/depreciation for the year decreased from DKK 487 million in 2019 to DKK 1,096 million in 2020.

The total shareholders' equity increased from $22,071 million in 2019 to $22,984 million in 2020 and then decreased slightly to $22,177 million in 2021 [7]. This fluctuation can be attributed to various factors such as net income, other comprehensive income, and changes in retained earnings.\n\nNext, we examine the components of comprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (OCI). From the data provided, we can see that net income increased significantly from $6,759 million in 2019 to $8,060 million in 2021 [5]. However, OCI, which includes items like unrealized gains on debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, showed a mixed trend. For example, there were losses in foreign currency translation adjustments in 2021 compared to 2019 [5].\n\nThe impact of these changes on comprehensive income is evident when we compare the comprehensive income figures: $6,619 million in 2019, $2,977 million in 2020, and $8,010 million in 2021 [5]. Despite fluctuations in OCI, the overall increase in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by the substantial rise in net income.\n\nIn summary, while changes in shareholders' equity reflect the overall financial health and performance of the company, the significant increase in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021 was mainly due to the substantial growth in net income, despite some negative impacts from other comprehensive income components.\n\n![Changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive income](image5)"}

According to [1], the foreign income before taxes was $7,481 million in 2019, $5,719 million in 2020, and $10,274 million in 2021. This indicates a significant increase from 2020 to 2021, which could be attributed to various factors such as increased international operations or favorable market conditions.\n\nNext, let's look at the foreign tax provision. The foreign tax provision was $(407) million in 2019, $526 million in 2020, and $518 million in 2021, as shown in [4]. The negative value in 2019 suggests a tax benefit, while the positive values in 2020 and 2021 indicate tax expenses. The decrease in the foreign tax provision from 2020 to 2021, despite an increase in foreign income before taxes, might be due to changes in tax laws or more efficient tax planning strategies.\n\nThese changes in foreign tax provision and foreign income before taxes could have several impacts on the company's financial strategy. For instance, the increase in foreign income before taxes could lead to higher cash flows, which may be reinvested in further international expansion or used to pay down debt.

The text quote [4] provides insight into how Siemens Healthineers measures entitlements from defined benefit plans by applying the projected unit credit method. This method calculates the present value of future benefit entitlements based on actuarially determined assumptions, including discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression and mortality rates.\n\nFor Germany, the specific tables used are derived from data of the German Siemens population and to a lesser extent from data of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany, as shown in image5. For the United States, the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Long Range Demographic Assumptions is applied.\n\nNext, let's look at the financial indicators. Image3 provides detailed information on the defined benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net defined benefit balance for both Germany and the United States. For Germany, the defined benefit obligation increased from €2,007 million in 2020 to €2,033 million in 2021, while the fair value of plan assets decreased from €1,318 million in 2020 to €1,216 million in 2021. This resulted in a net defined benefit balance of €791 million in 2020 and €715 million in 2021.\n\nFor the United States, the defined benefit obligation decreased from €1,050 million in 2020 to €986 million in 2021, while the fair value of plan assets increased from €937 million in 2020 to €948 million in 2021. This led to a net defined benefit balance of €113 million in 2020 and €38 million in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, image4 shows the effect on the defined benefit obligation due to changes in actuarial assumptions. For example, a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the defined benefit obligation by €242 million in 2021 and €227 million in 2020. A half-percentage-point increase in compensation increase would increase the defined benefit obligation by €16 million in 2021 and €11 million in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators affecting the defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 can be attributed to variations in the specific tables and projections used, as well as changes in the defined benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net defined benefit balance.\n![The table displays the discount rates for different currencies as of September 30, 2021 and 2020.]()"}

This suggests an overall decline in profitability.\n\nFor specific segments:\n- **Global Markets**: According to image7, Global Markets saw a significant increase in adjusted revenue, up by $1,562m or 27% from 2019, driven by strong performance in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC).\n- **Global Banking**: Image10 shows a decrease in adjusted revenue by $1,852m or 12%, reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income.\n- **Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF)**: Image10 also indicates a decline in GTRF revenue by $82m or 4%, largely due to lower lending balances and fees, particularly in Hong Kong and the UK.\n\nIn summary, while Global Markets experienced growth, other segments like Global Banking and GTRF faced declines, contributing to the overall reduction in profit before tax as seen in image1.\n\n![Adjusted net operating income and profit before tax decreased across most banking segments in 2020](image1)"}

By 2020, as shown in image4, Amberjack's net income decreased to $201 million, while Mars' net income increased slightly to $163 million.\n\nThe decrease in Amberjack's net income could be influenced by the capital contributions made to Permian Basin, which were zero in 2020 but $\\S25$ million in 2019 and $\\mathbb{S}28$ million in 2018 [2].

The accumulated amortization also increased from $6,100 million in 2021 to $6,273 million in 2022. This indicates that while new intangible assets were added, existing assets continued to be amortized.\n\nNext, we look at the amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021.

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual [5].\n\n- **Net Interest Expense**: The net interest expense increased by $14.1 billion from 2019 to 2020, which is a substantial increase compared to the decrease of $3.7 billion from 2018 to 2019. This increase was mainly due to higher funding costs and lower interest rates [5].\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, which includes four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking, and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other [4]. Each segment has its own specific activities, products, and businesses, and their performance contributes to the overall financial results of the bank.

This decline was primarily due to a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which dropped by 44.4% from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021 [7]. The decrease in interest income can be attributed to lower short-term interest rates that prevailed through 2021, affecting the substantial holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills [4].\n\nRegarding asset composition, there was a notable increase in equity securities, rising from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 [3].

The increase was due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes of $760 million, and higher asset sales gains of $640 million. This indicates a significant improvement in the U.S. upstream segment's financial performance from 2020 to 2021.\n\nFrom the text quote [7], we learn that U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million. This indicates a substantial improvement in the U.S. downstream segment's financial performance from 2020 to 2021.\n\nFrom the text quote [9], we learn that earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company's control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.\n\nFrom the image quote `![The graph shows quarterly average spot prices for WTI Crude Oil, Brent Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021.]()`, we can see that the spot prices for WTI Crude Oil and Brent Crude Oil experienced a significant decline in 2020 but recovered in 2021.

According to [11], the liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020, was $89 million, compared to $303 million in 2019. This indicates a significant reduction in the balance of uncertain tax positions.\n\nNext, we examine the fair value assets and liabilities.

For December 31, 2020, the total fair value of assets is $6,970 million, which includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments. In comparison, for December 31, 2019, the total fair value of assets was $5,387 million.

This significant increase can be attributed to various factors including net income, other comprehensive income, and currency translation differences.\n  - **Net Income**: Net income increased from €1,423 million in 2020 to €1,746 million in 2021.\n  - **Other Comprehensive Income**: Other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss increased from a negative €593 million in 2020 to €542 million in 2021. This is largely due to changes in currency translation differences and cash flow hedges.\n    - **Currency Translation Differences**: These differences improved from a negative €768 million in 2020 to €724 million in 2021.\n    - **Cash Flow Hedges**: Cash flow hedges showed a positive €61 million in 2020 but a negative €154 million in 2021.\n\nNext, let's look at the balance sheet components:\n\n- **Total Assets**: Total assets increased from €25,094 million in 2020 to €42,162 million in 2021. This substantial increase is primarily due to an increase in non-current assets, particularly goodwill and property, plant, and equipment.\n  - **Goodwill**: Goodwill increased from €9,038 million in 2020 to €17,512 million in 2021.\n  - **Property, Plant, and Equipment**: Property, plant, and equipment increased from €2,774 million in 2020 to €3,712 million in 2021.\n- **Total Liabilities**: Total liabilities also increased from €12,584 million in 2020 to €25,823 million in 2021. This increase is mainly driven by higher long-term financial debt and provisions for pensions and similar obligations.\n  - **Long-Term Financial Debt**: Long-term financial debt increased from €314 million in 2020 to €457 million in 2021.\n  - **Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations**: These provisions increased from €1,029 million in 2020 to €908 million in 2021.\n- **Total Equity**: Total equity increased from €12,511 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021. This increase is largely due to retained earnings and capital reserves.\n  - **Retained Earnings**: Retained earnings decreased from a negative €1,276 million in 2020 to a negative €300 million in 2021.\n  - **Capital Reserve**: Capital reserve increased from €13,476 million in 2020 to €15,818 million in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the key differences in the comprehensive income and balance sheet components of Siemens Healthineers AG between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 include a significant increase in comprehensive income, total assets, and total equity, with notable changes in goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, and long-term financial debt.\n\n![The table shows the detailed breakdown of comprehensive income and balance sheet components for fiscal years 2020 and 2021](image1)"}

According to image7, the total shareholding of the promoter and promoter group (which includes the Tata group) remained constant at 72.0% throughout the fiscal year. This indicates that there were no changes in the shareholding of the Tata group during this period.\n\nNext, let's examine the shareholding of public shareholders. Image8 provides a detailed breakdown of public shareholding. It shows that the total public shareholding decreased slightly from 28.0% at the beginning of the year to 27.8% at the end of the year. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the shareholding of individual shareholders holding nominal share capital in excess of ₹1 lakh, which decreased from 0.5% to 0.3%.\n\nIn summary, while the shareholding of the Tata group remained unchanged, there was a slight decrease in the shareholding of public shareholders, particularly among individual shareholders with larger holdings.\n\n![The shareholding of the Tata group remained constant at 72.0%, while the total public shareholding decreased slightly from 28.0% to 27.8%.](image7)"}

This increase was primarily due to additions of $23,139 and disposals of $4,052, with a net effect of exchange rate movements of $1,529 [1].\n- **Hardware and Software**: The carrying amount decreased from $3,082 to $2,258.

For instance, [1] shows a steady increase in the total tax benefits realized from share-based awards, which were $567 million in 2021, $273 million in 2020, and $237 million in 2019. This indicates a growing benefit from share-based compensation.\n\nAdditionally, [4] mentions a significant event in fiscal 2019 where Qualcomm applied for a partial refund claim for taxes previously withheld from licensees in Korea, resulting in a noncurrent income taxes receivable of $1.9 billion and a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefits of the same amount at September 26, 2021, and September 27, 2020, respectively. This suggests a substantial adjustment in their tax liabilities and receivables.\n\nThe image quotes provide more detailed financial data. `![image7](image7)` shows the breakdown of the effective tax rate and its components for each year. The effective tax rate decreased from 41% in 2019 to 9% in 2020 and then increased to 12% in 2021. This fluctuation is due to various factors including the benefit from FDII deduction, excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards, and other tax credits.\n\nFurthermore, `![image8](image8)` illustrates the changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits increased significantly from $1,705 million in 2019 to $1,901 million in 2020 and further to $2,136 million in 2021. This trend indicates an increasing uncertainty in tax positions over the years.\n\nIn summary, Qualcomm has seen a mix of increases and decreases in various tax provisions and benefits over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, with notable fluctuations in the effective tax rate and unrecognized tax benefits."}

This graph is referenced but not directly shown in the text. However, image3 provides a visual representation of this data.\n- According to image3, which shows the historical stock price performance of Amgen (AMGN), the Amex Biotech Index (BTK), the Amex Pharmaceutical Index (DRG), and the S&P 500 (SPX) from 2015 to 2020, we can observe that:\n  - Amgen's stock price increased from approximately $100 in 2015 to around $162.76 in 2020.\n  - The S&P 500 index increased from approximately $100 in 2015 to around $203.12 in 2020.\n  - Therefore, while both Amgen and the S&P 500 experienced growth over the period, the S&P 500 outperformed Amgen in terms of stock return.\n\nSecondly, let's look at the trends in Amgen's stock repurchase activities:\n- The text quote [4] indicates that during the three months and year ended December 31, 2020, Amgen had one outstanding stock repurchase program.\n- Image2 provides detailed data on Amgen's stock repurchase activities for the periods October 1 to October 31, November 1 to November 30, and December 1 to December 31, 2020. It shows:\n  - A total of 5,304,313 shares were purchased under the publicly announced program.\n  - The average price paid per share was $230.35.\n  - The maximum dollar value that may yet be purchased under the program decreased from $3,781,230,811 on October 1 to $2,976,579,948 on December 31.\n- This suggests that Amgen actively engaged in stock repurchases throughout 2020, with a decreasing amount of funds available for future repurchases by the end of the year.\n\nIn conclusion, while Amgen experienced positive growth in its stock price from 2015 to 2020, it did not outperform the S&P 500 index in terms of stock return.

According to [6], Table 14 presents regulatory capital information for BANA in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2020, and 2019. The table shows that BANA met the definition of well capitalized under the PCA framework for both periods.\n\nNext, we can refer to image6, which provides detailed risk-based capital metrics and leverage-based metrics for December 31, 2020, and 2019.

According to [3] and image3, S Fallscheer held 4,140,000 shares at the beginning of FY19 and purchased an additional 1,687,764 shares during the year, resulting in a total of 5,827,764 shares held at the end of FY20. This indicates a significant increase in shareholdings.\n\nNext, we examine the remuneration details. From [7] and image5, we can see that S Fallscheer's total remuneration increased from $1,282,749 in FY19 to $1,341,286 in FY20. The breakdown shows increases in salary & fees, non-monetary benefits, and performance-based payments.\n\nThe implications of these changes on S Fallscheer's financial position are positive. The increase in shareholdings suggests a stronger alignment with shareholder interests, potentially leading to greater influence within the company. The rise in remuneration reflects enhanced value contribution and possibly better performance outcomes.\n\nIn summary, S Fallscheer experienced a notable increase in both shareholdings and remuneration from FY19 to FY20, which likely strengthens their financial position and influence within the company.\n![S Fallscheer's shareholdings and remuneration increased significantly from FY19 to FY20](image3)"}

The cost of revenues increased from RMB16,761 million in 2019 to RMB21,840 million in 2021 [6]. This increase is primarily due to higher service costs, which rose from RMB14,967 million in 2019 to RMB18,992 million in 2021 [6]. Additionally, other cost of revenues also increased from RMB1,794 million in 2019 to RMB2,848 million in 2021 [6].\n\nOperating expenses also saw an increase, with total operating expenses rising from RMB4,744 million in 2019 to RMB6,687 million in 2021 [2]. This increase was driven by higher selling and marketing expenses, which grew from RMB2,041 million in 2019 to RMB2,678 million in 2021 [2], and general and administrative expenses, which increased from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,009 million in 2021 [2].\n\nThese changes indicate that the company has been investing more in its operations and expanding its services, which could be a sign of growth and strategic investment.

The increase in noncurrent assets by $3,039 million (adjusted for currency) suggests a reinvestment in long-term resources, which could enhance the company's operational capacity and future revenue potential [7]. This is supported by the data showing an increase in deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets, partially offset by decreases in long-term financing receivables and net intangible assets [9].\n\nConcurrently, the decrease in long-term debt by $3,253 million (adjusted for currency) reflects a reduction in financial leverage, potentially lowering interest expenses and improving the company's debt-to-equity ratio [8]. This aligns with the overall decrease in total debt from $62,899 million to $61,538 million, indicating a more conservative financial stance [12].\n\nIn terms of cash flows, the significant drop in financing activities from a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a net use of $9,721 million in 2020 highlights a major change in how IBM is managing its liquidity [2]. This shift, driven by various factors including decreased cash from acquisitions and increased cash used for marketable securities, suggests a reallocation of capital towards different investment priorities [4].\n\nRegarding equity, the decrease by $258 million primarily due to dividends paid and declines in accumulated other comprehensive income was partially offset by increases from net income and common stock [6]. This indicates that while IBM returned value to shareholders through dividends, it also maintained a strong earnings performance.\n\nOverall, these financial changes suggest that IBM is focusing on strengthening its balance sheet by reducing debt and reinvesting in long-term assets, which could position the company for sustainable growth and improved financial health in the long term.\n![Global Financing's provision for expected credit losses increased by $34 million in 2020](image4)"}

Of those who availed leave, 967 (94%) returned to work after the leave ended, and 66 (6%) were still employed after 12 months.\n- **Male Employees**: 98,347 are entitled to parental leave, with 2023 availing it. Of those who availed leave, 1,941 (96%) returned to work after the leave ended, and 75 (4%) were still employed after 12 months.\n\nFrom these numbers, we can see that a higher percentage of male employees who took parental leave returned to work compared to female employees (96% vs. 94%). However, a smaller proportion of male employees who returned to work after parental leave were still employed after 12 months compared to female employees (4% vs. 6%).\n\nThis data suggests that while both male and female employees are returning to work after taking parental leave, there may be factors affecting the long-term retention of female employees post-parental leave. This could reflect on the gender diversity policies in the workplace, indicating a need for further support and initiatives to ensure equal opportunities and retention for female employees.\n\n[7] Our family of 1.2 Lakh+ employees with diverse socio-economic and educational backgrounds enable us deliver hyper-personalised experiences to our customers.

Therefore:\n- For 2016: $199 million + $196 million = $395 million\n- For 2017: $322 million + $128 million = $450 million\n- For 2018: $350 million + $73 million = $423 million\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the total net expense increased from $395 million in 2016 to $423 million in 2018.\n\nTherefore, the total net expense increased by $28 million from 2016 to 2018.\n![The table shows the changes in interest expense and pension and post-retirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) from 2016 to 2018](image7)"}

The most significant increase occurred in Spain, with an additional 144 stores, followed by the \"Rest of Europe\" with an additional 39 stores, and the Americas with an additional 66 stores.\n\nThe reasons behind these changes could be attributed to Inditex's store optimization activities mentioned in [1], which included openings, refurbishments, and enlargements. Additionally, the pandemic's impact on store operations in 2020, as described in [11], may have led to a strategic focus on expanding in certain regions to recover lost sales and adapt to changing consumer behaviors.\n\nIn conclusion, the geographical distribution of Inditex's stores changed with increases in Spain, the rest of Europe, and the Americas, likely due to strategic expansion efforts and recovery from pandemic-related disruptions."}

On the other hand, Rural Development Projects have expenditures ranging from ₹0.06 crore to ₹18.55 crore, with a significant investment of ₹18.55 crore in Gujarat and Rajasthan for Dairy Support.\n\n### Implementation Methods\nThe implementation methods also differ between the two types of projects. COVID Relief projects are primarily implemented through implementing agencies, as indicated by the \"No\" entries under the \"Mode of Implementation - Direct (Yes/No)\" column.

Let's start by examining the comprehensive income figures from the provided financial statements.\n\nFrom [7], we can see that UnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income increased from $10,865 million in 2018 to $14,821 million in 2019 and further to $15,167 million in 2020. This indicates a positive trend in comprehensive income over the three-year period.\n\nTo understand the factors contributing to these changes, we need to look at the components of comprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI comprises items such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, and pension plan adjustments.\n\nFrom [7], we can observe that net earnings increased from $12,382 million in 2018 to $14,239 million in 2019 and further to $15,769 million in 2020. This growth in net earnings is a significant factor contributing to the increase in comprehensive income.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the impact of OCI on comprehensive income. From [7], we can see that OCI fluctuated over the three years. In 2018, OCI was a loss of $1,517 million, which reduced comprehensive income. In 2019, OCI was a gain of $582 million, which added to comprehensive income. In 2020, OCI was a loss of $236 million, which again reduced comprehensive income but to a lesser extent than in 2018.\n\nThe fluctuations in OCI are primarily due to changes in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. These factors can be influenced by market conditions, exchange rate movements, and changes in the fair value of investments.\n\nIn summary, the increase in comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 for UnitedHealth Group can be attributed to the growth in net earnings, despite some fluctuations in other comprehensive income. The company's strong performance in generating net earnings has been a key driver of the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n![Comprehensive income increased from $10,865 million in 2018 to $15,167 million in 2020, driven by growth in net earnings and fluctuations in other comprehensive income.]()"}

The table in image6 shows the breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the years 2021 and 2022.\n\nFor deferred tax assets:\n- In 2021, the total deferred tax assets were $4,564.\n- In 2022, the total deferred tax assets decreased to $4,091.\n\nFor deferred tax liabilities:\n- In 2021, the total deferred tax liabilities were $8,503.\n- In 2022, the total deferred tax liabilities increased to $9,288.\n\nThe decrease in deferred tax assets and the increase in deferred tax liabilities suggest that the company has recognized more future tax obligations than benefits. This could indicate a shift in the company's expectations regarding future taxable income or changes in tax laws that affect the timing of tax payments.\n\nThe impact on the financial position of the company is that the net deferred tax liability has increased from $3,939 (8,503 - 4,564) in 2021 to $5,197 (9,288 - 4,091) in 2022. This means that the company has a larger amount of future tax obligations compared to future tax benefits, which could potentially reduce the company's cash flow in the future if these liabilities become due.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between 2021 and 2022 have resulted in a higher net deferred tax liability, indicating a potential reduction in future cash flow for the company.

These groups settled in clusters across the county, contributing to its diverse cultural landscape. The establishment of rural school districts and churches also played a role in the county's development [1][4].\n\nHowever, the decline in population after 1890 can be linked to several factors, including the consolidation of farms, which led to fewer but larger farm units [6], and the shift in economic activities away from small towns [10]. Additionally, the changing transportation patterns, particularly the importance of rail connections, affected town development and population distribution [10].\n\nIn summary, the population trends of Hamilton County were shaped by a combination of federal policies, agricultural practices, and transportation developments, leading to an initial boom followed by a gradual decline."}

The relevant evidence includes both text and image quotes.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the overall trend in Americans' perceptions of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power over time. According to [7], there has been a decline in this perception since March 2020, with 52% of Americans still seeing their country as the world's leading economic power, down from 59% in March. This is further supported by the line graph in image8, which shows a downward trend in the percentage of Americans who believe the U.S. is the world's leading economic power from 2017 to 2020.\n\nNext, we need to consider the differences in these perceptions between political affiliations. According to [6], Democrats have become significantly less likely to see the U.S. as the leading global economy, with 54% holding this opinion in March compared to 44% today. This is corroborated by the line graph in image4, which shows a clear divergence in the views of Republicans and Democrats over time, with Republicans consistently more likely to view the U.S. as the leading economic power than Democrats.\n\nAdditionally, [3] mentions that about three-quarters of Americans say they have not too much confidence or no confidence at all in Chinese President Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs. This sentiment is reflected in the stacked area chart in image2, which shows a significant increase in the percentage of Americans who have no confidence at all in Xi from 2018 to 2020.\n\nFinally, [4] notes that there is a partisan divide in evaluations of Xi, with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now 10 points more likely than their Democratic counterparts to have no confidence at all in Xi. This is consistent with the line graph in image3, which shows a growing gap between Republicans and Democrats in their views of Xi.\n\nIn conclusion, Americans' perceptions of their country's status as the world's leading economic power have declined over time, with a significant difference in these perceptions between political affiliations, particularly between Republicans and Democrats. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between these perceptions and the level of confidence Americans have in Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n![Americans' perceptions of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power have declined over time](image8)"}

This indicates that Republicans generally perceive a higher level of threat from international issues compared to Democrats.\n\nNext, we can examine image4, which provides a bar chart comparing the percentages of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents who believe that U.S. efforts to solve problems usually make things worse versus those who believe problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement. The chart shows that 62% of Republicans believe problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement, while only 31% think U.S. efforts usually make things worse. In contrast, 56% of Democrats believe problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement, and 37% think U.S. efforts usually make things worse. For Independents, 50% believe problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement, and 43% think U.S. efforts usually make things worse.\n\nAdditionally, text quote [5] mentions that overall, 55% say that problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement, compared with fewer (38%) who say U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world usually end up making things worse. This aligns with the data presented in image4.\n\nFinally, text quote [12] states that comparable majorities of both Republicans (62%) and Democrats (56%) say world problems would be worse without U.S. involvement. This further supports the findings from image4 and text quote [5].\n\nIn conclusion, the data suggests that Republicans are more likely to believe that problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement, while Democrats and Independents are more divided on this issue.\n![Republicans are more likely to believe that problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement](image4)"}

It states that for each model pair, there is a bit higher than 10% of cases where there is no agreement among the three annotators, which are considered as ties. On about 28% to 35% of the pairs, all annotators have unanimous judgments, and in about 55% to 60% of the pairs, one annotator differs from the other two. This indicates that while there is a significant portion of unanimous judgments, there is also a notable amount of disagreement, suggesting that the relative evaluation can be challenging and that Chameleon performs similarly to other baselines in many cases.\n\nThe image quote `![image5 shows the number of cases where all three annotators agree, two annotators agree, and there is no agreement for different model comparisons.]()` further supports this by showing the exact counts and percentages of agreement levels for various model comparisons involving Chameleon. For instance, when comparing Chameleon vs. Gemini+, there are 331 cases (31.5%) where all three annotators agree, 609 cases (58.1%) where two of three annotators agree, and 108 cases (10.3%) where there is no agreement. Similar patterns are observed for other model comparisons.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that while there is a substantial level of agreement among annotators, the relatively high percentage of cases where there is no agreement or only two out of three annotators agree indicates that the inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance may have some variability. This could imply that the evaluation of Chameleon's performance, especially in relative terms, might be subject to interpretation and that the model's performance is perceived similarly to other strong baselines in many instances.\n\nIn conclusion, the inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance appears to be reasonably high, with a majority of cases showing agreement among annotators, but there is also a notable degree of variability that suggests the evaluation can be challenging and that Chameleon performs comparably to other strong baselines in many cases.[4]"}

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings, optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques [9]. The process involves encoding images and text into feature embeddings and indexing them for efficient retrieval.\n\n2. **Index System**: To enhance the speed of retrieval, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented [7]. This facilitates dimensionality reduction, transforming vectors in a high-dimensional space into a reduced one, which significantly speeds up the retrieval process.\n\n3. **Retrieving & Ranking**: In this phase, the retrieved category labels alongside image embedding are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [2]. The MLLMs combine their internal knowledge with the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category. This ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n4. **Prompt Design**: The prompt primarily serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory, guiding MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5].\n\n5. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: For object detection datasets, additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring are applied to help the MLLMs focus on the relevant objects [4].\n\n6. **Memory Construction**: Memory $\\mathcal{M}$ is constructed using a multimodal retriever, which is then integrated with the retrieval process to enhance performance in few-shot/zero-shot perception tasks [6].\n\n![RAR Pipeline](image1)\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline integrates these components to improve the fine-grained few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs by retrieving and ranking relevant information efficiently [1]."}

The table shows that for the CLIP model, the average precision (AP) increases progressively from $\\mathrm{AP_{r}}$ through $\\mathrm{AP_{c}}$ to $\\mathrm{AP_{f}}$, indicating a gradation in precision across varying class frequencies. However, the RAR method achieves its peak performance on $\\mathrm{AP_{r}}$, surpassing the CLIP model by as much as 19.6 percentage points. This significant leap in performance suggests a substantial advantage of the RAR method when it comes to rare categories.\n\nThe integration of RAR into MLLMs plays a pivotal role here, as it demonstrates a heightened ability to discriminate among the rare classes. Our retrieving and reranking mechanism effectively pools relevant information from the external memory, providing the MLLMs with a richer context for rare class identification. Moreover, the ranking capability of MLLMs ensures that even the lesser-represented classes receive adequate attention during the classification process.

Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. The steps for this method are outlined below:\n\n![Comparison of F1 scores for collapsed tree and tree traversal](image8)\n\nFrom the graph, it is evident that the collapsed tree approach consistently outperforms tree traversal across various context lengths, achieving higher F1 scores. This suggests that the collapsed tree method is more effective in retrieving relevant information for a given question, as it allows for greater flexibility in choosing nodes from different layers based on the question's detail level [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the collapsed tree querying method demonstrates superior performance compared to tree traversal in terms of F1 score across different context lengths."}

The table in [7] shows a high number of items with errors for both blog and article types from schema.org, with 72,441 and 49,222 errors respectively. These errors can negatively affect how search engines interpret and display content, potentially leading to lower rankings and reduced visibility.\n\nSecondly, the meta description issues are also noteworthy. The table in [3] indicates that there are 2,215 duplicate meta descriptions and 1,450 short meta descriptions. Duplicate meta descriptions can confuse search engines about the uniqueness of pages, while short meta descriptions may not provide enough information to users or search engines, leading to missed opportunities for click-throughs and engagement.\n\nTo further understand the impact, we can look at the backlink discovery graph in [1]. The steady increase in backlinks suggests that despite the structured markup and meta description issues, the site is still gaining authority. However, it's important to note that the quality and relevance of these backlinks are crucial. If the backlinks are from low-quality sources or irrelevant pages, they may not contribute positively to the site's SEO performance.\n\nIn conclusion, structured markup errors and meta description issues can have a detrimental effect on SEO performance by affecting how search engines interpret and display content, as well as potentially reducing user engagement and click-through rates. Addressing these issues is essential for optimizing a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results.\n![Structured markup errors and meta description issues can negatively impact SEO performance by affecting how search engines interpret and display content, as well as potentially reducing user engagement and click-through rates.]"}

The graph clearly indicates a significant upward trend over these years.\n\nNext, for the pure-play vendors, we have specific data points. In [8], it is mentioned that the Big Data Pure-Play Revenue was $468M in '1. Although this quote does not specify the year, we can infer it might be referring to an earlier period given the relatively low revenue figure compared to the overall market. To get a more detailed view of the pure-play vendor revenues, we can refer to image7, which provides a bar chart showing the total Big Data Pure-Play Revenue as $468 million, distributed among various companies like Vertica, Opera Solutions, Mu Sigma, etc.\n\nBy comparing these two pieces of information, we can conclude that while the overall big data market experienced substantial growth, reaching $53.4B by 2017, the pure-play vendors also contributed significantly, with a collective revenue of $468M. However, the exact comparative growth trend between overall and pure-play vendors would require more detailed annual figures for pure-play vendors, which are not provided here.\n\nIn summary, the big data market, including both overall and pure-play vendors, showed robust growth from 2011 to 2017, with the overall market reaching $53.4B by 2017 and pure-play vendors contributing a notable $468M.\n![The overall revenue in the big data market grew from $5.1B in 2012 to $53.4B in 2017.]"}
