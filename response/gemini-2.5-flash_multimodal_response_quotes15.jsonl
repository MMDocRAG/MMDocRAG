A modest share of workers with high school diplomas or less (38%) indicate that technology has made their jobs more interesting, and a similarly low share (32%) feel it has increased their opportunities for career advancement; these figures are substantially lower than those reported by workers with more education [2].\n\n![Percentage of workers by educational attainment who say technology made their work more interesting or increased opportunities for advancement](image5)\n\nCollege graduates are also somewhat more likely to say technology has made their work more demanding (45% vs. 36%), but also more likely to say it has made their work less demanding (31% vs. 20%) [1]. Across various common workplace technologies, workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those without college to say each has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers [4].\n\nEducational attainment profoundly affects the perceived impact of technology on work, with workers holding higher levels of education being significantly more likely to view technology positively regarding making work more interesting and increasing opportunities for advancement."}

While effectiveness and fairness views often align, there are notable exceptions that highlight differing levels of public trust. [4]\n\nLet's examine the perceived effectiveness and fairness across four different automated systems: automated personal finance scores, automated video analysis of job interviews, automated resume screening of job applicants, and automated scoring of people up for parole.\n![A table showing effectiveness and fairness percentages for four automated systems, with the automated personal finance score having the largest positive difference (+22) between effectiveness (54%) and fairness (32%).](image3)\n\nThe automated personal finance score stands out as a system where perceived effectiveness significantly outweighs perceived fairness. Some 54% of Americans think this system would be effective at identifying good customers, but only 32% believe it would be fair to consumers. [1], [8] This 22-percentage-point difference is the largest among the scenarios presented. [8] Public skepticism about the fairness of this system is particularly high. [7], [9] When asked directly, a large majority (68%) find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable. [9]\n![A bar chart showing that 68% of U.S. adults find the use of automated personal finance scores unacceptable, with reasons for unacceptability including violating privacy, not representing the person accurately, and being unfair or discriminatory.](image2)\nReasons for this high unacceptability include concerns that it violates privacy, doesn't represent a person accurately, or is unfair/discriminatory. [image2]\n\nIn contrast, the automated criminal risk score concept sees a much smaller difference between perceived effectiveness and fairness. While 49% think it would be effective at identifying people deserving of parole, half (50%) think it would be fair to those being analyzed. [1] The perception of fairness for the parole scoring algorithm is higher than for the personal finance score or video job interview analysis. [7], [image4]\n![A stacked bar chart showing the breakdown of fairness perceptions for four automated systems, with automated scoring of people up for parole having the highest percentage of people rating it as 'Somewhat fair' or 'Very fair'.](image4)\n\nAutomated resume screening and video job interview analysis fall somewhere in between, with smaller differences between perceived effectiveness and fairness compared to the personal finance score, but generally lower fairness perceptions than the parole scoring system. [5], [7], [image3], [image4] Only around one-third of Americans think the video job interview or personal finance score algorithms would be fair. [9]\n\nOverall, these differing perceptions imply that public trust in automated systems is not universal but is highly dependent on the application context. [6] The significant gap between effectiveness and fairness for systems like the personal finance score, coupled with high rates of perceived unfairness and unacceptability, indicates lower public trust compared to systems where fairness and effectiveness perceptions are more aligned, such as the criminal risk score. General concerns about whether algorithms inherently reflect human bias also contribute to this varying trust.

Overall, a substantial majority of adults favor requiring government-issued photo identification to vote [10].\n\nAmong Democrats, however, White adults are less supportive of requiring photo identification than Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults [6]. This is clearly illustrated by data showing support among Democrats:\n![Support among Democrats for requiring government-issued photo identification to vote varies by race, with White Democrats showing the lowest support.](image1)\nWhile 54% of White Democrats favor this requirement, support is higher among Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian (71%) Democrats [6], [1]. This pattern contrasts with the general trend among Democrats, where White adults are often as, or more, supportive of policies aimed at making it easier to vote [1].\n\nViews on voting accessibility policies often show different racial dynamics, especially within partisan groups. For example, White Democrats are more supportive of allowing all voters to vote early or absentee than are Democrats of other races and ethnicities [2]. Image 5 provides a detailed look at this:\n![Support for allowing any voter the option to vote early or absentee shows variations by race and political affiliation, with strong support among Democrats and lower support among Republicans.](image5)\nThis image shows that 59% of White adults favor allowing any voter to vote early or absentee, compared to 81% of Black adults and 63% of Hispanic adults [5]. Among Democrats specifically, 84% favor this option, with White Democrats showing 59% support, Black Democrats 81%, and Hispanic Democrats 63% [5].\n\nBy contrast, among Republicans, White adults are less supportive than Hispanic adults of policies aimed at easing voting [3]. For example, about half of Hispanic Republicans (51%) favor automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote, compared with 35% of White Republicans [3]. Overall, White adults are less likely to favor making Election Day a national holiday and automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote than are Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults [4]. Furthermore, Black adults are often distinctive in their preferences for more expansive voting policies and show among the lowest levels of support for restrictive policies like voter list removal or requiring photo ID [7], [5].\n\nIn summary, while photo identification requirements generally garner broad support but show White Democrats less supportive than other Democrats, voting accessibility policies exhibit more varied racial and partisan patterns, including White Democrats often being more supportive of easing access than other Democrats, and White Republicans being less supportive than Hispanic Republicans.\n\nRacial and political affiliations significantly influence perspectives on voting policies, with support for photo ID requirements showing a different pattern by race among Democrats than support for certain accessibility policies."}

Artists who succeed in top streaming and album sales are seen as trendsetters [5], further emphasizing the importance of mastering the formats preferred by their genre's audience.\n\nThe trends show that while streaming leads overall, album and song sales still hold varying levels of importance depending on the music genre, requiring the industry to adopt genre-specific strategies."}

Specific demonstration selection strategies, such as those based on sentence embedding or EPR, substantially surpass random sampling in terms of F1 score [10].\n\n![Box plots showing F1 scores for random, sentence embedding (embed), and EPR demonstration selection methods.](image3)\n\nThe rightmost panel of the figure above clearly shows that 'embed' (sentence embedding) and 'epr' strategies result in notably higher F1 scores compared to 'random' selection for demonstrations. The study adopted the sentence embedding strategy for its main experiments due to its simplicity and superior performance over random sampling [10]. The impact of instruction format and demonstration selection, as shown in the plots above, applies to the LLMs studied, including ChatGPT and Codex, as they are central to the comparison of LLMs and SLMs under various settings [5].\n\nWhen comparing ChatGPT and Codex to other models on the FewNERD dataset specifically, their performance relative to other models, including fine-tuned SLMs and other LLMs like InstructGPT, LLaMA, and Vicuna, varies with the number of shots (demonstrations).\n\n![Line plots showing F1 scores across different shot numbers (1-shot, 5-shot, 10-shot, 20-shot) for various models on CONLL03, OntoNotes, and FewNERD.](image1)\n\nAs shown in the rightmost panel of the figure above for FewNERD, fine-tuned models (dashed red line) and methods like UIE (dashed cyan line) or FSLS (dashed orange line) generally show improvements as the number of shots increases.

Open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Vicuna (solid darker lines) demonstrate more limited capacity in leveraging demonstrations, with performance stagnating or collapsing with few demos [3].\n\nIn conclusion, for ChatGPT and Codex performance on FewNERD, demonstration selection based on methods like sentence embedding significantly improves F1 scores compared to random selection, while different instruction formats have a less pronounced but still present impact. When compared to other models on FewNERD, ChatGPT and Codex perform within a certain range, showing improvement with more shots but potentially plateauing earlier than fine-tuned SLMs, and generally performing better than open-source LLMs at low shot counts."}

For refuted claims, common reasons include incorrect calculation results, wrong approximation words, claims being partially right, values not matching, and incorrect operation types [8]. According to the data, the most frequent reason for refutation is an incorrect calculation result, accounting for 41.7% of cases, followed by incorrect approximation words at 33.3% `![Table showing proportions of reasons for refuted and NEI claims.](image4)`. This diversity in reasons, beyond simple negation found in other datasets, reflects the nuances of real-world scientific claims [8].\n\nNEI claims are typically due to a lack of sufficient evidence within the provided table or a need for additional background knowledge, either closed-domain or open-domain [3]. The most common reason for an NEI claim is that the claim does not have enough matching evidence, making up 33.3% of such cases `![Table showing proportions of reasons for refuted and NEI claims.](image4)`. Other reasons for NEI include lack of open-domain knowledge (25.0%), lack of closed-domain knowledge (15.0%), reference to another table, vague pronouns, and omission of specific information [3] `![Table showing proportions of reasons for refuted and NEI claims.](image4)`. These reasons emphasize that verifying some scientific claims requires more than just reading a table; it can necessitate external knowledge and careful handling of ambiguous language [3].\n\nThese complex reasons significantly impact the performance of different models, especially in the zero-shot 3-class classification setting, which includes supported, refuted, and NEI labels [9]. The inclusion of the NEI class poses a considerable challenge, leading to notably poorer results compared to the 2-class setting where NEI is excluded [10]. Models often struggle to accurately predict the NEI class or distinguish between refuted and NEI claims [1, 10]. For instance, InstructGPT frequently misclassifies supported and refuted claims as NEI, showing a tendency to be \"less confident,\" while GPT-4 incorrectly categorizes NEI claims as supported or refuted, exhibiting overconfidence `![Confusion matrices showing label distribution percentage for InstructGPT and GPT-4 in zero-shot 3-class setting.](image2)` [6]. This difficulty in distinguishing verifiability is a key challenge [6], causing models to potentially lose confidence and shift predictions towards NEI when faced with claims requiring extensive reasoning or deep understanding [1, 10].

This suggests that with more missing knowledge, the model in this setting becomes more accurate (higher precision) at identifying statements that *cannot* be supported by the provided knowledge, improving the overall F1-Score [5]. The stable recall indicates that the model has a limited ability to identify *all* statements that require missing knowledge [5].\n\nConversely, in the context of retrieval analysis, which simulates retrieval accuracy by replacing ground truth knowledge graphs with irrelevant ones [1], the trends are different.\n![Retrieval analysis results showing the downward trends of correctness, precision, recall, and F1_Score as retrieval accuracy decreases](image5)\nAll metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-Score, show clear downward trends as retrieval accuracy drops [10]. The impact on recall is much more significant than on precision [10], meaning the model's ability to cite all necessary information deteriorates drastically when the correct knowledge is not retrieved [7]. Precision also drops, but the model retains some ability to filter out incorrect retrieved knowledge [10]. This highlights the crucial role of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts [3].\n\nThe removal of knowledge elements leads to differing outcomes depending on the simulation; in the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting simulating absent knowledge, precision and F1-Score rise while recall is stable, indicating improved identification of unsupported statements with more missing data, whereas in retrieval analysis simulating incorrectly retrieved knowledge, precision, recall, and F1-Score all fall, demonstrating the critical dependence on accurate input knowledge."}

Specifically, incorporating relevant logic into the reasoning process helps models perform better on complex reasoning tasks [3, 4, 6]. For instance, comparing \"vanilla ICL w. CoT\" with \"CoT w. logical constraints,\" models across the board demonstrate improved Micro-F1 and reduced Logical Inconsistency on both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank.\n![Table comparing performance with vanilla ICL, CoT, and CoT with logical constraints across models and datasets](image1)\n\nBeyond logical constraints, the number of demonstration samples provided to the model also impacts performance [7]. Performance typically improves as the number of demonstrations increases, although the gains tend to become limited after a certain point (e.g., beyond 10 samples) [7].\n\nCrucially, the combination of both demonstrations and logical constraints is shown to be more effective than either method alone [7]. Adding logical constraints provides stable improvements and can even allow models with fewer demonstrations to outperform those with a larger number of demonstrations but without logical constraints [7]. The left graph in Image 4 illustrates this, showing that performance increases with the number of demonstrations, and performance is consistently higher when logical constraints are included compared to using only demonstrations.\n![Graph showing the effect of increasing demonstration samples with and without logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank performance](image4)\n\nIn summary, both logical constraints and demonstration samples positively influence model performance on these datasets, with logical constraints providing stable improvements and enhancing the effectiveness of demonstrations.\n\nThe use of logical constraints and demonstration samples generally improves model performance on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

This is consistently reflected in the results tables.\n\n![Post-processing consistently achieves 0% Logical Inconsistency across various models and datasets.]()\n\nFor example, on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 all show an LI of 0% when using post-processing. This also holds true for the Causal-TimeBank dataset [image1]. Similarly, the pre-trained versions, Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, also achieve 0% LI with post-processing on both datasets [image3]. Text quote [8] corroborates this, stating that post-processing results in LI of 0%.\n\nIn contrast, incorporating logical constraints, whether all available or retrieved, significantly reduces logical inconsistency compared to baselines without them [3, 8]. However, this reduction does not typically bring the LI down to 0%, although the extent of the reduction varies considerably depending on the model and the dataset. For instance, on MAVEN-ERE, GPT-4 with all logical constraints achieved an LI of 8.3%, which is a substantial reduction but still non-zero [image1]. Other models like Vicuna and Llama2 showed much higher LI percentages even with logical constraints (e.g., Vicuna with all logical constraints had 37.6% LI on MAVEN-ERE) [image1]. On the Causal-TimeBank dataset, using logical constraints also resulted in varied but generally non-zero LI percentages across different models [image1].\n\nThe studies suggest that while post-processing is most effective at eliminating logical inconsistency, it may negatively impact the quality of the overall generation, whereas logical constraints reduce inconsistency and can lead to stable performance improvements [2, 8]. Teaching LLMs explicit logical constraints has been shown to improve their logical consistency [3].\n\nPost-processing is the most effective method for achieving zero logical inconsistency, while logical constraints effectively reduce inconsistency to varying degrees depending on the model and dataset."}

In this basic setup, upon receiving a user query, the system encodes it into a vector, computes similarity scores against indexed document chunks, retrieves the top K most similar chunks, and uses these chunks as context for the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a response [10].\n\nAdvanced RAG represents a significant improvement over Naive RAG, specifically targeting enhancements in retrieval quality [1]. It introduces pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies to optimize the process [1]. Pre-retrieval steps might involve query routing or rewriting, while post-retrieval steps can include re-ranking or fusion of retrieved results [1]. Additionally, Advanced RAG refines indexing techniques through methods like a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and incorporating metadata, alongside other optimization methods [1].\n![Flowcharts comparing the pipelines of Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and the modular structure/patterns of Modular RAG](image3)\n\nModular RAG further advances the architecture, offering enhanced adaptability and versatility beyond the Naive and Advanced paradigms [8].

With UnifiedQA, RAPTOR scored 36.6%, 4.5 points higher than DPR and 10.2 points higher than BM25 [4]. This consistent outperformance is visually represented in Table 3.\n\n![Table 3 shows F-1 scores for different retrievers with GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA on the QASPER dataset, where RAPTOR achieves the highest scores across all three language models.](image2)\n\nFurthermore, RAPTOR with GPT-4 sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark on QASPER with a 55.7% F-1 score, exceeding the previous best score of 53.9% achieved by CoLT5 XL [3].\n\nFor the QuALITY dataset, RAPTOR also shows significant improvements [5, 7]. When paired with GPT-3, RAPTOR achieved an accuracy of 62.4%, which is a 2% improvement over DPR (60.4%) and a 5.1% improvement over BM25 (57.3%). Similar trends are observed with UnifiedQA, where RAPTOR's accuracy of 56.6% surpasses DPR (53.9%) by 2.7% and BM25 (49.9%) by 6.7% [7]. These results are summarized in Table 4.\n\n![Table 4 presents accuracy scores on the QuALITY dev dataset for BM25, DPR, and RAPTOR when used with GPT-3 and UnifiedQA, showing RAPTOR's superior performance.](image1)\n\nRemarkably, on the QuALITY dataset, RAPTOR paired with GPT-4 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.6%, vastly improving upon the previous best result of 62.3% [8]. This significant gain is particularly evident on the challenging QuALITY-HARD subset, where RAPTOR outperforms CoLISA by 21.5% [8]. Table 7 illustrates this performance jump.\n\n![Table 7 shows accuracy scores on the QuALITY dataset, including a Hard Subset, for several models, highlighting RAPTOR + GPT-4's new state-of-the-art performance.](image3)\n\nOn the Narrative QA dataset, which uses metrics like ROUGE-L, BLEU, and METEOR, RAPTOR paired with UnifiedQA not only outperforms traditional retrieval methods like BM25 and DPR but also sets a new state-of-the-art in the METEOR metric [2, 6]. Compared to a recursively summarizing model by Wu et al. (2021), RAPTOR outperforms it on all metrics [6].

The contribution of non-leaf nodes from the hierarchical structure during retrieval is shown in Figure 7, underscoring the importance of RAPTOR's multi-level summarization [10]. Additionally, combining RAPTOR with different base retrievers like SBERT, BM25, and DPR generally improves their performance on both QuALITY and QASPER datasets [Image 5].\n\n![Table showing Accuracy on QUALITY and Answer F1 on QASPER for SBERT, BM25, and DPR, with and without RAPTOR, demonstrating performance gains when RAPTOR is applied.](image5)\n\nOverall, RAPTOR consistently improves performance on question-answering tasks across various datasets and language models, often setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks."}

Fine-grained visual recognition typically measures classification accuracy on datasets with subtle distinctions between classes, while zero-shot object recognition, as evaluated in the provided context, is assessed through metrics like Average Precision (AP) on object detection datasets under zero-shot settings, which involves both classification and localization.\n\nIn the domain of fine-grained visual recognition, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like LLaVA1.5 initially face challenges when dealing with extensive vocabularies and subtle distinctions, largely due to limitations in their context window size [4]. The RAR method is designed to address these issues by integrating retrieval and ranking mechanisms [8]. Results show that RAR (LLaVA1.5) significantly improves classification accuracy on numerous datasets, including fine-grained ones [1], [9]. For example, across 11 datasets, including 4 fine-grained ones, RAR (LLaVA1.5) boosts average top-1 accuracy from 57.0% to 63.2% in the 4-shot setting and from 63.0% to 69.8% in the 8-shot setting compared to initial retrieval results [1].\n\n![Accuracy results for RAR (LLaVA1.5) and baselines on various datasets in 4-shot and 8-shot settings, including fine-grained ones like Flower102, StanfordCars, Food101, and OxfordPets.]()\n\nSpecifically on fine-grained datasets shown in Image 1, RAR (LLaVA1.5) achieves high accuracy such as 80.4% on Flower102, 54.4% on StanfordCars, 71.4% on Food101, and 60.9% on OxfordPets in the 4-shot setting. These figures demonstrate a notable capability in distinguishing fine-grained categories [Image 1]. RAR's effectiveness in handling fine-grained image classification is further highlighted by its improvements over methods like CLIP+KNN and the LLaVa model itself [9].\n\nFor zero-shot object recognition, particularly as evaluated on object detection datasets like LVIS and V3Det, the task involves recognizing objects from unseen classes without specific training examples for those classes, often in conjunction with object localization [6], [8]. This presents challenges related to both large category numbers and the need for precise bounding box predictions. The RAR method is applied to improve performance in this setting as well [8]. On the LVIS dataset, RAR (LLaVA1.5) achieves an overall Average Precision (APall) of 56.2% [Image 3].\n\n![Average Precision results for RAR (LLaVA1.5) and baselines on the LVIS zero-shot object detection dataset.]()\n\nOn the V3Det dataset, which contains an extremely large number of fine-grained categories (13,204), RAR also demonstrates improved performance [10]. RAR (LLaVA1.5) achieves an APall of 11.1% on this highly challenging dataset [Image 5]. While the absolute AP numbers might appear lower than classification accuracies, they reflect the increased complexity of the object detection task compared to classification, especially on a dataset like V3Det [10]. Across both LVIS and V3Det, RAR (LLaVA1.5) shows improvements over baseline methods [Image 3], [Image 5].\n\n![Average Precision results for RAR (LLaVA1.5) and baselines on the challenging V3Det zero-shot object detection dataset with a large number of classes.]()\n\nIn summary, RAR (LLaVA1.5) demonstrates strong performance in both fine-grained visual recognition (measured by accuracy) and zero-shot object recognition on object detection datasets (measured by Average Precision). Although direct numerical comparison between accuracy and AP is not standard, the evidence indicates that RAR effectively enhances LLaVA1.5's capabilities in handling the complexities of both distinguishing subtle visual differences and recognizing objects from a vast number of categories in a zero-shot context."}

The RAR approach integrates a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to generate candidate object predictions from a memory, which are then ranked and finalized by MLLMs [8]. This synergy helps overcome the limitations of CLIP in distinguishing fine-grained differences and MLLMs' reduced performance with increasing category numbers [8].\n\nThe empirical results demonstrate notable improvements. On the LVIS dataset, RAR achieves a 6.4% gain in zero-shot object recognition performance [5].\n\n![RAR models show improvement in AP across small, medium, and large objects, as well as overall AP compared to the CLIP w/ box baseline.](image1)\n\nAs shown in the table above, RAR models using different MLLM backbones (LLaVA1.5, Qwen-VL, InternLM-XC2) consistently improve the overall Average Precision ($AP_{all}$) compared to the CLIP w/ box baseline, with improvements ranging from +1.0 to +1.5 percentage points on this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, RAR shows significant strength in handling rare categories ($AP_r$) which are common in long-tailed distribution datasets like LVIS [7]. The table below shows a substantial improvement in $AP_r$.\n\n![RAR models achieve significantly higher AP for rare categories compared to CLIP baselines and RegionCLIP.](image2)\n\nWith the InternLM-XC2 backbone, RAR boosts $AP_r$ by an impressive 10.1 percentage points over the CLIP w/ box baseline [7].

It surpasses the CLIP baseline by 1.5 percentage points in overall average precision ($AP_{all}$) with the InternLM-XC2 model [9, 5].

This differs from standard image classification.\n\nInitially, the image is processed by cropping regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates [8]. These cropped regions are then resized to a fixed proportion [8]. To help the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focus on the intended object within these cropped regions, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the object of interest [8]. This process is illustrated in the diagram.\n\n![An image showing the pre-processing steps for object detection, including cropping based on bounding boxes, followed by embedding and retrieval using k-NN from memory, and finally ranking by an MLLM.](image4)\n\nAfter pre-processing and obtaining embeddings from the cropped regions, the system proceeds to the retrieval phase. Unlike image classification which might use image-to-image retrieval, object detection utilizes image-to-text retrieval based on CLIP's image-text interaction capabilities [6]. The system queries the constructed memory [1], [3], [10] which stores multimodal embeddings [3], using the processed image embeddings. This retrieval navigates the memory index [3], [10] via k-NN [10], image3, image4 to find the top-k most similar items [10], image4.\n\nThe output of the retrieval step is a list of the top-k candidate category names related to the object in the cropped region [6], [10], image4.\n\n![A diagram illustrating the overall architecture including a multimodal retriever constructing memory and a retrieving & ranking component where an image is processed, top-k categories are retrieved, and an MLLM ranks them.](image3)\n\nFinally, these retrieved category labels, alongside the image embedding, are sent to the MLLMs for ranking [5], image4. The MLLMs leverage their internal knowledge combined with the retrieved information to rank the candidate categories and make the final prediction for the object's category [5], [9]. This ranking improves precision by analyzing the contextual appropriateness of each retrieved class name with the input image [4]. While fine-tuning can enhance the MLLM's ranking ability [7], the core process involves the MLLM sorting the retrieved list [4]. An example of the retrieved list and the reranked result is shown.\n\n![An example illustrating object detection results showing the original objects with bounding boxes, the list of retrieved candidate categories for each object, and the final reranked category prediction.](image2)\n\nThe multimodal retriever system processes objects in detection datasets by first pre-processing bounding box regions through cropping and blurring, then performing image-to-text retrieval from memory to get top-k candidate categories, and finally using an MLLM to rank these candidates for the final prediction."}

TimeQA is classified as a Knowledge QA dataset, while StrategyQA is a Multi-hop Reasoning dataset [7]. TimeQA involves answering questions often requiring access to specific factual knowledge about time, which can be effectively aided by retrieval, and the Step-Back abstraction likely helps pinpoint relevant information. StrategyQA, on the other hand, requires more complex multi-step logical deductions, where errors can stem from various points in the reasoning chain [6], potentially limiting the direct impact of improving retrieval alone, even with the Step-Back abstraction. The larger number of examples in the TimeQA test set (5226) compared to the StrategyQA development set (229) [7] might also play a role in the observed percentages, although the core difference likely lies in the complexity and type of reasoning required by the respective tasks.\n\nThe error analysis shows that Step-Back + RAG provides a more substantial relative improvement on the Knowledge QA dataset TimeQA compared to the Multi-hop Reasoning dataset StrategyQA, suggesting the approach is particularly effective for tasks heavily reliant on accurate knowledge retrieval where the Step-Back abstraction can simplify the search."}

On datasets like SST-2 and SST-5, where accuracy is the primary metric, BERT trained with the standard Cross-Entropy (CE) objective performs better or comparably to BERT trained with DL or DSC [10].\n![Accuracy scores for BERT with different training objectives on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets](image1)\nThis confirms that the proposed dice losses are not accuracy-oriented and should be applied judiciously based on the evaluation metric of the task [10].\n\nIn summary, the proposed DSC loss consistently leads to improved F1 scores for BERT and XLNet models across various F1-oriented tasks like paraphrase identification and machine reading comprehension, demonstrating particular effectiveness on imbalanced datasets, but is not suitable for accuracy-oriented tasks."}

Both models show significant improvements over DS-Span for certain slots [3]. DS-DST and DS-Picklist dramatically reduce errors for slots like `attraction-type`, `hotel-internet`, and `hotel-parking` because their values are often not directly extractable from dialog context but can be predicted from candidate lists [4].\n![A table showing slot-level accuracy for DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set, including average accuracy.](image5)\nImage 5 shows the detailed slot-level accuracy.

For time-related slots like `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by`, which can be challenging for span-based methods and DS-DST when no span matching exists, DS-Picklist can further reduce error rates because predicted values are found in candidate lists [4]. While DS-DST performs strongly by jointly handling categorical and non-categorical slots, DS-Picklist's reliance on a comprehensive ontology and treating all slots as categorical leads to a higher accuracy on many slots, contributing to its better overall joint accuracy [1, 6, image5].

This slight advantage for DS-Picklist is also visible when compared against other BERT-based methods, as shown in Table 3 (Image 3), where DS-Picklist again shows a higher joint accuracy than DS-DST and BERT-DST models [10]. The paper notes that DS-Picklist requires access to a full ontology, which might not always be available in real-world scenarios, whereas DS-DST does not have this requirement [5].\n\n![Joint accuracy on the test sets of MultiWOZ 2.1 comparing DS-DST and DS-Picklist with BERT-DST variants and ToD-BERT.](image3)\n\nExamining the slot-level accuracy provides a more detailed comparison [7].

In these cases, DS-DST and DS-Picklist generally have very similar performance, with DS-DST sometimes having a slight edge (e.g., `hotel-internet`, `hotel-parking`), and DS-Picklist having a slight edge on others (e.g., `hotel-type`, `attraction-type`) as seen in Image 1. These slots benefit from being treated as categorical because their values often have varied expressions that are difficult for span-based methods to extract [2, 3].\n\nHowever, DS-Picklist demonstrates a more significant advantage on certain slots where span-based methods (like DS-Span) struggle due to values not being directly present as spans in the dialogue context [3]. This is particularly evident for time-related slots such as `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by`, where DS-Span's performance is low. While DS-DST also improves, DS-Picklist, with access to the candidate value lists from the ontology, can correctly predict many values that DS-DST might miss [3]. Image 1 clearly shows this, with DS-Picklist significantly outperforming DS-DST on `train-arrive by` (96.59% vs 95.78%) and having a slight edge on `taxi-leave at` (98.91% vs 98.53%). Similarly, Image 5, which shows the reduction of errors for values not found by DS-Span, illustrates DS-Picklist's strong performance on `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by` compared to DS-DST in such cases.\n\n![Error reduction percentages for DS-DST and DS-Picklist compared to DS-Span for slots where DS-Span often misses ground-truth values.](image5)\n\nOther slots like `restaurant-name`, `attraction-name`, `hotel-name`, and `hotel-area` also see improvements with DS-DST and DS-Picklist over DS-Span, with Image 1 showing competitive performance between DS-DST and DS-Picklist, often with DS-Picklist holding a small lead.\n\nIn summary, while DS-Picklist shows a better overall joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.1, its advantage is more pronounced on specific slots, particularly those whose values are difficult to extract via span matching and where ontology access helps identify the correct value from a candidate list.\n\nOverall, DS-Picklist performs better than DS-DST on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, with its advantage being particularly significant for certain time-related slots like train-arrive by and taxi-leave at where it can leverage the full ontology."}

While the proposed approach shows improvement on Stop Distance compared to some baselines on CHAI, all models perform poorly on Manipulation Accuracy (MA) [5]. This indicates the significant challenge posed by manipulation in CHAI, even though simple navigation-only subsets of CHAI show better performance on SD [10]. The complexity of CHAI is also evident in its instruction structure, which often requires decomposing into multiple intermediate goals involving both movement and actions on objects [9].\n\nThe inherent ambiguity of the tasks, particularly instruction following, makes exact goal identification difficult, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance on both LANI and CHAI [2, 8]. Human performance shows a Task Completion of 63% on LANI and 100% Manipulation Accuracy on CHAI (with a Stop Distance error of 1.34) [2], although the human evaluation rating on LANI was higher than the model [4]. The gap between current model performance and human performance remains large across both tasks [2, 8].\n\nThe key difference in task completion and performance metrics lies in the nature of the tasks: LANI focuses on navigation to a single goal evaluated by Task Completion, while CHAI combines navigation with manipulation towards multiple intermediate goals, evaluated by Manipulation Accuracy, which proves to be a significantly harder challenge for current methods compared to LANI's navigation."}

Human performance on LANI shows a Stop Distance (SD) of 5.2 and Task Completion (TC) of 63%, whereas on CHAI, human SD is 1.34 and Manipulation Accuracy (MA) is 100%, indicating different inherent difficulties or task natures [5].

Access to oracle goals significantly improves navigation performance on both tasks, highlighting ambiguities the automated metrics might miss, particularly the planning complexity in CHAI [2]. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of different model components, with ablations severely impacting performance, especially on CHAI [6].\n![Table showing performance metrics for LANI and CHAI tasks across various methods, including ablations, on the validation dataset.](image3)\n\nThe linguistic categories used in instructions also differ between the two tasks. LANI instructions frequently involve spatial relations between locations (123 instances), conjunctions of two or more locations (36 instances), and constraints on the shape of the trajectory (94 instances) [3].\n![Table listing linguistic categories found in LANI and CHAI instructions with counts and examples for each.](image2)\nCHAI instructions, while also containing spatial relations (52 instances), are more focused on temporal coordination of sub-goals (68 instances) and co-reference (18 instances), reflecting the sequential nature of manipulation actions [3]. An example CHAI instruction involves a sequence of actions like picking up items and placing them [10].\n![Text describing a CHAI scenario and associated written instructions involving multiple steps like opening cupboards, putting items in, and closing.](image5)\n\nIn summary, LANI is a navigation task with instructions emphasizing spatial relationships and trajectory constraints, while CHAI is a more complex manipulation task requiring instructions with greater temporal coordination and co-reference, reflected in lower model performance, particularly on manipulation accuracy, despite the authors' approach outperforming baselines."}

However, the overall MA scores across all methods are quite low, clustering around 40% [7].\n\nInsights drawn from this comparison indicate that while the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LANI task in terms of task completion, the CHAI task, particularly manipulation, remains significantly challenging for all evaluated models [7]. Even with access to oracle goals, the model fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI, illustrating the planning complexity of this domain [1]. Human performance benchmarks show a CHAI manipulation accuracy of 100%, highlighting a substantial gap between current model capabilities and human ability for this task [10]. The limitations of the model, such as cascading errors and difficulty reasoning about instructions that include constraints on the execution, are potential reasons for the poor performance on manipulation tasks, which may involve such constraints [8].\n\nThe proposed approach demonstrates strong performance on LANI TC compared to baselines and prior methods, but all models, including the proposed one, struggle significantly with CHAI MA, indicating the inherent difficulty of manipulation tasks in this domain and a large gap to human performance."}

Specifically focusing on instructions including navigation actions only on CHAI, Our Approach gives an SD of 3.24, a 17% reduction of error compared to the STOP baseline's SD of 3.91 [2]. However, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially on manipulation (MA) [3].

The model uses an explicit separation of goal prediction and action generation [4]. While this allows for an interpretable goal representation [4], its reliance on the predicted goal means action generation is not exposed to the instruction directly, which can lead to cascading errors if the goal prediction is incorrect [4].\n![Performance metrics for various methods on the development dataset for LANI and CHAI](image4)\nAccess to oracle goals significantly improves navigation performance on both tasks, indicating the impact of goal prediction accuracy [10, Image 4]. For example, with oracle goals on the test set, OA achieves an SD of 2.13 and TC of 94.60 on LANI, and SD of 2.19 and MA of 41.07 on CHAI [Image 5]. Linguistic features like temporal coordination and co-reference significantly affect goal prediction accuracy [1].\n![Impact of linguistic categories on goal prediction distance on LANI](image1)\nFurthermore, the model is unlikely to successfully reason about instructions that include constraints on the execution itself, such as intermediate trajectory constraints [4].\n![Example instruction with trajectory constraint](image2)\nThe example instruction \"curve around big rock keeping it to your left\" illustrates such a constraint [Image 2]. While the model might reach the final goal, it may fail to follow the specified path [4]. The inherent ambiguity of the tasks themselves, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance (LANI SD 5.2, TC 63%; CHAI SD 1.34, MA 100%) [6], also contributes to the difficulty. Automated evaluation metrics may also fail to capture execution quality fully when instructions include constraints [8].\n\n\"Our Approach\" generally outperforms baselines and previous methods on LANI (SD and TC) and CHAI navigation (SD), but struggles with CHAI manipulation (MA) and instructions involving trajectory constraints due to its architectural separation and dependence on goal prediction accuracy."}

Conversely, highly dissimilar languages like HE->PT also demonstrated substantial improvements [8].\n\n![This table compares the BLEU scores of standard and pre-trained NMT systems for different source languages translating into Portuguese, indicating that pre-training improves accuracy for various language pairs with differing degrees of linguistic similarity.](image1)\n\nBeyond overall BLEU score improvements, pre-training helps in specific areas like translating low-frequency words and generating more grammatically correct sentences [1, 7].\n\n![This example shows a source sentence, a reference translation, a translation by a standard bilingual system, and a translation by a multi-lingual pre-trained and aligned system, highlighting how the pre-trained system better translates specific terms and phrases.](image2)\n\nIn multilingual translation systems that share an encoder, aligning pre-trained embeddings for different source languages into a similar vector space is also helpful for increasing BLEU scores [3, 4, 6].\n\nPre-training word embeddings generally improves NMT accuracy, with the greatest impact occurring within a 'sweet spot' of limited training data and varying degrees of improvement across different language similarity pairs."}

In bilingual scenarios, *a priori* alignment of embeddings may not be necessary [5], and results shown for various language pairs translated into English indicate that alignment can sometimes slightly decrease performance or provide only marginal gains [Image depicting the effect of aligning embeddings in bilingual NMT shows minor positive or negative changes in BLEU scores across several language pairs](). For example, in the GL→EN pair, alignment resulted in a decrease in BLEU score, while for AZ→EN and RU→EN there were slight increases [Image depicting the effect of aligning embeddings in bilingual NMT shows minor positive or negative changes in BLEU scores across several language pairs]().\n\nIn contrast, for multilingual translation systems where an encoder is shared across multiple source languages [10], aligning the word embeddings helps to increase BLEU scores for all tested language pairs [7]. This is intuitive because a shared encoder benefits from the word embeddings of different languages being in similar vector spaces [7], allowing the model to learn more effectively [7]. Results for multilingual training show that alignment provides the best performance across all evaluated low-resource languages (GL, AZ, BE) when trained on pairs of similar languages [Image showing BLEU scores for multilingual translation into English across different language pairs and training setups]().\n\nRegarding the observed differences in F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency, pre-training improves the accuracy of translation across the entire vocabulary [8]. However, the improvement is particularly noticeable for words that occur less frequently in the training corpus [8]. As frequency increases, both standard and pre-trained models perform better, but pre-training provides a greater relative benefit for lower frequency words compared to higher frequency words [Image showing F-measure vs. Frequency in Training Corpus for standard and pre-trained models](). This indicates that pre-trained embeddings are especially useful in providing better representations of less frequent concepts [4].\n\nAlignment of word embeddings is more beneficial for multilingual translation systems, while pre-training improves translation accuracy across all word frequencies, with a notable impact on low-frequency words."}

The subspace dimension analysis indicates SWEM's efficiency in leveraging parameters effectively at lower dimensions, making it a competitive and often more parameter-efficient alternative [3, 9].\n\nIn summary, SWEM models generally perform comparably or superiorly to CNNs on many NLP tasks, particularly document classification and sentence matching, are more parameter-efficient at lower dimensions, but are less effective on tasks requiring strong word-order modeling in short texts."}

Existing public datasets for this task are relatively small, which prevents these models from effectively capturing the necessary sequential patterns and features [3, 9].\n\nTo address this, knowledge transfer from document-level sentiment classification, which is less expensive to obtain, is explored using pretraining (PRET) and multi-task learning (MULT) [1, 4, 6]. These two tasks are semantically related, suggesting the potential for beneficial knowledge transfer [4].\n\nExperiments demonstrate that the inclusion of different model components during knowledge transfer affects performance. An ablation study on the pretraining approach shows that transferring knowledge through different layers is helpful [7].\n\n![Ablation test results showing accuracy and macro-F1 scores when transferring different combinations of layers from a document-level model to an aspect-level model across four datasets.](image2)\n\nAs seen in the ablation tests, transferring the LSTM and embedding layers is generally more beneficial than transferring the output layer, which is typically more task-specific [7]. Transferring the embedding layer is particularly helpful for datasets D3 and D4 [7]. This may be attributed to the highly unbalanced label distribution in these datasets (especially the small number of neutral examples shown in image1) and the fact that initial word embeddings (like GloVe) might not adequately capture sentiment information, which can be improved by transferring embeddings trained on document-level data [7].\n\nVarying the percentage of document-level training examples used for knowledge transfer also shows clear trends in performance across the datasets.\n\n![Plots showing how accuracy and macro-F1 scores change across four datasets as the percentage of document-level training examples increases from 0% to 100%.](image3)\n\nAs the percentage of document-level training examples increases from 0% to 100%, accuracy consistently improves across all datasets [5, image3]. Similarly, Macro-F1 scores generally improve with more document examples [5, image3]. For datasets D1 and D2, the improvements in Macro-F1 are stable with increasing document data, while for D3 and D4, there are sharp increases in Macro-F1, particularly when changing the percentage from 0% to 40% [5, image3]. This indicates that leveraging knowledge from document-level data, especially in greater quantities, significantly boosts performance, particularly on datasets with more challenging characteristics like label imbalance [5, 7, image1].\n\nThe inclusion of knowledge transferred from document-level data, either through pretraining or multi-task learning (or a combination), improves aspect-level sentiment classification performance, with the benefit increasing as more document-level training data is utilized."}

When evaluated specifically on the restaurant domain of MultiWOZ, TRADE again leads in joint accuracy with 65.35% [5].\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios, where the model is pre-trained on a set of domains and then fine-tuned on a new, held-out domain using limited data (1%), the TRADE model shows advantages compared to training from scratch on the new domain [7], [8]. Fine-tuning from a base model often yields better results on the new domain [6].

The performance comparison between GEM and EWC on the new domain can vary depending on the specific domain, as shown in image3.\n\nThe effectiveness of transfer learning during domain adaptation is also influenced by the similarity of slots between the source and target domains [7]. Slots that are common across multiple domains, such as 'people', 'area', 'price range', and 'day', benefit from successful knowledge transfer, making them easier for the model to track in a new domain [7].\n\n![Bar charts showing slots present in the Hotel and Restaurant domains](image2)\n\nConversely, slots that are unique to a single domain, like 'parking', 'stars', and 'internet' in the hotel domain or 'food' in the restaurant domain, are much harder for the model to track correctly when adapting to that new domain [7]. This suggests that the performance gains from fine-tuning strategies are more pronounced for common, transferable slots than for unique ones.\n\n![Heatmap showing similarity between different slots](image5)\n\nIn summary, GEM generally outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in mitigating catastrophic forgetting on original domains during domain expansion, while fine-tuning methods, including GEM and EWC, typically perform better than training from scratch on the new domain.

FastQA also improves significantly, reaching 44.5% on WIKIHOP gold chain (65.3% masked) and 54.6% on MEDHOP gold chain (51.8% masked) [1]. This suggests that a major challenge lies in selecting the relevant documents [1], [10].\n\nFurthermore, experiments where documents not containing candidate mentions were discarded showed that BiDAF's performance dropped, indicating its ability to leverage cross-document information, while FastQA showed less conclusive results or also dropped, suggesting it has problems integrating cross-document information compared to BiDAF [3].\n\nOverall, BiDAF consistently outperforms FastQA across standard, masked, and gold chain conditions on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets."}

Seq2Seq models, for example, are known to produce shorter sentences with more common words [8].\n\n![Table showing word and character counts and rare word percentages for various methods including Seq2Seq, RetNRef variants, MemNet, and Human.](image3)\n\nAs shown in the table [image3], Seq2Seq has the lowest average word count (11.7) and character count (40.5), and the lowest percentage of rare words (<100: 0.4%, <1k: 5.8%) [8]. The RetrieveNRef (RetNRef) model shows some improvement, doubling the use of rare words compared to Seq2Seq, but still not closely matching human statistics [8]. The RetNRef++ model, which more strongly utilizes the retriever [1], shows further improvement, with word and character counts and rare word percentages (2.3% <100, 10.9% <1k) much closer to human levels (3.0% <100, 11.5% <1k) [8]. This suggests that RetNRef++ generates longer, more diverse sentences, which is encouraged by attending to the retriever [4, 7].\n\nWhile automated metrics like perplexity are sometimes reported, they are considered particularly flawed for retrieve and refine models, as a valid, retrieved response different from the target may result in a poor perplexity score [5, 10]. Indeed, RetNRef++ performs poorly on perplexity, yet human judgments improve [10].\n\nHuman evaluations provide a more robust measure of conversational quality. In A/B tests where human annotators compare outputs, RetNRef++ shows statistically significant wins over the Memory Network retriever and the Seq2Seq generator [6].\n\n![Table showing A/B test win rates comparing RetNRef++ against Memory Network and Seq2Seq, RetNRef+ against Memory Network and Human, and Seq2Seq against Human.](image1)\n\nThe A/B test results [image1] show RetNRef++ winning 54.5% of comparisons against Memory Network and 53.7% against Seq2Seq [image1]. RetNRef models can effectively learn when to copy the retrieval utterance (when it is good) and when to generate instead (when it is bad) [6]. RetNRef+ also performs better than Memory Network but less well than RetNRef++ against humans [image1].\n\nHuman judgments on specific attributes also highlight the differences.\n\n![Table showing human evaluation scores for Engagingness, Fluency, Consistency, and Persona for Seq2Seq, Memory Network, RetNRef, RetNRef+, and RetNRef++.](image2)\n\nAs seen in this table [image2], RetNRef++ achieves the highest engagingness score (3.80) among all models, significantly outperforming Seq2Seq (2.70-2.76) and slightly outperforming the Memory Network (3.66) [9, image2]. It also scores well on fluency and consistency, although, like the Memory Network, it is weaker at using the persona compared to Seq2Seq [9, image2]. Example dialogues illustrate the difference in output styles [image5].\n\nOverall, RetNRef++ excels in human-like conversational abilities, producing more engaging conversations with word statistics closer to human utterances, based on human judgments and word analysis, despite performing poorly on metrics like perplexity.\n\nRetNRef++ differs from other methods by generating longer, more vocabulary-rich responses closer to human statistics and achieving higher human evaluation scores for engagingness compared to Seq2Seq and Memory Network."}

QCT revenues saw a 64% increase, largely due to demand for 5G products, a recovery from COVID-19 impacts, and higher automotive and IoT revenues [8]. QCT's equipment and services revenues specifically rose from \\$16.1 billion in 2020 to \\$26.6 billion in 2021 [10]. QTL revenues increased by 26%, mainly due to higher estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, also reflecting a COVID-19 recovery [8]. Additionally, earnings before income taxes from QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) increased due to higher net gains on investments [8].\n\nComprehensive income also increased substantially in fiscal year 2021.\n\n![Fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 comprehensive income and its components](image5)\n\nComprehensive income was \\$9.0 billion in fiscal 2021, up from \\$5.3 billion in fiscal 2020 and \\$4.3 billion in fiscal 2019. The difference between net income and comprehensive income is primarily due to components of other comprehensive income, such as foreign currency translation gains/losses and net unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments [image5].\n\nThe net income and comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 were significantly higher than in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, largely driven by strong revenue growth in both QCT and QTL segments and higher investment gains."}

Key components of this increase included Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Insurance and Other), which rose from $79.9 billion to $86.7 billion, and Income taxes, principally deferred, which increased significantly from $74.1 billion to $90.2 billion. Consolidated claim liabilities totaled approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021, with a large portion related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group [2]. While estimates for claims recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, increasing pre-tax earnings [6], the overall level of unpaid losses and other liabilities, along with a substantial rise in deferred income taxes, led to the increase in total liabilities.\n\nConcurrently, Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated shareholders' equity saw a significant increase from $451.3 billion at December 31, 2020, to $514.9 billion at December 31, 2021 [4].

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders were $89.8 billion in 2021 [4], a substantial increase from $43.3 billion in 2020 [image4]. These strong earnings, which included after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [4], flowed into retained earnings. However, Berkshire also significantly increased its treasury stock balance, reflecting substantial share repurchases, which reduced the overall increase in equity. Treasury stock at cost grew from $(32.8) billion at the end of 2020 to $(59.8) billion at the end of 2021 [image3], representing approximately $27 billion in repurchases during the year.\n\nIn summary, Berkshire Hathaway's liabilities increased primarily due to higher unpaid loss reserves and deferred income taxes, while shareholders' equity grew substantially driven by strong net earnings, partially counterbalanced by share repurchases."}

[Image 2]\n\n![Operating results showing breakdown of revenues, expenses, and earnings per share for 2018-2020](image2)\n\nBreaking down the revenue changes by market segment reveals that the International Operated Markets segment experienced the most significant declines [5]. Company-operated sales in the International Operated Markets decreased by 19%, from $6,334 million in 2019 to $5,114 million in 2020. Franchised revenues in the International Operated Markets also decreased by 14%, from $5,064 million to $4,348 million [Image 5]. This was largely a result of COVID-19 related temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [5, 6].\n\n![Detailed breakdown of revenues by company-operated and franchised, across market segments for 2018-2020](image5)\n\nWhile the U.S. market saw positive sales performance [6], total U.S. Company-operated sales still decreased slightly by 4%, and U.S. Franchised revenues decreased by 2% [Image 5]. These declines were partly influenced by significant franchisee support provided through incentives for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth, which offset positive sales performance and impacted revenue [6, 7].\n\nThese revenue declines, particularly in the International Operated Markets, contributed to a decrease in Operating income and Net income [Image 1, Image 2]. Additionally, other factors impacted net income, including higher Selling, General and Administrative expenses, higher restaurant closing costs, lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses, and an increase in reserves for bad debts related to rent and royalty deferrals [7].\n\nGAAP earnings per common share—diluted decreased by 20% from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020 [Image 1, Image 2, Image 3].

In 2020, there were net pre-tax strategic gains of $268 million, or $0.26 per share, primarily from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock [2, Image 3]. Accounting for these strategic items, Non-GAAP earnings per share—diluted decreased by 23%, from $7.84 in 2019 to $6.05 in 2020 [Image 3]. The decrease in weighted-average shares outstanding (from 764.9 million in 2019 to 750.1 million in 2020 due to share repurchases before suspension) [8, Image 2] partially mitigated the impact of lower net income on EPS.\n\nChanges in company-operated and franchised revenues across different markets, particularly significant declines in International Operated Markets due to COVID-19 and offsetting factors like U.S. franchisee support and strategic gains, resulted in a decrease in both McDonald's GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share from 2019 to 2020."}

The overall ending balance for worldwide Card Member loans rose from $73.4 billion in 2020 to $88.6 billion in 2021, while worldwide Card Member receivables increased from $43.7 billion to $53.6 billion [image5].\n\nCoinciding with the increase in balances, provisions for credit losses decreased substantially and resulted in a net benefit in 2021 [4]. This was primarily driven by a large reserve release – $2.5 billion according to one text quote [4] – and lower net write-offs [4]. The reserve release was attributed to improved portfolio quality and a better macroeconomic outlook, including improvements in unemployment rate projections [4, 7]. The ending reserve balance for Card Member loans decreased from $5.344 billion in 2020 to $3.305 billion in 2021, and for receivables from $267 million to $64 million [image5].\n\n![Worldwide network volumes and total billed business increased significantly from 2020 to 2021.](image3)\n\nThese changes occurred alongside a strong recovery in Card Member spending and activity. Worldwide network volumes increased by 24 percent, and total billed business grew by 25 percent from 2020 to 2021 [image3, image4]. Average worldwide Card Member spending also saw a significant increase of 25 percent during the same period [image3]. The growth in billed business was the primary driver of the increase in discount revenue, the company's largest revenue line [9].\n\nWhile Card Member loans increased, their growth rate (21 percent) was lower than the growth in billed business (25 percent) [4]. This was partly due to higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances, indicating customers had continued liquidity and financial strength, which also contributed to the decrease in net interest income [4, 9]. The higher paydown rates and overall improved economic outlook contributed to the improved portfolio quality and the subsequent reserve release [4, 7].\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, Card Member loans and receivables balances significantly increased, credit loss provisions decreased resulting in a net benefit due to reserve releases driven by improved outlook and portfolio quality, while network volumes and Card Member spending saw robust growth.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, Card Member loan and receivable balances increased alongside strong growth in network volumes and Card Member spending, while credit loss provisions decreased significantly due to improved economic outlook and portfolio quality."}

Text quote [4] corroborates this decline, stating net income decreased by 21% (22% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion.\n\nComprehensive income also decreased from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020.\n![Comprehensive income decreased from $6,152.2 million in 2019 to $4,626.4 million in 2020.](image4)\nThis represents a decrease of $1,525.8 million.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the decrease in net income. Operating income decreased significantly from $9,069.8 million in 2019 to $7,324.0 million in 2020 [Image2]. This decrease in operating income was a primary driver of the lower net income. Text quote [9] attributes the decrease in cash provided by operations, which is closely linked to operating earnings, to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19. Total revenues decreased from $21,364.4 million in 2019 to $19,207.8 million in 2020 [Image2]. While total operating costs and expenses also decreased, the decrease in revenues was proportionally larger, leading to a lower operating margin [3]. The company's operating margin decreased from 42.5% in 2019 to 38.1% in 2020 [3]. While strategic gains, primarily from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, impacted results in 2020 [6, 7], and strategic charges impacted 2019 [6], operating income still decreased significantly when excluding these items [6].\n\nThe change in comprehensive income includes the change in net income plus changes in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax [Image4]. Total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, shifted from a gain of $126.8 million in 2019 to a loss of ($104.1) million in 2020 [Image4]. This swing was primarily influenced by a significant change in cash flow hedges, which went from a gain of $6.1 million in 2019 to a loss of ($123.3) million in 2020 [Image4, 10], and also a reduction in foreign currency translation adjustments from a gain of $174.3 million in 2019 to a gain of $63.1 million in 2020 [Image4].\n\nIn conclusion, both net income and comprehensive income decreased significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily driven by a reduction in operating earnings due to the impact of COVID-19 on revenues and operating margin, compounded by unfavorable changes in other comprehensive income components like cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments."}

Corporate unallocated expenses, which include centrally managed initiatives and commodity derivative gains/losses [7, 8], negatively impacted total operating profit, with the deficit increasing from ($1,396) million in 2018 to ($1,442) million in 2020 [image4].\n\nExamining individual divisions:\n-   FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) saw continuous growth in both net revenue ($16,346M to $18,189M) and operating profit ($5,008M to $5,340M) from 2018 to 2020 [image4].\n-   QFNA (Quaker Foods North America) also showed growth in net revenue ($2,465M to $2,742M) and operating profit ($637M to $669M) [image4].\n-   PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) experienced growth in net revenue ($21,072M to $22,559M) but a decline in operating profit ($2,276M to $1,937M) [image4]. The loss of a major customer like Walmart could have a material adverse effect on the FLNA, QFNA, and PBNA divisions [10].\n-   LatAm (Latin America) saw a decline in both net revenue ($7,354M to $6,942M) and operating profit ($1,049M to $1,033M) [image4].\n-   Europe experienced growth in net revenue ($10,973M to $11,922M) and operating profit ($1,256M to $1,353M) [image4].\n-   AMESA (Africa, Middle East, South Asia) showed significant growth in both net revenue ($3,657M to $4,573M) and operating profit ($661M to $600M), although operating profit decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 [image4].\n-   APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand) grew in net revenue ($2,794M to $3,445M) and operating profit ($619M to $590M), with operating profit declining in 2020 compared to 2019 [image4].\n\nOperating profit in 2020 included certain pre-tax charges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. These charges were significant across divisions:\n![Breakdown of 2020 pre-tax charges by division due to COVID-19](image2)\nThe total impact was $774 million, with the largest charges in PBNA ($304M), FLNA ($229M), and LatAm ($102M) [image2]. These charges contributed to the fluctuations or declines in operating profit seen in some divisions in 2020.\n\nThe distribution between beverage and food/snack categories varies significantly by international division:\n![Percentage of net revenue from beverage and food/snack categories by international division from 2018-2020](image3)\nIn LatAm, the revenue is heavily skewed towards food/snack (around 90%) [image3]. In Europe, it's more balanced, slightly favoring beverage (around 55% beverage) [image3]. AMESA shifted from being mostly food/snack in 2018 (55%) towards a higher beverage percentage in 2020 (30% beverage, 70% food/snack) [image3]. APAC remained consistently strong in food/snack (around 75%) [image3]. PepsiCo as a whole is balanced, with approximately 45% beverage and 55% food/snack revenue [image3].\n\nWhile a direct causal link between the category split and the changes in net revenue and operating profit cannot be definitively established from the provided data alone, observing the trends in international divisions suggests potential relationships. LatAm, heavily reliant on food/snack, saw revenue and profit decline [image4, image3]. Europe, with a more balanced portfolio leaning beverage, saw consistent growth in both [image4, image3]. AMESA saw strong revenue growth and fluctuated profit as its mix shifted, while APAC saw revenue growth and fluctuating profit with a consistent food/snack focus [image4, image3]. The impact of the category distribution is intertwined with regional market dynamics and the specific effects of the pandemic mentioned in 2020 [1, 10].\n\nNet revenue generally increased across divisions from 2018 to 2020, while operating profit trends varied, influenced by factors including COVID-19 related charges and the regional mix of beverage and food/snack categories."}

This represents a favorable change of $1.58 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [9]. The improvement in 2020 was attributed to operational efficiencies [9].\n\nContributing factors impacting net income included a significant increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2020, primarily due to stock-based compensation expense [10]. Specifically, stock-based compensation expense related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award increased substantially, contributing $838 million in 2020 compared to $296 million in 2019 [10]. Overall stock-based compensation expense, as shown in the cash flow adjustments, also increased year over year from $746 million in 2018 to $898 million in 2019 and $1,734 million in 2020, reflecting adjustments for non-cash items that impact net income [image3].\n\nAnother factor influencing comprehensive income was the foreign currency translation adjustment. This adjustment, part of other comprehensive income, shifted from losses of -$42 million in 2018 and -$28 million in 2019 to a gain of $399 million in 2020 [image1]. These adjustments result from the effect of exchange rate changes on translating the financial statements of foreign operations [image1].

Net income is a primary driver of equity changes. For the year ended August 28, 2022, the Net income attributable to Costco was $5,844 million [Image 2], which increases Total Costco Stockholders' Equity via retained earnings [10]. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $71 million [Image 2], which increases the Noncontrolling Interests balance [10].\n\nComprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss) [8]. For the year ended August 28, 2022, total comprehensive income including noncontrolling interests was $5,194 million [Image 1]. This was comprised of Net income including noncontrolling interests of $5,915 million [9, Image 2] and Other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of $(721) million [Image 1].\n\nComprehensive income is then attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests [6, Image 1]. For the year ended August 28, 2022, comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $36 million [Image 1], while comprehensive income attributable to Costco was $5,158 million [Image 1]. The difference between comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($36 million) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($71 million) represents the noncontrolling interests' share of other comprehensive loss ($35 million). This is shown in the changes in equity statement as \"Foreign-currency translation adjustment and other, net\" of $(35) million impacting noncontrolling interests [Image 4]. Costco's portion of the other comprehensive loss, $(686) million, impacted Total Costco Stockholders' Equity [Image 4].\n\nBeyond comprehensive income, other transactions affected equity. Specifically, during 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $208 million to noncontrolling interests and purchased the equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner for $842 million [1, Image 4]. These transactions significantly reduced the Noncontrolling Interests balance. Total Costco Stockholders' Equity was also affected by net income, cash dividends declared, repurchases of common stock, stock-based compensation, and other items [Image 4, Text 5].\n\nCostco's total stockholders' equity increased from $17,564 million in 2021 to $20,642 million in 2022, driven primarily by net income attributable to Costco, while noncontrolling interests decreased from $514 million to $5 million, largely due to the acquisition of a joint venture partner's interest and dividends paid to noncontrolling interests."}

The increase in interest income specifically in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates [3]. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net, which result from the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts, are also components of this total [3, image5].\n\nIn summary, both SG&A expenses (in absolute dollar terms) and Interest Income and Other, Net increased from 2020 to 2022, although SG&A expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales."}

These improvements in margins and pre-tax income were driven by a continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, yield from delivery productivity improvements, and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model [8].\n\n![Table showing Global Business Services external gross profit and pre-tax income for 2019 and 2018 and year-to-year changes](image5)\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, Cloud & Cognitive Software's external gross profit increased while its pre-tax income decreased, whereas Global Business Services saw increases in both external gross profit and pre-tax income."}

This decrease was driven mainly by a $53 million decrease in transportation services revenue [9]. The decline in transportation revenue was largely due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crude and refined products, lower rates on certain contracts, increased impact from planned turnarounds and storms, and the deferral of deficiency credits in 2020 compared to their utilization in 2019 [10]. While revenues decreased, total costs and expenses increased from $288 million in 2019 to $312 million in 2020 [image3]. These factors combined led to the reduction in operating income.\n\nNext, let's examine the cash flows from investing activities.\n![Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for 2020, 2019, and 2018](image5)\nAs indicated above, Net cash used in investing activities was $(87) million in 2019, while Net cash provided by investing activities was $64 million in 2020 [image5]. This represents a substantial positive change in cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe improvement in cash from investing activities is primarily explained by changes in capital expenditures and investments. Capital expenditures decreased from $38 million in 2019 to $27 million in 2020 [image5]. Text confirms this trend, stating capital expenditures were $22 million in 2020 compared to $35 million in 2019 [3]. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to the completion of specific projects [3]. Furthermore, there were no contributions to investment in 2020 compared to $25 million in 2019 [image5, 3]. An increase in the return of investment, from $66 million in 2019 to $91 million in 2020, also contributed to the positive change [image5].\n\nShell Midstream Partners, L.P.'s operating income decreased from $215 million in 2019 to $169 million in 2020 due to decreased revenue and increased costs, while cash provided by investing activities significantly improved from a net use of $87 million in 2019 to a net provide of $64 million in 2020, primarily driven by lower capital expenditures and no contributions to investments in 2020."}

In 2019, the company recorded a total foreign tax benefit of $524 million (a current benefit of $407 million and a deferred benefit of $117 million) [Image 3]. By 2020, this had changed to a total foreign tax provision (expense) of $500 million, and it increased slightly to a total foreign tax provision of $530 million in 2021 [Image 3].\n\n![Table showing current and deferred income tax provision/benefit broken down by Federal, State, and Foreign jurisdictions for 2019, 2020, and 2021](image3)\n\nThis transition from a foreign tax benefit to a foreign tax expense, alongside the growth in foreign income, has several potential implications for the company's financial strategy. While the increased foreign income is positive for overall profitability, the shift to a significant foreign tax provision means that a larger portion of this income is now being paid as taxes. This could influence decisions regarding the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S., as repatriated income might trigger additional U.S. taxes unless strategically managed, although some foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. [7]. The company also faces complexities and potential volatility in foreign tax matters, such as seeking partial refunds of taxes in Korea [1], [10] and managing tax incentives with specific requirements like the one in Singapore [4]. Furthermore, ongoing tax examinations in numerous foreign jurisdictions introduce uncertainty and the possibility of future adjustments [5]. These factors necessitate careful tax planning and management to optimize the after-tax profitability of foreign operations and manage cash flows related to tax payments, such as the remaining payments for a one-time repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018 [3]. The need for valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets also reflects uncertainties in utilizing future tax benefits in specific foreign jurisdictions [6].\n\nForeign income before taxes increased substantially from 2019 to 2021, while the foreign tax provision shifted from a significant benefit in 2019 to a substantial expense in 2020 and 2021, impacting net foreign profitability and requiring strategic tax planning."}

As of December 31, 2020, total WFAM assets under management were $603.0 billion.

Commercial loans increased from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by higher commercial and industrial loan demand [1].

The decrease in consumer loans was primarily driven by a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale [1].\n\n![Table showing total loans broken down into commercial and consumer categories for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, including the total change]().\n\nTotal deposits increased from $1,404.4 billion to $1,482.5 billion, a 6% increase [image1] [5]. This growth was primarily seen in core deposit categories. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by 13%, interest-bearing demand deposits increased by 4%, and savings deposits increased by 9% [image1].\n\n![Table detailing deposit balances by type, percentage of total, and year-over-year change for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020]().\n\nIn contrast to the growth in demand and savings deposits, time deposits decreased significantly by 41%, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices decreased by 44% [image1]. These declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of deposit, and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices, were actions taken to manage under the asset cap [10].\n\nBased on these changes, the financial entity appears to have pursued a strategy focused on growing its commercial lending portfolio [1] while allowing its consumer mortgage portfolio to shrink due to market conditions and strategic asset sales [1]. On the funding side, the strategy involved growing lower-cost core deposits (demand and savings) while actively reducing certain types of deposits, specifically time deposits and non-U.S. deposits, likely as a measure to manage regulatory requirements related to its asset cap [10]. The decrease in the Allowance for Credit Losses for loans also suggests improved credit quality and a positive outlook on economic conditions [9].\n\nThe financial entity increased its total loans, driven by commercial loan growth, while strategically managing its deposit mix by increasing core deposits and decreasing time and non-U.S. deposits, partly to manage under an asset cap."}

Rates also performed strongly due to increased trading activity in government bonds [10]. This strong Global Markets performance more than offset the impact of lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments on GBM's adjusted revenue [1].\n\nConversely, Global Banking revenue decreased by $0.1bn or 2% [4], from $3,875m in 2019 to $3,804m in 2020. ![Table showing changes in adjusted revenue for different divisions from 2019 to 2020.](image4) This decrease reflected lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [4]. However, this decline was partly offset by growth in capital markets revenue and increased net interest income from corporate lending within Global Banking [4]. One example of activity was supporting Rolls-Royce through a capital markets drive, which involved acting as joint bookrunner and lead arranger for financing [image2].\n\nWhile the specific profit before tax for GBM is not provided, the overall group's reported profit before tax decreased by 34% to $8.8bn, and adjusted profit before tax decreased by 45% to $12.1bn in 2020 [2, 6]. This significant decline in the group's profit before tax was primarily due to a large increase in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL), which rose by $6.1bn to $8.8bn, compared with 2019 [2, 3, 6]. These higher ECL charges were a result of the expected impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic outlook, particularly in Europe, MENA, and North and Latin America [3]. The group's reported revenue also decreased by 10% [2]. Although Global Markets revenue increased strongly, this was not enough to fully offset the impacts of lower interest rates across other global businesses and the significant rise in ECL on the overall group profitability [2, 5]. The group also saw a fall in reported operating expenses, partly mitigating the profit decrease [2, 6], with adjusted operating expenses lower due to cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay [8]. Furthermore, management actions delivered significant reductions in Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs) globally in 2020 [1, 7], which helps capital efficiency but doesn't directly impact profit before tax.\n\nIn summary, while Global Markets revenue within GBM increased significantly due to market conditions, Global Banking revenue slightly decreased, and the impact of higher expected credit losses and lower interest rates negatively affected overall group profitability in 2020."}

Similarly, the discount rate for Other Retiree Benefits increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022 [image1].\n\n![Discount rate and expected return on plan assets for pension and other retiree benefits for years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020](image4)\nThe expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022, while the expected return on plan assets for Other Retiree Benefits remained constant at 8.4% from 2021 to 2022 [image4]. For defined benefit retirement plans, factors considered in developing the expected return estimate include historical returns of indices and projections from consultants, with expected long-term rates for equities and bonds ranging from 3-9% [7]. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected return reflects assets primarily comprised of Company stock with a projected return of 8.5% [7].\n\nAn increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligation [10], leading to an actuarial gain [4]. For 2022, the actuarial gain for pension plans was primarily related to increases in discount rates [4], resulting in a significant net actuarial gain recognized in the change in plan assets and benefit obligations [image3]. A decrease in the expected rate of return assumption, however, increases the periodic benefit expense [1, image2]. Despite the decrease in the pension expected return assumption, the significant increase in discount rates contributed to large actuarial gains [4, image3].\n\n![Classification of net amount recognized and amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)](image5)\nThe combined impact of these changes and other factors resulted in a decrease in the net amount recognized for Pension Benefits from a net liability of $5,428 million in 2021 to a net liability of $2,435 million in 2022. For Other Retiree Benefits, the net amount recognized changed from a net liability of $2,238 million in 2021 to a net asset of $3,819 million in 2022 [image5]. This shows a significant improvement in the recognized status of both plans, largely driven by the actuarial gains from increased discount rates [4, image3].\n\nThe discount rate for Pension Benefits increased by 2.0 percentage points, and for Other Retiree Benefits by 1.8 percentage points, while the expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits decreased by 1.0 percentage point and remained unchanged for Other Retiree Benefits, which likely led to a decrease in net liabilities recognized due to actuarial gains from higher discount rates outweighing other effects."}

This increase was primarily driven by increases in employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, service delivery costs (including increased data center capacity), and amortization of purchased intangible assets [2]. The increase in headcount across various functions, including research and development (54% increase since fiscal 2019) [7], marketing and sales (36% increase) [9], general and administrative (38% increase) [5], and professional services [4], along with costs associated with integrating recent acquisitions [4, 5, 7, 9], contributed to the rise in operating expenses [image4].\n\nThe significant revenue growth in the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category has a strong positive impact on overall financial performance by contributing substantially to total revenue growth.

This decrease was driven by lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets [3]. Specific segments saw significant declines: average Home Lending loans decreased by 16% [image1], as paydowns exceeded originations and were impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations [8]. Small Business period-end loan balances also decreased significantly (-36%) [image1], primarily impacted by a decline in PPP loans [8]. While some areas like Auto lending saw growth in both average (+6%) and period-end (+17%) balances [image1], supported by higher originations [image2], the overall trend for loans was downward due to weak demand and higher paydowns [1, 3].\n\n![Average and period-end loan balances by line of business showing overall decrease](image1)\n\nIn the commercial segment, average Total Loans decreased by 14%, dropping from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021 [image4].

Similarly, period-end Total Deposits rose by 13%, from $784,565 million to $883,674 million [image1]. This growth in deposits was driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. The increase also reflected higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending due to government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty [4], contributing to higher income from higher deposit balances [1].\n\nOverall, from 2020 to 2021, total loans decreased primarily due to weak demand and higher paydowns, while total deposits increased significantly driven by government stimulus, increased liquidity, and economic uncertainty."}

The balance of Credit Risk RWA under the Standardized approach rose from $342,684 million to $387,066 million, and under the Advanced approach from $228,927 million to $284,930 million.\n\n![Table showing Credit Risk RWA increasing from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, under both Standardized and Advanced Approaches due to changes in various components.](image2)\n\nThis increase in Credit Risk RWA was primarily driven by an increase in Derivatives exposures due to market volatility and an increase in Investment securities, notably from the E*TRADE acquisition [4]. Lending commitments within Wealth Management and Institutional Securities, along with increased Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains, also contributed to this rise [4]. For the Advanced Approach, Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) also increased due to higher Derivatives exposure and credit spread volatility [4]. An increase in RWA generally requires a corresponding increase in capital to maintain risk-based capital ratios.\n\nExternal Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) is a component of the capital structure, consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital, and eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD) [3]. The required External TLAC as a percentage of RWA was 21.5% in 2020.\n\n![Table showing External TLAC, Eligible LTD, and their ratios to RWA and leverage exposure for December 31, 2020, and 2019, including required ratios.](image5)\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA was 49.9%, and as of December 31, 2020, it was 47.7% [Image5]. While the dollar amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million [Image5], the percentage relative to RWA decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020. This indicates that although the institution maintained a substantial buffer above the required TLAC percentage, the increase in Total RWA [Image2] outpaced the increase in External TLAC.\n\nThe overall capital structure saw an increase in key components. Total Common Equity Tier 1 capital increased from $64,751 million in 2019 to $78,650 million in 2020 [Image3]. Total Tier 1 capital increased from $73,443 million to $88,079 million [Image3], and Total Capital increased from $82,708 million to $96,994 million for the Advanced Approach [Image3].\n\n![Table showing the breakdown of capital components including Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 capital for December 31, 2020, and 2019.](image3)\n\nThe increase in Credit Risk RWA put upward pressure on the total RWA [Image2], which would, in isolation, reduce risk-based capital ratios (like CET1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio, Total capital ratio). However, the financial institution's overall capital levels also increased significantly [Image3]. The change in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA showed a slight decline, indicating RWA growth was faster than TLAC growth, but still demonstrated a large buffer relative to the regulatory requirement. These changes affected the capital structure by increasing the risk base (RWA), slightly decreasing the TLAC cushion relative to that risk base, but simultaneously increasing the overall capital amounts available.\n\nThe increase in Credit Risk RWA and the slight decrease in the External TLAC percentage of RWA occurred alongside an overall increase in the financial institution's capital levels."}

For instance, the Consumer Banking segment experienced a $3.5 billion decrease in net interest income from 2019 to 2020 [8], which is confirmed in image1 and contributes substantially to the overall decline. This segment-level reporting allows the company and investors to understand how the overall changes in the interest rate environment impact different parts of the business structure, such as Consumer Banking where lower rates impacted income despite higher deposit and loan balances [8].\n\n![Table showing financial results for Consumer Banking and Total Consumer Banking in 2020 and 2019, including a $3.5 billion decrease in Net Interest Income for Consumer Banking](image1)\n\nThe major difference in changes of net interest income was a $5.5 billion decrease from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to lower rates, contrasting with a net increase from 2018 to 2019, and these changes are reflected in the performance aggregated and reported across Bank of America's business segments."}

Pre-tax net investment income decreased by 5.0% from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021.\n![Net investment income declined from 2020 to 2021.](image2)\nThis decrease was primarily driven by a significant decline in interest and other investment income, which fell by 44.4% in 2021 compared to 2020 [6]. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income also decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 [10]. These declines were largely attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities due to low interest rates that prevailed through 2021 [6], [10].\n\nThe asset composition of the insurance businesses changed notably between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021.\n![Asset composition shifted with significant increases in cash and equity securities.](image1)\nCash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased substantially from $67,082 million at the end of 2020 to $90,688 million at the end of 2021. Equity securities also saw a significant increase, from $269,498 million to $334,907 million. Conversely, Fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million to $16,386 million during the same period.\n\nThe implication of these changes includes the impact of interest rates on investment income. Holding substantial balances of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, coupled with low prevailing interest rates, resulted in significantly lower interest income in 2021 compared to 2020 [6], negatively affecting investment earnings [10]. Despite the lower yield, the company maintained ample liquidity, emphasizing safety over yield with respect to short-term investments [6]. The increase in equity securities holding also means that unrealized gains and losses from market price changes can significantly increase the volatility of reported earnings [9], although the direct impact on *investment income* (as shown in image2) is primarily from interest and dividends, not unrealized market value changes.\n\nNet investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to lower interest income from increased holdings of low-yielding cash and short-term securities and decreased holdings of fixed maturity securities, while equity security holdings increased significantly."}

The upstream segment, which is the most significant factor affecting the company's results [3], experienced a substantial loss in 2020 before a strong recovery in 2021.\n\n![A table showing Chevron's earnings by operating area for 2021, 2020, and 2019, detailing upstream and downstream performance in the United States and internationally, as well as total net income.](image1)\n\nIn 2019, the Total Upstream segment reported earnings of \\$2.576 billion. This declined sharply in 2020, resulting in a significant loss of \\$2.433 billion, particularly driven by losses in both U.S. and International Upstream operations (U.S. -\\$1.608 billion, International -\\$825 million) [image1]. This downturn in 2020 coincided with a significant drop in crude oil and natural gas prices [image5].\n\n![A graph showing the quarterly average prices for Brent crude oil, WTI crude oil, and Henry Hub natural gas from 2019 to 2021, indicating a sharp price decline in early 2020 followed by a recovery through 2021.](image5)\n\nHowever, 2021 saw a dramatic reversal, with Total Upstream earnings surging to \\$15.818 billion [image1]. This remarkable increase was primarily due to higher realizations for both U.S. and International Upstream, supported by the recovery in commodity prices seen in image5, as well as the absence of impairments and write-offs that impacted 2020 [5, 6].\n\nThe downstream segment's performance was less volatile but also saw changes. Total Downstream earnings were \\$2.481 billion in 2019, fell slightly to \\$47 million in 2020 [image1], and then rebounded to \\$2.914 billion in 2021 [image1]. The decrease in International downstream earnings in 2020 was largely due to lower refined product margins and higher operating expenses [2], while the increase in U.S. downstream earnings in 2021 was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales and higher earnings from joint ventures [9].\n\nThese segment performances directly affected Chevron's Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation. In 2019, the company reported a net income of \\$2.924 billion. This plummeted to a net loss of \\$5.543 billion in 2020, largely driven by the severe downturn in the upstream business [image1, image2]. The strong recovery in the upstream segment in 2021 propelled the company to a significant net income of \\$15.625 billion [image1, image2], aligning with the principle that upstream profitability largely dictates overall results [3].\n\n![A table showing Chevron's Net Income, Earnings Per Share, Dividends, Sales, and Return on metrics for 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image2)\n\nOverall, Chevron's upstream operations experienced a significant decline and loss in 2020 due to lower commodity prices, which drove the company to an overall net loss, followed by a substantial recovery in 2021 as prices rebounded, leading to a strong net income."}

The company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased significantly from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020.\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million at the end of 2019 to $1,829 million at the end of 2020.](image3)\n\nAs shown in the summary, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the period were $1,423 million as of December 31, 2019, and increased to $1,829 million as of December 31, 2020 [image3]. These represent tax positions taken by the company that may be challenged by tax authorities [3]. The company also recognized increased interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions, totaling $52 million in 2020 compared to $19 million in 2019 [3]. The company believes it is reasonably possible that this liability could decrease by $39 million in the next twelve months due to settlements and statute expirations [10].\n\nNext, let's examine the common share repurchases during the same period. The company engages in share repurchases as authorized by its Board of Directors [5]. A summary provides the details for 2020 and 2019 [4].\n\n![A table shows common share repurchases decreased from 22 million shares at an aggregate cost of $5,500 million in 2019 to 14 million shares at a cost of $4,250 million in 2020.](image1)\n\nThe company repurchased fewer shares in 2020 than in 2019. In 2020, 14 million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $4,250 million, compared to 22 million shares repurchased at an aggregate cost of $5,500 million in 2019 [image1]. As of December 31, 2020, the company had authorization remaining to purchase up to 58 million additional shares [2, image1]. The objectives of this program include optimizing the capital structure and improving returns to shareholders [5].\n\nThe increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits between 2019 and 2020 represents a potential future liability or uncertainty for the company, which could impact its effective tax rate if challenged [3, image3]. The decrease in common share repurchases between 2019 and 2020 indicates the company spent less cash on this activity in the latter year [image1], which reduces the cash balance and equity on the balance sheet, though to a lesser extent than in 2019. Share repurchases, while lower than the prior year, still used substantial cash ($4.25 billion in 2020) and are intended to optimize the capital structure and improve shareholder returns [5].\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased, representing a potential future liability, while the level of common share repurchases decreased, reducing cash used for this purpose but continuing to impact equity and aiming to optimize capital structure and returns."}

Consolidated sales and revenues rose by $2.563 billion, or 23%, reaching $13.798 billion in Q4 2021 from $11.235 billion in Q4 2020 [10].

Specifically, dealers decreased inventories significantly more in Q4 2020 (about $1.1 billion) compared to Q4 2021 (a decrease of about $100 million), meaning more product flowed through dealers to end-users in Q4 2021 compared to the previous year's quarter [9].

Manufacturing costs had a significant negative impact on operating profit, as did SG&A & R&D expenses [image4]. Higher SG&A expenses were partly due to increased headcount and investments, including higher short-term incentive compensation [6, 3]. The Financial Products segment also contributed positively to the increase in operating profit [7], with segment profit increasing by $53 million, or 27%, mainly due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower provision for credit losses [3].\n\n![Table showing segment profit (loss) comparison for Q4 2021 vs Q4 2020, including Consolidated Operating Profit and Financial Products Segment profit](image2)\n\nIn summary, total sales and revenues and consolidated operating profit increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset in the case of operating profit by higher costs.\n\nSales volume and operating profit increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, driven primarily by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, with operating profit also impacted by higher manufacturing and operating costs."}

Amortization of intangible assets added back USD 3,974 million. [1] The tax on the total adjustments amounted to USD 516 million [1]. The large negative adjustment in Acquisition or divestment items in 2021 was primarily due to the gain on the divestment of the investment in Roche [1].\n\nIn 2020, the adjustments increased IFRS Income before taxes from USD 9,878 million to USD 15,561 million. The sum of adjustments before tax was USD 5,683 million. The largest components were positive adjustments from Amortization of intangible assets (USD 3,789 million) and Impairments (USD 1,335 million). Acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items was a relatively small positive adjustment of USD 140 million. The tax on the total adjustments for continuing operations amounted to USD 596 million [3].\n\nThe \"Other items\" adjustment column, which includes items like restructuring charges, legal-related items, adjustments to provisions, and gains/losses from divestments of products/financial assets [2, 4, 6, 7, 8], also contributed to the difference between IFRS and core results, but their magnitude was generally smaller compared to Amortization, Impairments, and the large 2021 Acquisition/Divestment adjustment.\n\nComparing the years, the most significant difference in adjustments relates to \"Acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items,\" which caused a large negative adjustment in 2021 (primarily due to the Roche divestment gain being removed for core results) compared to a minor positive adjustment in 2020. Amortization of intangible assets was also a consistently significant positive adjustment in both years.\n\nThe most significant adjustments affecting net income and basic EPS were the large negative adjustment in 2021 related to the acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items (primarily the Roche divestment gain) and, in both years, the positive adjustments for amortization of intangible assets."}

Dealers decreased inventories by about $2.9 billion in 2020, compared to a smaller decrease of about $100 million in 2021 [8, 10].\n\n![Table detailing Caterpillar's sales and revenues by segment for 2020 and 2021, showing how sales volume, price realization, and currency changes contributed to the change in sales.](image3)\n\nSales were higher across all regions and the three primary segments: Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy & Transportation [6]. The Construction Industries segment showed the most significant improvement, with sales increasing by $5.188 billion, or 31 percent, primarily due to higher sales volume ($4.063 billion contribution) and favorable price realization ($732 million contribution) [4, image3]. Resource Industries sales increased by $2.057 billion (26%), while Energy & Transportation sales increased by $2.817 billion (16%) [image1].\n\nSales volume and favorable price realization were major contributors to Caterpillar's $9.223 billion revenue increase in 2021, with the Construction Industries segment showing the most significant improvement in dollar amount and percentage change."}

Net income for Consumer Banking fell by $6.5 billion to $6.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [8]. This decline was primarily attributed to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and increased expenses [8]. The revenue decrease was driven by lower net interest income, due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances, and lower noninterest income, affected by reduced service charges and lower card income [8]. Additionally, specific lending activities within Consumer Banking saw production declines; for example, first mortgage loan originations decreased [7] and home equity production also decreased [4].\n\nFor the Global Wealth & Investment Management segment, which consists of Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank [2], total revenue saw a decrease.\n\n![Table showing GWIM total revenue decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020](image2)\n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, for GWIM decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020, a decrease of $954 million [image2]. Specifically, Bank of America Private Bank revenue decreased four percent primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates [5], and MLGWM revenue also decreased [image2]. While noninterest income primarily from investment and brokerage services income increased due to higher market valuations and positive AUM flows, this was largely offset by declines in AUM pricing and lower other income, contributing to the overall decrease in revenue [3]. The provided information does not include specific net income figures for the GWIM segment.\n\nIn summary, Consumer Banking saw a substantial decrease in both revenue components and net income, while GWIM experienced a decrease in total revenue, with no specific net income figures provided in the quotes."}

Incremental COVID-19 expenses related to employee costs, personal protective equipment, and restaurant modifications also impacted operating income and margins in both segments [5], [6].

This $232 million increase in accumulated depreciation contributed to a decrease in the net value of solar energy systems from $6,138 million to $5,979 million over the period [2]. Solar energy systems pending interconnection are depreciated once placed in service, and systems under construction are depreciated upon completion and placement in service [1]. Costs on leased solar energy systems are recorded as solar energy systems under construction until installed [10]. The cost of solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements also contributes to this asset class and accumulates depreciation [6].\n\nFor property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), the total gross cost increased from $14,130 million at the end of 2019 to $17,864 million at the end of 2020.\n![Table showing property, plant, and equipment assets and accumulated depreciation for December 31, 2020 and 2019.](image1)\nAccumulated depreciation for PP&E increased significantly from $3,734 million at the end of 2019 to $5,117 million at the end of 2020 [Image 1]. This increase of $1,383 million in accumulated depreciation reduced the overall net increase in PP&E value from the gross increase of $3,734 million ($17,864 - $14,130). Consequently, the net value of PP&E increased from $10,396 million in 2019 to $12,747 million in 2020 [Image 1]. Depreciation expense on PP&E was $1.57 billion in 2020, higher than $1.37 billion in 2019 [5].

This standardized approach supports rapid expansion. The company also maintains a nimble and opportunistic approach to expansion, ready to accelerate plans if opportunities arise or defer entry if conditions are not favourable [3]. They specifically focus on securing quality retail sites in locations with high pedestrian traffic, typically in AA, A, or B grade shopping centres and malls [9].\n\nThe evolution of this strategy from 2016 to 2020 is clearly demonstrated in the significant expansion of their international footprint.\n![Table showing Lovisa's store count by country from 2016 to 2020, indicating significant growth in key international markets.](image5)\nAs shown, the total store count grew from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, driven largely by international growth [image5].

Despite this shift in financing and changes in investing activities, the net change in cash was a positive $5,361 million in 2020, compared to a decrease of $3,290 million in 2019 [Image 3].\n![A table showing cash flow from financing activities shifted from a source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a use of $9,721 million in 2020.](image3)\nMeanwhile, total equity decreased by $258 million, mainly due to dividends paid and foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net income [7].\n\nOverall, the financial changes, including the increase in noncurrent assets, the managed decrease in total debt despite a slight rise in long-term debt, the significant shift in financing cash flow reflecting strategic capital management, and the decrease in equity, resulted in a positive net cash position for IBM in 2020, indicating a strengthening liquidity position."}

Total credit card purchase volumes declined from $277.852 billion in 2019 to $251.599 billion in 2020. ![Total credit card purchase volumes decreased from $277.852 billion in 2019 to $251.599 billion in 2020, while debit card purchase volumes increased.](image2) This decline was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19, with spending on categories like travel and entertainment remaining lower compared to 2019, although overall spending improved in the latter half of 2020 [6]. Debit card purchase volumes, conversely, increased during the same period [6], ![Total credit card purchase volumes decreased from $277.852 billion in 2019 to $251.599 billion in 2020, while debit card purchase volumes increased.](image2). Outstanding balances in the credit card portfolio decreased by $18.9 billion in 2020, falling to $78.7 billion [4]. This was attributed to lower retail spending and higher payments [4]. Despite lower volumes and balances, the total risk-adjusted margin for credit cards increased [6], ![Total credit card purchase volumes decreased from $277.852 billion in 2019 to $251.599 billion in 2020, while debit card purchase volumes increased.](image2), driven by factors including lower net credit losses [6]. Net charge-offs decreased significantly, as did loans 30 days or more past due, primarily due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19 [4]. Card income also decreased due to lower client activity [7].\n\nFor Home Equity:\nHome equity production decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 [5], driven primarily by a decline in applications [5]. Similarly, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020 [9], ![Home equity balances for Consumer Banking and total decreased from 2019 to 2020.](image4). This decrease in outstanding balances was primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines [9].\n\nThese changes suggest that in 2020, consumers reduced reliance on credit cards for purchases, shifting towards debit cards, possibly due to economic uncertainty, reduced opportunities for discretionary spending (like travel/entertainment), and direct use of stimulus funds. Simultaneously, consumers appeared to prioritize paying down existing credit card debt, leading to lower balances and improved credit quality metrics (fewer charge-offs and past-due loans), facilitated by stimulus and payment deferrals. For home equity, the decrease in production and outstanding balances suggests consumers were less inclined to take out new home equity loans or draw on existing lines, potentially favoring debt reduction over leveraging home equity during a period of economic uncertainty.\n\nOverall, the changes in credit card and home equity metrics between 2019 and 2020 indicate a shift in consumer behavior towards reduced discretionary spending on credit, increased use of available funds (debit), prioritizing debt reduction, and aHesitation to take on new home equity debt amidst the economic impacts and stimulus responses related to COVID-19."}

The company's performance in specific commodities like coal and nickel is directly influenced by these price fluctuations.\n\nFor coal, lower market prices significantly contributed to a decrease in Underlying EBITDA. [2]. The average realised prices for metallurgical and hard coking coal specifically decreased in FY2021 compared to FY2020, as shown in the financial data for the Coal segment.\n\n![Financial and production data for Coal, including average realised prices, showing a decrease in coal prices in FY2021](image2)\n\nThis impact from lower prices amounted to US\\$0.7 billion [2]. Beyond price, lower volumes and increased controllable cash costs, such as higher maintenance expenses and increased stripping volumes, further reduced coal's Underlying EBITDA [2]. The unit cost per tonne for Queensland Coal increased in FY2021 [image5]. Uncertainty regarding coal import restrictions into China is also mentioned as a factor influencing future guidance [6].\n\nConversely, the Nickel West segment saw an increase in Underlying EBITDA, largely due to higher nickel prices and increased volumes [1]. The average realised nickel sales price was higher in FY2021 [10]. Key drivers identified for the strong nickel price included positive investor sentiment, a robust rebound in end-use demand across various regions, supply disruptions, and a decrease in London Metal Exchange stocks [10]. However, unfavourable exchange rate movements and increased costs for third-party concentrate, which were adversely affected by the stronger nickel price, partially offset these gains [1].\n\nThe sensitivity of BHP's results to commodity price changes is quantified. For example, a US\\$1/t increase in metallurgical coal price is estimated to impact Underlying EBITDA by US\\$35, while a US\\$1/lb increase in nickel price impacts it by US\\$1.\n\n![Estimated impact on profit and EBITDA from a US$1 change in various commodity prices](image1)\n\nOther factors influencing the impact of commodity prices include foreign currency exchange rates [8].\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices directly affect BHP's financial results, with lower coal prices contributing to decreased earnings in that segment, while higher nickel prices boosted earnings in the Nickel West segment, driven by factors like demand, supply, and sentiment."}

The company issued MCPS Series A in 2019 [5] and MCPS Series B in 2020 [2].\n\n![Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity show changes in preferred stock, common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020](image1)\n\nImage1 shows that the preferred stock balance increased from $0 at the beginning of 2019 to $1,600 million by the end of 2019 due to issuances, and further increased by $1,668 million from issuances in 2020, resulting in a balance of $3,268 million by the end of 2020.

Conversely, cash flows from financing activities also show payments of dividends ($615 million in 2020, $527 million in 2019, and $433 million in 2018), which reduced retained earnings, another component of equity [Image1].

The operating income saw a significant increase from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021 [Image 3].

This change was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, partially offset by increases related to theme park operations [2].\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities increased from $24,737 million in 2020 to $29,146 million in 2021, driven primarily by improved operating income, lower income tax payments, and higher cash distributions from equity method investments, partially offset by negative changes in operating assets and liabilities."}

U.S. income before tax increased by $15.37 billion, primarily due to higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [4]. International upstream reported earnings improved significantly due to higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments, write-offs, and severance charges [6]. U.S. downstream earnings increased due to higher margins on refined product sales, higher earnings from equity affiliates, and higher sales volumes [8]. U.S. upstream earnings also saw a large increase driven by higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments, higher sales volumes, and higher asset sales gains [9].\n\nBeyond net income, the change in comprehensive income was also influenced by changes in other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI shifted from a loss of $622 million in 2020 to a gain of $1,723 million in 2021 [image4].

These performance goals are intrinsically linked to sophisticated battery control models that manage charging, discharging, temperature, and balancing to optimize battery health and performance over time. These control units are considered core electrification technologies [![Core electrification technologies including power control units](image4)()].\n\nThe evolution of battery control models contributes to making fuller use of battery capacity while ensuring safety, security, and extending service life for Toyota's next-generation BEVs."}

Interest income decreased, mainly due to a decline in the interest yield on average Card Member loans driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [4]. Net interest income also declined in 2021, which was primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by these higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances [6]. The decrease in net interest income was also primarily due to a decline in interest income driven by lower revolving Card Member loan balances, partially offset by lower cost of funds [1]. The higher paydown rates reduced the average loan balances [1, 6] and the interest earned on those balances, thus impacting the overall yield.\n\nThe net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.1% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021, primarily due to higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances."}

This positive price impact was partially offset by higher price-linked costs, primarily increased royalties driven by these higher realised prices [4, Image 5].

Similarly, Petroleum's Underlying EBITDA benefited from a US$0.3 billion increase from price impacts, net of price-linked costs [8].\n\nIn contrast, the change in volumes negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$312 million [Image 5]. While some operations like WAIO achieved record volumes and Olympic Dam had its highest annual production, these gains were more than offset by expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence, natural field decline in Petroleum, and adverse weather events [6].

Optum revenues, specifically, grew 21% in 2020 [1].

This represents a total decrease of 72 basis points from 2020 to 2022.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this change. The gross margin percentage decreased across all segments [1]. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the gross margin percentage was 10.94% in 2022, a decrease of 19 basis points compared to 2021 [5].\n\nKey factors impacting the gross margin percentage included:\n*   A primary negative impact came from a decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly in fresh foods and foods and sundries, accounting for a 33 basis-point decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 [5]. This decrease in core merchandise categories gross margin percentage was observed across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods [6].\n*   A LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs negatively impacted gross margin by 19 basis points in 2022 [5], and also negatively impacted the U.S. segment [1].\n*   Increased 2% rewards negatively impacted gross margin by one basis point [5], and specifically impacted the Other International segment [1].\n*   Higher gasoline prices significantly impacted net sales [7], and while the gasoline business enhances traffic, it generally has a lower gross margin percentage, meaning a higher penetration of gasoline sales tends to lower the overall gross margin percentage [2]. However, warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points in 2022 [5].\n*   Investments in merchandise pricing, such as holding prices steady despite cost increases or reducing prices to drive sales, negatively impacted gross margin and gross margin percentage [3]. Inflation higher than in recent years impacted merchandise costs [3].\n*   Conversely, the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19 positively impacted all segments' gross margin [1], contributing five basis points positively to the overall gross margin in 2022, partially offset by a one-time charge [5].\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022 due primarily to decreases in core merchandise categories, a LIFO charge, increased rewards, and the mix effect of higher gasoline sales, partially offset by benefits from ceasing COVID-19 related wage increases and contributions from warehouse ancillary businesses."}

These activities more than offset the net income added to retained earnings, leading to a decrease in this component of equity.\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), another component of shareholders' equity [1], increased the loss (became more negative), moving from $(2,895)$ million in 2020 to $(2,945)$ million in 2021 [Image 4].\n![Comprehensive Income statement showing Net Income and Other Comprehensive (loss) income components.]()\nThis increase in the AOCI loss is reflected in the Other comprehensive (loss) income statement, which showed a loss of $(50)$ million in 2021 [Image 2]. This loss included negative foreign currency translation adjustments of $(163)$ million and net unrealized debt securities losses of $(42)$ million, partially offset by net unrealized pension benefits gains [Image 2]. Foreign currency translation adjustments arise from translating monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates and non-monetary items at historic rates [1].\n\nThe combined effect of the decrease in retained earnings (primarily due to share repurchases and dividends exceeding net income) and the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss resulted in a decrease in the company's total shareholders' equity, weakening its equity position from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThe company's financial position was impacted by a decrease in total shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021, driven by a decrease in retained earnings due to significant share repurchases and dividends, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss from factors like foreign currency translation adjustments."}

While cash flow from operating activities does not directly alter the equity balance itself in the same way as profit or dividends, it is intrinsically linked. Profitability, which increases retained earnings and total equity, is a primary driver of operating cash flow. Positive operating cash flow indicates the company's ability to generate cash from its core business, essential for funding operations, investments (like capital expenditure on new stores [10]), and financing activities (like paying dividends), all of which support the business's sustainability and capacity for future profit generation and equity growth. Despite the impact of COVID-19 during the final quarter of FY20 on operating cash flows [10], the company generated significant cash from operations over the two-year period.\n\nIn summary, total equity increased from $45,242k at July 2, 2018, to $58,368k at June 28, 2020, influenced directly by changes in retained earnings resulting from profits and dividend payments, and supported by strong operating cash flows which reflect the underlying health of the business."}

These acts transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state and spurred a \"great tide of emigration for the west and especially Nebraska,\" leading to thousands acquiring land under the Homestead Act by 1900 [9].\n\n![Table showing Hamilton County population from 1870 to 2000](image3)\n\nFollowing the peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population began a slow decline [5], decreasing to 13,330 by 1900 and continuing to fall to 9,403 by 2000 [Image 3]. A significant factor in this decline was the transformation of the agricultural landscape due to mechanization [4]. As farming became more mechanized, the scale of operations increased, leading to farm consolidation; the number of individual farms declined dramatically while the average acreage per farm increased significantly throughout the 20th century [4]. This shift had \"significant impacts on rural life\" [4], contributing to a reduced need for labor and potentially leading to out-migration from rural areas. The county's towns, outside of Aurora which saw recent gains, generally struggled to maintain population after peaking earlier in the 20th century [2, 3].\n\nHamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000 show a rapid initial increase driven by settlement policies like the Homestead Act, followed by a decline and leveling off largely influenced by changes in agricultural practices."}

This large increase suggests that pre-trained embeddings are particularly effective in bootstrapping models for languages that are just reaching the point of producing reasonable translations [1]. The improvement is evident in the BLEU scores when comparing a standard baseline ('std std') to models with pre-trained source ('pre std') or both source and target ('pre pre') embeddings.\n\n![Table showing BLEU scores for different language pairs with standard and pre-trained source and target embeddings, demonstrating significant gains especially for low-resource languages like GL->EN, AZ->EN, and BE->EN when source embeddings are pre-trained.](image4)\n\nThis effect is not limited to translation to English. Pre-training also leads to significant BLEU score increases for translation pairs targeting Portuguese (PT). For example, pairs like R U → P T and H E → P T, which have very low baseline BLEU scores, see larger accuracy gains (up to +8.9 BLEU points for HE->PT) compared to languages more similar to Portuguese like F R → P T and I T → P T [9].\n\n![Table showing BLEU scores for different language pairs translating to Portuguese, comparing standard and pre-trained models, indicating significant improvements, particularly for pairs with lower baseline scores.](image3)\n\nThe trend observed across different language pairs is that the gain from pre-training is highest when the baseline system is poor but not excessively poor [4]. This implies that a certain level of basic language modeling is necessary before pre-training becomes highly effective [4].\n\nFurther analysis reveals that the boost from pre-trained embeddings is largely attributable to a better encoding of the source sentence, with more significant increases seen when source language embeddings are pre-trained [6]. Pre-training also helps models capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences, which contributes to improved translation quality and higher BLEU scores [2, 8].\n\nThe impact of pre-training can also depend on the size of the training data. While pre-training helps across different training set sizes, the *magnitude* of the BLEU increase relative to the standard model might vary, sometimes peaking at intermediate data sizes before decreasing slightly as the standard model catches up with more data.\n\n![Line graphs showing BLEU scores for standard and pre-trained models across varying training set sizes for three language pairs, and a lower graph showing the absolute increase in BLEU from pre-training relative to the standard model across these sizes.](image2)\n\nIn multilingual systems, aligning word embeddings can further help increase BLEU scores, particularly for language pairs that are more similar [10].\n\nIn summary, pre-training word embeddings generally leads to an increase in BLEU scores across various language pairs, with particularly large gains observed for extremely low-resource languages or those with low baseline translation quality."}

It begins by selecting the most relevant root nodes. Then, it considers the children of these selected nodes at the next layer, again selecting the most relevant ones based on cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated sequentially down to the leaf nodes [7]. This approach allows for control over the specificity and breadth of information retrieved by adjusting the depth and the number of nodes selected at each layer, starting broadly and focusing on finer details in lower layers [9].\n\n![Diagram illustrating Tree Traversal Retrieval where a query is encoded and used to select nodes layer by layer through a tree structure to retrieve context](image2)\n\nIn contrast, the **Collapsed Tree** method offers a simpler approach by considering all nodes across all layers simultaneously [2, 3]. Instead of moving layer by layer, this method effectively flattens the multi-layered tree into a single level, bringing all nodes together for comparison against the query [3].\n\n![Diagram illustrating Collapsed Tree Retrieval where a query is encoded and used to select nodes from a flattened, collapsed tree structure to retrieve context](image2)\n\nThe collapsed tree approach is considered better due to its greater flexibility, as it searches through all nodes concurrently, allowing it to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [1]. This contrasts with Tree Traversal, where the proportion of information from different levels remains constant regardless of the query [1]. Performance tests have shown that the collapsed tree approach consistently performs better than tree traversal [1].\n\n![Line chart showing Collapsed Tree outperforming Tree Traversal in F1 score across different context lengths on the QASPER dataset](image5)\n\nThe primary difference between Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval is that Tree Traversal selects nodes layer by layer, while Collapsed Tree evaluates all nodes across all layers simultaneously."}

This process, which enhances interaction and allows the model to learn from broader context [3], appears to be particularly beneficial when there are multiple potential entities and relations within a single sentence [1, 4]. The optimal number of iterations for relation propagation was found to be two (M=2) on the relation extraction task [10], as shown in the plot of Relation F1 versus the number of iterations [image5].

These methods differ in how they structure the interaction between the language model and the retrieval component, particularly concerning query refinement, decomposition, and the dynamic control of retrieval.\n\nThe **Iterative** retrieval process involves repeating the retrieval and generation steps multiple times. As depicted, the process starts with a query, retrieves information, and then generates a response [image5]. A \"Judge\" component evaluates the result, and based on a condition (like reaching a max number of iterations or a threshold), the process can loop back to the retrieval step with potentially more context, repeating the cycle N times before producing a final response [image5]. This approach essentially provides more context iteratively to refine the output [image5].\n\n**Recursive** retrieval is characterized by breaking down complex problems or queries step-by-step [image5]. It often involves an initial retrieval, followed by generation and evaluation by a \"Judge\" [image5]. Based on this evaluation, the query might undergo transformation or decomposition, leading to subsequent retrieval steps using a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner or perform secondary retrieval within documents [1, 5, image5]. This recursive nature allows for gradual convergence on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop, particularly useful for complex or nuanced searches where user needs are unclear initially [1].\n\nThe **Adaptive** retrieval process is flexible and allows for active control of retrieval and generation [image5]. Unlike fixed retrieval pipelines, adaptive methods enable the Large Language Model (LLM) to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval [2, 3]. In this process, a \"Judge\" component decides whether to perform retrieval based on the current query and scenario, potentially retrieving on demand [2, 3, image5]. Alternatively, the model might proceed directly to generation [image5]. Query transformation/decomposition can also occur, and the \"Judge\" further decides whether to generate a special token (perhaps indicating the need for more retrieval or a specific action) or a final response [image5]. This approach transcends the fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios, enhancing efficiency and relevance [2, 3].\n\nIn summary, Iterative retrieval repeats the retrieval-generation cycle, Recursive retrieval decomposes complex queries and refines results step-by-step, and Adaptive retrieval uses a learned mechanism to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve or generate."}

In this distractor setting, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves a respectable 67.08 F1 score, suggesting that many questions can be answered even by a model without explicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities [1].\n\n![A table showing F1 scores for different models in the Distractor and Open settings, with Single-paragraph BERT achieving 67.08 F1 in the Distractor setting.](image3)\n\nHowever, the performance of models is significantly affected by the nature and inclusion of these paragraphs, particularly in more challenging scenarios. When the distribution of distractors changes, such as using adversarially selected distractors or those matching the entity type of gold paragraphs, the performance of models trained on the original distribution degrades significantly [8]. For instance, using type-matching distractors caused the original model's accuracy to drop to 40.73 F1 [2]. Similarly, using new adversarial distractors resulted in a decline from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 [4].\n\n![A table showing model performance (F1) on Original and Adversarial evaluation data, trained on Original or Adversarial data, illustrating the drop in performance when tested on different distractor types.](image2)\n\nThis indicates that the quality and type of distractors are crucial; stronger distractors make the task more difficult for single-hop models, potentially forcing the need for multi-hop reasoning [5, 7]. However, models re-trained on these new, adversarial distractors can recover much of their performance, achieving 58.42 F1 with type distractors [2] and 60.10 F1 with general adversarial distractors [4]. This suggests that while adversarial distractors are more challenging, models can adapt if exposed to them during training [8].\n\nIn the open-domain setting, where paragraphs must first be retrieved, the task becomes much more challenging for single-hop models [3, 10]. A major issue here is the failure of standard retrieval methods like TF-IDF to find the necessary gold paragraphs, especially for multi-hop questions [6, 10].\n\n![A table showing F1 scores in different open-domain retrieval settings, demonstrating a lower F1 score with 500 retrieved paragraphs compared to when gold paragraphs are included.](image5)\n\nAs shown, the F1 score is only 39.12 when using 500 retrieved paragraphs, but it increases significantly to 53.12 when the gold paragraphs are additionally provided [10]. This highlights that having the correct gold paragraphs is essential for successful question answering, and the inability of retrieval systems to find them is a major performance bottleneck in open-domain multi-hop QA [10]. Therefore, the inclusion and successful retrieval of gold paragraphs, alongside the type and quality of distractors, critically affect model performance in multi-hop question answering.\n\nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs is essential for high F1 scores in multi-hop question answering, while challenging distractors and retrieval failures significantly degrade performance."}

The visual data clearly illustrates this drop, showing the \"Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl\" line falling below the \"Question-controlled CT\" line, particularly at higher z values, and ending around 80% at z=10.\n![A line graph shows the percentage of utterances containing a question mark against the question-asking control level (z), indicating that adding repetition control reduces the question-asking rate, especially at higher z levels.](image4)\nTo counteract this, an extra setting denoted z=10 (boost) was introduced, which modifies how the `extrep bigram` feature is used, allowing the model to produce the necessary question bigrams and achieve a rate of 99.54% at z=10 [4].\n\nThe introduction of repetition control causes a significant reduction in the question-asking rate at the highest control level (z=10), lowering it from near 100% to 79.67%."}

It is specifically created to provide a comprehensive evaluation that goes beyond the capabilities tested by many existing benchmarks [4].\n\nIn terms of **breadth**, MMMU covers 30 subjects across 6 major disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering [2, 10]. These subjects are further divided into over 183 subfields [2, 10]. The questions are manually collected from common university majors, drawing from online sources, textbooks, and lecture materials [2, 3]. A key aspect of MMMU's breadth is its inclusion of 30 diverse image formats [5, 10], such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, medical images, paintings, and geometric shapes, among others [5, image1, image2]. This contrasts with prior benchmarks that often focus on daily knowledge, common sense, and a limited number of image formats [5].\n![MMMU covers 6 disciplines and 30 heterogeneous image types](image1)\n\nRegarding **depth**, MMMU collects more difficult, expert-level problems that require nuanced perception, recalling domain-specific knowledge, and performing step-by-step reasoning [4, 10]. The problems are sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks and require college-level subject knowledge [5, 10]. Unlike previous benchmarks that may only require commonsense or simple physical/temporal reasoning, MMMU demands deliberate reasoning using this specialized knowledge [5]. The benchmark includes challenges stemming from the requirement for expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [6]. An example of a complex question structure requiring joint understanding of text and multiple images is illustrated in the benchmark description [image1]. The distribution of question difficulty in MMMU includes a significant portion of Medium (45%) and Hard (27%) questions [image2].\n\nCompared to other benchmarks, as illustrated visually, MMMU is positioned high on both the 'Breadth (Knowledge)' and 'Depth (Reasoning)' axes, indicating its significant coverage and difficulty [image3]. The accompanying table further highlights its scale (11.5K questions), diverse image types (30 Types), and source material (Textbooks, Internet, Annotated), distinguishing it from benchmarks that might be smaller, cover fewer image types, or rely on simpler sources [image3].\n\nThe implications of MMMU's breadth and depth for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) are significant. It is designed to evaluate how well LMMs can not only perceive and understand information across different modalities but also apply reasoning with subject-specific knowledge to derive solutions [1]. By requiring models to handle a wide variety of visual inputs alongside complex text and to reason with college-level knowledge, MMMU provides a holistic assessment of their general multimodal perception and reasoning abilities that goes significantly beyond basic visual perception [4, 6, 10]. Evaluating LMMs on MMMU helps underscore the progress made while also revealing substantial room for improvement, particularly in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning requirements [8].\n\nThe MMMU benchmark compares favorably to others in terms of breadth and depth by covering a wide range of expert-level subjects and diverse image types, requiring complex reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, providing a more challenging and comprehensive evaluation for large multimodal models."}

The results demonstrate that including the source information significantly improves correlation with human judgments for the translation ranking architecture [4]. While text [1] and [4] mention the *source* input, image2 directly compares the 'ref only' version of COMET-RANK against the full COMET-RANK model (which includes both reference and source, as the architecture uses both inputs [7]).\n\n![A table showing Kendall's Tau correlations for COMET-RANK (ref. only) and COMET-RANK across various English source and English target language pairs, including the difference in scores.](image2)\n\nImage2 clearly shows the performance (measured by Kendall's Tau correlation) of the COMET-RANK model using only the reference translation compared to the full COMET-RANK model across eight language pairs.

A key component of the model is the \"Token Representation Layer\", where a bidirectional LSTM is applied over these input tokens [6]. This BiLSTM processes the input sequence (which includes character representations, GLoVe, and ELMo embeddings for each token) and produces output token representations by stacking the forward and backward LSTM hidden states [6]. These initial token representations are crucial because the model then enumerates all possible text spans in each sentence and computes a locally-contextualized vector space representation of each span [1]. The BiLSTM provides the foundational contextualization of the tokens upon which these span representations are built.\n\n![The diagram shows the model architecture, with the Sentence-level BiLSTM processing token representations derived from the input document and feeding into span enumeration.](image1)\n\nTherefore, the sentence-level BiLSTM serves to create initial context-aware vector representations for each token in the input document, which are essential for the subsequent span enumeration and representation steps in the model."}

Then, it selects a \"relation\" ($r_t$) that connects this parent entity to another entity [4], image3.\n\n![A diagram illustrating the KGLM generative process, showing the steps to select an entity to render based on mention type, parent entity, and relation.](image3)\n\nThe entity ($e_t$) that is related to the chosen parent entity ($p_t$) by the selected relation ($r_t$) is the entity that the model decides to render [4], image3. For example, as described for the phrase \"published by Nintendo\", the model selected \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity ($p_t$) and the \"Publisher\" relation ($r_t$) to identify \"Nintendo\" as the entity ($e_t$) to be rendered [4], [5]. This selection process is responsible for choosing factual entities based on relationships in the knowledge graph [4], [5].\n\n![An annotation table showing tokens, mention types, entities, relations, and parent entities for an example sentence, including \"published by Nintendo\".](image5)\n\nOnce the entity ($e_t$) is selected, the model proceeds to render it as tokens ($x_t$), potentially using terms from the entity's aliases in addition to the standard vocabulary [9].\n\nThe model decides which entity to render in the context of \"published by\" by selecting a parent entity (e.g., Super Mario Land) and the \"Publisher\" relation, which together specify the entity (e.g., Nintendo) to be rendered."}

Human evaluation is considered a gold standard for this, comparing models like Llama 2-Chat against open-source and closed-source models [6].\n\nBenchmarks such as TruthfulQA and ToxiGen are used to provide quantifiable metrics for truthfulness and toxicity [4]. For TruthfulQA, models are evaluated on metrics including the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, the percentage that are true, and the percentage that are informative [3, image5].\n\n![Table showing TruthfulQA scores (% true + info, % true, % info) for pretrained and fine-tuned models, including ChatGPT and Llama 2-Chat.](image5)\nBased on the evaluation results presented, the fine-tuned ChatGPT model demonstrates the highest truthfulness score, achieving 78.46% for generations that are both truthful and informative, and 79.92% for generations that are true [image5]. While pretrained models have lower truthfulness scores, fine-tuning significantly improves them; for instance, the Llama 2-Chat 70B model improves to 64.14% for truthful and informative generations and 67.07% for true generations [7, image5].\n\nRegarding toxicity, the evaluation uses benchmarks like ToxiGen, where a lower percentage of toxic generations is better [4]. Pretrained models can exhibit varying levels of toxicity [4, image4]. However, significant effort is placed on reducing toxicity through fine-tuning [1, 7].\n\nFine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models, across all sizes, demonstrate a substantial reduction in toxicity, achieving an effectively zero percentage of toxic generations [2, 7]. For example, the 70B Llama 2-Chat model has a toxicity score of 0.01, which is noted as the lowest among all compared models [7].\n\n![Table showing TruthfulQA and ToxiGen scores for various pretrained models including MPT, Falcon, Llama 1, and Llama 2.](image4)\nWhile pretrained models show toxicity scores above 10% (e.g., Llama 2 70B at 24.60%) [image4], the fine-tuning process effectively eliminates this issue in the Llama 2-Chat versions [7].\n\nBased on the evaluation, ChatGPT has the highest truthfulness score and the fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models have the lowest toxicity score."}

For most input pins (excluding the EA pin, XTAL2, and RST), the logical LOW input voltage (VIL) is specified from -0.5V minimum to 0.8V maximum, and the logical HIGH input voltage (VIH) is 2.0V minimum up to VCC + 0.5V maximum. The EA pin on the 8751H has a VIL1 range of 0V minimum to 0.7V maximum. For the XTAL2 and RST pins, the VIH1 range is 2.5V minimum up to VCC + 0.5V maximum. [1] Capacitive loading on Ports 0 and 2 can potentially cause noise pulses on output signals like ALE/PROG during 1-to-0 transitions, which in worst cases can exceed 0.8V [1]. The voltage on any other pin relative to VSS is specified from -0.5V to +7V [9].\n\n![Table showing input/output voltage specifications and test conditions for various 875x series microcontrollers.](image1)\n\nOutput voltage specifications also depend on the port and operating mode. For Ports 1, 2, and 3, the logical LOW output voltage (VOL) is a maximum of 0.45V when sinking 1.6mA, and the logical HIGH output voltage (VOH) is a minimum of 2.4V when sourcing -80µA. For Port 0, ALE, and PSEN on the 8751H and 8751H-8, the VOL1 is a maximum of 0.60V when sinking 2.4mA and a maximum of 0.45V when sinking 3.2mA. In external bus mode, Port 0's VOH1 is a minimum of 2.4V when sourcing -400µA.\n\nComparison with other models shows some similarities and differences. Most standard input (VIL, VIH, VIH1) and output (VOL for Ports 1-3, VOH, VOH1) voltage specifications are the same across 8751H, 8751H-8, 8751BH, and 8752BH [Image1]. However, there are differences:\n*   The VIL1 for the EA pin is 0V to 0.7V for the 8751H and 8751H-8, but 0V to 0.8V for the 8751BH and 8752BH [Image1].\n*   The 8751BH and 8752BH have a specific VIH2 requirement for the EA pin (4.5V to 5.5V), which is not listed for the 8751H [Image1].\n*   The VOL1 specification for Port 0, ALE, and PSEN on the 8751BH and 8752BH only lists the maximum of 0.45V when sinking 3.2mA, unlike the 8751H/8751H-8 which also lists 0.60V max at 2.4mA [Image1].\n*   Crucially, the maximum voltage allowed on the EA/VPP pin relative to VSS for programming is significantly higher for the 8751H (-0.5V to +21.5V) compared to the 8751BH/8752BH (-0.5V to +13.0V) [9]. This difference is related to the programming algorithm used [6].\n\nThe input and output voltage specifications for the 8751H vary by pin and state, and while many specifications are shared with related models, there are notable differences in the EA pin characteristics and the Port 0 logical LOW output specifications."}

Various types of computerized medical information systems exist to manage this, including those for \"Patient registration/ demographics, Insurance validation, Billing systems, Appointment systems, Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), EMR/EHR/CPR, Pharmacy systems\" [8], as well as \"Lab systems, Imaging systems, Tele medicine, Patient education, Decision Support\" [1].\n\nAdoption rates for several key computerized medical information systems related to patient data and clinical processes show varying trends between 2005 and 2006.\n![Adoption rates for various computerized medical information systems between 2005 and 2006](image2)\nWhile adoption of systems like Electronic Medical Records (EMR), Enterprise-Wide Clinical Information Sharing, and Clinical Data Repositories saw slight increases or remained stable, others like Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE) and Bar Coded Medication Management experienced slight decreases in adoption during this specific period. However, Digital Picture Archiving (PACS) saw a notable increase from 26% to 42% [image2].

[Image1] depicts this chain starting with a \"Data\" source, moving through \"Reporting\", then \"Analysis\", which leads to \"Action\", and finally culminates in \"Value\". Similarly, text describes pushing data through this chain from collection, analysis, decisions, action, and finally to impact, emphasizing that reaching the end is crucial [6].\n\nThe \"Levels of Analytics\" expand on the Analysis stage, detailing increasingly sophisticated ways to extract value from data [1]. [Image2] shows a progression starting from basic \"Standard Reports\" answering \"What happened?\", moving through \"Ad-hoc Reports\", \"Query Drilldown\", and \"Alerts\" which represent business intelligence focused on describing the past or current state. Higher levels, categorized under business analytics, involve \"Statistical Analysis\" (\"Why is this happening?\"), \"Forecasting\" (\"What if these trends continue?\"), \"Predictive Modelling\" (\"What will happen next?\"), and ultimately \"Optimisation\" (\"What's the best that can happen?\"). This progression increases the \"Degree of Intelligence\" and the potential \"Business Value\" derived from the data [Image2].\n\nThe distinction between earlier stages like Reporting and later stages like Analysis is key [Image3]. Reporting is often descriptive, backward-looking, and primarily raises questions by turning data into information. Analysis, on the other hand, is prescriptive, forward-looking, aims to answer questions, and transforms data and information into insights, recommendations, and storytelling [Image3].\n\nUltimately, analytics is about achieving impact [8]. This is why the \"Action\" step in the value chain is critical [Image1]. Insights generated through analysis must be translated into actions that lead to tangible business value [6]. Without action, even brilliant insights yield zero credit or impact [8].\n\nAccording to the levels of analytics and the analytics value chain, the process of transforming data into business value progresses from collecting data, through reporting and increasingly sophisticated analysis, leading to informed action, and finally resulting in measurable impact and value."}

Mendel studied the inheritance of specific traits, such as flower color [5].\n\nIn a typical monohybrid cross involving true-breeding parents with contrasting traits, such as purple flowers crossed with white flowers, Mendel observed that all plants in the F1 generation displayed only one of the traits, in this case, purple flowers [5].\n![A diagram shows a cross between purple and white flowered pea plants resulting in all purple flowered plants in the F1 generation.](image5)\n\nMendel hypothesized that parents pass \"heritable factors\" (now known as genes) to their offspring [7]. These genes exist in different forms called alleles, which are located at specific positions or gene loci on chromosomes [3, 10].\n![A diagram shows a chromosome with three different gene loci labeled with letters P, a, and B, indicating the position of alleles.](image1)\n\nDifferent combinations of alleles result in different genotypes. For a single trait like flower color, a plant can be homozygous for the dominant allele (e.g., PP), homozygous for the recessive allele (e.g., aa, like the white flower parent), or heterozygous (e.g., Bb, representing the F1 generation's genotype) [6].\n![Text shows different genotypes (PP, aa, Bb) and describes them as homozygous dominant, homozygous recessive, or heterozygous with accompanying Arabic translations.](image3)\n\nWhen the F1 generation (which is heterozygous, Pp, for the flower color gene) reproduces, the alleles for each trait segregate during gamete formation, meaning each gamete (sperm or egg) receives only one allele from the pair [image4]. When these gametes combine to form the F2 generation, the alleles assort randomly [image4].\n\nThe possible combinations of alleles in the F2 generation can be predicted using a Punnett square or similar diagram. The F1 plants (Pp) produce gametes with either the P allele or the p allele in equal proportions [image4]. Fertilization between these gametes results in F2 offspring with genotypes PP, Pp, and pp in a 1:2:1 ratio [image4].\n![A diagram illustrates a monohybrid cross showing the parental genotypes (PP and pp), gamete formation, the F1 generation genotype (Pp), gamete formation from F1, and the resulting F2 genotypes (PP, Pp, pp) and their phenotypic ratio (3 purple: 1 white).](image4)\n\nSince the purple allele (P) is dominant over the white allele (p) [implied by 5 and image5], plants with genotypes PP and Pp will have purple flowers, while only plants with the genotype pp will have white flowers [image4, image5]. This explains why the F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of approximately 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant [5, image5].\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the observed 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (PP:Pp:pp) and the resulting 3:1 phenotypic ratio (purple:white) in the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross based on the principles of segregation and dominance."}

The genetic makeup (alleles) of the parents determine the possible combinations in the offspring [image4]. Different versions of a gene, called alleles, can be found at the same position (locus) on homologous chromosomes [5]. The DNA genotype provides the molecular basis for the phenotypic traits observed [8].\n\nIn the F2 generation of this monohybrid cross, the observed phenotypic ratio is 3 purple plants to 1 white plant [10, image4].\n\n![A diagram showing the inheritance of flower color from parental generation to F1 and F2, illustrating the phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation.](image4)\n\nThe genotypic ratio in the F2 generation, corresponding to these phenotypes, is 1 PP (homozygous dominant) : 2 Pp (heterozygous) : 1 pp (homozygous recessive) [image4]. This distribution explains why the dominant trait (purple) reappears in three-quarters of the F2 offspring, while the recessive trait (white) reappears in one-quarter [10].\n\nThe phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation of the plant cross is 3:1 (dominant to recessive), and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (homozygous dominant:heterozygous:homozygous recessive)."}

This is often illustrated by simple consumption like eating. The first hot dog consumed might provide significant pleasure, but the tenth hot dog would likely provide much less utility, perhaps even negative utility or discomfort [3].\n\n![A table showing diminishing utility from consuming hot dogs.](image4)\n\nThis pattern means that focusing excessively on consuming many units of the same item can be \"bad\" from a utility perspective in a standard context [4].\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the utility derived is not solely from the intrinsic enjoyment of consuming each unit, but significantly from the outcome or achievement [7, 10]. In a hot dog eating contest, while the physical experience of eating many hot dogs might involve diminishing (and eventually negative) utility per unit, the potential utility gain from winning or reaching a competitive milestone can be enormous, dramatically altering the overall utility calculation [5, 7].\n\n![A comparison of diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome utility in hot dog consumption, highlighting a large utility gain at a competitive milestone.](image5)\n\nThis \"differential outcome\" means that reaching a specific competitive target, such as tying for the championship as shown, can yield a massive surge in utility (e.g., +5000 to +10000), overriding the declining or negative physical utility from consuming additional units [7]. Focused practice and effort towards a competitive goal build cumulative \"skill consumption capital\" and \"human production capital,\" which contribute to this outcome-driven utility [7]. Similarly, in sports, practice makes the activity more enjoyable and increases the likelihood of winning, both of which add to overall utility beyond the immediate physical enjoyment of the action itself.\n\n![A young female soccer player stretching, with text explaining that practice makes the game more fun and increases the likelihood of winning.](image3)\n\nDiminishing marginal utility in standard consumption focuses on the decreasing satisfaction per unit consumed, while in competitive contexts, utility is significantly influenced by the cumulative outcome or achievement, which can lead to large, non-diminishing (or even increasing rapidly) utility gains near the competitive goal."}

This is explicitly listed as a key goal during the Construction phase [image5]. The processes of Needs Exploration and the use of various Elicitation Methods are fundamental to achieving this goal by ensuring a thorough understanding of what stakeholders require, both initially and as needs evolve.\n\nNeeds Exploration is a vital activity aimed at understanding and defining the requirements for the solution being developed. It occurs during various phases of the project lifecycle, starting with exploring the initial scope during Inception [image5] and continuing as part of producing a potentially consumable solution during Construction [image5]. This involves activities such as defining the level of detail for requirements, potentially focusing on requirements envisioning or light specification [image3], and exploring different views like usage, domain, process, or user interface modeling [image3]. These activities facilitate requirements envisioning and modeling [1].\n\n![Needs Exploration activities are part of producing a potentially consumable solution](image2)\n\nElicitation Methods are the specific techniques employed to gather information about stakeholder needs and requirements. These methods are directly linked to addressing changing stakeholder needs [image1]. Techniques can include just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, all-hands demos, and iteration demos [image1]. The modeling strategy within scope exploration also involves elicitation techniques like informal modeling sessions and interviews [image3]. The importance of eliciting requirements, especially from stakeholders who may be geographically distributed [5, 10], underscores the necessity of effective elicitation methods.
