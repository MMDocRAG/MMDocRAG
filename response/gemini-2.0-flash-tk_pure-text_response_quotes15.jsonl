Furthermore, within STEM, perceptions diverge, with some attributing underrepresentation to a lack of belief in ability and insufficient role models within these groups, while others point to racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring and advancement [4].  Notably, those employed in STEM jobs are more inclined to cite lack of access to quality education, lack of early encouragement, and a scarcity of Black and Hispanic role models as significant factors compared to individuals in non-STEM roles [1].  Black STEM workers especially emphasize limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and lack of early encouragement as major reasons for underrepresentation [8].\n\nThe Pew Research Center identifies lack of access to quality education, lack of early encouragement, and discrimination as major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs."}

While negotiating trade agreements emerges as an area where Trump receives relatively higher confidence from the general public [3], the overall public confidence in appointments to federal courts remains mixed, with 45% expressing at least some confidence and a notable portion expressing lack of confidence [9].  Examining broader confidence levels across different governmental tasks reveals that while Republicans generally exhibit high confidence in Trump across most issues [7], public confidence as a whole is more varied.  Tasks like working effectively with Congress receive lower confidence ratings compared to economic matters [8, 10].  ![Public confidence in Trump's ability to work effectively with Congress is the lowest among various governmental tasks](image1).

A key reason many do not identify as Hispanic stems from mixed backgrounds or distant Hispanic heritage, as indicated by $27\\%$ of those with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic [10].\n\n![The image illustrates various reasons why individuals with Hispanic ancestry may not identify as Hispanic, with 'Mixed background/Hispanic ancestry too far back' being the most cited reason at 27%.](image2)\n\nInterestingly, factors often associated with Hispanic identity, such as speaking Spanish or having a Spanish last name, are not deemed essential by most Hispanics themselves [4, 6].  The vast majority of self-identified Hispanics, $84\\%$, do not believe a Spanish last name is necessary for Hispanic identity [4], and even more, $71\\%$, do not think speaking Spanish is a prerequisite [image5].\n\n![The image presents data showing that a large majority of self-identified Hispanics, especially in later generations, do not speak Spanish or have a Spanish last name.](image5)\n\nThis perspective is particularly strong among later generations, with $92\\%$ of third or higher generation Latinos stating that speaking Spanish is not a defining factor for Latino identity [6].  Concurrently, as generations progress, there's an increasing inclination towards American identity. A notable $73\\%$ of third or higher generation Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, a sentiment that grows stronger with each generation removed from immigration [7].\n\n![The image is a bar chart showing data for three groups related to generational status, indicating differences across generations but lacking specific labels to interpret the data fully.](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, self-identification among Hispanics in the U.S. is significantly influenced by generational factors, shifting away from Hispanic labels towards American identity in later generations, while traditional markers like Spanish language and surnames become less relevant for self-identification across all generations."}

This bias is visually evident when examining the class distribution of different querying methods, as some strategies disproportionately select data from certain categories while neglecting others, leading to imbalanced datasets for training. For instance, in the PathMNIST dataset, strategies like VAAL exhibit a strong preference for the muscle class, almost entirely overlooking classes like mucus and mucosa, as depicted in the bar chart of class distributions ![VAAL querying strategy demonstrates a biased selection towards the muscle class while neglecting mucus and mucosa in PathMNIST dataset](image5). This skewed selection is not unique to PathMNIST; similar patterns are observed in other datasets like OrganAMNIST, where VAAL tends to favor femur-right and platelet classes while disregarding lung, liver, and monocyte classes [6]. The consequence of such biased querying is that these active learning strategies, including Entropy, Margin, and VAAL, may struggle to outperform even random sampling, especially at the initial stages of learning, because crucial classes remain underrepresented or entirely unselected [8].\n\nLabel diversity emerges as a critical factor in mitigating these issues and enhancing the effectiveness of active querying [2, 9].  Incorporating label diversity into querying criteria generally improves the performance and robustness of most active querying strategies, including BALD, Margin, VAAL, and Uncertainty, across various datasets such as PathMNIST, OrganMNIST, and BloodMNIST, as illustrated in performance comparisons ![Label diversity enhances the AUC scores across various active querying strategies on MedMNIST datasets](image3). This improvement is particularly noticeable in low-budget scenarios where the initial dataset is small, and balanced class representation is crucial for effective learning [4, 10]. While various active querying strategies suffer from this issue to different extents, those like VAAL, Entropy and Margin, which demonstrably skew class selection, generally exhibit the worst label diversity across datasets.\n\nIn summary, **VAAL and similar biased active querying strategies generally yield the worst label diversity across the datasets.**"}

Instead of admitting uncertainty by classifying claims as NEI, GPT-4 often incorrectly categorizes NEI claims as either supported or refuted [5]. This indicates that GPT-4, despite its strong reasoning abilities [7], struggles with recognizing the absence of verifiable information and tends to force claims into a binary supported/refuted framework, even when inappropriate.  Both models, as visualized in confusion matrices, demonstrate a clear difficulty in accurately predicting the NEI class, highlighting that identifying unverifiable claims remains a key obstacle in scientific claim verification tasks [5].\n\n![Confusion matrices of InstructGPT and GPT-4 showing their performance in predicting different classes.](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the main challenge for both InstructGPT and GPT-4 is accurately identifying NEI claims, but they manifest this challenge differently: InstructGPT is under-confident and defaults to NEI, while GPT-4 is over-confident and misclassifies NEI claims as supported or refuted."}

In settings where knowledge is intentionally removed to simulate incomplete knowledge graphs, a phenomenon known as \"Conscious Incompetence\" emerges [6]. This setting enables models to identify when knowledge required for an answer is missing from the provided sources [6]. When examining the citation quality under these conditions, it's observed that removing necessary knowledge has minimal effect on the correctness of the generated text, but it significantly decreases both citation precision and recall [2].  As more knowledge is deliberately omitted from the knowledge graph, precision and recall experience a drastic decline. This highlights a considerable challenge related to coverage when aiming to generate answers with high-quality citations [2].\n\n![The graph illustrates that as more knowledge elements are removed, precision and F1-Score increase, while recall remains stable.](image3)\n\nInterestingly, recall remains relatively stable regardless of the extent of knowledge removed, suggesting that current language models possess a limited ability to recognize missing knowledge [5].  Conversely, precision and the F1-Score show a clear upward trend as more knowledge is absent from the knowledge graph. This indicates that the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting becomes increasingly important in enabling generated outputs to more accurately pinpoint absent knowledge when the knowledge graph's coverage is limited [5].\n\nHowever, when retrieval accuracy is considered, a different perspective emerges. Experiments simulating varying retrieval accuracies, from perfect retrieval to only 20% accuracy, demonstrate a clear downward trend in all metrics, including precision and recall, as retrieval accuracy diminishes [10]. Notably, the impact of poor retrieval quality is much more pronounced on recall compared to precision, suggesting that models can filter out incorrect knowledge to some degree, thus mitigating the impact on precision [10].\n\n![This graph shows that as retrieval accuracy decreases, precision, recall, and F1-Score all exhibit a downward trend.](image5)\n\nThe reduction in recall is almost linear with decreasing retrieval accuracy, which is logical because knowledge that is not provided cannot be cited [10].  This emphasizes the crucial role of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts [3]. While \"Conscious Incompetence\" helps in identifying absent knowledge and can improve precision and F1-score in scenarios with knowledge removal, the overall citation quality, especially recall, is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the retrieved knowledge.\n\nIn summary, while 'Conscious Incompetence' allows models to identify and somewhat compensate for missing knowledge by improving precision and F1-score when knowledge is deliberately removed, the ability to handle absent knowledge effectively is ultimately constrained by retrieval accuracy, which significantly impacts recall and overall citation quality."}

This improvement is observed across different strategies, including using all logical constraints, retrieved logical constraints, and post-processing approaches, which generally lead to better performance compared to scenarios without these constraints, as shown in the evaluation metrics for models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets ![Comparison of model performance with logical constraints](image3).  The performance boost from logical constraints is particularly noticeable when combined with demonstrations, suggesting that providing LLMs with both examples (\"What\") and logical rules (\"How\") is beneficial [7].\n\nMoreover, the number of demonstration samples also plays a crucial role. Initially, increasing the number of demonstrations from one to five leads to a clear performance improvement; however, further increases beyond this point yield diminishing returns [7]. This trend is visualized in performance graphs where Micro-F1 scores improve with the initial increase in demonstration samples but then plateau despite further increases ![Performance change with number of demonstrations](image4).  Even with fewer demonstrations, incorporating logical constraints can outperform scenarios with more demonstrations but lacking explicit logical guidance [7]. For instance, models like Llama2-13B and Vicuna-13B, when pre-trained with logical constraints, exhibit substantial performance gains, sometimes surpassing larger LLMs, particularly on tasks requiring logical reasoning [9]. This is further highlighted in case studies where pre-training with logical constraints corrects errors made by models without such pre-training, leading to more logically consistent and accurate answers ![Example of improved logical consistency after pre-training](image2).\n\nIn summary, both logical constraints and demonstration samples are crucial factors influencing the performance of models on datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank; integrating logical constraints provides a more robust and effective method for enhancing the logical consistency and accuracy of LLMs, often proving more impactful than simply increasing the number of demonstration samples."}

To address this, different strategies have been explored, notably the integration of logical constraints and post-processing techniques.  Employing logical constraints within LLM instructions yields consistent enhancements in performance, especially as the quantity of demonstrations increases [2].  Notably, incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even outperform prompts using a larger number of demonstrations without these constraints, highlighting the importance of guiding LLMs on \"how\" to reason logically, not just \"what\" to reason about [2].\n\nThe table below illustrates a performance comparison across various models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, under conditions of using all logical constraints, retrieved logical constraints, and post-processing. ![This table compares model performance using logical constraints and post-processing on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets.](image1).  It is evident that retrieval-based approaches to incorporate logical constraints significantly reduce logical inconsistency and improve overall performance in both tasks [8]. While post-processing can guarantee the absence of logical conflicts achieving 0% Logical Inconsistency (LI), it may compromise the quality of the generated content due to potential semantic drift from the ground truth caused by random selection during the process [8]. In contrast, pre-training LLMs with logical constraints also leads to substantial performance improvements, especially when compared to models without such constraints, as shown in the performance boost of LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B after pre-training on LLM-LR [9].\n\nConsider the results from pre-trained models Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. ![This table displays the performance of pre-trained models Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT with logical constraints and post-processing.](image3).  The data reveals that while post-processing consistently achieves the lowest Logical Inconsistency (LI) at 0%, the highest Micro-F1 scores are generally attained when using logical constraints, particularly with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This suggests that logical constraints not only aid in reducing inconsistencies but also enhance the model's ability to perform the extraction task effectively.  Further supporting the effectiveness of logical constraints, evaluations across different models, including RoBERTa-Large, Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2, on MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank, and ProofWriter tasks, demonstrate a consistent pattern. ![This table evaluates various models on MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank, and ProofWriter tasks, highlighting the impact of logical constraints.](image4). Across these evaluations, the integration of logical constraints generally leads to a reduction in logical inconsistency and an improvement in Micro-F1 scores, compared to vanilla In-Context Learning (ICL) or ICL with CoT methods alone.\n\nIn summary, while post-processing is effective in eliminating logical inconsistencies entirely, it may come at the cost of generation quality. Logical constraints, on the other hand, effectively reduce logical inconsistencies while often enhancing the overall performance of LLMs on tasks like event relation extraction, making them a beneficial strategy for improving the logical coherence and accuracy of LLM outputs."}

This pre-processing is crucial because, in object detection tasks, objects are often smaller and variably positioned compared to image classification where objects are typically central and large [8]. Instead of image-to-image retrieval, the system uses CLIP's image-text interaction for image-to-text retrieval to identify the top-k categories relevant to the cropped image regions [6].

This indicates that while CHAI excels in manipulation, LANI faces challenges in navigation and task completion.\n\nDespite human imperfections setting a realistic benchmark [5], models still struggle to match human-level performance in both tasks [5].  Comparing different approaches, it's observed that for LANI, improvements in task completion are achievable, whereas CHAI poses significant difficulties, especially in manipulation [7]. Even with oracle goals, navigation improves significantly for both, but CHAI still struggles with manipulation, highlighting its planning complexity [2]. The complexity of CHAI is further underscored by ablation studies, which show that removing components of the model leads to ineffective behavior, particularly in CHAI [6].\n\nFurthermore, linguistic analysis is applied to LANI instructions, focusing on goal prediction error [3]. This suggests a deeper dive into understanding the language aspect in LANI compared to CHAI, where the emphasis seems to be more on the manipulation and planning complexities.\n\nIn summary, LANI and CHAI differ significantly in task performance; LANI struggles more with navigation aspects reflected in task completion metrics, while CHAI's primary challenge lies in manipulation, despite achieving high manipulation accuracy in human demonstrations, and linguistic analysis is more focused on goal prediction in LANI."}

In bilingual scenarios, aligning embeddings beforehand might not be strictly necessary, as NMT systems can learn reasonable projections during training [2, 5]. However, in multilingual systems, where a shared encoder handles multiple languages, aligning embeddings becomes more beneficial. This pre-alignment ensures that word embeddings from different source languages reside in similar vector spaces, aiding the model's learning process as if it were trained on a single language [7].\n\nDespite these potential advantages, empirical results reveal that the effectiveness of embedding alignment is not uniform across all language pairs.

For example, on ACE04, it achieves a notable 7.1% relative improvement in NER and a remarkable 25.8% relative improvement in relation extraction [4].  Furthermore, DYGIE advances the state of the art on the SciERC dataset, improving relation extraction by 5.9% and NER by 1.9%, underscoring the power of coreference and relation propagation in creating detailed contextualized representations [8].  Coreference propagation is particularly effective for entity extraction and often reaches its peak performance around the second iteration [3, 5]. While generally beneficial, coreference propagation appears to be more impactful for entity tasks and can sometimes negatively affect relation extraction, as observed in datasets like ACE05; conversely, relation propagation consistently enhances both entity and relation extraction across various domains, especially in scenarios with multiple relations between entities [6].  In conclusion, DyGIE exhibits superior performance across different datasets, with coreference and relation propagation significantly contributing to its enhanced entity and relation extraction capabilities, although their specific impact can vary depending on the dataset."}

Impressively, DyGIE surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, showing substantial improvements of $11.6\\%$ and $11.3\\%$ on ACE04-O and ACE05-O, respectively [2]. While it also advances performance on GENIA, the gain is more modest at $1.5\\%$ [2].  When examining the impact of coreference propagation (CorefProp), it's observed that its effect is dataset-dependent. On ACE05, CorefProp primarily aids in entity extraction, but surprisingly, it seems to hinder relation extraction [9]. In contrast, on the SciERC dataset, CorefProp yields a more limited benefit for entity F1 [7]. This reduced impact on SciERC might be explained by the dataset's characteristic of uniformly assigning a 'Generic' label to pronouns, diminishing the utility of coreference propagation for entity extraction [6]. Conversely, relation propagation (RelProp) consistently proves beneficial for both entity and relation extraction in both ACE05 and SciERC datasets [9].  Notably, sentences rich in entities benefit significantly from relation propagation, suggesting its strength in leveraging broader context [3]. DyGIE, as a comprehensive information extraction framework, achieves state-of-the-art results in both entity recognition and relation extraction across diverse domains, highlighting the power of its dynamic span graph approach and task interaction mechanisms [8].  In summary, DyGIE's performance in entity and relation extraction fluctuates across datasets, with CorefProp's influence varying and sometimes being detrimental, while RelProp generally enhances performance, particularly in complex sentences."}

Specifically, in datasets like ACE05, coreference plays a crucial role in disambiguating entity classes, especially for pronouns where context from previous sentences is essential [10]. For instance, identifying whether \"them\" or \"ours\" refers to a person or organization in sentences like “One of  $[\\mathbf{them}]_{\\mathrm{PER}}$ , from a very close friend of [ours] ORG .” often requires cross-sentence reasoning [10]. The effectiveness of coreference propagation is evident in the $6.6\\%$ improvement DyGIE achieves in pronoun performance on ACE05, confirming its importance in such contexts [10]. However, the impact of coreference annotations can vary depending on the dataset characteristics. In datasets like SciERC, where pronouns are uniformly labeled with \"Generic\", coreference propagation does not significantly affect entity extraction performance [9]. This suggests that the informativeness of coreference annotations within a dataset directly influences the extent to which models like DyGIE can benefit from coreference propagation in entity recognition tasks. In datasets like ACE2004 and ACE2005, coreference propagation is integrated into the models for overlapping entity extraction, even in the absence of relation annotations, highlighting its broader utility beyond pronoun disambiguation [7]. Ultimately, the presence and quality of coreference annotations in datasets significantly influence the performance of the DyGIE model in entity recognition, with datasets requiring contextual reasoning for entity disambiguation benefiting most from coreference mechanisms."}

CorefProp is observed to be more impactful on entity extraction, addressing confusions particularly related to pronouns [4, 6]. While relation propagation substantially enhances both entity and relation extraction, it particularly shines in sentences with a higher number of entities, leveraging broader context to improve relation identification [3, 5].  As shown in the relation score graph, relation propagation leads to more significant improvements in sentences containing more entities ![Relation propagation shows more improvement in sentences with more entities for relation extraction](image3).

For instance, SWEM-max achieved a competitive test accuracy of 83.8% on SNLI with only 120K parameters [1].  This performance is detailed in comparisons across several models on tasks like SNLI, MultiNLI, and WikiQA, where SWEM's different pooling strategies are benchmarked against CNN and LSTM approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in these tasks ![This table compares the performance of CNN, LSTM, and SWEM variants on sentence matching tasks like SNLI and WikiQA.](image2).\n\nWhen considering document classification tasks, SWEM again demonstrates notable capabilities.  In topic prediction, SWEM models, especially SWEM-concat, have outperformed both LSTM and CNN architectures, even surpassing a 29-layer deep CNN in topic prediction accuracy [7].  This strength in document categorization contrasts slightly with sentence classification tasks, where SWEM's performance on sentiment analysis datasets is less impressive compared to CNN/LSTM, though it remains comparable in tasks like question classification and subjectivity detection [10].  Across various text classification benchmarks, the performance of SWEM models, including aver, max, and concat pooling, is juxtaposed with CNN and LSTM, highlighting their relative strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific task ![This table presents a performance comparison of various models, including SWEM variants, CNN, and LSTM, on different text classification datasets such as MR and SST.](image3).\n\nThe efficiency of SWEM becomes particularly apparent when examining subspace dimensions.  In scenarios with limited trainable parameters, SWEM exhibits higher accuracy than CNN across a range of low subspace dimensions, suggesting it is more parameter-efficient in achieving a good solution [3].  As illustrated in the comparison of SWEM and CNN across varying subspace dimensions, SWEM maintains competitive accuracy, and as the subspace dimension increases, both models' accuracies improve, approaching their direct implementation performances ![These graphs compare the accuracy of SWEM and CNN models over different subspace dimensions, showing the performance trend as dimensionality changes.](image1).  This parameter efficiency and competitive performance across a spectrum of NLP tasks highlight SWEM as a surprisingly effective and computationally lighter alternative to more complex models like CNN in many natural language understanding scenarios.

As shown, different component configurations influence the model's accuracy and Macro-F1 score across datasets. Notably, models excluding LSTM or embeddings show varied performance, highlighting their importance.

The advantage of TRADE over models like SpanPtr stems from its ability to handle semantic variations beyond simple index-based copying, addressing scenarios where user utterances express slot values using synonyms rather than exact ontology terms [10].  In contrast, models like MDBT, GLAD, and GCE, which rely on predefined domain ontologies for binary classification, face limitations that hinder their tracking performance [10, 4].\n\nFurthermore, TRADE exhibits strong domain adaptation capabilities [7].

For instance, fine-tuning TRADE on just 1% of new domain data can outperform training from scratch using the same amount of data [7]. Different fine-tuning strategies impact the model's ability to retain knowledge from the original domains while adapting to the new one [6]. GEM fine-tuning emerges as a superior strategy in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, which is the tendency of models to lose performance on previously learned tasks when learning new ones [6, 9].  For example, when fine-tuning with GEM, the joint accuracy on the original domains experiences a smaller drop compared to naive fine-tuning, which significantly deteriorates the tracking ability [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the TRADE model outperforms other dialogue state tracking models on the MultiWOZ dataset and its restaurant subset, and it excels in domain adaptation scenarios, especially when employing GEM for fine-tuning, which effectively balances learning new domains and preserving performance on existing ones."}

Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) are two techniques employed to mitigate this issue [10]. GEM, as described, retains a small set of samples from the original domains and constrains gradient updates to prevent performance degradation on these samples while learning the new domain [8]. This approach helps GEM outperform naive fine-tuning, which lacks such constraints and can lead to significant drops in performance on previously learned domains [1, 5, 6, 9]. For instance, in domain expansion experiments, GEM consistently outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning, demonstrating better retention of knowledge from pre-trained domains [6, 9].\n\n![Table comparing fine-tuning methods](image3)\n\nThe effectiveness of GEM is highlighted when compared to naive fine-tuning, where GEM achieves a joint accuracy of $34.73\\%$ on a new domain like 'attraction', while naive fine-tuning only reaches $29.39\\%$ [1].

This is further supported by the heatmap showing cosine similarity between slot embeddings, where similar slots tend to have higher cosine similarity, suggesting shared learned representations [Image5 conclusion pending]. Conversely, slots unique to a specific domain, such as 'parking', 'stars', 'internet' (hotel), and 'food' (restaurant), are harder to track in a zero-shot setting [7], indicating that slot similarity significantly influences the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and, consequently, model performance in new domains.\n\n![Heatmap of cosine similarity between slots](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, GEM represents a more effective fine-tuning strategy than naive fine-tuning and EWC for adapting models to new domains by mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and the similarity between slots across domains significantly impacts the success of knowledge transfer and overall model performance in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios."}

For example, translations involving roles traditionally associated with a specific gender tend to be more accurate than those challenging these norms.  This bias arises because machine translation models can sometimes default to stereotypical gender assignments, even when the context suggests otherwise [9]. Consider the example where translating \"The doctor asked the nurse...\" into Spanish can mistakenly assign male gender to \"doctor\" due to stereotype, despite context clues indicating a female doctor.\n\nHowever, adjustments based on stereotypes can influence translation outcomes.

This decline highlights that models trained on standard datasets may not robustly handle scenarios with strong, misleading contextual information.

However, the pass-through strategy's sensitivity is context-dependent; it is more sensitive in open vocabulary models where each character combination is treated uniquely, but less sensitive in closed vocabulary models where out-of-vocabulary words are uniformly processed [4, 8]. Examining the word error rates, the background backoff strategy often yields lower WER, as shown in evaluations where it reconstructs words more accurately than other methods [9]. This is further supported by performance comparisons across different error types, where the background variant of ScRNN shows lower error scores [image5]. Despite a tendency for lower WER with background models, it's important to note that a lower error rate does not always guarantee greater robustness, as sensitivity plays a crucial role [7, 10]. The interplay between WER and sensitivity reveals that while minimizing word errors is important, reducing sensitivity is often more critical for enhancing robustness against attacks [10].\n\nIn summary, closed vocabulary models generally have lower and more constrained sensitivity compared to open vocabulary models, and while background backoff tends to reduce WER, neutral backoff often provides the lowest sensitivity, influencing the overall robustness of the models."}

Further adjustments, categorized as 'other items', alongside amortization, also played a role in shaping the core operating income in 2020.\n\nMoving into 2021, the trend of positive adjustments continued. For gross profit, amortization of intangible assets contributed an adjustment of USD 3,419 million, and other items added USD 344 million, collectively bridging the gap from an IFRS gross profit of USD 32,218 million to a core gross profit of USD 35,981 million ![In 2021, adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and other items increased gross profit from IFRS to core results](image3).  Similarly, for operating income in 2021, amortization of intangible assets accounted for an adjustment of USD 3,528 million, and other items contributed USD 381 million.  These, along with other factors such as impairments and acquisition/divestment adjustments, resulted in an increase from an IFRS operating income of USD 10,688 million to a core operating income of USD 15,215 million [3]. These adjustments, including those for restructuring and rationalization, are detailed across various financial statement lines, such as cost of goods sold and research and development expenses [2, 4].\n\nIn both 2020 and 2021, adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and other items positively increased both the gross profit and the operating income when moving from IFRS to core results."}

This increase in profit year-over-year naturally contributes to the growth in retained earnings.\n\nFurthermore, considering the 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year', we see an increase from RMB 5,268 million in 2019 to RMB 8,100 million in 2020 [image5]. This significant rise is not solely due to the profit for the year.  A key factor is the 'Fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income', which dramatically increased from RMB 1,031 million in 2019 to RMB 5,219 million in 2020 [image5].  This indicates a substantial positive revaluation of certain financial assets held by the company, boosting the total comprehensive income.  Overall revenue growth also played a role, with total revenues increasing from RMB 25,434 million in 2019 to RMB 29,153 million in 2020 [image2], supported by increases in both online music services and social entertainment revenues [10, 4].\n\nIn summary, both 'Retained Earnings' and 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' increased from 2019 to 2020, primarily driven by increased profitability and a significant positive change in the fair value of financial assets.\n\nThe values of 'Retained Earnings' and 'Total Comprehensive Income for the Year' both increased from 2019 to 2020, largely due to increased profit and positive fair value changes in financial assets."}

The Upstream segment is primarily involved in crude oil and natural gas exploration, production, and transportation, while the Downstream segment focuses on refining, marketing, and transporting petroleum products, along with manufacturing petrochemicals and renewable fuels [1, 6].  Revenues in the Upstream sector are mainly from selling crude oil and natural gas, whereas Downstream revenues come from refining and marketing petroleum products [6].  The profitability of the Upstream segment is significantly influenced by crude oil prices, which are determined by global markets [7].

This increase in unearned revenue suggests a strong pipeline of future revenue, as it represents billings for services yet to be provided [9].  Approximately 50 percent of the total revenue recognized in fiscal year 2020 originated from the unearned revenue balance carried over from January 31, 2019 [1], highlighting the significance of unearned revenue as a source of future earnings.  The comparability between fiscal years was impacted by business combinations and acquisitions, notably the Tableau acquisition in August 2019, which was the largest to date [10]. This acquisition and other business combinations also contributed to unearned revenue from business combinations, which is reflected in the change of unearned revenue [3].

Operating activities became a more substantial source of cash, with net cash provided increasing by $3,426 million [4].  This was reflected in an overall increase of $3.4 billion in cash provided by operating activities, reaching $18.2 billion in 2020 [6]. This improvement was largely attributed to a surge in cash from receivables, which contributed $4.8 billion [6].  This increase in receivables included gains from sales of financing receivables amounting to $3.076 billion [10]. Furthermore, the company benefited from approximately $600 million in payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions related to COVID-19 relief programs [10].  These positive inflows were partially counteracted by performance-related declines within net income and an increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million [10].\n\nInvesting activities also played a crucial role, showing a decrease in net cash used by $23,908 million [5].  Specifically, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $23.9 billion compared to the previous year, amounting to $3.0 billion in 2020 [9]. This significant decrease was primarily due to a substantial reduction in cash used for acquisitions, by $32.3 billion, as the prior year included the acquisition of Red Hat [9].  This reduction in acquisition expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $6.2 billion in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, mainly due to the OEM IT commercial financing operations being wound down [9].  Moreover, there was an increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments by $896 million [1].\n\nHowever, financing activities presented a contrasting picture, shifting from a net source of cash in 2019 to a net use of cash in 2020.  In 2020, financing activities resulted in a net use of cash of $9,721 million, compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019 [8]. This year-over-year change of $18,763 million indicates a considerable shift in how financing impacted IBM's cash position [8].\n\nIn summary, IBM's net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to 2019 was influenced by improved cash generation from operating and investing activities, largely due to increased receivables and decreased acquisition spending, while financing activities became a net cash outflow, contributing to a complex overall cash flow dynamic."}

This growth is further detailed by segment contributions, where the Cable Communications segment played a role in increasing revenue by $1,450 million, and NBCUniversal segments significantly boosted revenue by $6,788 million, alongside a $1,285 million increase from the Sky segment, as visualized in the revenue changes from 2020 to 2021. ![Waterfall chart depicting revenue changes by segment from 2020 to 2021](image5).

NBCUniversal's expenses grew across its Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. In contrast, Cable Communications faced increased expenses in programming, technical support, and marketing, though partially offset by reductions in other areas [2].  It's also important to note that amortization expenses, particularly linked to intangible assets from acquisitions like Sky and NBCUniversal, remained significant at approximately $2.4 billion in 2021 [1].  The contributions to changes in operating costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were also segmented, providing a clearer picture of where cost fluctuations occurred [5].\n\nIn summary, the primary drivers for the change in Comcast's consolidated revenue from 2020 to 2021 were the NBCUniversal and Cable Communications segments, while operating expense changes were influenced by increases across various segments due to factors like programming costs and business expansions."}

These events in 2019 demonstrate a dynamic tax landscape requiring agile responses.\n\nThe complexities extend to specific regions, as seen in Korea where court rulings led to a partial refund claim for taxes previously withheld from licensees [1]. This resulted in noncurrent income taxes receivable and liabilities being recorded in both 2020 and 2021, each valued at \\$1.6 billion and \\$1.9 billion respectively, indicating an ongoing and substantial financial impact [1].  ![Ongoing Korean tax refund claims are a significant financial item](image1).\n\nFurthermore, tax incentives in Singapore, tied to employment and other criteria, add another layer to the foreign tax strategy [4].  The company's restructuring in 2018 led to profit decline in Singapore, potentially jeopardizing these incentives and requiring a refund of previously realized tax benefits for 2017 and 2018 if criteria are not met by March 2022 [4].\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact changes in foreign tax provision and foreign income before taxes are not explicitly detailed numerically between 2019 and 2021 within these quotes, the narrative suggests increased complexity and volatility in foreign tax management. This necessitates a financial strategy that is adaptable to changing international tax laws and regional economic performances, with a focus on managing tax risks and optimizing benefits from available incentives and legal interpretations."}

Notably, Wells Fargo divested Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) by selling it on November 1, 2021 [2, 7].  Prior to this sale, WFAM generated income through investment advisory and asset-based fees from managing various assets, including mutual funds and institutional accounts [2, 9]. The sale of WFAM contributed to an increase in other income for Wells Fargo in 2021, with a gain of $269 million specifically attributed to this transaction [6].\n\nRegarding available-for-sale (AFS) securities, the amortized cost, net of credit loss allowance, experienced an increase compared to December 31, 2020 [3]. This growth is attributed to continued purchases of AFS and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, which outweighed portfolio runoff and AFS debt security sales [3].  However, despite the increase in amortized cost, the total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt securities actually decreased from December 31, 2020, primarily due to rising interest rates [8].  Furthermore, a strategic portfolio repositioning led to the transfer of $56.0 billion of AFS debt securities to HTM debt securities in 2021 for capital management purposes [3].\n\nIn summary, between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, Wells Fargo sold WFAM, leading to its removal from assets under management, while their available-for-sale securities portfolio saw an increase in amortized cost but a decrease in unrealized gains, alongside a significant transfer to held-to-maturity securities."}

However, a significant strategic move was the sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), which is evident from the substantial decrease in WFAM assets under management in 2021, primarily due to its sale on November 1, 2021 [6, 10].  This sale is clearly depicted in the WFAM assets under management table, showing a significant outflow due to the sale ![WFAM assets under management data for 2019-2021, showing inflows, outflows, market impact and the sale of WFAM.](image5). Prior to the sale, WFAM was a contributor to Wells Fargo's fee income through investment advisory and asset-based fees, derived from managing diverse assets [10].  The strategic decision to sell WFAM suggests a shift in Wells Fargo's business focus, potentially moving away from direct asset management to streamline operations or concentrate on core banking activities.  Furthermore, the company actively manages its portfolio of available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, which are crucial for liquidity and interest rate risk management, indicating a proactive approach to managing financial risks and capital [8].  These securities are also used for yield enhancement, and the portfolio composition is adjusted based on economic conditions and company objectives [8, 9].  The net unrealized gains on these securities decreased from 2020, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, which also influences the overall financial strategy [2].  In essence, the changes in total assets and the strategic sale of WFAM, along with active management of debt securities, reflect a dynamic financial strategy at Wells Fargo, adapting to market conditions and business objectives.\n\nThe changes in total assets and the sale of WFAM in 2021 led Wells Fargo to refine its financial strategy by shifting business focus and optimizing capital management."}

This downturn was largely influenced by the global Covid-19 outbreak and the resulting economic uncertainties, which led to increased expected credit losses [4, 7].  Simultaneously, adjusted revenue saw an increase, although this was partly due to internal accounting adjustments related to own shares and funding cost allocations across different segments [1, 9].  However, when examining specific business areas, Global Banking faced a revenue decrease due to lower fee income and losses in certain sectors, despite growth in capital markets revenue [3]. Similarly, the ‘Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other’ segment also saw reduced revenue, impacted by lower interest rates and decreased performance in insurance and investment products [5]. In contrast, GBM (Global Banking and Markets) managed to increase adjusted revenue, primarily driven by strong performance in Global Markets which compensated for the adverse effects of lower global interest rates [6].  Despite the revenue fluctuations across segments, adjusted operating expenses were reduced, aided by lower bank levy charges and discretionary spending, alongside investments in digital capabilities [2, 8].  In conclusion, while facing headwinds from the pandemic and interest rate environment, different banking segments showed varying impacts on their revenue and expenses, ultimately contributing to a lower adjusted profit before tax in 2020 compared to 2019."}

This overall increase was composed of differing trends within the portfolio segments. Commercial loans experienced growth, rising from December 2020, notably in the commercial and industrial sector due to heightened loan demand and increased originations [1].

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment income, interest expense, depreciation, amortization, and certain operating gains and losses [9]. Revenue increases in 2021 compared to 2020 were noted, primarily due to market recovery and the lessening impacts of COVID-19 from the previous year, as seen across segments like Comcast Spectacor and overall market conditions [1, 6]. However, expenses also increased in 2021 [3].  This rise in expenses was attributed to several factors across different segments: NBCUniversal experienced increased expenses in Media, Studios, and Theme Parks; Cable Communications saw higher programming, technical support, regulatory fees, and marketing costs; and Sky faced increased direct network costs [3]. Conversely, some expense decreases were also observed, such as in Sky’s programming costs and Corporate and Other expenses due to reduced severance charges [3, 7]. Capital expenditures, a significant factor influencing long-term profitability, were mainly concentrated in the Cable Communications segment, particularly for scalable infrastructure [2]. While overall capital expenditure was flat in 2021 due to reduced spending in Theme Parks because of COVID-19, increases were present in Cable Communications [8]. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, affected by the timing of film and television amortization, increased production spending, and the return of sporting events, further shaped the financial landscape in 2021 [5].

GBM notably increased adjusted revenue, a positive outcome driven by strong performance within Global Markets [1]. This robust performance in Global Markets was supported by heightened volatility and increased client activity, alongside wider spreads, which collectively boosted Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) performance, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit. Rates also contributed positively due to increased trading in government bonds [10].  However, within GBM, Global Banking experienced a revenue decrease, reflecting challenges in real estate and structured finance fee income, as well as losses from legacy corporate restructuring positions, although capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending did see growth [4]. Despite the revenue increase in GBM, it's important to note the broader context of the bank's overall financial results, which showed a decrease in reported profit before tax [2, 6]. This decline was attributed to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, alongside the impact of lower global interest rates across the business, even though Global Markets revenue partly offset this [2]. Management actions within GBM did deliver gross Risk Weighted Asset (RWA) reductions, contributing to a decrease in net reported RWAs for the group [1, 7].\n\nIn conclusion, while specific figures for GBM's net operating income and profit before tax change are not explicitly provided, GBM's adjusted revenue increased due to strong Global Markets performance, but the overall bank profit before tax decreased, impacted by broader economic factors and credit losses."}

Despite these variations in operational earnings, the overall net income attributable to Chevron Corporation mirrored the upstream trend, swinging from a \\$2.9 billion profit in 2019 to a \\$5.5 billion loss in 2020, and then soaring to a \\$15.6 billion profit in 2021, demonstrating a strong recovery as illustrated in the summary of financial data ![Summary of Chevron Corporation's Net Income, Per Share Amounts, Dividends, Sales and Return on Investment from 2019 to 2021](image2). The graph depicting quarterly average spot prices for WTI Crude Oil and Brent Crude Oil further contextualizes these financial shifts, showing a pronounced dip in prices during 2020 followed by a significant rebound in 2021, aligning with the periods of losses and subsequent profits for Chevron ![Quarterly average spot prices of WTI Crude Oil, Brent Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021](image5).\n\nIn conclusion, Chevron's upstream operations experienced a substantial recovery from losses in 2019 and 2020 to significant profits in 2021, driven by increased crude oil prices and improved market conditions, which heavily influenced the overall net income trend from a loss to a substantial profit over these three years."}

This improvement in operating income occurred even as net cash provided by operating activities saw a slight decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 [7, image5].  The net cash used in investing activities also decreased, which aligns with the deconsolidation of RBH and reduced capital expenditures [1, image5].

Equity saw an increase of €3,828 million, reaching a total of €16,339 million [10]. This growth was significantly propelled by the issuance of new shares in March 2021, specifically to finance the acquisition of Varian [10]. This share issuance contributed to a rise in subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million [3].  Despite this substantial increase in equity, the equity ratio actually declined from 76% to 55% [3].\n\nThis seemingly contradictory decrease in the equity ratio despite equity growth is explained by a \"significant increase in loan liabilities\" [3].  Indeed, Siemens Healthineers received substantial financial inflows from the Siemens Group, including borrowings of €10 billion and an additional €850 million, explicitly for financing the Varian acquisition [7]. These borrowings and other financing arrangements, alongside existing credit facilities, contributed to the rise in liabilities. While dividends paid to shareholders represented a cash outflow of €856 million [1] and decreased unappropriated net income [3], the overall net income for the year, combined with the capital increase, still resulted in a net positive effect on equity [3].\n\nIn conclusion, Siemens Healthineers' equity increased primarily due to capital injections related to the Varian acquisition, while its liabilities also significantly increased due to loans taken to finance this acquisition, resulting in a decreased equity ratio despite the overall growth in equity."}

The decline in revenue within the International Operated segment was a major factor in the overall decrease in restaurant margins for the company [10].  Simultaneously, the U.S. market demonstrated positive sales performance; however, this growth was counterbalanced by substantial investments in marketing and franchisee support initiatives aimed at accelerating recovery and stimulating growth, including the notable \"Thank You Meals\" program for first responders and healthcare workers [1].  These support measures, along with investments in Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\"), also influenced franchised margins in the U.S. [2]. Despite positive sales trends in the U.S., the International Operated Markets experienced negative comparable sales across most markets due to COVID-19, with the same European countries leading the decline, although Australia showed some positive results [4]. The decrease in operating income within the International Operated Markets was attributed to these sales declines, coupled with over $\\S100$ million in marketing support, increased COVID-19 related operational expenses such as employee costs, and other factors like restaurant closing costs and obsolete inventory payments [5].

McDonald's revenue model is based on sales from company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised locations, with franchised restaurants making up a significant majority of their global presence [7, 9].

U.S. sales plummeted from $3,866 million in 2018 to $2,001 million in 2020, and ROW sales decreased from $609 million to $292 million during the same timeframe. ![Neulasta® sales declined sharply in both US and ROW from 2018 to 2020](image5).  This decrease was largely due to biosimilar competition impacting both net selling price and unit demand [5], a consequence of increased competition from biosimilar versions in the United States and Europe [1].\n\nIn contrast, Otezla® presents a different scenario, primarily because it was acquired in November 2019.  While data for 2018 is unavailable, sales in 2020, after its acquisition, were substantially higher in both the U.S. ($1,790 million) and ROW ($405 million) compared to 2019 (U.S.: $139 million; ROW: $39 million). ![Otezla® sales increased significantly from 2019 to 2020 post-acquisition](image4).

Conversely, the rise in noninterest income was propelled by increased net gains from equity securities, enhanced mortgage banking income, and stronger investment advisory and other asset-based fee income [9].

For instance, if the EBIT growth falls below a certain threshold, no incentives are exercisable ![No incentives are exercisable when EBIT growth is below a threshold](image3).  However, as EBIT growth increases, the exercisable percentage rises incrementally.  One structure shows that 24% compound growth leads to 10% exercisable, scaling up to 100% exercisable at 26% compound growth ![Incentives scale from 10% to 100% exercisable as EBIT growth increases from 24% to 26%](image3).  Another similar incentive structure demonstrates that 17.5% compound growth results in 40% of incentives being awarded, reaching 100% at 25% compound growth ![Incentives scale from 40% to 100% exercisable as EBIT growth increases from 17.5% to 25%](image4).  The Board establishes these EBIT target growth hurdles applicable to performance option grants [2, 10].  Thus, higher EBIT growth leads to a greater percentage of exercisable incentives."}

Furthermore, changes in gasoline prices, while increasing net sales, generally put downward pressure on the gross margin percentage because of gasoline's inherently lower margin [2]. Even when excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, the gross margin still decreased [5].  The company's strategy to maintain competitive pricing and its \"pricing authority\" also played a role.

While overall net income increased substantially [1], net interest income actually experienced a decrease [2]. This decline was primarily attributed to the impact of lower interest rates, reduced loan balances due to soft demand, and increased prepayment and refinancing activities [2].  This is reflected in the Commercial Banking sector where net interest income decreased from $6,134 million in 2020 to $4,960 million in 2021, as shown in the income statement ![Net interest income for Commercial Banking decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021.](image1).\n\nDespite the drop in net interest income, other factors contributed to the total revenue increase, such as higher net gains from equity securities and increased fee income [1].  The decrease in net interest income was also linked to lower loan balances, driven by weak demand and the low-interest-rate environment [3, 5].  Looking at the balance sheet data for Commercial Banking, we observe a decrease in average total loans from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021.  This is further broken down, showing a decrease in Commercial and Industrial loans and Commercial real estate loans within Commercial Banking ![Total loans and specifically commercial and industrial loans within Commercial Banking decreased from 2020 to 2021.](image2).\n\nSimilarly, for the broader \"Banking\" sector, average total loans saw a slight increase from 2020 to 2021, rising to $178,587 million from $176,875 million.

We can observe that gains from pre-training are not uniform across all language pairs; for higher-resource languages, the improvement is consistent at approximately 3 BLEU points, while for very low-resource languages, the gains can be either minimal or substantial, reaching up to 11 BLEU points in some cases [1]. This suggests that pre-training is especially beneficial for bootstrapping translation models when they are on the verge of producing reasonable translations, as demonstrated with Galician to English translations [1].\n\nQualitative analysis further supports these quantitative gains, revealing that pre-training helps the model capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically sound sentences [2]. For instance, pre-training enables the successful translation of names and multi-word phrases, indicating improved representation of less frequent concepts in low-resource scenarios [2]. The table below illustrates BLEU score changes with aligned and unaligned pre-training for various language pairs.\n\n![This table shows BLEU score changes with aligned and unaligned pre-training for various language pairs, with some pairs showing negative changes with alignment while others show positive or no change.](image1)\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also related to the initial performance of the translation system; it tends to be most effective when the baseline BLEU score is in the range of 3-4 [4].  Furthermore, the increase in BLEU score seen with pre-training often follows a trend where the gain is highest when the initial system is weak but not excessively so [4].  This suggests that a moderately capable baseline system is needed for pre-training to be truly effective, but once a system can capture the basic language characteristics, pre-training can significantly enhance its performance [4].  The gains in BLEU scores are also significantly more pronounced when pre-training is applied to source language embeddings, indicating that a better encoding of the source sentence is a major contributor to the overall improvement [6].\n\n![These line graphs illustrate the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translation tasks, showing pre-training gains are more significant at smaller training set sizes and decrease as training set size increases.](image2)\n\nThe degree of similarity between languages also plays a role in the effectiveness of pre-training.  When considering multilingual translation systems, the gain from pre-training often correlates with the similarity between the language pairs [10].  For instance, language pairs with higher similarity, such as Galician/Portuguese, tend to show larger gains from pre-training, while less similar pairs, such as Belarusian/Russian, may show smaller or even negative gains [10]. As shown in the following table, language pairs with shared linguistic families tend to have different levels of BLEU score improvements from pre-training.\n\n![This table presents data related to translation datasets categorized by language family, showing varying BLEU score improvements with pre-training across different language families.](image3)\n\nPre-training enhances BLEU scores in machine translation, with the extent of improvement depending on factors like language resource availability, baseline system quality, language similarity, and the focus of pre-training on source or target embeddings."}

It is engineered to efficiently query a vast external memory for pertinent information by creating and storing multimodal embeddings for both images and text descriptions [8, 1]. To ensure rapid and precise retrieval, an index system utilizing the HNSW algorithm is implemented, optimizing retrieval speed [7, 8]. As depicted in ![The diagram shows the Multimodal Retriever and Retrieving & Ranking components of the RAR pipeline.](image3), this retriever comprises an image encoder to extract image features, a feature index for efficient retrieval, and memory ($\\mathcal{M}$) to store embeddings, employing k-NN for retrieval [image3]. This component effectively tackles the challenge of managing a large volume of embeddings for quick access [8].\n\nSecond, the **retrieving and ranking** component harnesses the power of MLLMs to refine the retrieved information and make accurate predictions [6, 1]. Following the retrieval of top-k category labels, these labels, along with the image embedding, are integrated and fed into the MLLMs using a ranking prompt [4].  MLLMs then combine their pre-existing knowledge with the retrieved information to produce the final prediction [4]. This ranking step is pivotal for enhancing classification accuracy, as exemplified in ![The image shows an example of ranking prompt for few-shot image classification.](image4), where retrieved car categories are ranked to identify the correct car model.\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline for multimodal retrieval consists of a multimodal retriever for efficient information access and a retrieving and ranking component with MLLMs for refined prediction."}

Conversely, on easier samples, found in the right areas of the figure with higher confidence scores, LLM reranking can impede performance, resulting in a decrease, especially for the very easiest samples on the rightmost side [9]. This observation is consistent with findings that LLMs are more proficient in handling challenging samples compared to Small Language Models (SLMs), but underperform on easier samples relative to SLMs [9]. The experimental setup involves using SLMs as filters and LLMs as rerankers, where LLMs are applied to rerank the top predictions from SLMs, particularly for samples deemed hard [1]. This adaptive filter-then-rerank paradigm effectively leverages the strengths of both SLMs and LLMs, improving overall performance by focusing LLM capabilities on difficult instances [2, 7].

Interestingly, simply applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to infer logic doesn't significantly aid Event Relation Extraction (ERE) tasks, possibly due to inherent limitations in LLMs for generating precise rationales, leading to logical inconsistencies [1]. However, when generative methods encourage LLMs to incorporate logical constraints during reasoning, substantial performance improvements are observed across tasks [1].  The averaged micro-F1 score serves as a key metric for evaluating performance, alongside logical inconsistency [2]. Datasets like MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank, and Proof Writer are used for evaluation [3]. Initial analysis using Vanilla ChatGPT reveals poor performance on complex reasoning tasks, exhibiting low micro-F1 scores and high inconsistency [4]. Retrieval-based methods, which incorporate logic constraints into LLM instructions, effectively reduce logical inconsistency and enhance overall performance [5, 6]. Pre-training models on datasets like LLM-LR leads to considerable performance gains, especially when compared to baselines lacking logical constraints [9].\n\nFrom the experiments, it's evident that incorporating relevant logic significantly improves model performance [10].

The implications of MMMU are significant as it highlights the areas where current LMMs, even advanced models, still have substantial room for improvement, particularly in handling complex visual inputs and reasoning with subject-matter expertise [8].\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark surpasses other benchmarks in both breadth and depth by covering a wide array of college-level subjects and demanding expert-level reasoning, making it a valuable tool for thoroughly evaluating the capabilities of large multimodal models."}

This stage ensures that the reasoning process is faithful and transparent, as it relies on established algorithms within the symbolic solver, such as those used for deductive reasoning problems formulated in Logical Programming (LP) or constraint satisfaction problems [1, 5].

Initially, when all nodes are fully connected without relation types, the improvement over a model with no R-GCN is only marginal, suggesting a simple GCN isn't sufficient for this task [5].  However, the R-GCN component significantly enhances the model's capability to perform above simpler models, even without accessing extensive context, by updating representations based on inter-mention relations [3].\n\nRemoving the R-GCN component, particularly when using GloVe embeddings, leads to a considerable decrease in performance.

Object detection datasets often contain images where objects of interest are small and variably positioned, unlike image classification tasks where objects are typically large and centrally located [4]. To tackle this, a pre-processing methodology is employed, which involves cropping image regions based on proposal bounding boxes and subsequently resizing these cropped regions to a fixed proportion, as illustrated in the diagram of object recognition system ![The diagram illustrates how pre-processing techniques like cropping and resizing assist in zero-shot recognition for object detection tasks using multimodal retrieval methods.](image2).  Furthermore, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects. This blurring strategically directs the Multimodal Large Language Models’ (MLLMs) attention toward the relevant objects, effectively filtering out background noise and facilitating accurate object identification [4]. This focus is essential because MLLMs, while possessing broad knowledge, benefit from guided attention to discern objects within specific regions of interest in detection tasks [1, 6]. The pre-processing stage, therefore, is instrumental in refining the input for the zero-shot recognition system by emphasizing the objects and minimizing distractions, thereby improving the accuracy of object recognition in complex visual environments. In essence, pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring are designed to make object detection tasks more manageable for MLLMs in zero-shot scenarios."}

Reporting is descriptive and backward-looking, focused on answering 'what' questions, and transforming data into information, often presented through reports and dashboards [4].  The next critical step is \"Analysis\", which goes beyond just reporting. Analysis seeks to understand 'why' things are happening, taking a forward-looking orientation and converting data and information into actionable insights [4].  These insights then drive \"Action\", where informed decisions are made and implemented, leading to \"Value\", demonstrating the tangible benefits derived from the data-driven process ![The flowchart illustrates a data-driven process that transforms data into value, starting from Data, then Reporting, Analysis, Action, and finally Value.](image1).  Therefore, the Analytics Value Chain systematically converts raw data into value through a series of steps involving collection, reporting, analysis, and action."}

He discovered that parents pass heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [7]. These genes exist at specific locations called gene loci on chromosomes [10, 3].  Within these loci, different versions of a gene, called alleles, can exist, some of which may be dominant over others [image1]. ![Alleles are different versions of a gene, some being dominant](image1). For instance, Mendel crossed purple-flowered pea plants with white-flowered pea plants.  In the parental generation (P), these plants were homozygous, meaning they had identical alleles for flower color. The purple plants could be represented as PP (homozygous dominant) and white plants as pp (homozygous recessive) [image3]. ![Different genotypes: homozygous dominant, homozygous recessive and heterozygous](image3). When these were crossed, the first filial generation ($\\mathsf{F_{1}}$) offspring all had purple flowers, even though they were heterozygous (Pp), inheriting one allele for purple and one for white [5, image4]. ![Illustration of a genetic cross in plants, showing P, F1 and F2 generations](image4). This happened because the purple flower allele is dominant, masking the recessive white flower allele [5].\n\nHowever, when Mendel allowed the $\\mathsf{F_{1}}$ generation to self-pollinate, the recessive trait reappeared in the second filial generation ($\\mathsf{F_{2}}$).  In the $\\mathsf{F_{2}}$ generation, he observed a phenotypic ratio of approximately 3 purple-flowered plants to 1 white-flowered plant [5, image5]. ![Mendelian inheritance pattern showing 3:1 phenotypic ratio in F2 generation](image5). This 3:1 phenotypic ratio arises from a genotypic ratio of 1 homozygous dominant (PP), 2 heterozygous (Pp), and 1 homozygous recessive (pp) [image4].  Mendelian inheritance explains these ratios through the principles of segregation and independent assortment of alleles, resulting in the predictable reappearance of traits and specific phenotypic and genotypic proportions in the $\\mathsf{F_{2}}$ generation."}

Within Pro mode, users can manually select a focus mode to match their subject; for stationary subjects, AF-S (single) mode is suitable, while AF-C (continuous) is better for moving subjects [1]. Alternatively, MF (manual focus) allows you to precisely focus by touching the desired area on the screen, such as a face, offering tailored focus control for specific subjects ![The table describes different camera focus modes and their usage scenarios](image1).\n\nMetering modes can also be adjusted in Pro mode, allowing you to control how the camera measures light [3]. Matrix metering evaluates light across the entire scene, ideal for landscapes. Center metering concentrates on the center, which is useful for portraits, and spot metering focuses on a small area, perfect for detailed subjects like eyes ![The table provides a comparative overview of three different camera metering modes with descriptions of how each mode functions and its ideal use case](image5).  These settings, among others like ISO, shutter speed, and white balance, are typically accessible within the Pro mode interface, as illustrated, giving photographers granular control over their image capture process ![The image is a labeled diagram of a smartphone camera interface in \"Pro\" mode](image2). By offering selectable focus and metering modes, Pro Mode empowers photographers to optimize camera settings for diverse shooting conditions and creative intentions."}

These programmes are designed with specialised curricula and delivered through lectures, seminars, and tutorials [1]. NIE offers various courses for professional development, some of which can be accredited towards Advanced Diploma programmes [3]. These courses, developed with the Ministry of Education, Singapore, are broadly categorised into Pedagogical Skills and Content Knowledge [3].  For individuals seeking to deepen their understanding in specific disciplines, NIE provides options for coursework-based Masters programmes with disciplinary content, as shown in the programme overview ![Overview of Master's and Doctoral programmes divided into categories](image4).\n\nThese programmes cater to different interests, including applied linguistics for language professionals [5], humanities education for educators and leaders in humanities [8], and life sciences for those interested in recent scientific developments [7]. The duration and mode of study vary across programmes, with options for both full-time and part-time study [6]. Many Master's programmes offer a full-time duration that can extend up to three years, as detailed in the duration table ![Table listing academic programs with duration and mode of study](image1).  The environment for graduate studies is collaborative and engaging, as seen in settings ranging from casual discussions to laboratory work  ![Three women sitting together at a table discussing graduate studies](image2)  ![Four people in a laboratory setting, possibly related to education or research](image3) ![Three individuals standing on a balcony in a modern building, discussing graduate studies](image5).\n\nThe programmes by coursework with disciplinary content that allow for a maximum full-time duration of 3 years are MA (Applied Linguistics), MA (Humanities Education), MSc (Exercise & Sport Studies), MSc (Life Sciences), and MSc (Mathematics for Educators)."}

It is essential to monitor the progression of leads through the funnel, from initial interest to becoming sales-qualified opportunities. [4] depicts the stages of lead conversion, starting from Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs) to Sales-Accepted Leads (SALs), then to Sales-Qualified Leads (SQLs), and finally to Sales Won Opportunities (SWOs).  ![The image displays cross-industry average conversion rates at various stages of a sales funnel, showing a 4-8% conversion rate from MQLs to SALs.](image5) shows that the typical conversion rate from MQL to SAL ranges between 4% and 8%. However, when we examine specific data, such as in ![The image shows a series of data metrics related to sales and marketing performance, indicating a 1.50% conversion rate from MQL to SAL.](image4), we observe a significantly lower conversion rate of just 1.50% from MQL to SAL. This stark contrast suggests a potential issue in the lead qualification process or alignment between marketing and sales teams.  A lower than average MQL to SAL conversion rate could indicate that the criteria for defining an MQL are not effectively aligned with what sales considers a truly qualified lead, leading to inefficiencies in the sales pipeline.\n\nThe conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads to Sales Accepted Leads varies significantly across different datasets, suggesting potential discrepancies in lead qualification processes or sales-marketing alignment."}

For instance, if your dishes are not drying properly, it could be due to selecting a short program which uses a lower washing temperature, or using low-quality cutlery that doesn't drain water well. In such cases, try using a program with a longer washing time or consider that certain cutlery types are not dishwasher safe ![This image shows potential causes and solutions for dishes not drying.](image1).\n\n\nSometimes, the issues are more noticeable, like a stained tub interior which could be simply from using detergent with colorant, easily solved by switching to a detergent without colorant.  Other times you might find a white film inside, indicating hard water minerals, which can be cleaned with a damp sponge and dishwasher detergent ![This image details several common dishwasher problems and their solutions, such as dealing with rust stains or noises.](image2).  It’s also worth noting that operational problems such as the dishwasher not starting could be as simple as a blown fuse or a tripped circuit breaker, or even just the dishwasher door not being properly closed ![This image lists problems like the dishwasher not starting and provides troubleshooting steps.](image3).\n\nFurthermore, issues like dishes not being clean might arise from not using enough detergent, items blocking the spray arms, or filters that are dirty or improperly fitted.  These are all aspects you can check and correct before assuming a more serious malfunction ![This image provides troubleshooting tips for issues such as dishes not being clean.](image5). In total, there are quite a few problems that you might troubleshoot on your own before deciding to call for professional service.\n\nThere are potentially many problems a dishwasher may encounter that can be troubleshooted before calling for service."}
