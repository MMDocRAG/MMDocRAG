Confidence is assessed based on the strength and reliability of evidence, while likelihood is evaluated based on the probability of an event occurring. Below are the detailed evaluations for both concepts, supported by figures and textual descriptions from the document pages and figures provided. \n\n### Confidence Evaluation\n\nConfidence is categorized into four levels, each reflecting the strength and reliability of evidence and the degree of expert consensus. The levels are as follows:\n\n1. **Very High**: Strong evidence with established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well-documented and accepted methods, and high consensus.\n2. **High**: Moderate evidence with several sources, some consistency, varying methods, or limited documentation, and medium consensus.\n3. **Medium**: Suggestive evidence with a few sources, limited consistency, incomplete models, emerging methods, and competing schools of thought.\n4. **Low**: Inconclusive evidence with limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation, untested methods, and a lack of expert consensus or disagreement.\n\nThis classification is visually represented in Figure 1.\n\n![Confidence Levels](image2)\n\n### Likelihood Evaluation\n\nLikelihood is evaluated based on the probability of an event occurring, using subjective assessments. The terms and their corresponding probabilities are:\n\n1. **Very Likely**: Greater than or equal to 9 in 10.\n2. **Likely**: Greater than or equal to 2 in 3.\n3. **As Likely As Not**: Approximately 1 in 2.\n4. **Unlikely**: Less than or equal to 1 in 3.\n5. **Very Unlikely**: Less than or equal to 1 in 10.\n\nThis classification is visually represented in Figure 2.\n\n![Likelihood Terms](image3)\n\n### Supporting Textual Descriptions\n\nFrom the document pages, we find further elaboration on these evaluations:\n\n- **Confidence Language**: Describes the validity of a finding based on the type, amount, quality, strength, and consistency of evidence and the degree of expert agreement on the finding. Confidence is expressed qualitatively and ranges from low confidence (inconclusive evidence or disagreement among experts) to very high confidence (strong evidence and high consensus)[9].\n- **Likelihood Language**: Describes the likelihood of occurrence based on measures of uncertainty expressed probabilistically (in other words, based on statistical analysis of observations or model results or based on expert judgment). Likelihood, or the probability of an impact, is a term that allows a quantitative estimate of uncertainty to be associated with projections. Thus, likelihood statements have a specific probability associated with them, ranging from very unlikely (less than or equal to a 1 in 10 chance of the outcome occurring) to very likely (greater than or equal to a 9 in 10 chance)[7].\n\nThese evaluations help in understanding the robustness of the evidence and the probability of potential"}

According to the data presented in the figures, individuals with higher education levels tend to have differing views on the ethical standards and extremism of political parties compared to those with lower education levels. Additionally, political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping these perceptions.\n\n![Political Party Preference](image3)\n\nFrom Figure 1, we see that among all registered voters, 48% prefer the Democratic Party, while 43% prefer the Republican Party. This preference varies across different demographic groups, such as gender, race, age, and education level.\n\n![Ethics and Extremism Perception](image4)\n\nFigure 2 provides a breakdown of perceptions regarding the ethical standards and extremism of political parties. For instance, among those with a college degree or higher, 17% believe that both parties have high ethical standards, whereas 43% think that one party has high ethical standards and the other does not. In contrast, among those with a high school education or less, 19% believe both parties have high ethical standards, and 43% think one party has high ethical standards and the other does not.\n\n![Approval and Disapproval Ratings](image1)\n\nFigure 3 further illustrates the approval and disapproval ratings of political parties among different demographic groups.

According to the survey data, the Democratic Party is perceived to have slightly higher ethical standards (42%) compared to the Republican Party (41%). Conversely, the Republican Party is seen as more extreme (48%) than the Democratic Party (42%). These findings highlight a nuanced view where one party is perceived as having marginally better ethical standards, while the other is seen as more extreme.\n\n![Ethical Standards and Extremism Perceptions](image3)\n\nWhen examining these perceptions through the lens of education, individuals with higher educational attainment tend to have differing views. For instance, those with at least a college degree are more likely to believe that neither party has high ethical standards (31%), compared to those with some college education (26%) or a high school degree or less (20%). This suggests that educational background plays a role in shaping perceptions of political parties' ethical standards[5].\n\n![Ethical Standards by Education](image1)\n\nPolitical affiliation also significantly influences these perceptions. Independents are notably more likely than partisans to say that neither party has high ethical standards (34%), including equal shares of Republican leaners and Democratic leaners (33% each). In contrast, only about two-in-ten Republicans (19%) or Democrats (18%) hold this view[1]. Furthermore, when considering the perception of extremism, 48% of the public views the Republican Party as too extreme, which has decreased from previous years, while 42% view the Democratic Party as too extreme, showing a slight decline in this perception as well[3].\n\n![Political Affiliation Influence](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and extremism between the Republican and Democratic parties are complex and influenced by both educational background and political affiliation.

The data highlights widespread dissatisfaction with both the conduct of political entities and the nature of the campaign itself. Here's a detailed analysis of how these perceptions interrelate based on the provided evidence: \n\nFirst, examining voter perceptions of political entities, we see that a majority of voters gave low grades to various political actors involved in the 2016 election. According to the survey data presented in Figure 1, only a small percentage of voters gave high grades (A or B) to entities such as Trump (30%), Clinton (43%), the Republican Party (22%), the Democratic Party (26%), the press (22%), and the pollsters (21%). The average grades for these entities were predominantly C or lower, indicating general dissatisfaction among voters. \n\n![Survey Data on Political Entities](image4)\n\nSecond, the perception of campaign negativity was also notably high among voters. As shown in Figure 2, 92% of voters believed there was more mudslinging in the 2016 election compared to previous elections. This figure marks a significant increase from earlier years, highlighting the particularly negative tone of the 2016 campaign. \n\n![Perception of Campaign Negativity](image1)\n\nThese two pieces of evidence together suggest a strong correlation between the negative perceptions of political entities and the perception of increased campaign negativity. The dissatisfaction with the conduct of political actors likely contributed to the perception of a more negative campaign environment, where mudslinging and other forms of negative campaigning were prevalent. This interplay underscores the broader sentiment among voters that the 2016 election was one to forget, characterized by harsh criticisms and low ratings for most involved parties[8]."}

The following analysis highlights these trends using multiple figures and textual descriptions from the provided evidence. \n\n### Overall Trends Over Time\nFrom 2004 to 2015, there was a noticeable shift in public opinion regarding the government's efforts to combat terrorism. Initially, a larger portion of the population believed that the government had not gone far enough to protect the country. However, by 2015, the perception shifted, with more people believing that the government had gone too far in restricting civil liberties[10]. This trend is illustrated in the following figure:\n\n![Trend in Public Opinion on Terrorism Efforts](image3)\n\n### Political Affiliation Differences\nThe perception of government efforts also varies significantly by political affiliation. Republicans tend to be more supportive of the government's anti-terrorism policies compared to Democrats and Independents. This is evident in the line graph below, which shows the percentage of each political affiliation that believes the government has not gone far enough to protect the country:\n\n![Political Affiliation Trends](image1)\n\nAs of 2015, 71% of Republicans felt that the government had not gone far enough, compared to 54% of Democrats and 49% of Independents[3].\n\n### Age Group Differences\nOpinions on government efforts to combat terrorism also differ by age group. Younger individuals (ages 18-29) are more likely to believe that the government has gone too far in restricting civil liberties, whereas older individuals (ages 65+) are more inclined to think that the government has not gone far enough to protect the country. This is depicted in the table below:\n\n![Age Group Opinions](image2)\n\nIn 2015, 43% of individuals aged 18-29 believed that civil liberties were being overly restricted, compared to only 15% of those aged 65+. Conversely, 71% of individuals aged 65+ felt that more measures were needed to protect the U.S., compared to 44% of those aged 18-29.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, public perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have evolved over time, with a notable shift towards concerns about civil liberties. These perceptions vary significantly by political affiliation, with Republicans generally more supportive of current efforts, and by age group, with younger individuals more concerned about civil liberties and older individuals more focused on national security."}

However, by 2015, these numbers had shifted to 56% feeling that the country had gone too far and only 28% thinking it had not gone far enough. This change reflects a growing concern about civil liberties over national security measures.\n\n![Figure 1](image2)\n\n![Figure 2](image5)\n\nThese insights highlight the complex interplay between age, political ideology, and temporal changes in public perception of government actions related to terrorism.

This indicates that Hispanic households have faced greater difficulty in securing employment over this period.\n\n### Income\n![Income Comparison](image2)\nIn terms of median household income, Hispanic households earned $42,500 in 2014, which is lower than the $53,700 median income for all U.S. households. This disparity suggests that Hispanic families generally have fewer financial resources to meet their needs compared to the average U.S. household.\n\n### Poverty Rate\n![Poverty Rate Comparison](image2)\nThe poverty rate for Hispanic households was 23.6% in 2014, compared to 14.8% for all U.S. households. This substantial difference highlights the greater economic hardship experienced by Hispanic households, with a higher proportion of individuals living below the poverty line.\n\n### Wealth\n![Wealth Comparison](image2)\nMedian household wealth for Hispanic households was $13,700 in 2013, markedly lower than the $81,400 for all U.S. households. This stark disparity in wealth accumulation underscores the long-term economic insecurity faced by Hispanic households.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the data illustrates that Hispanic households have faced greater economic challenges in terms of higher unemployment rates, lower incomes, higher poverty rates, and significantly less wealth compared to the general U.S. population during the period from 2000 to 2015. These disparities reflect systemic economic inequalities that impact the financial stability and opportunities available to Hispanic families.[7][1]"}

The data indicates an overall improvement in these perceptions across various Latino subgroups during this period. Here's a detailed breakdown based on the provided figures and textual descriptions: \n\n### Personal Financial Situation\n\nFrom Figure 1, we observe that the perception of personal financial situations has improved among both the general population and all Hispanics. Specifically, the percentage of Hispanics rating their financial situation as 'excellent' or 'good' increased from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015, marking a substantial rise of 14 percentage points. This trend is also reflected in the general population, where the percentage increased from 56% in 2008 to 61% in 2015, a smaller but still notable increase of 6 percentage points.\n\n![Personal Financial Situation](image5)\n\n### Family Income Relative to Cost of Living\n\nFigure 2 provides insights into how different racial and ethnic groups perceive their family income relative to the cost of living. In 2015, 53% of Hispanic adults felt their income was falling behind the cost of living, compared to 53% in 2014. However, the percentage of those who felt their income was staying about even with the cost of living increased from 34% in 2014 to 37% in 2015. Additionally, the percentage of those who felt their income was going up faster than the cost of living remained relatively stable at 10% in 2015, compared to 9% in 2014.\n\n![Family Income Relative to Cost of Living](image1)\n\nThese changes reflect a nuanced shift in perceptions among Latino groups regarding their financial well-being and the ability of their income to keep pace with the cost of living. While the proportion feeling behind remains significant, there is a slight improvement in those feeling they are keeping up or advancing financially."}

Specifically, 64% of the surveyed population holds this view, with a notable difference between Republicans/Lean Republicans (32%) and Democrats/Lean Democrats (91%). This indicates a strong partisan divide on the issue of transparency regarding financial information.\n\n![Responsibility to Release Tax Returns](image1)\n\nSecondly, figure 2 highlights the public's trust in Trump compared to previous presidents. Only 26% of respondents say they trust Trump more than previous presidents, whereas 58% say they trust him less[10]. This perception varies significantly between Republicans/Lean Republicans (58% trust more) and Democrats/Lean Democrats (94% trust less)[5], reflecting a stark partisan division.\n\n![Trust in Trump Compared to Previous Presidents](image3)\n\nAdditionally, figure 3 shows the approval ratings of several U.S. presidents at different points in their terms. Trump's approval ratings are notably lower compared to some of his predecessors, such as Reagan and G.H.W. Bush, who had higher approval ratings during their respective terms.\n\n![Approval Ratings of U.S. Presidents](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, public perceptions of Trump's responsibilities and trustworthiness are generally lower compared to previous presidents. These perceptions are heavily influenced by partisan views, with Democrats being more critical and Republicans more supportive of Trump. This analysis underscores the polarized nature of public opinion regarding presidential performance and responsibilities in contemporary American politics."}

When broken down by political affiliation: \n- **Republicans/Lean Republican:** 79% believed the policies made things better, 13% felt they had no effect, and 6% believed they made things worse. \n- **Democrats/Lean Democrat:** Only 10% believed the policies made things better, 41% felt they had no effect, and 46% believed they made things worse. \n\nThis is illustrated in the following figure: \n\n![Economic Impact Perception](image4) \n\n### Ethical Standards \nViews on the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials are also divided along partisan lines. According to the data: \n- **Republicans/Lean Republican:** 76% believe the ethical standards are excellent or good, while 24% believe they are not good or poor. \n- **Democrats/Lean Democrat:** A significant majority, 90%, believe the ethical standards are not good or poor, with 67% rating them as 'poor'. \n\nThis is depicted in the following figure: \n\n![Ethical Standards Perception](image2) \n\n### Long-Term Success \nOpinions on whether Trump will be a successful president in the long run show stark contrasts between political affiliations: \n- **Republicans/Lean Republican:** 65% believe he will be successful, 9% unsuccessful, and 25% say it's too early to tell. \n- **Democrats/Lean Democrat:** Only 3% believe he will be successful, 80% unsuccessful, and 16% say it's too early to tell. \n\nComparing this to previous presidents like Obama, Bush, and Clinton, we find that Trump's perceived success is more polarized. For instance, in January 2011, 43% of Democrats believed Obama would be successful, whereas in December 2003, 69% of Republicans believed Bush would be successful. \n\nThese comparisons are visualized in the following figure: \n\n![Long-Term Success Perception](image5) \n\n### Approval Ratings \nApproval ratings for Trump in January 2019 stood at 39%.

These differences are illustrated in the following figures and descriptions: ![Partisan Beliefs on Reasons for Outbreak Continuation](image3) ![Perceived Adequacy of Measures](image2) ![Trust in Government](image5) In Figure 1, we see that 89% of Democrats believe that 'not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing' is a major reason for the outbreak's continuation, compared to only 57% of Republicans. Similarly, 82% of Democrats think that 'restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places,' whereas only 31% of Republicans agree. Furthermore, 82% of Democrats consider the 'inadequate response from the federal government' a major factor, in contrast to just 21% of Republicans[10].

According to Figure 1, 50% of self-identified Hispanics prefer to identify with their country of origin or heritage. This preference is most prominent among the foreign-born population, where 65% identify this way, compared to 36% of the second generation and 26% of the third or higher generation. Conversely, the preference for identifying as 'American' increases with each generation, rising from 7% among the foreign-born to 56% among the third or higher generation[3].\n\n![figure2](image1)\n\nFigure 2 further illustrates this trend, showing that 7% of the foreign-born identify as 'American,' which jumps to 36% in the second generation and 56% in the third or higher generation.

This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of multiple figures and textual descriptions provided in the document. Specifically, figure 1 shows the label diversity of different querying strategies on the PathMNIST dataset. Among the strategies compared, VAAL exhibits the lowest entropy value of 2.800, indicating a highly skewed distribution favoring certain classes over others. For instance, VAAL heavily selects data from the muscle class while largely ignoring mucus and mucosa classes. This pattern is consistent with the findings reported in the textual descriptions, which mention that VAAL tends to focus on specific classes, leading to a lack of diversity in the selected data. This behavior is further corroborated by figure 7, which illustrates the label diversity on the OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST datasets. In both cases, VAAL shows a strong bias towards certain classes, such as femur-right and platelet in OrganAMNIST, and basophil and erythroblast in BloodMNIST, while neglecting other important classes. This selective bias results in poor overall label diversity, making VAAL the least effective strategy for ensuring balanced class representation across different datasets. ![Label Diversity on PathMNIST](image5) ![Label Diversity on OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST](image1)"}

According to the data, the most common reason for refuted claims is incorrect calculation results, accounting for 41.7%. Additionally, 33.3% of refuted claims involve incorrect approximation words, and 10.0% are partially right but ultimately incorrect. These reasons highlight the complexity in verifying scientific claims, especially when calculations and approximations are involved. For NEI claims, the leading reason is insufficient matching evidence, which accounts for 33.3%, followed by the lack of open-domain knowledge at 25.0%. These issues suggest that many claims require additional evidence or domain-specific knowledge to be verified, complicating the classification process for models. ![Refuted and NEI Reasons](image4)\n\nWhen examining the performance of various models in zero-shot 3-class classification, we observe significant differences. InstructGPT, for instance, struggles particularly with NEI claims, often misclassifying them as 'supported' or 'refuted.' This is evident in the confusion matrix, where InstructGPT predicts 26.8% of NEI claims as 'supported,' 23.6% as 'refuted,' and only 24.6% correctly as 'NEI.'

The inclusion of NEI claims indeed diminishes model confidence, leading to frequent misclassification, as highlighted in the confusion matrices. This analysis reveals that while certain models like GPT-4 might excel in specific areas, the overall performance on NEI claims remains a critical issue, reflecting the inherent difficulties in scientific fact-checking tasks."}

The performance metrics and error types provide valuable insights into their accuracy and error tendencies.\n\n### Performance Comparison\n\nFrom the performance table (Figure 1), we see that GPT-4 generally outperforms InstructGPT in both zero-shot and in-context scenarios. Specifically, GPT-4 achieves higher scores in both 2-class and 3-class classification tasks compared to InstructGPT.\n\n![Performance Comparison](image5)\n\n### Error Analysis\n\nThe confusion matrices (Figure 2) reveal significant differences in how InstructGPT and GPT-4 handle classification errors:\n\n- **InstructGPT**:\n  - Shows a tendency to classify many instances as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information). For example, 26.8% of 'Supported' claims and 23.6% of 'Refuted' claims are misclassified as 'NEI'.\n  - This suggests that InstructGPT is less confident in making definitive classifications and often defaults to 'NEI'.\n\n- **GPT-4**:\n  - Demonstrates a higher confidence in classifying claims as 'Supported'. For instance, 32.1% of 'Supported' claims are correctly classified as 'Supported', and only 0.4% are classified as 'NEI'.\n  - However, GPT-4 also shows a notable tendency to misclassify 'NEI' claims as 'Supported' (10.3%) and 'Refuted' (8.5%).\n\n![Confusion Matrices](image2)\n\n### Error Types\n\nFurther analysis of error types (Figure 3) provides additional context:\n\n- **Grounding Errors**:\n  - Account for 50% of errors, indicating issues in associating data with the correct cells in the table.\n\n- **Ambiguity Errors**:\n  - Make up 22% of errors, suggesting challenges in interpreting ambiguous expressions in claims.\n\n- **Calculation Errors**:\n  - Constitute 20% of errors, pointing to inaccuracies in arithmetic calculations.\n\n- **Program Errors**:\n  - Represent 8% of errors, involving mistakes in programming logic.\n\n![Error Types](image3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, GPT-4's higher performance and lower tendency to default to 'NEI' indicate its stronger reasoning capabilities and confidence in classification. In contrast, InstructGPT's frequent classification as 'NEI' suggests a more cautious approach but may also reflect uncertainty in handling certain claims. Understanding these differences helps in tailoring the use of these models to specific tasks requiring varying levels of confidence and precision."}

However, the nature of these challenges differs between the two models.\n\nFor **InstructGPT**, the primary challenge lies in its tendency to classify supported and refuted claims as 'NEI'. This is evident from the confusion matrix, where a substantial portion of supported claims (26.8%) and refuted claims (23.6%) are misclassified as NEI. This suggests that InstructGPT often defaults to 'NEI' when uncertain about the verifiability of a claim.\n\n![InstructGPT Confusion Matrix](image5)\n\nOn the other hand, **GPT-4** exhibits a different pattern of errors. It tends to over-confidently categorize NEI claims as either supported or refuted. As shown in the confusion matrix, a notable percentage of NEI claims are incorrectly classified as supported (10.3%) or refuted (8.5%). This indicates that GPT-4 may be overly assertive in its classifications, leading to frequent mislabeling of NEI claims.\n\n![GPT-4 Confusion Matrix](image5)\n\nThese differences highlight the distinct approaches taken by the two models in handling uncertainty and ambiguity in claim classification. While InstructGPT leans towards caution by labeling more claims as 'NEI', GPT-4's over-confidence results in more aggressive but often incorrect classifications[5]."}

Here's a detailed interpretation based on the provided figures and descriptions from the document pages and figures. \n\nIn the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting, as depicted in Figure 1, the removal of knowledge elements leads to a significant increase in precision, which starts at around 14 and reaches about 26. This suggests that the model becomes more precise in identifying the absence of knowledge as more elements are removed. Recall remains relatively stable, hovering around 14, indicating that the model consistently identifies the need for absent knowledge without much fluctuation. The F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, shows a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18. This implies that while the model improves in precision, its overall performance in handling absent knowledge is moderately enhanced.\n\n![Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence](image3)\n\nOn the other hand, the retrieval analysis presented in Figure 2 illustrates a different trend. As retrieval accuracy decreases, precision, recall, and F1-Score all decrease. Specifically, precision, represented by blue circles, shows a notable decline, indicating that the model struggles to maintain precision as the retrieval accuracy drops. Recall, shown by the orange curve, also decreases, suggesting that the model's ability to retrieve relevant information diminishes. The F1-Score, indicated by green inverted triangles, follows a similar downward trend, reflecting a balanced decline in both precision and recall. Correctness, marked by red triangles, starts high and slightly decreases, showing that while the model maintains a relatively high correctness, it is not immune to the effects of reduced retrieval accuracy.\n\n![Retrieval Analysis](image5)\n\nIn summary, the removal of knowledge elements in the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting enhances precision and moderately improves the F1-Score, highlighting the model's improved ability to identify absent knowledge. However, in the retrieval analysis, the decrease in retrieval accuracy leads to a decline in precision, recall, and F1-Score, indicating challenges in maintaining performance when retrieval quality is compromised. These findings underscore the importance of both precision and retrieval accuracy in evaluating a model's ability to handle absent knowledge effectively."}

TimeQA involves temporal reasoning over large datasets (5226 examples), which benefits greatly from the structured prompting and retrieval methods used in Step-Back + RAG[4]. In contrast, StrategyQA focuses on multi-hop reasoning with fewer examples (229), making it more susceptible to reasoning errors despite the structured prompting.

Let's break down the performance metrics and insights from the multitask learning approach used by SciIE.\n\nFirst, consider the performance of SciIE on the SemEval 17 dataset as shown in ![figure 1](image4). SciIE achieves higher precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to the 'Best SemEval' and 'Luan 2017' models in tasks such as Span Identification, Keyphrase Extraction, and Relation Extraction. Specifically, SciIE's F1 scores are 58.6 for Span Identification, 46.0 for Keyphrase Extraction, and 27.8 for Relation Extraction, which are higher than those of the competing models[7].\n\nNext, looking at the results on the SciERC dataset in ![figure 2](image1), SciIE again shows strong performance. For entity recognition, SciIE achieves an F1 score of 64.2 on the test set, which is higher than other models like LSTM+CRF and E2E Rel.

Specifically, the F1 score for adversarial evaluation data is 60.10 when trained on adversarial data, compared to 46.84 when trained on original data[9].\n\n![Performance Metrics](image4)\n\n#### Distractor vs. Open-Domain Settings\nFigure 3 compares the F1 scores for various settings, including distractor, open-domain with 10 paragraphs, open-domain with 500 paragraphs, and open-domain with 500 paragraphs plus a gold paragraph. The results indicate that the 'Distractor' setting achieves the highest F1 score of 67.08, while the addition of a gold paragraph in the open-domain setting significantly boosts the F1 score to 53.12[5].\n\n![Distractor vs. Open-Domain Settings](image2)\n\n#### Model Performance\nFigure 4 presents the F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: 'Distractor' and 'Open.' The scores show that models like DFGN + BERT and DecompRC perform well in the 'Distractor' setting, with F1 scores of 68.49 and 69.63 respectively. However, in the 'Open' setting, models like Cognitive Graph and DecompRC show higher F1 scores of 48.87 and 40.65 respectively.\n\n![Model Performance](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, adversarial training data tends to improve performance on adversarial evaluation data, and the inclusion of a gold paragraph in open-domain settings significantly enhances F1 scores. Different models exhibit varying strengths depending on the evaluation setting, with some performing better in distractor settings while others excel in open-domain settings. These insights highlight the importance of selecting appropriate training and evaluation strategies to optimize performance in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks."}

By introducing adversarial examples, the distribution of statistical cues is mirrored over both labels, which eliminates the signal that models might rely on for making predictions. This leads to a substantial decrease in performance metrics such as Mean, Median, and Max scores for BERT models when evaluated on the adversarial dataset compared to the original dataset[3].\n\nIn the original dataset, BERT achieves a Mean score of 0.671, a Median score of 0.712, and a Max score of 0.770. However, when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance drops drastically, with a Mean score of 0.504, a Median score of 0.505, and a Max score of 0.533[6]. This decline indicates that the adversarial setup effectively reduces the reliance on spurious statistical cues, leading to more robust evaluations of argument comprehension.\n\n![Original vs Adversarial Comparison](image3)\n\nThe adversarial data setup challenges the models to understand the arguments better rather than relying on superficial cues. This shift in performance highlights the importance of using adversarial datasets to evaluate and improve the robustness of NLP models, ensuring they perform well under varied conditions and not just on datasets with specific biases[8].\n\n![Performance Metrics on Original Dataset](image5)\n![Performance Metrics on Adversarial Dataset](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup serves as a more rigorous test for evaluating argument comprehension, pushing models like BERT to develop deeper understanding capabilities rather than exploiting statistical quirks in the data. This approach is crucial for advancing the field of NLP towards more reliable and robust systems."}

Greedy decoding stands out as the most effective automated method, achieving the highest average score of 77.53 across various relations such as oWant, xIntent, xNeed, xReact, and xWant. However, it still falls short of human validation, which achieves an average score of 86.18, indicating that while automated methods can perform well, they do not yet match human-level performance.[7]\n\n![Decoding Methods Performance](image1)\n\nFigure 2 provides insights into how different percentages of training data impact the model's performance metrics. As the percentage of training data increases, there is a noticeable improvement in perplexity (PPL), BLEU-2 scores, and novelty metrics (N/T and N/U).

This conclusion is drawn from the data presented in the figures and tables from the provided documents. Here's a detailed comparison based on the evidence provided: \n\n### Accuracy and Performance Comparison\n\nFrom Figure 1, we can see that the COMET model achieves the lowest perplexity (4.32) and the highest score (95.25) among all models tested. Additionally, the human evaluation score for COMET is 91.69, which is very close to the human performance score of 91.70. This indicates that COMET closely approximates human-level performance on the ConceptNet dataset.\n\n![Performance Comparison](image1)\n\n### Novelty Analysis\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the novelty of the generated tuples by COMET. The graph shows that as the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, but the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%. This suggests that COMET generates tuples that are both novel and accurate, maintaining high classifier accuracy even with significant edit distances from the training data.\n\n![Novelty Analysis](image2)\n\n### Detailed Example of Generated Tuples\n\nFigure 3 provides specific examples of tuples generated by COMET. These examples show that COMET can generate plausible relationships between concepts, such as 'piece' being a part of a 'machine,' 'bread' being a food, and 'puzzle' being located in the 'mind.' This further supports the model's capability to generate accurate and contextually relevant knowledge.\n\n![Generated Tuples](image3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe COMET model's superior performance in terms of accuracy and its ability to generate novel yet accurate tuples highlight its effectiveness in handling the ConceptNet dataset. The combination of low perplexity, high scores, and close approximation to human performance, along with the generation of novel and plausible tuples, underscores the robustness and reliability of the COMET model in commonsense reasoning tasks."}

This growth was driven by increases in various asset categories, particularly in Equity and Liquidity.\n\n![AUM Table](image3)\n\n- **Key Contributors**:\n  - **Equity**: Increased from $111 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020.\n  - **Liquidity**: Increased from $158 billion in 2018 to $252 billion in 2020.\n\n#### Fee Rates\n- **Decline in Fee Rates**: Despite the increase in AUM, the overall fee rates decreased across most categories. The table below illustrates these changes:\n\n![Fee Rates Table](image1)\n\n- **Key Trends**:\n  - **Fixed Income**: Fee rates decreased from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020.\n  - **Alternative/Other**: Fee rates dropped from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020.\n  - **Total AUM**: Overall fee rates fell from 47 bps in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020.\n\n#### Impact on Revenues\n- **Revenue Implications**: The combination of increased AUM and declining fee rates suggests a complex impact on the firm's revenues. While the rise in AUM provides more opportunities for generating income, the reduction in fee rates may offset some of this potential revenue growth. Specifically, the firm's ability to maintain or grow revenues will depend on its success in leveraging the larger AUM base despite lower fees per asset managed.\n\nIn conclusion, the firm's strategic focus on increasing AUM while managing fee rate reductions will be crucial in navigating the evolving market conditions and maintaining revenue stability.[9]"}

Similarly, comprehensive income rose to $8,964 million in 2021 from $5,305 million in 2020 and $4,272 million in 2019. These increases can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n- **Revenue Growth**: As shown in the financial data, total revenues increased from $23,531 million in 2020 to $33,566 million in 2021. This growth was driven by higher equipment and services revenue, which rose from $16,129 million in 2020 to $26,616 million in 2021[10], and licensing revenue, which increased from $7,402 million in 2020 to $6,950 million in 2021.\n\n- **Cost Management**: Despite the increase in revenues, the company managed to keep costs under control. For instance, the cost of revenues increased from $11,574 million in 2020 to $17,179 million in 2021, but this was proportionally less than the increase in revenues.\n\n- **Effective Tax Management**: The income tax expense decreased from $1,174 million in 2020 to $1,057 million in 2021, despite the increase in taxable income, indicating effective tax planning and management.\n\n- **Foreign Currency Translation Gains**: There was a positive foreign currency translation gain of $40 million in 2021, compared to $60 million in 2020 and a loss of $110 million in 2019, which positively impacted comprehensive income.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the improved financial performance of the company in fiscal year 2021.\n\n![Financial Data Table](image2)\n![Comprehensive Income Table](image5)"}

This reduction indicates a strategic effort to manage costs during a challenging economic period, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuating market conditions.\n\n![Capital Expenditures](image3)\n\n### Taxes\n\nThe tax data for the same period shows a dramatic shift. Income taxes went from a positive $5,282 million in 2019 to a negative $(5,632) million in 2020. This negative figure suggests that ExxonMobil either received tax credits or had losses that offset taxable income.

Specifically, the comprehensive income for 2020 was $4,626.4 million, compared to $6,152.2 million in 2019 and $5,493.2 million in 2018. This decline can be attributed to several factors, as detailed below.\n\n![Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income](image5)\n\n### Key Factors Contributing to the Differences:\n\n1. **Net Income:**\n   - The net income for 2020 was $4,730.5 million, which is lower than the $6,025.4 million reported in 2019 and slightly higher than the $5,924.3 million in 2018. This reduction in net income is a primary factor in the overall decrease in comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments:**\n   - There was a gain of $63.1 million in 2020, compared to $174.3 million in 2019 and a loss of $453.6 million in 2018. The significant improvement in 2020 compared to 2018 indicates a positive impact on comprehensive income.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Hedges:**\n   - A loss of $123.3 million was recorded in 2020, contrasting with a loss of $20.4 million in 2019 and a gain of $48.9 million in 2018. This represents a substantial negative impact on comprehensive income for 2020.\n\n4. **Defined Benefit Pension Plans:**\n   - A loss of $43.9 million was recorded in 2020, compared to losses of $27.1 million in 2019 and $26.4 million in 2018. While this component has consistently been a negative factor, its impact increased slightly in 2020.\n\nIn summary, while some components like foreign currency translation adjustments showed improvement, the overall decrease in net income and significant losses from cash flow hedges were major contributors to the decline in comprehensive income for McDonald's in 2020."}

Let's delve into the specifics of these changes and their underlying causes using the provided figures and descriptions. \n\n### Net Interest Income Changes\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the net interest income showed a slight increase. In 2019, the net interest income was $866 million, which rose to $967 million in 2020 and further to $1,011 million in 2021. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including lower costs of funds and the exclusion of certain interest expenses and incomes not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio[7].\n\n![Net Interest Income](image2)\n\n### Card Member Receivables Changes\n\nThe card member receivables saw a significant increase over the same period. In 2019, the total card member receivables were $22.8 billion. This figure decreased to $18.7 billion in 2020 but rebounded sharply to $22.4 billion in 2021, marking a 20% increase from 2020 to 2021. The increase in card member receivables was primarily driven by higher average Card Member spending and an increase in the number of proprietary cards-in-force[7].\n\n![Card Member Receivables](image4)\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these financial changes:\n\n- **Lower Cost of Funds:** The net interest income benefited from a lower cost of funds, which helped offset the impact of lower average revolving Card Member loan balances[7].\n- **Higher Billed Business:** There was a substantial increase in billed business, particularly in the U.S., which positively impacted both net interest income and card member receivables.\n- **Recovery from Pandemic Effects:** The recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic played a crucial role in the increase in card member receivables, as consumer spending patterns normalized.\n\nIn conclusion, the observed changes in net interest income and card member receivables from 2019 to 2021 reflect a combination of strategic financial management and broader economic conditions, including recovery from the pandemic and shifts in consumer behavior."}

This significant rise can be attributed to the profit for the year, which was RMB 4,176 million in 2020, as shown in the income statement. Additionally, other comprehensive income components, such as fair value changes on financial assets and currency translation differences, also contributed positively to the overall increase in retained earnings.\n\n- **Total Comprehensive Income for the Year**: The total comprehensive income for 2019 was RMB 5,268 million, which rose dramatically to RMB 8,100 million in 2020. This increase was largely driven by substantial gains in fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, which were RMB 5,219 million in 2020 compared to RMB 1,031 million in 2019.

In 2018, the total provision was $3,562 million, which increased to $3,742 million in 2019 and further to $4,973 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\n![Income Tax Provisions](image5)\n\n### Analysis of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nIn 2020, the total deferred income tax assets amounted to $3,391 million, up from $2,868 million in 2019. This increase in deferred tax assets suggests that the company has more future tax benefits expected to offset taxable income in subsequent years.\n\n![Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities](image3)\n\nConversely, the total deferred income tax liabilities decreased from $(5,861) million in 2019 to $(6,758) million in 2020. This reduction in liabilities indicates that the company has fewer future tax obligations, which might contribute to the higher current tax provisions.\n\n### Impact on Trends\n\nThe combination of increased deferred tax assets and reduced deferred tax liabilities implies that while the company may face higher current tax provisions, it anticipates lower future tax obligations. This strategic positioning allows the company to manage its tax liabilities effectively over time.\n\nOverall, the trends in the company's provisions for income taxes reflect a complex interplay between current tax obligations and future tax planning strategies, influenced by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities."}

This reduction was influenced by changes in various debt instruments, including reductions in Euro-denominated commercial paper and specific senior unsecured notes.\n\n![Debt Components](image4)\n\n### Relationship Between Liabilities and Debt\n\nWhile liabilities increased overall, the slight reduction in total debt suggests that the company might have managed its debt more effectively or refinanced some of its obligations. The increase in liabilities, particularly in deferred revenue and cross-currency swap derivative liabilities, indicates a potential shift in financial strategies or operational activities that impacted the balance sheet differently than debt management.\n\nThis comparative analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between liabilities and debt, where strategic financial decisions can lead to divergent trends in these critical financial metrics."}

By 2020, this figure decreased to $2,977 million, and then increased again to $8,010 million in 2021. This fluctuation can be attributed to several factors within the shareholders' equity section, particularly the changes in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nFrom the detailed breakdown in the equity section, we observe the following key impacts:\n\n- **Net Income**: The net income, which directly contributes to retained earnings, was $6,759 million in 2019, dropped to $3,135 million in 2020, and then rose sharply to $8,060 million in 2021. This increase in net income in 2021 contributed to the higher comprehensive income for that year.\n\n- **Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income**: This includes components like net unrealized debt securities gains (losses), foreign currency translation adjustments, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits. These components show variability across the years, with notable losses in 2021, especially from foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n- **Share Repurchases and Dividends**: The repurchase of common shares and declaration of cash dividends reduced retained earnings each year, impacting the overall comprehensive income.\n\nBelow are the visual representations of these financial elements:\n\n![Shareholders' Equity Changes](image3)\n\n![Comprehensive Income Breakdown](image5)\n\nOverall, the interplay of these elements within the shareholders' equity section highlights how they collectively influenced the comprehensive income trends observed over the three-year period."}

In contrast, consumer loans decreased from $409,220 million in 2020 to $382,274 million in 2021.\n\n![Loan Figures](image5)\n\nThis shift suggests that the financial entity may be focusing more on commercial lending opportunities, possibly due to higher demand or perceived profitability in this sector. The decrease in consumer loans could indicate a strategic move away from consumer lending, potentially due to market conditions or risk assessments.\n\n### Deposit Changes\nTotal deposits saw an overall increase from $1,404,381 million in 2020 to $1,482,479 million in 2021, representing a 6% rise. However, there were notable decreases in certain deposit categories:\n\n- **Time deposits** decreased significantly by 41%, from $49,775 million in 2020 to $29,461 million in 2021.\n- **Interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices** also saw a substantial decline of 44%, from $35,157 million in 2020 to $19,783 million in 2021.\n\n![Deposit Figures](image1)\n\nThese reductions suggest that the financial entity might be managing its asset cap, likely by reducing reliance on less stable or more expensive funding sources like time deposits and foreign deposits. This aligns with the broader trend of increasing noninterest-bearing deposits, which rose by 13%.\n\n### Strategic Implications\nThe observed changes in loans and deposits indicate a strategic focus on strengthening liquidity and capital management. By increasing noninterest-bearing deposits and commercial loans while reducing time deposits and foreign deposits, the entity appears to be positioning itself for stability and growth in a changing economic landscape. This approach may help mitigate risks associated with volatile funding sources and capitalize on opportunities in the commercial sector."}

For Amberjack, the net income increased from $157 million in 2018 to $218 million in 2020. In contrast, Mars' net income decreased from $154 million in 2018 to $134 million in 2020.\n\n![Statements of Income for 2018](image2)\n\n![Statements of Income for 2019](image5)\n\nSeveral factors might have influenced these changes:\n\n1. **Total Revenues**: Both Amberjack and Mars experienced increases in total revenues over the period. Amberjack's revenues rose from $204 million in 2018 to $238 million in 2020, while Mars' revenues increased from $241 million in 2018 to $247 million in 2020. This increase in revenue could contribute to Amberjack's higher net income but might not fully explain Mars' decline.\n\n2. **Total Operating Expenses**: Operating expenses for Amberjack increased from $47 million in 2018 to $61 million in 2020, whereas Mars' operating expenses rose from $87 million in 2018 to $102 million in 2020. The higher increase in operating expenses for Mars compared to Amberjack might explain why Mars' net income decreased despite the increase in revenue.\n\n3. **Operating Income**: Amberjack's operating income increased from $157 million in 2018 to $177 million in 2020, while Mars' operating income decreased slightly from $154 million in 2018 to $145 million in 2020. This indicates that Amberjack managed to improve its operational efficiency more effectively than Mars.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net income for Amberjack and Mars can be attributed to differences in how they managed their revenues and operating expenses over the years. Amberjack's strategic management of expenses relative to its revenue growth likely contributed to its improved net income, whereas Mars' higher increase in operating expenses relative to its revenue growth led to a decrease in net income."}

In 2021, net investment income decreased from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million. This decline is primarily due to a significant reduction in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, marking a 44.4% decrease[2]. This sharp decline is explained by lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, influenced by low interest rates that prevailed through 2021[2].\n\n![Investment Income](image5)\n\nIn contrast, dividend income saw an increase from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, reflecting a 3.5% rise.

As of December 31, 2021, there was a noticeable increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills, rising from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021.

Additionally, equity securities increased from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, highlighting a continued focus on equity investments despite the challenges in fixed income.\n\nOverall, the decline in net investment income is a result of the reduced interest income, which was exacerbated by the prevailing low-interest-rate environment, while the asset allocations show a strategic shift towards more liquid and potentially stable investments."}

Specifically, the net operating income increased by $434 million, or 3%, rising from $14,869 million in 2019 to $15,303 million in 2020. However, the profit before tax decreased by $342 million, or 7%, falling from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020. These changes can be attributed to several factors, as detailed below:\n\n![Adjusted Results](image2)\n\n- **Net Operating Income Increase:** The rise in net operating income was primarily driven by strong performance in the Global Markets sector, where revenues increased significantly. For instance, the FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) segment saw a revenue increase of $1,541 million, or 33%, largely due to higher volatility levels and increased client activity[10]. Additionally, there were improvements in other areas like Foreign Exchange and Rates, which contributed to the overall growth in net operating income.\n\n![Management View of Adjusted Revenue](image1)\n\n- **Profit Before Tax Decrease:** Despite the increase in net operating income, the profit before tax declined due to a substantial rise in expected credit losses and other impairment charges. These charges increased by $1,056 million, or over 200%, from $(153) million in 2019 to $(1,209) million in 2020. This increase reflects the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic outlook, leading to higher provisions for credit losses[2].\n\nIn summary, while the GBM division managed to grow its net operating income through robust performance in key market segments, the increase in credit impairment charges significantly impacted the profit before tax, resulting in a decline despite the revenue growth."}

This turnaround can be attributed to increased earnings in both the United States ($7,319 million in 2021 vs. $(1,608) million in 2020) and International operations ($8,499 million in 2021 vs. $(825) million in 2020).\n\n![Upstream and Downstream Net Income](image5)\n\nSimilarly, the Downstream segment experienced a positive shift in 2021, with total net income reaching $2,914 million, up from a net income of $47 million in 2020. This improvement was driven by increased earnings in the United States ($2,389 million in 2021 vs. $(571) million in 2020) and relatively stable performance in International operations ($525 million in 2021 vs. $618 million in 2020).\n\n### Total Assets\n\nChevron's total assets also saw a slight decrease in 2021 compared to 2020.

This decline reflects a reduction in the overall profitability from investments, which could impact the company's ability to generate returns on its investment portfolio.\n\n![Investment Income Table](image2)\n\nSecondly, looking at the asset composition, the table below illustrates changes in various asset categories. Notably, there was an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. Additionally, equity securities rose from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021. Conversely, fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021.\n\n![Asset Composition Table](image1)\n\nThese changes suggest a strategic shift towards more liquid assets and equity securities, possibly aimed at enhancing liquidity and capitalizing on market opportunities. The increase in cash and cash equivalents might provide the company with greater flexibility to respond to market conditions or unforeseen financial needs. Meanwhile, the rise in equity securities indicates a focus on potentially higher-yielding investments, although they come with increased risk.\n\nOverall, the decrease in net investment income alongside the changes in asset composition highlights the need for careful financial management and strategic planning to optimize returns while managing risk effectively."}

To mitigate these risks, Nestlé employs several strategies, including implementing safety and security policies, maintaining business continuity plans, and ensuring compliance with local regulations and international standards[5]. This approach helps to minimize disruptions and maintain stable operations.\n\nNestlé's factory distribution across different regions plays a crucial role in managing supply chain risks. By having factories spread out globally, Nestlé can leverage regional strengths and diversify its supply sources, reducing dependency on any single location. Below are tables showing Nestlé's factory distribution in different regions:\n\n![Europe, Middle East, and North Africa](image5)\n\n![Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa](image1)\n\n![Americas](image3)\n\nThese tables illustrate how Nestlé's factories are strategically located across multiple countries within each region.

This fluctuation indicates a recovery in loan activity by the end of 2021, potentially reflecting economic conditions post-COVID-19 disruptions.\n\n![Card Member Loans](image4)\n\nIn contrast, the net interest income experienced a more significant decline over the same period.

The increase in average loans in 2021 suggests a rebound in consumer borrowing, which could positively impact future revenue streams. However, the lower net interest income indicates that the company might need to focus on strategies to enhance profitability from its lending activities, possibly through optimizing interest rates or expanding its customer base.

Below is a detailed analysis of each contribution and their respective impacts on the company's financial statements. \n\n### Share-Based Compensation Contribution\n\nShare-based compensation plays a crucial role in enhancing Accenture plc's shareholders' equity. According to the financial data, the share-based compensation expense for the year 2020 was $1,197,806. This amount is reflected in the increase in restricted share units by 1,118,284 and additional paid-in capital by $79,522, as shown in the table below:\n\n![Share-Based Compensation](image5)\n\nThis compensation strategy helps in retaining and motivating employees while also boosting the company's equity by recognizing the value of shares issued as part of employee compensation packages.\n\n### Cash Flows from Operating Activities Contribution\n\nOn the other hand, cash flows from operating activities significantly bolstered Accenture plc's cash position. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $7,672,624. This figure includes net income of $5,185,313, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and changes in working capital components like accounts receivable and accounts payable. The detailed breakdown can be seen in the table below:\n\n![Cash Flows from Operating Activities](image2)\n\nThese cash inflows from operating activities are essential for maintaining liquidity, funding ongoing operations, and supporting strategic investments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth share-based compensation and cash flows from operating activities are vital contributors to Accenture plc's financial health. While share-based compensation enhances shareholders' equity by recognizing the value of shares issued to employees, cash flows from operating activities ensure robust liquidity and support for the company's operational needs. Together, these factors strengthen Accenture plc's overall financial position for the year 2020."}

These changes can be attributed to various factors, including comprehensive income and cash flow activities.\n\n![Financial Statement](image3)\n\n### Assets and Liabilities Analysis\n- **Assets:** The decrease in total assets is largely due to reductions in cash and cash equivalents, particularly in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, which fell from $29,824 million in 2020 to $20,548 million in 2021. Additionally, investment securities saw a significant drop from $21,631 million to $2,591 million.\n- **Liabilities:** The slight decrease in total liabilities is mainly due to a reduction in long-term debt, which went from $42,952 million in 2020 to $38,675 million in 2021.\n\n### Comprehensive Income\nThe entity's comprehensive income, as shown in the financial statements, includes elements such as net unrealized gains or losses on debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.

As shown in the table below, the sale resulted in a reduction of $587.1 billion in the total WFAM assets under management for the year ending December 31, 2021. This event drastically reduced the balance of WFAM assets under management from $603.0 billion at the beginning of the period to $100.0 billion at the end of the period.\n\n![WFAM Assets Under Management](image5)\n\nThis sale was part of the company's strategic decision to divest certain assets, which influenced various aspects of its financial statements. The income statement for the same period reflects a notable increase in noninterest income, which can be attributed to the gains from the sale of WFAM and other assets. Specifically, the noninterest income rose to $10,036 million in 2021 from $4,916 million in 2020, marking a substantial increase of $5,120 million, or 104%.\n\n![Income Statement Summary](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the balance sheet data shows a decrease in total assets and total deposits.

For example, there was a decrease of $1,464 million in interest income from interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments from 2019 to 2020. Additionally, there were substantial decreases in interest income from time deposits and federal funds, as well as from debt securities and loans and leases.\n\n2. **Decrease in Interest Expense**: The interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other liabilities also decreased. For instance, the interest expense on U.S. interest-bearing deposits decreased by $5,245 million, and the interest expense on non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits decreased by $3,893 million.\n\nThese changes reflect broader economic conditions, such as lower interest rates, which affected both the income generated from earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.

However, the core net income remained stable at $14,094 million in 2021, indicating that adjustments had a significant impact in 2020 but not in 2021.\n\n### Basic EPS Comparison\n\n#### 2020\n- **IFRS Basic EPS:** $3.55\n- **Core Basic EPS:** $5.78\n\n#### 2021\n- **IFRS Basic EPS:** $10.71\n- **Core Basic EPS:** $6.29\n\nThe basic EPS under IFRS increased substantially from 2020 to 2021, while the core EPS decreased slightly. This suggests that the adjustments had a more pronounced effect on the core results in 2020.\n\n### Significant Adjustments\n\nThe most significant adjustments impacting these metrics include:\n\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets:** This consistently adds back substantial amounts to the core results, reflecting non-cash expenses.\n- **Impairments:** These adjustments can vary significantly year-over-year, affecting both net income and EPS calculations.\n- **Acquisition or Divestment of Businesses:** Changes in business structure can lead to major adjustments in financial results.\n\nFor instance, in 2020, amortization adjustments added $3,655 million to gross profit and $3,528 million to operating income, while impairments added $18 million and $619 million respectively. In 2021, similar adjustments were made, but their impact varied, particularly in terms of net income and EPS.\n\nBelow are the relevant tables for reference:\n\n![2020 Financial Data](image4)\n\n![2021 Financial Data](image3)\n\nThese adjustments highlight the importance of understanding both IFRS and core results to gain a comprehensive view of the company's financial health across different years."}

The following figures illustrate these impacts in detail.\n\n![Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows](image4)\n\nFrom the consolidated statement of cash flows, we can see that Chevron paid $7,896 million in cash dividends during 2021. This expenditure is categorized under financing activities and contributed to a net cash outflow of $23,113 million in that category. Such a large outflow from dividend payments indicates a significant strain on Chevron's liquidity.\n\n![Consolidated Statement of Equity](image3)\n\nOn the equity side, the consolidated statement of equity shows that Chevron issued $7,896 million in cash dividends, which reduced retained earnings by the same amount. Additionally, Chevron engaged in treasury stock transactions, purchasing $14,734 million worth of shares and issuing $2,456 million. These transactions resulted in a net reduction of treasury stock by $12,278 million, which affected the overall equity structure. The purchases and issuances of treasury shares are critical for managing the company's equity and share count, influencing shareholder value and earnings per share calculations.\n\nIn summary, while cash dividends directly impacted Chevron's cash reserves and liquidity, treasury stock transactions played a crucial role in shaping the company's equity structure. Both actions are strategic financial maneuvers that reflect Chevron's approach to balancing shareholder returns and capital management."}

Below is a detailed analysis of these impacts based on the provided figures and descriptions from the documents. \n\n### Lease Liabilities Impact\n\nThe transition to AASB 16 resulted in the recognition of substantial lease liabilities. As shown in the table below, the lease liabilities increased significantly from zero at the start of the period to $167,154 thousand by the end of the fiscal year 2020. This increase is primarily attributed to the recognition of lease liabilities under the new standard, which mandates the inclusion of lease payments as part of the company's liabilities.\n\n![Lease Liabilities Table](image2)\n\n### Employee Benefit Liabilities Impact\n\nSimilarly, the transition also affected employee benefit liabilities. The table below illustrates the changes in employee benefit liabilities between 2019 and 2020. There was a slight increase in total employee benefit liabilities from $4,054 thousand in 2019 to $4,092 thousand in 2020. This change reflects adjustments in the liabilities for annual leave and long-service leave, as well as non-current liabilities for long-service leave.\n\n![Employee Benefit Liabilities Table](image7)\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThe transition to AASB 16 also impacted how the company accounts for certain provisions and estimates related to leases and employee benefits. For instance, the company no longer recognizes provisions for operating leases deemed onerous, as shown in the following figure. Instead, payments due under these leases are now included in the lease liability.\n\n![Onerous Leases](image5)\n\nMoreover, the straight-lining prepaid rent account is now capitalized as part of the right-of-use asset upon transition, as depicted below. This change eliminates the need for recognizing provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives.\n\n![Straight-Lining Prepaid Rent](image1)\n\nThese transitions reflect a shift in accounting practices aimed at providing a more accurate representation of the company's financial commitments under the new leasing standards."}

This represents a decrease of $278 million. Despite this decline, operating activities still contributed positively to the cash balance.\n\n![Operating Activities](image2)\n\n### Investing Activities\nThe net cash used in investing activities was $1,216 million in 2020, which is a decrease from $1,913 million in 2019. This reduction in cash outflow improved the overall cash position by $697 million.\n\n![Investing Activities](image2)\n\n### Financing Activities\nThe net cash used in financing activities was $8,496 million in 2020, up from $8,061 million in 2019. This increase in cash outflow negatively impacted the cash balance by $435 million.\n\n![Financing Activities](image3)\n\n### Overall Impact on Cash Balance\nCombining these changes, we can see that while there was a decrease in cash from operating activities and an increase in cash outflows from financing activities, the significant reduction in cash used for investing activities helped offset some of these negative impacts. However, the overall effect resulted in a smaller increase in cash balance compared to the previous year.\n\n- **2019**: The cash balance increased by $245 million, going from $6,620 million to $6,865 million.\n- **2020**: The cash balance increased by $420 million, going from $6,865 million to $7,285 million.\n\n![Cash Balance](image3)\n\nThus, the combined effects of these activities led to a modest increase in the cash balance at the end of 2020, despite challenges in both operating and financing areas."}

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $2,005 million, which rose to $2,731 million in 2019, and further increased to $6,346 million in 2020. This upward trend can be attributed to several factors outlined in the financial data and textual descriptions provided.\n\nFirstly, the net earnings, which form a part of comprehensive income, showed an increase from $2,651 million in 2018 to $3,646 million in 2020[6]. This rise in net earnings directly contributed to the overall increase in comprehensive income.\n\nSecondly, the foreign currency translation adjustments played a crucial role. In 2018, these adjustments resulted in a loss of $632 million, which turned into a gain of $2,918 million in 2020[1]. This substantial improvement in foreign currency translation adjustments significantly boosted the comprehensive income.\n\nAdditionally, while there were losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments, these were relatively minor compared to the gains from foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nThe table below illustrates these changes:\n\n![Financial Data Table](image1)\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 was primarily driven by higher net earnings and a significant gain from foreign currency translation adjustments, despite some losses from pension and postretirement plans."}

These changes are summarized in the table below:\n\n![Defined Benefit Obligation Changes](image1)\n\n- **Discount Rate**: An increase in the discount rate led to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation by €242 million in 2021 compared to €227 million in 2020. Conversely, a decrease in the discount rate increased the obligation by €271 million in 2021 compared to €266 million in 2020.\n- **Compensation Increase**: An increase in compensation resulted in a slight rise in the obligation by €16 million in 2021, compared to €11 million in 2020. A decrease in compensation reduced the obligation by €15 million in 2021, compared to €10 million in 2020.\n- **Pension Progression**: An increase in pension progression raised the obligation by €158 million in both 2021 and 2020.

Let's break down the analysis step-by-step using the provided figures and textual descriptions.\n\nFirstly, we examine the changes in the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) as shown in Figure 1. The table details the initial balances, changes, and final balances of Credit Risk RWA, Market Risk RWA, and Operational Risk RWA for both 'Standardized' and 'Advanced' approaches.\n\n![Risk-Weighted Assets Table](image3)\n\nFrom the table, we see that:\n- Credit Risk RWA increased significantly, with a total change of $44,382 million (Standardized) and $56,003 million (Advanced).\n- Market Risk RWA also saw an increase, with a total change of $14,547 million (Standardized) and $14,443 million (Advanced).\n- Operational Risk RWA decreased by $7,791 million (Advanced).\n\nThese changes led to the final RWA balances at December 31, 2020, being $453,106 million (Standardized) and $445,151 million (Advanced).\n\nNext, we look at the External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets, as shown in Figure 2. The table indicates that the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% at December 31, 2019, to 47.7% at December 31, 2020.\n\n![External TLAC Table](image5)\n\nThe regulatory minimum for this ratio is set at 18.0%, while the required ratio is 21.5%. Despite the increase in the actual External TLAC in terms of absolute dollars ($216,129 million in 2020 compared to $196,888 million in 2019), the percentage relative to the increased RWA decreased slightly. This is because the growth in RWA outpaced the growth in External TLAC.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in various components of RWA, particularly the increases in Credit Risk RWA and Market Risk RWA, contributed to a higher overall RWA, which in turn affected the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, causing it to decrease slightly from 2019 to 2020."}

These changes can be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly affected consumer behavior and operational capacities in different regions.\n\n### Revenue Composition Changes\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the revenue composition of McDonald's shifted slightly. According to Figure 1, the U.S. segment maintained a dominant share of 50% in 2020, down from 54% in 2019. Meanwhile, the International Operated Markets segment saw a slight increase in its share, rising from 37% in 2019 to 41% in 2020.\n\n![Revenue Composition by Segment](image6)\n\n### Growth Rates\n\nFigure 2 provides insight into the growth rates of different market segments. The U.S. segment showed a flat growth rate of 0% in 2020 compared to 5% in 2019. Conversely, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a sharp decline, dropping from a 3% growth rate in 2019 to a (13)% decline in 2020.\n\n![Growth Rates by Segment](image1)\n\n### Influencing Factors\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes:\n\n1. **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic led to widespread lockdowns and restrictions on dine-in services, significantly impacting sales in the International Operated Markets[3]. Many countries in this segment faced severe disruptions in their operations, leading to substantial revenue declines.\n\n2. **Consumer Behavior Shifts**: With many consumers opting for home-cooked meals or delivery services during the pandemic, foot traffic at traditional dining locations decreased, affecting revenue generation in both U.S. and International markets.\n\n3. **Operational Adjustments**: McDonald's implemented various strategies to adapt to the new normal, such as enhancing digital ordering capabilities and focusing on drive-thru and delivery services. However, these adjustments could not fully offset the overall decline in revenue, especially in the International Operated Markets.\n\nOverall, while the U.S. segment managed to maintain its revenue share relatively stable, the International Operated Markets faced considerable challenges due to the broader economic and operational impacts of the pandemic."}

Additionally, there was a notable rise in share-based payments, which could be linked to the increased shareholding discussed earlier.\n\nTo further understand the implications of these changes, we consider the broader context of the company's financial performance:\n\n![Financial Data](image1)\n\nThe financial data shows a decline in EBIT and net profit after tax from FY19 to FY20, indicating challenging market conditions. Despite these challenges, S Fallscheer's increased shareholding and remuneration suggest a commitment to the company and possibly a strategy to align personal financial interests with the company's long-term success.\n\nIn conclusion, S Fallscheer's increased shareholding and remuneration from FY19 to FY20 reflect a strategic decision to invest more heavily in the company, despite the broader financial challenges faced. This move could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's future potential and a way to align personal financial interests with corporate growth objectives."}

Specifically, the total credit card production fell from $27,785 million in 2019 to $25,160 million in 2020, while home equity production dropped from $11,131 million in 2019 to $8,160 million in 2020.\n\nThese changes can be attributed to shifts in consumer behavior influenced by the economic conditions of 2020, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in credit card production suggests reduced consumer spending and borrowing, likely due to economic uncertainty and a shift towards saving rather than spending. Similarly, the decrease in home equity production indicates that fewer consumers were leveraging their home equity, possibly reflecting a cautious approach to taking on additional debt during uncertain times.\n\n![Credit Card and Home Equity Production](image4)\n\nOverall, these trends point to a more conservative financial stance among consumers in 2020, with a focus on managing existing debts and limiting new borrowings[5]."}

Specifically, the impacts on coal and nickel can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Impact of Coal Price Changes\nFrom Figure 1, we see that a US$1 per ton increase in the metallurgical coal price impacts profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million. Similarly, a US$1 per ton increase in the energy coal price impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million.\n\n![Impact of Commodity Price Changes](image1)\n\nThe report highlights that the underlying EBITDA for coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, primarily due to lower price impacts and reduced volumes[2]. This decline reflects the sensitivity of BHP's financial performance to fluctuations in coal prices.\n\n### Impact of Nickel Price Changes\nFigure 1 also shows that a US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million. The report notes that the underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, along with lower maintenance costs[1].\n\n### Key Drivers Behind These Impacts\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include:\n- **Price Sensitivity:** As seen in Figure 1, even small changes in commodity prices can lead to substantial financial impacts. This sensitivity is critical for understanding BHP's financial performance.\n- **Volume and Cost Factors:** The report indicates that lower volumes and increased costs contributed to the financial outcomes. For instance, Queensland Coal experienced increased costs per tonne and reduced sales volumes, while Nickel West benefited from higher volumes and lower costs.\n\nIn conclusion, BHP's financial results are highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, particularly coal and nickel. Understanding these sensitivities and the underlying drivers is essential for stakeholders assessing the company's financial health and strategic direction."}

Additionally, a smaller percentage of females (6%) returned to work and remained employed after 12 months compared to males (4%).\n\n![Parental Leave Table](image5)\n\nThis data highlights several key points about gender diversity policies in the workplace:\n- **Entitlement Disparity**: Despite fewer females being entitled to parental leave, they are more likely to take it up compared to their male counterparts. This could suggest a cultural or societal expectation for women to take on childcare responsibilities.\n- **Return Rates**: The slightly lower return rate for females indicates potential challenges in re-integrating into the workforce post-leave, possibly due to caregiving responsibilities or lack of flexible work options.\n- **Long-term Employment**: The fact that fewer females return to employment after 12 months might point to systemic issues in retaining female employees post-maternity leave, indicating areas where gender diversity policies need strengthening.\n\nOverall, while HDFC Bank provides parental leave, the actual usage and return patterns suggest that there is room for improvement in supporting female employees' career progression and retention post-leave."}

The pandemic significantly impacted the retail industry in 2020, leading to widespread store closures and restrictions on opening new stores[10]. This likely influenced the distribution of stores in 2021 as companies adjusted to the new normal. Additionally, Inditex's strategic decisions regarding store optimization and absorption played a role. For instance, Inditex absorbed between 1,000 and 1,200 stores during 2020 and 2021, focusing on integrating smaller stores into larger, more efficient ones[1]. These actions would have affected the geographical distribution of stores, particularly in regions where such optimizations were implemented.\n\nFurthermore, Inditex's active engagement in opening new stores in multiple markets in 2021 also contributed to the changes observed in 2022. The company opened stores in 40 markets, indicating a strategic expansion effort that would have altered the regional distribution of stores[4].\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in the geographical distribution of stores from 2021 to 2022 reflect both external challenges posed by the pandemic and internal strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing and expanding the company's retail footprint."}

This increase was primarily driven by a substantial rise in intangible assets, which increased from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020. Additionally, deferred income tax assets also saw an increase from DKK 4,121 million to DKK 5,865 million during the same period. These increases indicate a strategic investment in intellectual property and tax planning, which can provide long-term benefits to the company.\n\n![Non-current Assets](image5)\n\n### Increase in Total Equity\n\nThe total equity also increased significantly from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020. This growth in equity was mainly due to an increase in retained earnings, which rose from DKK 57,817 million in 2019 to DKK 63,774 million in 2020. Retained earnings are a crucial component of equity, representing profits reinvested in the company rather than distributed as dividends. This increase suggests improved profitability and reinvestment strategies.\n\n![Total Equity](image3)\n\n### Impact on Financial Position\n\nThese changes in non-current assets and total equity reflect a strengthening of the company's financial position. The increase in non-current assets, particularly intangible assets, indicates a focus on long-term growth and innovation. Meanwhile, the rise in total equity, driven by higher retained earnings, demonstrates improved profitability and financial stability. Together, these factors contribute to a robust financial foundation, enabling the company to better withstand economic challenges and pursue strategic opportunities.\n\nOverall, the company's financial position has been positively influenced by these changes, positioning it well for future growth and sustainability."}

Despite the decrease in 2020, the cumulative effect of cash generated from operating activities over the years contributed positively to the company's liquidity and ability to reinvest in its operations.\n\n![Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows](image5)\n\n### Changes in Retained Earnings\nThe retained earnings, which represent profits kept within the company rather than distributed as dividends, show a notable increase over the period. Starting at $43,352,000 in July 2018, they rose to $57,852,000 by June 2020.

This reduction can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Loss and Other Carryforwards:** Decreased from $1,030 in 2021 to $914 in 2022.\n- **Pension and Other Retiree Benefits:** Decreased significantly from $1,476 in 2021 to $740 in 2022.\n- **Capitalized Research & Development:** Increased from $358 in 2021 to $646 in 2022.\n- **Valuation Allowances:** Improved from $(569) in 2021 to $(409) in 2022.\n\n![Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities](image3)\n\n### Deferred Tax Liabilities\n\nThe total deferred tax liabilities increased to $9,288 in 2022 from $8,503 in 2021.

This shift suggests that the company may face higher future tax expenses, potentially affecting its profitability and cash flow. Additionally, the changes in specific categories like pension benefits and unrealized gains indicate strategic financial decisions or external economic influences impacting the company's tax planning and financial strategies.\n\nOverall, understanding these changes is crucial for stakeholders assessing the company's financial health and tax management strategies."}

This is evident from the data shown in Figure 1, which depicts the percentage of people with unfavorable views of China over time. The \"Phone: four-point scale\" shows a steady rise in unfavorable views, peaking at 67% in 2021. Meanwhile, the \"ATP: four-point scale\" indicates a sharp increase from 46% in 2018 to 76% in 2021. The \"ATP: feeling thermometer\" also shows a rise from 50% in 2017 to 67% in 2021.\n\n![Trends in Unfavorable Views of China](image1)\n\n### Political Affiliations\n\n#### Republicans/Leaning Republican\n\nAmong Republicans/Leaning Republican, there has been a substantial increase in the percentage of individuals who feel \"Very cold\" towards China. According to Figure 2, this percentage rose from 31% in 2018 to 62% in 2021. This indicates a growing negativity towards China within this political group.\n\n![Perceptions by Political Affiliation](image5)\n\n#### Democrats/Leaning Democrat\n\nSimilarly, among Democrats/Leaning Democrat, the percentage of individuals who feel \"Very cold\" towards China increased from 17% in 2018 to 38% in 2021. Although the increase is less dramatic compared to Republicans, it still signifies a notable shift towards colder sentiments.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\nFigure 3 provides a breakdown of sentiments into \"Very cold (0-24)\" and \"Somewhat cold (25-49)\" categories. It shows that while both political affiliations experienced an increase in cold sentiments, Republicans consistently exhibit higher levels of negativity compared to Democrats.\n\n![Cold Sentiments by Political Affiliation](image4)\n\nIn conclusion, the data clearly demonstrates that perceptions towards China have become more negative from 2018 to 2021, with Republicans showing a more pronounced increase in unfavorable views compared to Democrats.

The top graph shows BLEU scores for different language pairs as a function of training set size, comparing standard training (std) with pre-trained models (pre). The bottom graph highlights the gain in BLEU scores achieved by pre-training over standard training.\n\n![Figure 2](image2)\n\n- **Pt → En**: Pre-training consistently provides higher BLEU scores across all training set sizes, with the most significant gain observed at smaller training set sizes.\n- **Tr → En**: Similar to Pt → En, pre-training offers higher BLEU scores, with the gain decreasing as the training set size increases.\n- **Ru → En**: Pre-training shows a notable improvement, especially at smaller training set sizes, with the gain gradually decreasing as the training set size grows.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPre-training generally leads to improved BLEU scores for most language pairs, with the extent of improvement varying based on the specific language pair and the amount of training data.

The tree structure is traversed starting from the root node. At each level of the tree, the method retrieves the top nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This means that the retrieval process is hierarchical, moving from the top of the tree downwards, selecting nodes at each level that are most relevant to the query. Once the relevant nodes are identified, their context is combined with the query to generate an answer using a language model (LLM).\n\n![Tree Traversal Retrieval](image2)\n\n### Collapsed Tree Retrieval\n\nOn the other hand, Collapsed Tree Retrieval starts similarly with a query encoded into a vector. However, instead of traversing the tree hierarchically, this method collapses the entire tree into a single layer. This flattened structure allows for the retrieval of nodes based on cosine similarity until a threshold number of tokens is reached. The retrieved context from these nodes is then combined with the query to produce an answer using an LLM. This approach simplifies the retrieval process by treating all nodes equally, regardless of their position in the original tree structure.\n\n![Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image2)\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- **Traversal Method**: Tree Traversal follows a hierarchical path, selecting nodes level by level, while Collapsed Tree treats all nodes as part of a single layer.\n- **Node Selection**: Tree Traversal selects nodes based on their relevance at each level, whereas Collapsed Tree selects nodes based on a cumulative token threshold.\n- **Complexity**: Tree Traversal might be more complex due to its hierarchical nature, while Collapsed Tree simplifies the process by collapsing the structure.\n\nThese differences highlight the trade-offs between maintaining the hierarchical context of information versus simplifying the retrieval process for efficiency."}

These queries are essentially learned positional embeddings that guide the transformer decoder in generating accurate object predictions. Here's a detailed explanation of how object queries are utilized in the DETR architecture:\n\n### Object Queries in DETR\n\n1. **Transformer Decoder**: The transformer decoder in DETR uses a set of small, fixed number of learned positional embeddings known as object queries. These queries are initialized and refined throughout the training process to represent potential objects in the image.\n\n2. **Attention Mechanisms**: The decoder leverages self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms to process these object queries. Self-attention allows the model to reason about the relationships between different parts of the image, while encoder-decoder attention enables the decoder to attend to the relevant parts of the image features extracted by the encoder.\n\n3. **Prediction Heads**: For each object query, a shared feed-forward network (FFN) predicts either the class and bounding box of a detected object or classifies it as 'no object.' This process is illustrated in the following figure:\n\n![DETR Model Architecture](image3)\n\n### Visual Example\n\nThe figure below provides a visual representation of the DETR model's output, where object queries lead to the detection of birds in an image.

This means that the initial state of the model is influenced by the historical interactions of the user. The Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) then sequentially process the encoded news information from the clicked news articles (`c1`, `c2`, ..., `ck`). The candidate news (`cx`) is similarly processed through a News Encoder to obtain its vector representation (`ex`). The final score indicating the relevance of the candidate news to the user's interests is computed using a dot product operation between the user representation and the candidate news encoding.\n\n![LSTUR-ini Framework](image3)\n\n### LSTUR-con\nOn the other hand, the LSTUR-con method concatenates the user-level embedding (`us`) derived from the click history with a fixed user embedding (`ul`), forming a combined user vector (`u`). This concatenated vector is then processed using GRUs alongside the news encoders to handle the click history (`c1`, `c2`, ..., `ck`). Like in LSTUR-ini, the candidate news (`cx`) is encoded, and a dot product operation generates a score reflecting the fit of the news recommendation to the user's profile.\n\n![LSTUR-con Framework](image3)\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Initialization vs Concatenation**: LSTUR-ini initializes the user representation based on historical data, whereas LSTUR-con concatenates the historical data with a fixed user embedding.\n- **Processing Approach**: Both methods utilize GRUs and news encoders but differ in how they integrate the long-term and short-term user data.

It starts with a query, retrieves information, generates a response, judges the adequacy of the response, and repeats the cycle if necessary until a satisfactory response is generated or a predefined threshold is met.\n- **Focus**: This method aims to enrich the context progressively by leveraging the knowledge base at each iteration, ensuring that the generated responses become increasingly accurate and relevant.\n\n![Iterative Retrieval](image5)\n\n### Recursive Retrieval\n- **Process**: The Recursive Retrieval process involves refining the user query and breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems. It continuously solves these sub-problems through retrieval and generation, transforming and decomposing queries as needed.\n- **Focus**: By recursively refining and dividing the problem space, this method ensures that complex queries are handled effectively, leading to more precise and targeted information retrieval.\n\n![Recursive Retrieval](image5)\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval\n- **Process**: The Adaptive Retrieval process allows the RAG system to autonomously decide when external knowledge retrieval is required. It can judge the necessity of retrieval based on the query and the current context, and it can also determine when to stop the retrieval and generation cycles using special tokens.\n- **Focus**: This adaptive approach provides flexibility, enabling the system to optimize resource usage and response generation by dynamically adjusting to the demands of the query.\n\n![Adaptive Retrieval](image5)\n\nIn summary, while Iterative Retrieval focuses on enriching context through repeated cycles, Recursive Retrieval emphasizes breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-tasks, and Adaptive Retrieval offers dynamic decision-making for efficient retrieval and generation.

By analyzing the provided figures and descriptions, we can understand these effects in detail. \n\nIn Figure 1, we see that the F1 scores for different models vary greatly depending on whether they are evaluated in a 'Distractor' setting or an 'Open' setting. For instance, the Single-paragraph BERT* model achieves an F1 score of 67.08 in the 'Distractor' setting but drops to 38.40 in the 'Open' setting. Similarly, other models like BiDAF*, BiDAF, GRN, QFE, and DecompRC show a decrease in F1 scores when moving from the 'Distractor' to the 'Open' setting. This indicates that distractors play a crucial role in reducing model performance.\n\n![Figure 1](image3)\n\nFigure 2 further elaborates on this by showing the F1 scores for different settings, including 'Distractor,' 'Open-domain 10 Paragraphs,' 'Open-domain 500 Paragraphs,' and 'Open-domain 500 Paragraphs + Gold Paragraph.' The 'Distractor' setting achieves the highest F1 score of 67.08. However, when moving to the 'Open-domain 500 Paragraphs' setting, the F1 score drops to 39.12. Interestingly, adding a 'Gold Paragraph' to the 'Open-domain 500 Paragraphs' setting significantly boosts the F1 score to 53.12. This suggests that while distractors negatively impact performance, the inclusion of relevant gold paragraphs can mitigate these effects and improve model accuracy.\n\n![Figure 2](image5)\n\nThe implications of these findings are profound for the development and evaluation of multi-hop question answering models.

It uses language processing models (LLMs) to understand the problem and formulate it with rules, facts, and queries. For instance, consider the problem of determining which vehicle is the oldest among three given options. The Problem Formulator would interpret the problem and represent it symbolically, including the relevant facts about each vehicle's age.\n\n![Problem Formulator](image5)\n\n### Symbolic Reasoner\nOnce the problem is formulated symbolically, the Symbolic Reasoner applies logical inference to derive a solution. Depending on the nature of the problem, different reasoning methods are used:\n- **Logic Programming**: For problems involving rules and logical entailments.\n- **First-order Logic Prover**: For problems requiring logical deductions.\n- **Constraint Optimization**: For problems with constraints that need to be satisfied.\n\nIn the case of the vehicle problem, the Symbolic Reasoner might use constraint optimization to compare the ages of the vehicles and determine the oldest one.\n\n### Result Interpreter\nFinally, the Result Interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into a comprehensible natural language response. This module ensures that the output is understandable and directly answers the original problem.

This property makes mirrors useful for various applications, including personal grooming, scientific instruments, and decorative purposes.\n\nWater also acts as a reflecting surface, especially when it is calm and still. The surface of a lake or a pond can create a mirror-like reflection of the surroundings, allowing light to bounce back and form clear images of objects above the water.\n\n![Reflection Diagram](image5)\n\nIn the diagram above, the principle of reflection is illustrated with two green arrows representing light rays.

These principles help us understand how we perceive objects as part of a greater whole. Here's a detailed breakdown of how each principle is applied in the design of 'GESTALT':\n\n1. **Segregação (Segregation)**: The letter 'G' is shown with a space, suggesting separation or distinct objects. This principle highlights how we perceive elements that are separated from each other as distinct entities.\n\n2. **Fechamento (Closure)**: The 'G' and 'E' together make us perceive a closed shape or form, even though part of it is missing. This principle explains our tendency to fill in gaps and perceive incomplete figures as complete.\n\n3. **Proximidade (Proximity)**: The letter 'E' is depicted as a series of small rectangles grouped closely together, suggesting unity. This principle indicates that objects close to each other are perceived as a single unit.\n\n4. **Continuidade (Continuity)**: The 'S' follows a continuous contour line, suggesting a smooth flow or pathway. This principle emphasizes our preference for perceiving elements as part of a continuous line or path.\n\n5. **Semelhança (Similarity)**: The letters 'T' and 'A' share a similar striped pattern, indicating that we group them together based on visual similarity. This principle states that elements with similar characteristics are perceived as part of the same group.\n\n6. **Pregnância (Prägnanz)**: The simplicity and clarity of the 'A' suggest that our perception tends towards seeing the simplest form. This principle asserts that simpler interpretations are preferred over complex ones.\n\n7. **Unidade (Unity)**: The consistent use of patterns and colors across the entire word suggests that all parts belong together, creating a unified whole. This principle underscores the importance of cohesion and integration in visual perception.\n\n![GESTALT Design](image1)\n\nBy applying these principles, the design of 'GESTALT' effectively demonstrates how Gestalt psychology influences our perception of visual elements, making the word appear as a cohesive and meaningful whole.[9][7][8]"}

According to the pie charts in figure 1, the percentage of time spent 'with family and friends' decreased from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010. Conversely, the time spent on 'fitness' increased from 5% in 2005 to 17% in 2010. Other activities such as 'watching films' saw slight increases, while 'reading' remained constant at 10%. These changes indicate a shift in priorities and possibly lifestyle trends among people during these years.\n\n![Weekend Activities](image1)\n\nSimultaneously, looking at the trends in banana exports as depicted in figure 2, we observe that Ecuador consistently led in banana exports throughout the period from 1994 to 2005. The overall export volumes for Ecuador show a general upward trend, peaking around 2005. Other notable exporters like the Philippines and Costa Rica also maintained strong export volumes, contributing significantly to the global market.\n\n![Banana Exports](image3)\n\nThe correlation between these two datasets might not be direct, but they reflect broader socio-economic trends. For instance, the increase in fitness-related activities could be linked to rising health consciousness, which might also influence dietary choices, including the consumption of fruits like bananas. Additionally, the economic stability and growth reflected in the banana export figures could suggest improved living standards, allowing more leisure time for activities like watching films and spending time with family.\n\nOverall, while the direct relationship between weekend activities and banana exports may not be evident, both datasets provide insights into the changing lifestyles and economic conditions during the observed period."}

This results in the formation of haploid cells at the end of telophase I. In contrast, meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, similar to mitosis, but occurring in haploid cells. This process is depicted in the following figures: ![Meiosis II Stages](image3) ![Meiosis II Process](image4) Figure 2 highlights the separation of sister chromatids and the formation of haploid daughter cells during meiosis II. The cleavage furrow indicates the beginning of cell division, and the separation of chromatids leads to the formation of four genetically distinct haploid cells. Together, these stages ensure genetic diversity in offspring through the production of gametes."}

These steps ensure the production of two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. Below is a detailed explanation of each step along with supporting figures and textual descriptions from the provided documents. \n\n1. **DNA Replication**: In this initial stage, the single circular chromosome of the prokaryotic cell duplicates itself. This duplication ensures that each new cell will receive a complete copy of the genetic material. The process is depicted in the following figure, which shows the bacterial DNA being replicated within the cell. \n\n![DNA Replication](image2)\n\n2. **Cell Elongation**: After DNA replication, the cell begins to elongate. This growth is necessary to accommodate the duplicated genetic material and to prepare for the physical separation of the cell into two parts. The elongation process is illustrated in the diagram below, which shows the cell extending in length while the genetic material remains centrally located. \n\n![Cell Elongation](image3)\n\n3. **Cell Division**: The final step involves the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells. During this phase, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint, eventually separating the cell into two independent units. Each daughter cell receives one copy of the duplicated DNA, ensuring genetic continuity. The process of cell division is visually represented in the following figure, which demonstrates the formation of two distinct cells from a single parent cell through binary fission. \n\n![Cell Division](image4)\n\nThese three stages collectively constitute the binary fission process in prokaryotic cells, allowing for rapid reproduction and genetic stability in these organisms[10]."}

For instance, while the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, the utility diminishes to -10 by the sixth hot dog, indicating that each additional hot dog brings less satisfaction than the previous one.\n\n![Standard Consumption Utility](image4)\n\nHowever, in a competitive context, such as a hot dog eating contest, the dynamics change significantly. The table below shows that while the utility initially decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, there is a dramatic spike in utility at the 64th hot dog. This spike occurs because consuming the 64th hot dog allows the individual to tie a competitor for a championship title in 2007, which results in a substantial increase in utility (+5000). This illustrates how competitive contexts can introduce significant variations in utility outcomes compared to standard consumption scenarios.\n\n![Competitive Context Utility](image5)\n\nThus, while standard consumption typically exhibits a straightforward pattern of diminishing marginal utility, competitive contexts can introduce unique incentives that alter the utility curve, leading to unexpected spikes in satisfaction or performance."}

It is primarily divided into two major stages: Interphase and the Mitotic Phase (M). \n\n### Interphase\nThis stage is further subdivided into three phases:\n- **G₁ Phase (First Gap Phase):** During this phase, the cell grows and performs normal functions. It is a period of active growth and preparation for DNA synthesis.\n- **S Phase (Synthesis Phase):** In this phase, DNA replication occurs, ensuring that each new cell will have a complete set of genetic material.\n- **G₂ Phase (Second Gap Phase):** The cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis. This phase involves the production of proteins necessary for cell division.\n\n### Mitotic Phase (M)\nThis phase includes two key processes:\n- **Mitosis:** This is the division of the cell's nucleus into two identical nuclei. It ensures that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the genetic material.\n- **Cytokinesis:** This is the division of the cytoplasm, which results in the formation of two separate daughter cells.\n\nThe cell cycle is depicted in a circular format to illustrate its cyclical nature, with arrows indicating the progression from one phase to the next.\n\n![Cell Cycle Diagram](image1)\n\nThis diagram provides a visual representation of the cell cycle, highlighting the different phases and their sequential order.
