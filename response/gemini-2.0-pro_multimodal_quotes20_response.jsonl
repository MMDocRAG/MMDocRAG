About half of STEM workers believe this is a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented [3].\n     -   This view is particularly strong among black STEM workers (73%) and is also held by about half of Hispanics (53%), Asians (52%), and whites (50%) in STEM jobs [11].\n*    **Discrimination**:\n    *   **Perceived Discrimination**: There is significant disagreement across racial and ethnic groups regarding how much discrimination contributes to these disparities [4]. Among STEM workers, 72% of blacks believe that discrimination in recruiting, hiring, and promotions is a major reason for the underrepresentation, compared to only 27% of whites and 28% of Asians [4].\n *   **Workplace Experiences**: Black STEM workers are especially likely to report experiencing discrimination at work due to their race or ethnicity [2]. 62% of blacks in STEM report such experiences, compared to 44% of Asians, 42% of Hispanics, and only 13% of whites [2].\n\n* **Major reasons**:\n    *    Major reasons for underrepresentation include limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and lack of encouragement from an early age [5].\n\n![Major reason more women are not in STEM jobs](image5)\n\nIn summary, the major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs, according to the Pew Research Center, are a lack of early encouragement, limited access to quality education, and discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions.\n"}

This state is updated by incorporating the encoded user utterance and the encoding of the previous system output. The dialogue state tracker then estimates the user's goal, represented by slot-value pairs, and maintains a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot [10].\n\n3.  **KB Query**: Based on the dialogue state tracking output, a query command is formulated and issued to a knowledge base (KB) to retrieve relevant information [3]. The query is generated by replacing tokens in a query command template with the best hypothesis for each goal slot [7].\n![KB query generation](image6)\n\n4.  **Policy Network**: The policy network selects the next system action. It takes three inputs: the dialogue-level LSTM state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results summary [12].\n![Policy network inputs](image1)\n\n5.  **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: Finally, the emitted system action is used to produce a system response in natural language format. This is achieved by combining the state tracker outputs and the retrieved KB entities. The system uses a template-based NLG, where delexicalised tokens in the template are replaced by values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities, depending on the emitted system action [6].\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's utterance, tracking the dialogue state, querying a knowledge base, selecting a system action via a policy network, and generating natural language output using a template-based NLG.\n"}

The majority of Novo Nordisk's sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. [3].\n    For 2020, exchange rate adjustments resulted in a negative impact of DKK 1,689 million on other comprehensive income. ![image3](image3)\n*   **Cash Flow Hedges:** To mitigate risks, Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities. [5]. Cash flow hedges contributed positively, with an adjustment of DKK 1,713 million in 2020. [7]\n*   **Overall Impact on Reserves**:\nThe combined effect of exchange rate adjustments and cash flow hedges, along with tax and other items, led to a total reserve at 31 December 2020 of DKK (911) million.\n    ![image7](image7)\n\n*   **Derivative Financial Instruments:** Novo Nordisk uses financial instruments which had a substantial impact, with forward contracts for cash flow hedges having a positive fair value of DKK 1,849 million and a negative fair value of DKK 47 million at year-end.

The system supports both image-image and image-text k-NN searches.\n\nTo enhance retrieval speed, especially with large datasets, indexing using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is employed [7]. This reduces the dimensionality of vectors, making the index more condensed and the retrieval process faster [7].\n\nFor object detection tasks, additional pre-processing steps, such as cropping and blurring, are applied to the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates [4].\n![Pre-processing for Object Detection](image3)\nThese steps help in resizing the cropped regions and directing the MLLMs' focus towards the relevant objects by blurring non-target areas [4].\n\nFollowing retrieval, the retrieved category labels, along with image embeddings, are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt [2].\n![Retrieving and Ranking](image1)\nThe MLLMs combine internal knowledge with retrieved information to make a final prediction of the image category [2].

This paradigm is designed to leverage the strengths of both SLMs and LLMs, particularly in scenarios where data samples are limited [5, 7]. The method converts few-shot IE tasks into multiple-choice questions, allowing LLMs to focus on sample-level decisions, which has been shown to be more effective [2, 5].\n![An example of MCQ prompts for LLMs](image5)\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, the filter-then-rerank method has shown consistent improvements across various datasets and settings [9, 11]. A key aspect of this approach is its ability to significantly enhance performance on \"hard\" samples—those that SLMs struggle with [7, 10]. This is illustrated by the substantial gains in F1 scores when LLMs are used to rerank a small fraction of samples identified as difficult by the SLMs [11].\n![Performance comparison before and after LLM reranking](image1)\n\n![Micro-F1 scores by confidence score](image2)\nFor example, only 0.5% to 10% of samples are reranked by LLM and it brings 10%~25% absolute F1 gains [11].\nThe performance improvement is quantified by an average F1 gain of 2.4% without SLM ensemble and 2.1% with SLM ensemble, confirming the effectiveness of LLM reranking [9].\n![Data of average time cost for different methods](image3)\n![Data of average financial cost for different methods](image4)\n\nMoreover, detailed experiments reveal that this method not only improves performance but also maintains efficiency in terms of time and cost [4].

This process continues un- til the output obtains an acceptable quality or a pre-specified number of iterations is reached. Self-Refine  (Madaan et al., 2023) introduced an effective framework using one LLM guided by varied prompts for the roles of generation, critic, and refinement, respectively.  Clinical Self- Verification  (Gero et al., 2023) applies this to extract clinical data, refining by spotting missing elements and verifying data accuracy.  Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) extends the method, adding a ‘‘long-term memory’’ to recall past errors and integrating diverse feedback forms.\n[5] Though beneficial in many text-generation tasks, self-correction usually demands powerful, large-scale LLMs for effectiveness, which sacri- fices efficiency. As observed by Madaan et al. (2023), smaller models often falter in refining, even with correct feedback. A possible solution involves explicitly training models for this self- correction process.  SelFee  (Ye et al., 2023) pro- poses training a model to emulate the self-correction process by generating output, feedback, and a re- fined solution in an auto-regressive manner. They use more powerful LLMs to provide feedback and refinement data, with data collection facili- tated through ChatGPT.\n\n6\n"}

Image 4 shows an extremely low conversion rate of 1.50%, while image 7 indicates a much higher range of 45% to 75%.\n\nThe Lead Funnel Progression [12] shows how many leads are coverting into next stage.\n\nThe difference has significant implications. A 1.5% MQL to SAL conversion rate suggests a severe bottleneck in the sales process. It implies that almost all leads qualified by marketing are rejected or not pursued by sales. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1.  **Poor Lead Quality:** Marketing might be qualifying leads that don't truly fit the ideal customer profile or aren't sales-ready.\n2.  **Lack of Sales and Marketing Alignment:** There might be disagreement or misunderstanding between marketing and sales regarding what constitutes a qualified lead.\n3.  **Insufficient Sales Capacity/Follow-up:** Sales might be overwhelmed, unable to follow up on the leads provided, or lack the resources to properly engage them.\n4. Lead Scoring ranks a prospector lead's level of interest and sales readiness according to a pre- determined scoring methodology [10].\n\nThe 45-75% range, on the other hand, suggests a much healthier process. It means a significant portion of marketing-qualified leads is deemed valuable by sales, indicating good alignment and lead quality.\n\nIn conclusion, the MQL to SAL conversion rates differ significantly across the datasets, ranging from 1.5% to a range of 45%-75%, indicating vastly different levels of sales and marketing effectiveness.\n"}

These issues are categorized by different symptoms, each with potential causes and solutions.\n\nFirst, there can problems of the dishwasher doesn't start, including a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker, the power supply not being turned on, low water pressure, or the door not being properly closed.  Another set of problems involves water not being pumped from the dishwasher. This can include a twisted or trapped drain hose, a clogged filter, or a clogged kitchen sink [6].\n![image6](image6)\nSud in the tub is another problem, it can be sovled by using only the special dishwahser detergent to aviod suds [6].\n![image6](image6)\nMoreover, issues such as a stained tub interior, white film on the inside surface, rust stains on cutlery, knocking or rattling noises within the dishwasher or water pipes, and unclean dishes encompass a range of causes, from spilled rinse-aid and hard water minerals to improper loading or program selection [7].\n![image7](image7)\nAdditionally, the problem of the dishes not drying can be caused by selecting the wrong program or using cutlery with a low-quality coating [8].\n![image8](image8)\nThe problem of the dishes are not clean can be encounter for several problems: Not enough detergent was dispensed, Items are blocking the movement of the spray arms,and the filter is not clean[3].\n![image3](image3)\n\nIn summary, there can be identified at least **20** possible problems based on the provided troubleshooting information.\n"}
