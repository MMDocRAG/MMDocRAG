This partisan divide is further highlighted by the fact that Latino Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to identify \"people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist\" as a major concern for the country [10].  In fact, $75\\%$ of Latino Democrats hold this view, compared to only $36\\%$ of Latino Republicans [10].  This difference in perception extends to personal experiences, as larger proportions of Latino Democrats and independents report having personally encountered racial discrimination compared to Republicans [9].\n\nIn conclusion, Latino Democrats are significantly more inclined to believe that the failure to recognize existing racial discrimination is a greater problem, while Latino Republicans are more concerned about the misperception of racial discrimination."}

In contrast, regarding Trump's election, a smaller percentage of voters, 51%, felt hopeful, and a larger percentage, 53%, felt uneasy, as depicted in the emotional reactions to Trump's election.  ![Emotions voters felt about Donald Trump's election include hopeful, proud, uneasy, sad, scared and angry.](image2) This shift indicates a move towards more mixed and potentially negative sentiments in 2016 compared to the predominantly positive reactions in 2008.\n\nFurthermore, the general happiness with the election outcome was also slightly lower in 2016 compared to Obama's first election in 2008.  While happiness levels in 2016 (50%) were similar to 2012 (52%), they were less positive than in 2008 when 58% of voters were happy with Obama's election [5, 6]. This is visually represented in the trend of happiness with election outcomes over time. ![Voter happiness with presidential election results from Clinton in 1996 to Trump in 2016 shows a slight decrease over time.](image3) This suggests a gradual decrease in overall voter satisfaction with presidential election outcomes over these years.\n\nMoreover, the 2016 presidential campaign itself was perceived as more negative and less focused on issues than past elections [7, 9]. This negativity likely contributed to the emotional responses observed after the election. Adding to the emotional complexity, surprise was a significant reaction to Trump's victory across the electorate. A substantial 73% of all voters expressed surprise at the outcome, with Clinton voters being particularly surprised (87%) [10].  Even among Trump voters, a majority (60%) were surprised by his win. This widespread surprise is further illustrated in the percentages of voters surprised by Trump's victory. ![Percentage of voters surprised by Trump's victory in 2016, broken down by all voters, Trump voters, and Clinton voters, reveals that a majority of all groups were surprised.](image4)\n\nIn terms of specific emotions after Trump's victory, beyond hope (51%), a considerable portion of voters reported feeling uneasy (53%), sad (41%), or scared (41%) [2, image2].  When examining the emotional divide between voter groups, the disparity is stark.  A large majority of Clinton voters reported negative emotions such as unease (90%), sadness (77%), and fear (76%), while a dominant percentage of Trump voters felt hopeful (96%) and proud (74%). ![Comparison of emotions between Trump and Clinton voters, with Clinton voters predominantly feeling negative emotions and Trump voters predominantly feeling positive emotions.](image5) This polarization of emotions highlights the deep divisions present in the electorate following the 2016 election.\n\nIn conclusion, voter reactions in the 2016 election were marked by increased negativity and polarization compared to prior elections, with unease, alongside hope and pride, being prominent emotions, particularly varying greatly between Trump and Clinton supporters."}

This is visually supported in `![Line graph showing quarterly unemployment rate for Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations, with Hispanic rate consistently higher and more volatile, especially during and after recessions.](image5)`, which illustrates the Hispanic unemployment rate fluctuating more significantly and consistently staying above the non-Hispanic rate. Text quote [2] further emphasizes that \"U.S. Latino unemployment rate is declining, but remains above its 2006 low,\" indicating a recovery but not a full return to pre-recession economic health for Hispanics.\n\nIn terms of economic perceptions, quote [9] states that \"Hispanics remain upbeat about national economic conditions,\" with a higher percentage viewing current conditions as \"good or excellent\" compared to whites.  Furthermore, \"one-third of Hispanics (34%) say U.S. economic conditions will be better in the coming year, a share about twice as high as seen among other groups of Americans.\" This optimism, however, contrasts with personal financial ratings as depicted in `![Line graph comparing percentage of general public and Hispanic rating their personal finances as good or excellent, showing Hispanics consistently lower.](image1)`. This image reveals that despite overall economic optimism, Hispanics consistently rate their *personal* finances as \"good\" or \"excellent\" at a lower rate than the general public across the years from 2004 to 2015.  Moreover, quote [4] highlights disparities *within* the Hispanic community itself, noting that \"Latinos with some college experience or more (56%) and U.S.-born Latinos (50%) were most likely to say their personal financial situation is either excellent or good,\" while those \"with less than a high school education and immigrant Latinos\" reported much lower positive financial ratings.\n\nThese trends in unemployment and potentially divergent economic perceptions contribute to income and wealth disparities.  Text quote [3] points out that \"median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession,\" remaining essentially unchanged at  $42,491 in 2014.  This stagnation is visually represented in `![Line charts comparing median household income, poverty rate, and median net worth for Hispanic and all households, showing lower income and wealth, and higher poverty for Hispanics.](image2)`, where the Hispanic median household income line is consistently below that of all households.  Quote [3] further notes that \"the Hispanic poverty rate – 23.6% in 2014 –... remains above pre-recession levels,\" and Hispanic households experienced \"the largest percentage decline in their net worth through 2009 of any major racial or ethnic group,\" with net worth continuing to fall even after the recession, unlike white households.  Image2 graphically illustrates the higher poverty rate and significantly lower median net worth for Hispanic households compared to all households.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hispanic unemployment has improved and there's optimism about the national economy, Hispanics still face higher unemployment rates than non-Hispanics, lower personal financial ratings, stagnated income, higher poverty rates, and significant wealth disparities, indicating persistent economic challenges and vulnerabilities despite overall progress."}

Men are more inclined to perceive negativity, while women lean towards positivity or balance in online interactions [4]. For example, a larger percentage of men (29%) report frequently seeing mean or bullying content compared to women (19%) [4]. This is further supported by the observation that men are somewhat more likely to witness bullying and deceptive behavior on social media [8].  Men are also about twice as likely as women to report seeing people being deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%) [10].\n\n![Men are more likely than women to perceive bullying and deception on social media, while women are more likely to perceive kindness or support.](image2)\n\nDespite these differences in perception of negative behaviors, both men and women largely agree that they see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behaviors, as indicated by 52% of men and 56% of women reporting this [4].  However, when it comes to deception and misinformation, a greater percentage of women (67%) than men (58%) perceive an equal mix of deceptive attempts and efforts to correct misinformation [10].  This suggests that while men might be more sensitive to outright negative behaviors like bullying and deception, women may have a more nuanced view of the information landscape, perceiving a balance between misinformation and correction attempts.\n\nThese differing perceptions could influence how social media platforms tailor content. If men are more likely to perceive negative behaviors such as bullying and deception, platforms might consider algorithms that prioritize content moderation and positivity for male users, or at least be mindful of the potentially higher sensitivity of male users to negative content. Conversely, while women also see negative content, their slightly higher inclination to perceive kindness and support, and their nuanced view of misinformation correction, might suggest a different content preference or at least a different tolerance level for certain types of content.  Social media platforms utilize user data to deliver targeted content [2], and understanding these gender-based perception differences can refine how platforms tailor recommendations and advertisements to better resonate with different user demographics.\n\nIn conclusion, men and women exhibit notable differences in their perceptions of social media content and behavior, particularly regarding negativity and deception, which has implications for how social media platforms can tailor content to user preferences based on gender."}

Furthermore, the US bubble is positioned higher on the Y-axis, indicating a higher motor vehicle penetration rate compared to China, although it seems comparable to or slightly higher than Germany in terms of vehicle ownership per capita. China's bubble is smaller and positioned much lower on the Y-axis, showing lower total CO2 emissions and significantly lower motor vehicle ownership per capita compared to both the USA and Germany.  Germany, while having a smaller bubble than the US, has a motor vehicle penetration rate that appears close to the US, suggesting a potentially more efficient emission profile relative to vehicle ownership.\n\nThe transportation sector is a significant contributor to these emissions, accounting for a substantial portion of CO2 emissions in industrialized economies [4].  Globally, around 20% of CO2 emissions come from transportation [4]. This sector is also a major environmental source of carcinogens [8], with traffic pollution contributing to annual deaths [10].  The higher vehicle ownership and potentially higher per capita emissions in the USA compared to China and possibly Germany, as suggested by the bubble chart, imply a greater environmental impact from transportation in the US.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA exhibits higher total CO2 emissions and high motor vehicle ownership per capita compared to China and Germany, indicating a potentially larger environmental impact related to transportation and overall energy consumption."}

One key factor is the shift in user behavior towards data-based services.  People are increasingly using data-based Instant Messaging (IM) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which leads to less usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [1]. This reduced usage of SMS and voice services directly contributes to a reduced ARPU [9].\n\nAdditionally, market dynamics play a role. Price wars, sometimes initiated by government policies, can initially reduce the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) [3].  Competition from CDMA operators also pushed GSM operators to lower their tariffs, further impacting ARPU [2].\n\nLooking at the image quotes,  ![Line chart showing Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data ARPU trends from 2013 to 2017.](image1) image1 shows the trend of Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data ARPU from 2013 to 2017.  As depicted, Voice and SMS ARPU show a declining or flattening trend from 2013 to 2014, while Mobile Data ARPU shows a slight decrease between 2013 and 2014 before starting to pick up.\n\nThis trend aligns with text quote [7] which states, \"Voice ARP U will continue to flatten in the medium term. SMS ARP U will continue to decrease... Data ARp U will fall in short term, but will pickup later... Continued trend of declining ARP U until 2015 where data users will start to enroll for bigger data plans... and compensate the declining voice and SMs ARP U.\"  This suggests that while overall ARPU might have continued to decline from 2013 to 2014 due to voice and SMS, there was an anticipation of data ARPU picking up later as data consumption increased.\n\nWhile the provided quotes don't give specific subscriber numbers for Telkomsel for 2013 and 2014, image5 provides subscriber and data user numbers for late 2014 across different operators.  ![Bar chart showing subscribers, smartphone users, blackberry users and data users for different telecom operators in late 2014.](image5) This image indicates a substantial subscriber base for Telkomsel and a significant number of data users in late 2014.  Considering the overall trend of smartphone adoption and increasing data usage described in the text quotes, it's plausible that Telkomsel's subscriber base continued to grow from 2013 to 2014, especially in the data user segment, even if overall ARPU was under pressure due to declining voice and SMS revenues.\n\nIn conclusion, Telkomsel likely experienced a decline or flattening in overall ARPU from 2013 to 2014, primarily driven by reduced voice and SMS usage and price competition, while their subscriber base likely continued to grow, especially in data users, due to increasing smartphone adoption and mobile internet usage."}

Looking at user statistics, we can observe an increase in smartphone users for both companies.  For Telkomsel, the number of smartphone users grew from 24 million to 35.4 million, and for XL, it increased from 13.6 million to 15 million between these periods.  ![Smartphone users increased for Telkomsel and XL between approximately 2013 and 2014.](image4)\n\nThis growth in smartphone adoption likely influenced the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).  As indicated, Voice and SMS ARPU are expected to decrease, while Data ARPU is anticipated to initially fall before rising as data consumption increases [2].  This is further supported by the observation that increased usage of data-based services like IM and VoIP leads to reduced usage of traditional SMS and voice calls [4], subsequently reducing overall ARPU [5].  ![Voice and SMS ARPU are decreasing while mobile data ARPU is increasing.](image2)\n\nInitially, reduced ARPU was attributed to government-initiated price wars [9]. However, as tariffs reached a rock-bottom level, the price war was expected to cease [10].  Despite the end of price wars, the shift in user behavior towards data consumption and away from voice and SMS, driven by increased smartphone penetration, appears to be the more significant factor influencing ARPU trends between 2013 and 2014.\n\nIn conclusion, between 2013 and 2014, both Telkomsel and XL experienced an increase in smartphone users, while their ARPU trends were likely influenced by a shift towards data consumption and away from traditional voice and SMS services, despite the cessation of price wars."}

To assess the information flow, metrics  $S_{wp}$ and $S_{pq}$ are used, where $S_{wp}$ measures the flow from text to label words and $S_{pq}$ from label words to target positions [5].\n\nIn shallow layers, the information flow from the text part to label words ($S_{wp}$) is high, while the flow from label words to the target position ($S_{pq}$) is low [8].  This is visually confirmed in the provided figures, where the blue line ($S_{wp}$) is higher than the orange line ($S_{pq}$) in the initial layers.\n\n```markdown\n![In shallow layers, Swp is higher than Spq, showing more information flow from text to label words.](image1)\n```\n\nHowever, in deeper layers, the significance shifts. $S_{pq}$ becomes dominant, indicating that information extraction from label words for prediction becomes more important [6, 8].

To answer this, we need to examine the provided quotes for evidence regarding the dominance of $S_{pq}$ (information flow from label words to the target position) across different layers.\n\nText quote [1] states, \"Initially, $S_{wp}$ occupies a significant proportion, but it gradually decays over layers, while $S_{pq}$ becomes the dominant one.\" This indicates that $S_{pq}$ is not dominant initially (in shallow layers) but becomes dominant later (in deeper layers).\n\nText quote [5] further clarifies, \"is prominent, while $S_{pq}$ (the information flow from label words to targeted positions) is less significant. However, in deeper layers, $S_{pq}$ dominates.\" This explicitly states that $S_{pq}$ is not dominant in shallow layers.\n\nText quote [6] also supports this: \"(1) in shallow layers, $S_{pq}$, the significance of the information flow from label words to targeted positions, is low, while $S_{wp}$, the information flow from the text part to label words is high; (2) in deep layers, $S_{pq}$, the importance of information flow from label words to the targeted position becomes the dominant one.\"  This again contrasts the dominance of $S_{pq}$ in shallow versus deep layers.\n\nImage3, described in text quote [1] as Figure 3, visually represents the relative sizes of $S_{wp}$, $S_{pq}$, and $S_{ww}$ across layers.  The image shows that in the initial layers (left side of the x-axis), $S_{wp}$ (blue line) is higher than $S_{pq}$ (orange line). As layers progress to deeper layers (right side of the x-axis), $S_{pq}$ becomes dominant, overtaking $S_{wp}$.\nSimilarly, Image4, described as Figure 4, also illustrates the same trend.\n\nBased on these quotes, it is clear that the information flow from label words to the target position ($S_{pq}$) does *not* dominate in all layers. It is initially less significant in shallow layers and becomes dominant in deeper layers.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the provided information, the information flow from label words to the target position, denoted as  $S_{pq}$ , does not dominate in all layers. In shallow layers, $S_{pq}$ is low, while $S_{wp}$ (information flow from text to label words) is high [6].

Specifically, in shallow layers, $S_{wp}$ is prominent and $S_{pq}$ is less significant, while in deeper layers, $S_{pq}$ dominates [5].

Unlike many datasets that feature a narrow range of entity categories and often rely on simplistic question types, SnapNTell is designed to evaluate a model's ability to recognize entities and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of them [2].\n\nThe dataset is meticulously curated to include a diverse set of entity names spanning 22 categories that reflect the breadth of real-world entities, encompassing both common and less common entities as illustrated in the categories like landmark, painting, sculpture, food, and animals ![Table showing the 22 categories included in the SnapNTell dataset and the corresponding number of entities for each category](image1). This wide range of fine-grained entities, each accompanied by representative images, is a key characteristic of SnapNTell [4].

However, it also notes that models struggle to rely solely on parametric knowledge for complex claims, achieving scores only slightly above random guessing [4].  In contrast, `ProgramFC` shows increasing effectiveness as reasoning depth increases, outperforming baselines by a larger margin on 4-hop claims compared to 2-hop claims [10].

Specifically, when knowledge is removed from the provided knowledge graph, citation precision and recall experience a drastic drop, while the impact on correctness is minimal [2]. This indicates that the absence of necessary knowledge poses a significant challenge for models to generate answers with high-quality citations [2].\n\nTo further illustrate this point, consider the experimental results on \"Conscious Incompetence.\" As depicted in the figure, with an increasing number of knowledge elements removed, precision and F1-Score exhibit an upward trend, while recall remains relatively stable ![Precision and F1-Score increase while recall is stable as knowledge is removed in Conscious Incompetence experiment](image3). This trend suggests that when knowledge is absent, Large Language Models (LLMs) can more accurately identify and flag this absence, thus improving precision and F1-Score in locating absent knowledge [5]. This highlights the increasing importance of the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting as the coverage of the knowledge graph deteriorates [5].\n\nHowever, when considering retrieval accuracy, a different perspective emerges. As retrieval accuracy decreases, all metrics, including precision and recall, show a downward trend. Notably, recall is more significantly affected by poor retrieval quality than precision ![Metrics decrease with decreasing retrieval accuracy in retrieval analysis](image5). This suggests that while models have some ability to filter out incorrect knowledge, mitigating the impact on precision, the reduction in recall is almost linear with decreasing retrieval accuracy [10].  The most substantial drop in recall occurs between perfect knowledge retrieval (ground truth) and a retrieval accuracy of 80% [10].\n\nIn conclusion, removing knowledge from the knowledge graph leads to a decrease in citation precision and recall, but within the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting, models can partially compensate for absent knowledge by identifying and flagging its absence, improving precision and F1-Score in those specific scenarios; however, overall, the models' ability to generate high-quality attributed texts is heavily reliant on the retrieval accuracy and coverage of the provided knowledge."}

For instance, directly adding logic leads to significant improvements on MAVEN-ERE, as evidenced in experiments [3].\n\n![The table shows that for various models like RoBERTa, Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna and Llama2, using 'CoT w. logical constraints' generally results in higher Micro-F1 scores and lower LI (Logical Inconsistency) scores on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets compared to 'vanilla ICL' and 'vanilla ICL w. CoT'.](image1)\n\nFurthermore, increasing the number of demonstration examples generally leads to performance improvements, but the inclusion of logical constraints offers stable enhancements, often outperforming scenarios with more demonstrations but without logical constraints [7].  This suggests that providing models with \"How\" (logical constraints) is as important as \"What\" (demonstrations) [7].\n\n![The bar chart on the left compares Micro-F1 scores for MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank (CTB) with and without logical constraints (lc) across different numbers of demonstration samples (1, 5, 10, 20).

Retrieval-based approaches to incorporate logical constraints into LLM instructions significantly reduce logical inconsistency and improve performance on tasks like event relation extraction [8]. Post-processing, on the other hand, guarantees the absence of logical conflicts, achieving 0% Logical Inconsistency (LI), but it may negatively impact the quality of the generated content [8].  This is because the semantics of the post-processed answer might deviate from the ground truth due to random selection, and the size of the candidate set affects performance [8].\n\nThe effectiveness of these methods can be observed across different LLM models and datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank.  For instance, examining the performance of models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2, we can see how logical inconsistency varies with different approaches.\n\n![Table showing LI(%) for different models and methods on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank.](image1)\n\nAs shown in the table, across all models and for both MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets, the \"w. post-processing\" method consistently achieves 0% LI. This confirms that post-processing is effective in eliminating logical inconsistencies. However, the Micro-F1 scores, which represent the quality of generation, are generally lower for post-processing compared to methods using logical constraints, suggesting a trade-off between logical consistency and generation quality.\n\nFurther evidence is provided by comparing Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT with and without post-processing.\n\n![Table comparing logical constraints and post-processing for Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT.](image3)\n\nThis table reinforces that post-processing drives LI down to 0% for both models and datasets. In contrast, using logical constraints, especially with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, offers a balance, reducing LI significantly while maintaining a higher Micro-F1 score, as seen in the results for \"CoT w. logical constraints\".\n\nMoreover, when considering Chain-of-Thought with logical constraints specifically, different base LLMs exhibit varying levels of logical inconsistency.\n\n![Table showing LI(%) for CoT with logical constraints for different models.](image4)\n\nThis table illustrates that even when employing Chain-of-Thought reasoning enhanced with logical constraints, models like RoBERTa-Large, Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 still present different degrees of logical inconsistency, although generally lower than baseline methods without explicit logical guidance.\n\nIn conclusion, while post-processing is highly effective at eliminating logical inconsistencies by reducing LI to 0%, it may sacrifice generation quality. Logical constraints offer a more balanced approach, substantially reducing logical inconsistency and often maintaining better generation quality, although not completely eliminating inconsistencies like post-processing."}

Corpora that maintain paragraph structure, like Common Crawl, tend to perform better than datasets with individual sentences, such as News Crawl, especially on sentence pair tasks like RTE [4, 5]. For instance, on RTE, Common Crawl outperforms News Crawl by a substantial margin, achieving a 14-point accuracy difference with 4.5B tokens [5].

This improvement is not uniform across all language pairs; it is significantly influenced by the linguistic similarity between the source and target languages [3].  For example, translation pairs with higher similarity, such as Galician to Portuguese (GL/PT), exhibit more substantial gains from pre-training compared to less similar pairs like Belarusian to Russian (BE/RU) [3, 6].\n\n![Table showing BLEU score improvements with pre-training are larger for more similar language families.](image1)\n\nAs shown in the table, language pairs like ES-PT and FR-PT, which belong to closely related language families, demonstrate higher BLEU score improvements with pre-training compared to pairs like RU-PT and HE-PT, which are from more distant families or have no common family. This observation supports the hypothesis that semantic neighborhoods are more similar in linguistically similar languages, leading to greater benefits from pre-training [10].  Furthermore,  pre-training helps in creating a more consistent embedding space where semantically similar words are closer together, which is especially beneficial when translating between similar languages [10].\n\n![Table showing the effect of pre-training and alignment on multilingual translation BLEU scores.](image3)\n\nInterestingly, while a priori alignment of embeddings may not be strictly necessary for bilingual translation, it becomes helpful in multilingual training scenarios [4].  This is because in multilingual systems with shared encoders, aligning word embeddings from different languages into similar vector spaces allows the model to learn more effectively, as if it were trained on a single language [3].\n\n![Graph illustrating BLEU score improvements from pre-training across different training set sizes.](image5)\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings is also tied to the size of the training dataset. Pre-training is most effective when there is a limited amount of training data, but not so little that the system struggles to train at all [4, 9].  As depicted in the figure, the gain in BLEU score from pre-training is highest at a moderate training set size and tends to decrease as the training set size increases. This suggests that pre-training provides the most substantial boost when data scarcity is a limiting factor, helping to overcome the challenges of low-resource scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training enhances translation accuracy, with the extent of improvement being modulated by both the degree of language similarity between the translation pair and the size of the training dataset, proving most beneficial for similar language pairs with limited training data."}

This table shows that for language pairs like GL->EN and PT->EN, aligned embeddings result in a slightly lower BLEU score compared to unaligned embeddings. However, in multilingual systems, aligning word embeddings becomes advantageous, leading to improved translation quality. This is because alignment in multilingual scenarios helps the model learn more effectively by projecting embeddings into a shared semantic space [7], which is empirically supported by ![Table 5 showing that alignment increases BLEU scores for multilingual translation](image3).

In masked settings, coreference resolution systems are not applied; however, performance is often stronger because coreferred mentions are already labeled with the same identifier, simplifying entity recognition [2]. This is because in masked versions, each entity is consistently referred to by the same unique surface form, which aids in linking mentions [2].\n\n```markdown\n![In masked settings, entities are consistently referred to by the same unique surface form.](image1)\n```\n![In masked settings, entities are consistently referred to by the same unique surface form.](image1)\n\nHowever, in unmasked settings, mentions of the same entity can vary (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\"), potentially making coreference resolution more challenging and less effective if the coreference system doesn't capture all variations [2].  Interestingly, ablating coreference links (COREF) shows that they play a marginal role, possibly because simpler methods like exact matching (MATCH) already capture easier coreference cases. Moreover, sophisticated coreference systems might not be reliable enough to provide a significant advantage [6].  As shown in the ablation studies, removing coreference edges does not drastically reduce performance, and in some cases, performance even degrades with the inclusion of coreference on the test set, suggesting that test documents might pose difficulties for coreference systems [6].\n\n```markdown\n![Table showing performance of Entity-GCN models with and without coreference.](image4)\n```\n![Table showing performance of Entity-GCN models with and without coreference.](image4)\n\nAs demonstrated in Table 5, comparing \"Entity-GCN with coreference\" and \"Entity-GCN without coreference,\" the difference in performance on the development set for both unmasked and masked settings is not substantial.

This is further supported by the observation that removing R-GCN from GloVe ('GloVe w/o R-GCN') leads to a further decrease in accuracy, highlighting the importance of the R-GCN component for performance [6]. The overall superior performance of the 'full (ensemble)' model suggests it effectively leverages graph structures and relation types, unlike simpler models like 'GloVe with R-GCN' which may rely more on surface-level features [4, 8].\n\n![This table shows the performance of different models, including full ensemble, in terms of accuracy in masked and unmasked tests.](image3)\n\nWhile the tables do not directly break down relation-based accuracy for 'full (ensemble)' and 'GloVe with R-GCN' models specifically, Table 4  in text quote [9] and  Image2 indicate that question types related to places like 'place\\_of\\_birth' and 'place\\_of\\_death' are generally harder, achieving lower accuracy compared to relations like 'member\\_of\\_political\\_party' or 'record\\_label'.

This is possibly because datasets D3 and D4 have unbalanced label distributions, and sentiment information might not be adequately captured by GloVe embeddings alone [7].\n\nVarying the percentage of document-level training examples also reveals performance trends.  ![Graphs showing accuracy and Macro-F1 score changes with varying percentages of document-level training examples.](image3) Figure 1 demonstrates that accuracy improvements are consistent across all datasets as the percentage of document-level training examples increases [5]. For macro-F1 scores, datasets D1 and D2 show stable improvements, whereas D3 and D4 exhibit sharp increases in macro-F1 scores when the percentage rises from 0 to 0.4 [5]. This sharp increase in D3 and D4 could be related to their extremely small number of neutral examples in the test sets, making them more sensitive to even small prediction differences [2].\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of LSTM and embedding layers significantly enhances model performance, especially for datasets with imbalanced classes, and increasing document-level training data generally improves accuracy and macro-F1, with notable sharp improvements in macro-F1 for datasets with limited neutral examples."}

Using adversarial distractors during training can improve model robustness. When trained on original distractors and evaluated on adversarial distractors, the F1 score drops significantly, but retraining on adversarial distractors recovers accuracy [9]. This is further supported by the data in Table 4, where models trained on adversarial distractors show improved F1 scores when evaluated on adversarial datasets, and even maintain higher accuracy when type filtering is applied during evaluation ![Table 4 shows F1 scores for models trained and evaluated on original and adversarial distractors, with and without type filtering.](image4).\n\nFurthermore, the choice of evaluation setting, such as using distractors versus open-domain evaluation, also impacts F1 scores.  Single-paragraph BERT achieves a higher F1 score in a distractor setting compared to an open-domain setting, indicating retrieval challenges in open-domain question answering [5].  Table 1 illustrates this, showing Single-paragraph BERT* achieving 67.08 F1 on Distractor F1 but only 38.40 F1 on Open F1 ![Table 1 compares Distractor F1 and Open F1 scores for various models, including Single-paragraph BERT*.](image1).  Even increasing the number of distractor paragraphs in open-domain evaluation does not fully bridge this gap, as shown in Table 2, where increasing paragraphs from 10 to 500 in open-domain setting only slightly improves F1, and adding gold paragraphs drastically increases the F1 score [5] ![Table 2 shows F1 scores for different open-domain settings with varying numbers of paragraphs and the inclusion of gold paragraphs.](image2).  This highlights the importance of effective retrieval methods, especially for multi-hop questions in open-domain scenarios [5].  The difficulty of distractor selection is also emphasized, as even with 500 distractors, performance doesn't reach the level achieved with fewer, more carefully chosen distractors [4].\n\nIn conclusion, both the training data, particularly the use of adversarial distractors, and the evaluation strategy, such as distractor-based versus open-domain evaluation, and the quality of distractors, play a crucial role in determining the F1 scores in question answering tasks for both multi-hop and single-hop questions."}

Different backoff variations have different sensitivities, with the neutral backoff variant having the lowest sensitivity because it returns a fixed neutral word when the ScRNN predicts UNK [4, 7].\n\n![Table 5 shows the WER of different backoff strategies for closed and open vocabulary models under swap, drop, add, and key attacks.](image2)\n\nTable 5 illustrates the Word Error Rates (WER) for closed vocabulary (word-only) and open vocabulary (char/word+char/word-piece) models under different backoff strategies (Pass-Through, Background, Neutral) across various attack types (Swap, Drop, Add, Key, All) [image2]. For open vocabulary models, the pass-through version is more sensitive than the background variant because it passes words as is, and each combination is considered unique. However, for word-only models, pass-through is less sensitive because out-of-vocabulary (OOV) character combinations are treated identically [8]. Ideally, a defense mechanism should have both low sensitivity and low WER, but in practice, achieving a low error rate can increase sensitivity [10].

The company's primary business involves distributing and selling both beverage and food/snack products [2].  Image4 provides a detailed breakdown of net revenue and operating profit for each division over the specified period.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the net revenue changes.\n![Net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020.](image4)\n\nFrom image4, we can observe that most divisions experienced net revenue growth from 2018 to 2020. For instance, FLNA, PBNA, and Europe divisions all show increasing net revenue over the years.  However, LatAm's net revenue decreased from 2018 to 2020.\n\nNow, let's consider the operating profit.\n![Net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020.](image4)\n\nImage4 shows a mixed trend in operating profit. FLNA and Europe divisions show an increase in operating profit from 2018 to 2020. QFNA and APAC also show increase in operating profit from 2018 to 2020, although QFNA's is less significant.  However, PBNA, LatAm, and AMESA divisions experienced a decrease in operating profit from 2018 to 2020.  In 2020, operating profit generally increased due to net revenue growth and productivity savings, but this was partially offset by operating cost increases [6, 9].\n\nTo understand how these changes might relate to the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, let's look at image3, which shows the approximate percentage of net revenue generated by beverages and food/snacks for each division.\n![Percentage of net revenue from beverage and food/snack businesses for each division across years.](image3)\n\nImage3 indicates that FLNA and QFNA are primarily focused on food and snack businesses, while PBNA is more heavily weighted towards beverages. LatAm, AMESA and APAC also have a significant portion of revenue from food/snacks, while Europe is more balanced.\n\nConsidering these distributions along with the profit trends, we can see some potential connections. FLNA and Europe, which showed operating profit increases, have a strong or balanced presence in the food/snack category.  PBNA, with a beverage-heavy focus, experienced an operating profit decrease despite net revenue growth. This might suggest that in the period from 2018 to 2020, the food and snack business might have been more profitable or resilient compared to the beverage business, or faced different cost pressures. It's also important to note that operating profit performance is influenced by various factors beyond just revenue and product category, including operating costs, productivity savings, and other charges [6, 9].\n\nThe changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 reflect a complex interplay of factors, potentially including the different performance of beverage versus food/snack categories in various regions, and the impact of operating costs and savings."}

Conversely, cash outflows from investing activities also saw a substantial increase, rising by €12,228 million to €14,140 million in 2021 [6].

However, it's also important to note that non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased, partially offsetting the gains from operational improvements [9, 10]. In 2018, restructuring actions, including employee termination expenses and asset impairments, negatively impacted the financial results [7], which would have contributed to the comprehensive loss in that year.\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders at Tesla evolved from a significant loss in 2018 and 2019 to a substantial profit in 2020, primarily due to a turnaround in net income and a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment, alongside operational improvements, although stock-based compensation increases and prior restructuring costs also played a part in these financial results."}

The change in accounting allocation in 2020, moving treasury related revenues and expenses from Corporate Centre to global businesses, likely influenced these results, making the Corporate Centre's profit increase potentially linked to re-categorization rather than purely organic growth, and contributing to revenue changes in Global Banking and Markets. The Corporate Centre's positive change in profit metrics contrasts with the mixed revenue performance within Global Banking and Markets, where strong growth in Global Markets was partially offset by a decline in Global Banking revenue."}

As markets recovered, revenue surged, directly impacting Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nConversely, the Theme Parks segment also showed a change in Adjusted EBITDA between 2020 and 2021, though it was a negative change.\n\n![Theme Parks Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 to 2021](image3)\n\nCapital expenditures in Theme Parks were intentionally reduced in 2021 as a direct response to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, which likely impacted park operations and visitor numbers [8]. However, operations of theme parks did contribute to partially offsetting decreases from changes in operating assets and liabilities [5], implying some level of recovery or ongoing activity despite reduced capital spending.\n\nFor the Sky segment, Adjusted EBITDA also experienced a change from 2020 to 2021.\n\n![Sky Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 to 2021](image4)\n\nExpenses within the Sky segment decreased in 2021, mainly due to reduced costs in programming, although this was partially offset by increased sporting events and new costs related to Sky Glass and XClass TV [4, 7].  The launch of new products like Sky Glass televisions also contributed to revenue increases in 2021 [6], but associated costs might have influenced the Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nOverall, at a consolidated level, comparing net income attributable to Comcast Corporation with Adjusted EBITDA shows the impact of various financial items.\n\n![Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation](image5)\n\nIn summary, the Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Corporation's segments showed mixed performance from 2019 to 2021, largely influenced by the fluctuating impacts of COVID-19 and strategic operational adjustments.  While Comcast Spectacor saw a recovery-driven increase, Theme Parks faced challenges, and Sky navigated expense adjustments and new product investments, all impacting their respective Adjusted EBITDA figures."}

The company explicitly states that these declines were \"primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities\" and that \"short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020.

However, the dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020 reduced unappropriated net income by €856 million [3].

The balance sheet data for total assets might reflect this shift, although the provided quotes do not directly link the WFAM sale to a specific change in total assets on the balance sheet.\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, eliminated WFAM assets under management and generated a one-time gain, positively impacting noninterest income in 2021, but it would also lead to a decrease in future asset-based fees."}

In contrast, the core net income was lower at USD 14,094 million, and the basic EPS was USD 6.29. ![In 2021, core Net Income and EPS were lower than IFRS Net Income and EPS.](image1)\n\nThe most significant adjustment impacting these metrics appears to be \"Income from associated companies\". In 2021, the adjustment for income from associated companies was a substantial USD 15,339 million. This large positive adjustment suggests that IFRS results in 2021 included a significant income from associated companies that was excluded or adjusted in core results, leading to a lower core net income compared to IFRS.\n\nIn 2020, while still present, the adjustment from income from associated companies was much smaller at USD 673 million. This smaller adjustment, combined with other typical core adjustments like amortization of intangibles and impairments, resulted in core results being higher than IFRS in 2020.\n\nThe shift in the impact of adjustments, particularly the dramatic increase in the \"Income from associated companies\" adjustment in 2021, is the most significant factor explaining the reversal in the relationship between IFRS and core net income and basic EPS between these two years.\n\nIn summary, core net income and basic EPS were higher than IFRS in 2020, but lower in 2021, primarily due to a large \"Income from associated companies\" adjustment in 2021."}

For September 30, 2021, an increase of half a percentage point in the discount rate would decrease the defined benefit obligation by €242 million, while a decrease of half a percentage point would increase it by €271 million. For compensation increase, an increase of half a percentage point would increase the obligation by €16 million, and a decrease would reduce it by €15 million.

In fiscal year 2021, total actuarial losses amounted to €22 million, while in 2020, there were actuarial gains of €67 million.

In 2019, the International Operated Markets constituted 54% of the revenue, whereas the U.S. accounted for 37% of the revenue. However, in 2020, these proportions changed to 50% and 41% respectively, indicating a relative increase in the U.S. segment's contribution and a decrease in the International Operated Markets' share of the total revenue. ![Pie charts showing revenue composition shift from International Operated Markets to U.S.](image4)\n\nThis shift in revenue composition is further explained by the changes in sales and revenue growth rates between the two segments.  In 2020, total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues decreased by 17% in the International Operated Markets segment, significantly impacting overall performance [3]. This decline is attributed to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations due to COVID-19, particularly in key European markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3].  The comparable sales in the International Operated segment also decreased by 15.0% in 2020, reflecting negative comparable sales in most markets due to COVID-19 [4]. ![Table showing comparable sales decrease in International Operated Markets in 2020.](image2)\n\nConversely, while the U.S. segment also experienced a decrease in total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues by 2% in 2020, and comparable sales growth was only slightly positive at 0.4% [1, Image3, Image2], it demonstrated more resilience compared to the International Operated Markets.  The text mentions positive sales performance in the U.S. [1]. This comparatively better performance in the U.S., even with the overall revenue decline, led to an increase in its proportional contribution to the total revenue, as seen in the shift in revenue composition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a major factor influencing these changes, causing sales declines in the International Operated Markets due to restaurant closures and operational limitations [1, 3, 5].  McDonald's also invested in strategic marketing and promotional activities in the U.S., including \"Thank You Meals\" for first responders, which aimed to accelerate recovery and drive growth [1, 2]. These support measures and the differential impact of the pandemic across geographies contributed to the observed changes in revenue composition and growth rates between the U.S. and International Operated Markets segments.\n\nIn conclusion, the shift in revenue composition and growth rates from 2019 to 2020 indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic had a more severe negative impact on McDonald's International Operated Markets segment compared to the U.S., leading to a larger revenue decline and a decreased share of total revenue for the international segment, while the U.S. segment showed more resilience despite facing its own challenges."}

General and administrative expenses, which include significant R\\&D investments, have increased, as the company continues to invest in research and development to enhance its competitive advantages [3].  R\\&D expenses alone were RMB 1,159 million, RMB 1,667 million, and RMB 2,339 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively [1].\n\n![Operating expenses breakdown from 2019 to 2021.](image3)\n\nSelling and marketing expenses have also grown, but the company states they are actively managing these costs by improving external promotion channel efficiency and internal traffic utilization [5]. Despite the increase in absolute expenses, these changes indicate a company actively investing in R\\&D for future growth and efficiency in marketing, while facing increasing service and operational costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the cost structure and operating expenses increased from 2019 to 2021, suggesting a phase of investment in research and development and business expansion, alongside efforts to manage marketing expenses and service costs."}

For credit cards, the portfolio saw a significant decrease.  Specifically, outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased by $\\S18.9$ billion in 2020 to $\\Updownarrow78.7$ billion [4]. This reduction was attributed to lower retail spending and increased payments from consumers [4].  This is further supported by the decrease in credit card purchase volumes from $\\S277.852$ billion in 2019 to $\\S251.599$ billion in 2020, as shown in the image.\n\n![Credit card purchase volumes decreased from 2019 to 2020.](image2)\n\nFurthermore, text quote [6] mentions that total credit card purchase volumes declined $\\Updownarrow26.3$ billion to $\\S251.6$ billion, reinforcing the image data. This decline is linked to the impact of COVID-19, which lowered spending, especially in travel and entertainment, although overall spending improved in the latter half of 2020 [6].\n\nTurning to home equity, there was also a decrease in this area. Home equity production in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation decreased by $\\S3.0$ billion in 2020 [5].  This was primarily driven by a decline in applications [5].  The outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio also decreased by $\\S5.9$ billion in 2020, mainly because paydowns were greater than new originations and draws [9].  The image below further illustrates the decrease in home equity balances for both Consumer Banking and the total corporation.\n\n![Home equity balances decreased in both Consumer Banking and total from 2019 to 2020.](image4)\n\nThese changes suggest a shift in consumer behavior during 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in credit card spending and increased payments indicate that consumers were potentially more cautious with their spending and prioritized debt reduction amidst economic uncertainty.  Similarly, the decline in home equity production and portfolio balances suggests that consumers were less inclined to take on new home equity loans, possibly due to financial caution or an anticipation of economic instability.\n\nIn conclusion, both total credit card and home equity metrics decreased between 2019 and 2020, indicating that consumers reduced spending, paid down debts, and were less inclined to take on new loans, likely driven by economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic."}

This overall increase is detailed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity [2, 5].

The capital increase in March 2021 also led to an increase in **issued capital** by €53 million [6, 9].  The total **issued capital** increased by €128 million from €1,000 million to €1,128 million over the period [5]. This increase reflects the issuance of new ordinary registered shares [4, 7].\n\n**Retained earnings** also experienced a notable positive change, increasing by €1,559 million. This growth is supported by the net income generated during the period, although it was partially offset by dividend distributions [9, 5].

In the U.S., income before tax increased substantially due to higher upstream realizations and downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs that had impacted 2020 results [4].  Specifically, U.S. upstream earnings rose because of higher realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, increased sales volumes, and gains from asset sales [9].  U.S. downstream earnings also improved, driven by higher margins on refined product sales, increased earnings from CPChem, and greater sales volumes [8].\n\nInternationally, upstream earnings saw a significant increase primarily due to higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments, write-offs, and severance charges. These gains were partially offset by higher tax charges, the absence of 2020 asset sales gains, increased depreciation expenses, and lower sales volumes [6]. However, international downstream earnings decreased because of reduced margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses, although this was partially mitigated by favorable foreign currency effects [10].\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income significantly improved from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by higher realizations in upstream operations, improved downstream margins, and the absence of significant impairments and write-offs that had affected the prior year.

This suggests that while parental leave is formally available to both genders, cultural or societal factors might influence men's uptake of leave to a lesser extent than women's.\n\nHDFC Bank is actively implementing gender diversity policies, aiming to foster an inclusive work environment. They have set a target to increase women's representation in the workforce to 25% by FY25, focusing on talent acquisition and retention through initiatives like \"Careers 2.0\" for women re-entering the workforce [6].  Furthermore, the bank is addressing unconscious biases through campaigns like ‘Uncovering Unconscious Biases’ and the #Intentional Inclusion video series to ensure a more equitable workplace for all genders and other diverse groups [9].\n\nTo support women in managing their careers alongside personal commitments, HDFC Bank offers flexible work arrangements and part-time options [10]. They are also prioritizing female hiring and developing leadership programs like the Career Accelerator Programme and ‘Shrishti’ to create a level playing field for women in leadership roles [10].\n\nWhile these policies indicate a strong commitment to gender diversity and inclusion, the parental leave data suggests that deeply ingrained societal norms regarding childcare responsibilities might still play a role.  Despite the availability of leave for men, its lower utilization could reflect prevailing societal expectations about primary caregiving roles.\n\nIn conclusion, HDFC Bank demonstrates a commitment to gender diversity through various policies and initiatives aimed at creating an inclusive environment and increasing women's representation; however, parental leave usage data indicates a potential gap between policy availability and practical uptake, particularly among male employees, possibly influenced by broader societal gender norms."}

A significant contributor was the decrease in gross margin within core merchandise categories [1], particularly in fresh foods [5, 6]. This was further compounded by a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge due to higher merchandise costs [1, 5]. Increases in $2\\%$ rewards programs also negatively impacted the gross margin [1, 5].  Furthermore, broader economic factors such as inflation impacted merchandise costs, which in turn affected gross margins [3].\n\nWhile warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly gasoline, showed positive impacts on gross margin [1, 5], and the ceasing of incremental COVID-19 wages provided some benefit [1], these positive impacts were not enough to offset the negative factors. In essence, the decrease in gross margin percentage across segments was primarily driven by reductions in core merchandise categories, alongside other negative influences like LIFO charges and increased rewards, despite some offsetting gains from ancillary businesses and reduced COVID-related wages [1].\n\nIn conclusion, the gross margin percentage decreased from 2020 to 2022 due to factors such as decreased gross margin in core merchandise categories, LIFO charges, increased rewards, and inflationary pressures on merchandise costs."}

In 1870, the county's population was a mere 130, but it exploded to 8,267 by 1880 and reached its peak of 14,096 in 1890 [5, Image3].  This rapid growth was significantly influenced by congressional acts like the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state and encouraged westward emigration [9].\n\n![Table showing Hamilton County population from 1870 to 2000, indicating a peak in 1890 and subsequent fluctuations.](image3)\n\nThe Homestead Act, in particular, provided pioneers with 160 acres of land, attracting a \"great tide of emigration\" to Nebraska [9].

While some rural communities in Hamilton County experienced population peaks between 1900 and 1940, typical of Midwest small towns, many faced challenges maintaining their populations as farm consolidation continued [3, 2]. The shift towards larger-scale, mechanized farming, as noted by historian Bertha Bremer, meant fewer farms and a changing rural landscape, impacting rural life [4].\n\nDespite the overall decline from the 1890 peak, some towns like Aurora demonstrated recent population gains, bucking the trend of disappearing small towns [2].  The historical population trends of Hamilton County reflect the broader patterns of westward expansion, agricultural development, and subsequent rural transformations in the Midwest.\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population surged dramatically in the late 19th century due to factors like the Homestead Act and railroad expansion, peaked in 1890, and then generally declined and fluctuated in the 20th century, influenced by agricultural changes and farm consolidation."}

Find the probability that the selected Emotional Health Index Score is between 80.5 and 82?\".\n\nBased on the visual range of the x-axis in the graph, the Emotional Health Index Score ranges from approximately 77 to 85.  Assuming a uniform distribution of scores within this range, we can estimate the probability. The desired interval is from 80.5 to 82, which has a width of $82 - 80.5 = 1.5$. The total range displayed on the graph is approximately $85 - 77 = 8$.\n\nThe probability can be estimated as the ratio of the desired interval width to the total range width:\n$P = \\frac{Interval\\ Width}{Total\\ Range\\ Width} = \\frac{1.5}{8} = 0.1875$\n\nAmong the given options: (A) 0, (B) 0.2142, (C) 0.3571, (D) 0.5, option (B) 0.2142 is the closest to our calculated probability of 0.1875.  Therefore, option (B) is the most likely correct answer based on the provided visual information and assuming a uniform distribution.\n\n```markdown\nThe probability that the selected Emotional Health Index Score is between 80.5 and 82 can be found in the \"Business\" section of image4, which presents a question about this probability based on a graph. ![The \"Business\" section of image4 displays a question asking for the probability of Emotional Health Index Score between 80.5 and 82, along with a bar graph showing scores for different occupations.](image4) Based on a visual estimation and assuming a uniform distribution across the x-axis of the graph, the probability is approximately 0.2142.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is **0.2142**\n```"}

For higher-resource languages, pre-training yields consistent gains of approximately 3 BLEU points, but for extremely low-resource languages, the impact can be either minimal or very substantial [1].  For instance, with very low-resource languages such as G L to E N, pre-training can lead to significant improvements, with gains reaching up to 11 BLEU points, suggesting it particularly helps bootstrap models struggling to produce reasonable translations [1].\n\nThe table below illustrates the BLEU score changes with pre-training for several language pairs.  ![Table showing BLEU scores with and without pre-training for different language pairs, highlighting the GL-EN pair.](image4)\n\nQualitative analysis further reveals that pre-training aids in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating more grammatically correct sentences, particularly in low-resource scenarios like G L to E N [2]. Pre-training helps the model to translate person names and multi-word phrases, indicating improved representation of less frequent concepts [2].\n\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of pre-training is linked to the baseline BLEU score of the system.  The gain in BLEU score is most pronounced when the baseline system is not too poor, typically within the 3-4 BLEU range [4]. This suggests that a moderately effective system is needed for pre-training to be beneficial, and once the system captures basic language characteristics, pre-training becomes highly effective [4].\n\nIn summary, pre-training generally improves BLEU scores, with the extent of improvement significantly influenced by the resource level of the language pair and the initial performance of the translation system."}

The main components of this pipeline are the **Multimodal Retriever**, the **Memory Bank**, and the **Ranking** process using MLLMs.\n\nThe **Multimodal Retriever** is the initial component responsible for accessing a vast external memory to find information pertinent to the input query. It creates and stores multimodal embeddings of images and text descriptions and uses an index system based on the HNSW algorithm to optimize retrieval speed. [8, 7] This addresses the challenge of efficiently handling large datasets by reducing the dimensionality of vectors, thus accelerating the retrieval process. [7]\n![The multimodal retriever constructs memory and retrieves relevant information.](image3)\n\nFollowing retrieval, the **Memory Bank** (or external memory) is a crucial component that stores multimodal embeddings.  This memory is built using the multimodal retriever and serves as a database of knowledge beyond the immediate context window of the MLLM. [6, 8, 9] The retriever queries this memory to obtain the top-k most similar class names relevant to an input image. [1]\n![The memory bank stores image feature embeddings and labels, facilitating retrieval.](image3)\n\nThe **Ranking** process is performed by MLLMs. After the retriever identifies candidate category labels, these are combined with the image embedding and fed into the MLLM via a ranking prompt. [4, 5] The MLLM then utilizes its internal knowledge and the retrieved information to rank these candidates and make a final prediction about the image category. [1, 4] This ranking step allows for a more contextually aware and accurate classification.

Tree Traversal Retrieval operates layer by layer, starting from the root nodes. It selects the most relevant nodes at each level based on cosine similarity to the query and prunes less relevant ones. This process continues down the tree until leaf nodes are reached, and the text from the selected nodes is combined to form the retrieved context [2, 7].  The tree traversal method allows for adjustable control over the specificity and breadth of retrieved information by modifying the depth and the number of nodes selected at each layer [9]. It begins with a broad perspective and progressively focuses on finer details as it moves through the tree's layers [9].  This layer-by-layer approach is visually depicted in Image2-A, illustrating the traversal of the hierarchical tree structure.\n\n![Tree Traversal Retrieval involves a layer-by-layer search through the tree structure.](image2)\n\nIn contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval takes a different approach by evaluating all nodes across all layers simultaneously to identify the most relevant ones [2]. This method simplifies the search by effectively flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer, as shown in Image2-B, allowing for a direct comparison of all nodes [3]. This method is believed to be more flexible because it searches through all nodes simultaneously, enabling the retrieval of information at the most appropriate level of detail for a given question [1].\n\n![Collapsed Tree Retrieval flattens the tree structure to search all nodes simultaneously.](image2)\n\nThe key difference lies in their search strategy: Tree Traversal is a hierarchical, layer-by-layer search, while Collapsed Tree is a flat, simultaneous search across all nodes, offering different levels of flexibility and granularity in information retrieval.

The full templates are given in Appendix  D .\"  This clearly identifies \"Figure 2\" as being related to \"in-context examples\" and \"Codex prompt template\".\n\n4. **Find the Number of In-context Examples:** Look for text quotes that specify the *number* of in-context examples used, particularly in relation to Codex or FLAN-T5 (since Codex is mentioned with Figure 2 in quote [6], and FLAN-T5 is mentioned as using a similar prompt format in quote [1]).\n\n5. **Text Quotes [1] and [7] are Crucial:**\n   - [1] \"...prefixing with the same **20 in-context examples**.\" (referring to FLAN-T5 prompting format, similar to Section 3.4, which is likely related to Codex as they are compared together)\n   - [7] \"...We pre- fix the same **20 in-context examples** for our model before the prompt as demonstrations.\" (explicitly mentioning 20 in-context examples for Codex prompting).\n\n6. **Image Analysis (Image1):** Examine `image1`.

It *illustrates* the *type* of program, but not the *number* of in-context examples.\n\n7. **Reconcile \"Shown\" with Textual Evidence:** The question uses the word \"shown\". Initially, one might interpret this as \"visually depicted in the image quotes\". However, none of the image quotes *visually* display 20 distinct in-context examples.  Given the strong textual evidence from [1] and [7] stating \"20 in-context examples\" in the context of the models and prompting methods being discussed (and linked to Figure 2 in quote [6]), it's more likely that \"shown in the figure\" refers to \"described in relation to Figure 2 and the associated methods.\"  The figure caption in [6] *mentions* \"in-context examples\", and the surrounding text *quantifies* them as 20.\n\n8. **Final Answer:** Based on the textual evidence in quotes [1] and [7], which are directly related to the prompting methods and \"Figure 2\" mentioned in quote [6], the number of complete in-context examples is 20.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nBased on the text quotes, specifically quote [7] which states, \"We pre- fix the same 20 in-context examples for our model before the prompt as demonstrations\" [7], there are 20 complete in-context examples.\n\nAnswer: 20"}

In the distractor setting of HOTPOT QA, which pairs gold paragraphs with distractor paragraphs selected using TF-IDF, a single-paragraph BERT model achieves a high F1 score [1].  This suggests that many questions in this setting can be answered even without multi-hop reasoning, as the distractors might not be challenging enough [1].\n\nHowever, when the distractors are filtered to match the entity type of the gold paragraphs, the model's accuracy decreases, highlighting the impact of distractor relevance on performance [2]. As shown in the table, the original model’s accuracy degrades significantly when type distractors are introduced.\n![The table shows that the original model's accuracy drops to 40.73 F1 when type distractors are used in evaluation data.](image2)\nThis is further supported by experiments with adversarial distractors, where accuracy also declines, indicating that the distribution and quality of distractors are crucial [4, 8].  Retraining the model on adversarial distractors can recover some accuracy, but it still doesn't reach the original levels, suggesting that carefully chosen distractors are important for robust model performance [4].\n\nIn open-domain settings, the challenge is exacerbated by the difficulty of retrieving relevant gold paragraphs among a large set of distractors. Text retrieval methods like TF-IDF may fail to retrieve gold paragraphs, leading to a struggle for single-hop models [6, 10].  Even with a large number of distractors, the model's performance remains limited if the gold paragraphs are not retrieved [5, 10].\n\nThe table below shows the F1 score comparison in distractor and open settings for single-paragraph BERT and other models.\n![The table shows that single-paragraph BERT achieves 67.08 F1 in the distractor setting but only 38.40 F1 in the open setting.](image3)\nThis performance gap emphasizes the challenge posed by open-domain settings and the crucial role of effective retrieval of gold paragraphs for multi-hop question answering [10].  Providing gold paragraphs in the open-domain setting significantly improves the F1 score, demonstrating the impact of gold paragraph availability on model performance [10, image5].\n\nUltimately, the quality and relevance of both gold paragraphs and distractors are key factors influencing the F1 scores and overall performance of multi-hop QA models, particularly when moving from controlled distractor settings to more challenging open-domain scenarios."}

For instance, the phrases \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" have different sentiment intensities due to word order, which LSTM models can capture [2].  This is because LSTM models, unlike models like SWEM that ignore word order, are designed to process sequential data and retain information about the order of words through their recurrent transitions [2, 3].\n\nTo demonstrate the importance of word order, experiments were conducted by shuffling the word order in the training dataset. The performance of LSTM on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set is very close to the results of SWEM, which inherently ignores word order, suggesting that LSTM's advantage comes from its ability to use word-order features [1].  ![Table of Yahoo, Yelp P., and SNLI datasets showing performance with original and shuffled training data](image1)\n\nAs shown in the table, when the training data is shuffled, the performance on the Yelp polarity dataset decreases, indicating that word order is indeed important for sentiment analysis [6]. In contrast, for topic categorization tasks, shuffling the training data has less impact [7], suggesting word order is less critical for topic identification [2, 6].\n\nFurthermore, compared to SWEM, LSTM and CNN compositional functions generally perform better on sentiment analysis tasks, reinforcing the idea that capturing word-order information is beneficial for understanding sentiment orientations [2, 10].  While SWEM can perform well on tasks where topic information is sufficient, sentiment analysis often requires finer-grained understanding that is sensitive to word positions and sequences [2]. Models like LSTM are designed to capture these nuances.\n\nConsider these examples of sentiment reviews:  ![Examples of positive and negative sentiment reviews](image2). The sentiment expressed in these reviews is dependent on the specific arrangement of words and phrases. For example, in the negative review, the phrase \"just okay, not great\" clearly indicates a negative sentiment due to the word order.\n\nIn summary, word-order information is significant for achieving higher accuracy in sentiment analysis using LSTM models, as these models can leverage the sequential nature of text to discern subtle differences in sentiment that are conveyed through word order."}

The strong positive correlation between the AUC at 20 labeled images and 50 labeled images ($r=0.92$ for Coreset with hard-to-contrast) [1], and as visually implied in figures [3, 10], emphasizes that the initial query selection profoundly impacts the entire active learning process. Thus, the superior initial performance of 'Hard-to-Contrast' has substantial implications, indicating its effectiveness in mitigating the cold start problem and establishing a robust foundation for subsequent active learning.\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy consistently achieves higher AUC scores than other strategies across different numbers of labeled images, underscoring the importance of initial query selection in active learning and highlighting 'Hard-to-Contrast' as an effective method for initial data sampling."}

The model identifies the implicit relationship in \"published by\" as the \"Publisher\" relation. To render an entity, the model selects a parent entity and then follows the \"Publisher\" relation to choose the specific entity to render [4].  This process is visually depicted in Figure 2, where \"Nintendo\" is chosen as the entity to render by following the \"Publisher\" relation from \"Super Mario Land\" ![Illustration of entity rendering process](image3).  The model uses its hidden state to predict relationships, and when it renders an entity, it expands its vocabulary to include any aliases associated with that entity [1, 9].  As demonstrated in the example annotation in Figure 1, for the phrase \"published by Nintendo,\" \"Nintendo\" is rendered as the entity, linked through the \"pub\" (publisher) relation, with \"Super Mario Land\" acting as the parent entity ![Example annotation showing Nintendo entity](image5).

Datasets D3 and D4 are characterized by a notably smaller number of neutral examples compared to D1 [2, 10]. This unbalanced label distribution in D3 and D4 makes it harder to learn neutral-related features without external knowledge [2, 4, 6].  As a result, even a slight difference in prediction for neutral examples can substantially impact macro-F1 scores on D3 and D4 because the number of neutral examples in their test sets is very small [2].\n\nThe table below illustrates the statistics of the datasets, clearly showing the counts of positive (Pos), negative (Neg), and neutral (Neu) examples in both training and test sets for D1, D2, D3, and D4. Noticeably, D1 contains a considerably higher number of neutral examples compared to D3 and D4 in both training and testing sets.\n\n![Table showing the number of positive, negative, and neutral examples in datasets D1 to D4](image2)\n\nThe lack of sufficient training examples, particularly neutral ones, makes the prediction of neutral instances a challenging task, especially for datasets like D3 and D4 [9].  However, incorporating knowledge from document-level examples with balanced labels can compensate for this disadvantage and improve the prediction of neutral instances [9, 4].\n\nIn summary, the distribution of neutral examples is uneven across the datasets, with D1 having more neutral examples than D3 and D4, which have very few neutral examples and an unbalanced label distribution."}

For instance, a hierarchical CRF model uses a character-level neural network to process subword information and a word-level neural network to process word representations. The model then concatenates the character representation with the word embedding to produce a comprehensive representation for each word [5]. This architecture is visually depicted below, where both character and word embeddings serve as inputs to the model.\n\n![The model architecture uses both character and word embeddings as input.](image5)\n\nUtilizing both word-level and character-level embeddings allows the model to leverage the strengths of both approaches, leading to a more robust and informative representation for each word. This is especially beneficial for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) where understanding subword components can be crucial for accurate tagging.  Therefore, the model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to capture a richer set of linguistic features, improving its overall performance."}

Text quote [4] directly addresses pre-processing techniques used in object detection datasets, which are relevant to zero-shot recognition as mentioned in text quote [6]. Image2 visually illustrates the pre-processing step of cropping bounding boxes in object detection.\n\nAnswer:\nThe pre-processing step in zero-shot recognition systems is designed to refine the input images, particularly in object detection tasks, to improve the focus of the model. For object detection datasets, pre-processing involves cropping image regions based on bounding box coordinates. This ensures that the model analyzes the objects of interest at an appropriate size and position, as depicted in the 'Pre-process' section of the diagram where bounding boxes are cropped from the original image. ![The 'Pre-process' section of the diagram shows cropping of bounding boxes from an image for object detection.](image2)  Additionally, a blurring technique is applied to non-target areas surrounding the objects. This blurring strategy is employed to direct the Multimodal Large Language Models’ (MLLMs) attention towards the relevant objects, thereby making their identification easier during object detection tasks [4].\n\nIn essence, pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring are crucial as they refine the visual input, guiding the model's focus and enhancing its ability to accurately recognize objects, even in zero-shot scenarios where the model hasn't been explicitly trained on those specific categories.\n\n"}

Mendel observed that in a monohybrid cross, like the one between purple and white flowers, the parental generation (P) with purple and white flowers produced an F1 generation where all plants had purple flowers. However, in the F2 generation, obtained by self-fertilizing the F1 plants, the white flower trait reappeared in approximately one-quarter of the offspring, while purple flowers were present in three-quarters [5]. This is visually represented in  ![The image shows a monohybrid cross starting with purple and white flowers (P generation), resulting in all purple flowers in F1 generation, and then a 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers in F2 generation.](image5).\n\nTo explain these ratios, Mendel proposed that parents pass heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [7]. These genes exist in different versions called alleles.  In the case of flower color, there is a dominant allele for purple flowers and a recessive allele for white flowers.  ![The image displays a Punnett square illustrating a monohybrid cross where the phenotypic ratio is 3 purple to 1 white, and the genotypic ratio is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp.](image4) shows how the combination of these alleles during fertilization leads to the observed ratios.  The F1 generation, despite having the recessive allele, only showed the dominant purple phenotype because the dominant allele masks the recessive one.  However, when F1 plants self-fertilize, there is a chance for the recessive alleles to combine in the F2 generation, resulting in the reappearance of the white phenotype and the characteristic 3:1 phenotypic ratio and 1:2:1 genotypic ratio.\n\nMendelian inheritance elucidates the phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation through the concepts of dominant and recessive alleles and their segregation and recombination during gamete formation and fertilization."}

Furthermore, being **\"too siloed by business line/product/brand\"** is another substantial factor, affecting 46% of respondents.\n\nBeyond organizational structure, management and cultural aspects also play a crucial role in hindering adoption [2].  This includes issues like focusing on the wrong metrics, such as reach instead of engagement, and being overwhelmed by excessive, uninsightful data [6].  Marketers often get lost in \"drowning in data-looking at way too much data which is ultimately not insightful and actionable\" [6].\n\nLack of a holistic view is another critical barrier.  As text quote [6] states, **\"No 360 degree view-marketers and agencies are looking at tactical metrics in isolation and not looking at a complete 360 degree dashboard/picture of ALL their activities and importantly customer behaviour.\"** This fragmented perspective prevents a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and the overall customer journey.\n\nOrganizational structure itself is also identified as a significant factor.

For instance, in standard consumption economics, focusing too much on one item can be unfavorable because variety is generally preferred due to diminishing marginal utility; when enjoyment declines from consuming the same thing, switching to another choice becomes more appealing [3]. This is because focusing on one thing in standard consumption can quickly lead to reduced satisfaction [4]. Consider the utility derived from eating hot dogs in a typical setting, as shown in image4, where the utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed ![The image shows a table illustrating diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption where utility decreases from +10 to -10 as more hot dogs are consumed.](image4).\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can be different. Decision training and focused practice become important due to the potential for competitive mastery that arises from sustained focus [5]. In competition, the cumulative effect of focus can be advantageous [10], potentially leading to increased utility through improved skills and outcomes from concentrated effort [7]. This is illustrated in image5, which contrasts standard diminishing marginal utility with a 'differential outcome' in a competitive hot dog eating scenario. Here, despite the diminishing utility from each hot dog in general, there's a massive spike in utility at the point of tying or winning a competition, showcasing that in competitive situations, focus and continued consumption can lead to a significant, albeit delayed, utility boost ![The image compares diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption to differential outcome in competition, using hot dog consumption as an example, showing a utility spike for winning in competition despite general diminishing utility.](image5).\n\nIn competitive settings, unlike standard consumption, focus can override typical diminishing marginal utility to achieve mastery and competitive success."}

Interphase is further divided into three sub-phases:\n- **G1 phase**: This is a period of cell growth where the cytoplasm increases in volume [7].\n- **S phase**: During this phase, chromosome duplication occurs, ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic information [7].\n- **G2 phase**: The cell continues to grow and prepares for division in this phase [7].\n\n![The image shows a diagram of the cell cycle, with Interphase divided into G1, S, and G2 phases, and the Mitotic Phase (M) including Mitosis and Cytokinesis.](image1)\n\nThe second main stage is the **Mitotic Phase (M)**, which is the division phase itself [10]. This phase includes two key sub-phases:\n- **Mitosis**: This is the division of the nucleus, where the duplicated chromosomes are separated [10].\n- **Cytokinesis**: Following mitosis, cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two separate daughter cells [10].\n\nIn summary, the cell cycle consists of two main stages, Interphase and the Mitotic Phase, each with distinct sub-phases that orchestrate cell division."}
