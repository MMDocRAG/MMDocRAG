However, we can deduce this information from the data presented in the tables.\n\nFrom image2, the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home is 53%.\n\nFrom image5, the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home is 67% ($30,000-$49,999) and 92% ($75,000+).\n\nSince the data from image5 is more detailed and specific, we can assume that the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home is around 67-92%, depending on the household income level.\n\nTo narrow down the gap, let's consider the data from image5, which provides a more detailed breakdown of the broadband adoption rates for the 65+ age group.\n\nFrom image5, the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home is:\n\n* 67% ($30,000-$49,999)\n* 83% ($30,000-$49,999)\n* 88% ($50,000-$74,999)\n* 92% ($75,000+)\n\nSince the data from image5 is more detailed and specific, we can assume that the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home is around 67-92%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the gap between male 65+ age group who use internet and broadband at home. We can assume that the percentage of male 65+ age group who use internet is around 59% (as mentioned in [5]).\n\nTo calculate the gap, we need to find the difference between the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home and the percentage of male 65+ age group who use internet.\n\nLet's assume that the percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home is around 80% (midpoint of 67-92%). This is a rough estimate, but it should give us a reasonable starting point.\n\nNow, let's calculate the gap:\n\nGap = Percentage of male 65+ age group who have a broadband connection at home - Percentage of male 65+ age group who use internet\n= 80% - 59%\n= 0.8 x 100 - 59\n= 21\n\nSo, the gap between male 65+ age group who use internet and broadband at home is approximately 21%.\n\nThis means that, on average, around 21% of male 65+ age group who use internet do not have a broadband connection at home.\n\n###![Gap between male 65+ age group who use internet and broadband at home (21%)](image11)"}

As discussed in the guidelines, evidence selection, answer construction, quote citation, and the structure of the response must all align to generate a high-quality answer.\n\n[2] Americans see a range of explanations for the under representation of women,  blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs. Since the question specifically mentions women, blacks, and Hispanics, [2] provides the most relevant information about the range of explanations.\n\n[3] Perceived reasons more women, blacks and Hispanics are not working in STEM. Although this quote mentions the same groups, it focuses more on perceived reasons rather than the major reasons.\n\n[5] Many Americans attribute the limited diversity of the STEM workforce to a lack of encouragement  for girls and blacks and Hispanics to pursue STEM from an early age;  $39\\%$   of Americans consider  this a major reason there are not more women in some STEM areas, and  $41\\%$   say this is a major  reason there are not more blacks and Hispanics in the STEM workforce. This supports the notion that a lack of encouragement is a significant issue but should be cited carefully in context.\n\n[6] In addition,  $42\\%$   of Americans say limited access to quality education to prepare them for these  fields is a major reason blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce; this  view is held by a majority of those working in STEM who are black   $(73\\%)$   and about half of  Hispanics   $\\left(53\\%\\right)$ , Asians   $\\left(52\\%\\right)$   and whites  $\\left(50\\%\\right)$   in STEM jobs. Although [6] mentions limited access to quality education as a major reason, it provides additional context on who holds this view.\n\n[7] There is wide disagreement  across racial and ethnic  groups on how much  discrimination contributes to  these racial/ethnic  disparities. Among those in  STEM,  $72\\%$   of blacks say a  major reason why blacks and  Hispanics are  underrepresented in these  jobs is because they face  discrimination in recruiting,  hiring and promotions; by  contrast only around a  quarter of whites   $(27\\%)$   and  Asians  $(\\it{28\\%})$   say this.  Hispanic STEM employees  might also be concerned about discrimination but are not explicitly quoted for their major reasons in this passage.\n\n[8] Most blacks in STEM positions consider major underlying reasons for the under representation of  blacks and Hispanics in science, technology, engineering and math occupations to be limited  access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions and a lack of  encouragement to pursue these jobs from an early age. This passage provides the major reasons for blacks in STEM positions, including limited access to quality education, discrimination in recruitment and promotions, and a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM jobs from an early age.\n\nGiven the quotes, the most relevant information to answer the question can be synthesized as follows:\n\nThe major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs according to the Pew Research Center include a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age and limited access to quality education to prepare them for these fields. These are major concerns for various groups, including women, blacks, and Hispanics, who hold these views by significant margins.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nThe major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs according to the Pew Research Center include a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age and limited access to quality education to prepare them for these fields. These are major concerns for various groups, including women, blacks, and Hispanics, who hold these views by significant margins.\n\nHere's the interleaved text and image response:\nThe major reasons for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs according to the Pew Research Center include a lack of encouragement to pursue STEM from an early age and limited access to quality education to prepare them for these fields [1] image1: A horizontal bar chart comparing the perceptions of U.S. adults regarding the quality of different levels of education in the U.S. shows that Americans view K-12 public schools, undergraduate education, and graduate education as average in quality [1].

This is in contrast to the positive ratings received by previous administrations, such as the Reagan administration, which had an approval rating of 64% or higher [image1].\n\n**Comparison to Past Administrations**\n\nTo put this into perspective, let's look at the approval ratings of Trump's administration officials' ethical standards compared to those of past administrations. As shown in the graph, the Trump administration's ratings are lower than those of previous administrations, including the Obama administration, which had an average approval rating of 55% [image1].\n\n**Public Approval of Trump's Job Performance**\n\nInterestingly, the public's evaluation of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president is little changed in recent months, and is roughly on par with ratings at the outset of his presidency [2]. This suggests that the low ratings for Trump's administration officials' ethical standards may not be directly related to public approval of Trump's job performance.\n\n**Demographic Differences**\n\nHowever, there are some demographic differences in the way different groups evaluate Trump's administration officials' ethical standards. For example, among Democrats, there are modest differences along ideological lines, with 8% of conservative or moderate Democrats and 93% of liberal Democrats giving low marks for the Trump administration's ethical standards [3]. This suggests that there may be a disconnect between public opinion and the administration's ratings on ethics.\n\n**Visual Representation**\n\nHere is a visual representation of the comparison between Trump's administration officials' ethical standards ratings and those of past administrations:\n\n[![image1](image1)](image1)\n\n**Sources**\n\n[1] Current ratings for the Trump administration's ethical standards are lower than for those at various points in other administrations dating back to when the question was first asked by ABC News and The Washington Post of Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983.\n[9] The Trump administration also gets low marks from the public for its ethical standards: 39% say the administration's ethical standards are excellent or good, while 58% rate them as not good or poor."}

This was evident in the 2008 election, where $58\\%$ of Obama supporters were happy, compared to $51\\%$ of Trump supporters in 2016. Additionally, the emotions prevalent after Trump's victory were predominantly hopeful and proud for Trump voters, whereas Clinton voters felt uneasy, sad, scared, and angry. \n\n![Surprise among Trump and Clinton voters](image4) \nThe image illustrates the levels of surprise among different voter groups, with all voters expressing a high level of surprise (73%) and Clinton voters being the most surprised (87%).

The perception of mudslinging in the election also played a significant role in shaping voters' emotional reactions. As shown in image 1, a substantial increase in the perception of more mudslinging in recent elections, particularly in 2016, contributed to the negative sentiment surrounding the campaign [7]. According to image 2, a larger proportion of Trump voters believed that issues \"don't matter\" compared to Clinton voters, indicating a potentially lower level of engagement with the campaign's issues [2].\n\nThe emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters also correlated with their perceptions of the election's outcome. A majority of Clinton voters felt uneasy, sad, and scared about Trump's victory, while Trump supporters expressed feelings of happiness and pride. These emotions are likely to influence their overall perception of Trump's performance in the election.

This demonstrates that both groups of voters were caught off guard by the outcome, but Clinton supporters were more surprised. In contrast, Trump supporters were somewhat less surprised, with $40\\%$ saying they were not surprised he won. This can be illustrated with image2, which shows the percentage of those who were \"Not surprised\" and \"Surprised\" among \"Trump voters,\" \"Clinton voters,\" and \"All voters.\" As seen in the image, $40\\%$ of Trump voters were not surprised, while $87\\%$ of Clinton voters were. We can also observe that image3, which displays the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters, highlights that while both groups express shock and surprise, Clinton voters were more shocked with \"shocked\" being the most frequent response, followed by \"disappointed\" and \"disgusted,\" whereas Trump voters mention their surprise or shock at the election and \"happy\" as the most mentioned word.\n\n|             | Not Surprised | Surprised   |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n| **All voters** | 27%          | 73%         |\n| **Trump voters** | 40%          | 60%         |\n| **Clinton voters** | 12%          | 87%         |\n\nFor instance, when voters are asked to summarize their feelings about Trump's victory in a word, many point to their surprise or shock at the election, as stated in [8]. The emotional reactions to Trump's victory therefore provide insight into the expectations of the voters prior to the election. Clinton voters, who were more surprised, might have been less confident in Trump's chances, while Trump voters, who were somewhat less surprised, may have had higher expectations for the outcome. This can be observed in image1, which displays a bar chart showing the percentage of each emotion with a higher percentage of Uneasy, Sad, and Scared emotions among Clinton voters. As illustrated in image1, these emotions are associated with lower hopes, and higher anxiety and fear about the election outcome. This illustrates the correlation between emotional reactions and expectations.\n\n|             | Hopeful | Proud  | Uneasy | Sad      | Scared | Angry   |\n|-------------|---------|-------|--------|----------|-------|---------|\n| **Clinton voters** | 51      | 36    | 53     | 41       | 41    | 31      |\n| **Trump voters** |  |       |        |          |       |         |\n\nIt is therefore clear that the emotional reactions to Trump's victory reveal the expectations of the voters prior to the election. Clinton voters, who were more surprised, had lower expectations and were more anxious about the election outcome. Trump voters, who were somewhat less surprised, may have had higher expectations and were less anxious. Overall, the emotional reactions to Trump's victory provide valuable insight into the expectations and perceptions of the voters prior to the election."}

It shows that \"All voters\" are surprised at a 73% rate, with \"Trump voters\" expressing surprise at 60% and \"Clinton voters\" at an astonishing 87%.

{"q_id": 94, "model": "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct_llm", "in_tok": 2148, "out_tok": 780, "total_tok": 2928, "response": "To address the question of how the perceptions of China's handling of COVID-19 differ between Republicans and Democrats, and how these perceptions have changed over time, let's examine the key evidence presented in the text and image quotes.\n\nWhile more than half thought economic ties were bad in the spring of 2019, when the question was last posed, this sense has increased by 15 percentage points over the past year, with a majority of Republicans and Democratic-leaning independents now believing bilateral economic ties are bad [4]. This trend suggests a worsening perception of U.S.-China economic relations over time, which may be influencing how people view China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to survey data, Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to say China has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus, with 82% of Republicans versus 54% of Democrats believing this [9]. This stark difference in perception may indicate a partisan divide in how people evaluate China's response to the pandemic. However, it's essential to consider that both groups are increasingly critical of China's handling of the outbreak, with around three-quarters of Americans saying China's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan contributed either a great deal or a fair amount to the global spread of the virus [7].\n\nThe distribution of responses to a survey question on China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that 51% of respondents believe the U.S. should hold China responsible, even if relations worsen, while 38% agree with holding China responsible, and 8% believe China is not to blame for the virus spread [5]. The bar chart accompanying this question shows that 51% of respondents fall into the \"hold China responsible\" category, indicating a significant proportion of Americans believe China should be held accountable for its role in the pandemic.\n\nTo understand the evolution of these perceptions over time, let's examine the line graph showing trends from 2005 to 2020 [2]. The graph indicates changes over time in percentages associated with Republicans and Democrats regarding holding China responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. The red line (Rep/Lean Rep) shows a steady increase in those who believe the U.S. should hold China responsible, from 39% in 2005 to 83% in 2020, while the blue line (Dem/Lean Dem) shows a less pronounced increase, from 34% in 2005 to 68% in 2020. This suggests that the perception of China's responsibility for the pandemic has become more widespread and bipartisan over time.\n\nFinally, the line graph showing the change in perceptions of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 and 2020 indicates a clear shift towards more negative views of China's handling of the pandemic [3]. The blue line (Bad) starts at 53 in 2019 and increases to 68 in 2020, while the green line (Good) starts at 41 in 2019 and decreases to 30 in 2020. This visual representation of the change in perceptions over time reinforces the idea that the perception of China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly negative.\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of China's handling of COVID-19 differ significantly between Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans being more likely to hold China responsible for the pandemic. These perceptions have changed over time, with a growing number of Americans believing China should be held accountable for its role in the outbreak. The evidence presented in the text and image quotes suggests that these shifts are part of a broader trend towards more negative views of China's handling of the pandemic, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nThe following image best illustrates these differences in perceptions:\n![ republicans-blame-China-82-Democrats-blame-China-54-(Based-on-survey-question-on-Chinas-handling-of-COVID-19)](image10)"}

Overall, while political affiliations and educational backgrounds can influence opinions on the U.S. and China's handling of the pandemic, the differences are not extreme, and there is considerable variation within each group.\nThe evidence in [4], [7] suggests that the opinions of the Chinese handling of the virus is not related with educational background."}

While the U.S. cannot learn from other countries is more prevalent among Republicans, liberal Democrats are more likely to think the country can learn from other nations (67% vs 25%). These partisan differences are evident, with 60% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believing the U.S. can learn a great deal, compared to 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\n**Comparison to Trust Levels in International Organizations**\n\nPartisan differences in trust levels for international organizations like the WHO (image2) and EU (image2) also exist. While Liberal Democrats express higher trust in the WHO (86%) and EU (79%) compared to Conservative Republicans (27% for the WHO and 49% for the EU). These differences in trust levels correlate with perceptions of the U.S. ability to learn from other countries, suggesting that partisan differences in trust in international organizations may contribute to varying perceptions of the U.S. capacity for learning from abroad.\n\n**Interpretation of Chart (image1)**\n\nThe chart highlights significant variation in perceptions of the U.S. ability to learn from other countries among different age groups, education levels, and political affiliations. For example, younger adults (ages 18-29) and those with higher education levels (postgraduate and college graduate) are more likely to believe the U.S. can learn from other countries. Conversely, Republicans, those with lower education levels, and older adults are less likely to hold this view.\n\n**Bar Chart Comparison (image3)**\n\nThe chart comparing responses to the question \"A great deal\" or \"A fair amount\" by education level shows that individuals with higher education levels (postgraduate, college graduate, and some college) are more likely to believe the U.S. can learn from other countries, while those with lower education levels (HS or less) are less likely to hold this view. This pattern is consistent across various demographic groups.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe perception of the U.S. ability to learn from other countries in handling the coronavirus is influenced by partisan differences, with liberal Democrats and those with higher education levels more likely to believe the country can learn from abroad. These perceptions correlate with varying trust levels in international organizations like the WHO and EU, suggesting that partisan differences in trust may contribute to differing perceptions of the U.S. capacity for learning from other countries."}

According to the survey results [1](#1), the views of Republicans and Democrats differ significantly on the topic of China's influence.\n\nOn the one hand, Republicans believe China's international clout will diminish as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, while 40% of Democrats share the same view. Additionally, Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe that the U.S.'s international influence will be strengthened as a result of the crisis, whereas Democrats are about four times more likely to expect American influence to weaken after the outbreak [3](#3).\n\nThe partisan gaps in views about China's influence are also reflected in the trust levels among different political groups for the WHO, EU, and Chinese government, as depicted in image 2 [2](#2). Liberal Democrats have the highest trust level for the WHO, followed by the EU and the Chinese government, with Liberal Democrats being more than 80% trusting of the WHO.\n\nA similar divide is seen when comparing the opinions of the U.S., EU, and China regarding their future influence in the world, as shown in image 3 [4](#4). The U.S. is expected to have about the same influence as before, while the EU is expected to have a greater influence. In contrast, China is expected to have less influence.\n\n### Factors Influencing Views\n\nThe level of education is also a significant factor in shaping views about the future influence of the U.S., EU, and China. A survey conducted by [10](#10) found that Americans with higher levels of education are more likely to think that the country's global influence will recede.\n\nAs demonstrated in image 4 [5](#5), the level of confidence or agreement with the idea that the pandemic will shape America's role in international affairs varies by demographic groups. Postgraduates, college graduates, and those with some college education are more likely to have a great deal of confidence, whereas those with a high school education or less are less confident.\n\n### Influencing Factors Summary\n\nTo summarize, the views about the future influence of the U.S., EU, and China differ based on political affiliation and education level. Republicans and Democrats have differing views on China's influence, while Liberal Democrats tend to have higher trust levels for the WHO and EU. Education level is also a significant factor, with higher levels of education leading to greater confidence in the country's global influence receding.\n\n```python\n# Conclusion\n# The views about the future influence of the U.S., EU, and China differ based on political affiliation and education level.\n# Republicans and Democrats have differing views on China's influence, \n# while Liberal Democrats tend to have higher trust levels for the WHO and EU.\n# Education level is also a significant factor, with higher levels of education leading to greater confidence in the country's global influence receding.\n```"}

The response, which we will articulate based on provided data, can be outlined as follows:\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center analysis of survey data, there are clear partisan gaps in views regarding the international influence of the U.S. and China after the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n#### Partisan Gaps and Age\n\nIn [4], it is reported that there is a large partisan divide in the belief that China's international clout will diminish as a result of the pandemic, with roughly six-in-ten Republicans believing this, while just $40\\%$ of Democrats share the same opinion. However, there is also internal division among Democrats, with liberal party supporters being $20$ percentage points more likely than conservatives and moderates within the party to foresee the decline of U.S. international influence.\n\nMoreover, age divides emerge on this question, with American adults ages 65 and older being $16$ percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis.\n\n#### Opinions on U.S. and China's Global Influence\n\nRegarding the U.S. and China's global influence, [5] and [8] indicate that the American public is divided in its views. Specifically, the Pew Research Center reported that about $29\\%$ of the U.S. public believes that China's influence will increase, about $41\\%$ believes it will be about the same, and about $29\\%$ believes it will decrease.\n\nIn contrast, the EU is also facing concerns over its international influence, with about $19\\%$ of the EU public believing that China's influence will increase, about $59\\%$ believing it will be about the same, and about $21\\%$ believing it will decrease.\n\n#### Education and Age Matters\n\nAccording to [9], Americans who have completed higher levels of education are more likely to think the country's global influence will recede, reflecting the diverse views within a particular demographic. Similarly, age matters significantly in perceptions about China's global power, with older Americans being more likely to say that China will have less global influence after the pandemic.\n\n#### Public Perception of China\n\n[7] suggests that there is a negative opinion of China, with a majority of Americans expressing unfavorable views toward China. In fact, as reported in [10], $66\\%$ of Americans expressed an unfavorable opinion of China, the most negative rating for the country since the Center began asking the question in 2005.\n\n### Concluding Response\n\nBased on the analysis, the predictions about the global influence of the U.S. and China differ significantly among different demographic and political groups after the coronavirus outbreak. Partisan gaps, age divides, and the impact of education level on views all contribute to these discrepancies. It is evident that the opinions on the future of global influence are highly influenced by various factors, including demographics and political affiliations.\n\n### Image\n![Bar Chart Comparing Opinions on China's Global Influence](image5)\n\nThe image above shows a bar chart comparing opinions from the U.S., the EU, and China on China's influence after the coronavirus outbreak.

This sentiment is more pronounced among Republicans, with 80% expressing negative views, while Democrats are more divided, with half saying China has not done a good job [3]. On the other hand, 62% of Democrats trust coronavirus information from the Chinese government, compared to just 36% of Republicans [6].\n\nFuture Influence in World Affairs\n---------------------------------\n\nThere is a significant partisan divide on the question of China's future influence in world affairs. Roughly six-in-ten Republicans believe China's international clout will diminish as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, while just 40% of Democrats share this view [5]. Additionally, 50% of Americans believe China will have less influence in world affairs after the pandemic, with the share of moderate and conservative Democrats being significantly lower, at 15% and 8%, respectively [9].\n\nPerceptions by Demographics\n-----------------------------\n\nAge also plays a role in shaping Americans' perceptions of China's handling of the outbreak and its future influence. American adults ages 65 and older are 16 percentage points more likely than those under 30 to say China will have less global influence after the crisis [5]. Furthermore, a related question about America's role in international affairs shows strong differences along both partisan and ideological lines, with six-in-ten Americans saying the U.S. should focus on its own problems and let other countries deal with the pandemic [9].\n\nChart: Public Trust in China's Handling of the Outbreak\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n![Public Trust in China's Handling of the Outbreak (chart)](image1)\n\nChart: Global Influence Expectations\n--------------------------------------\n\n![Global Influence Expectations (chart)](image3)\n\nChart: Public Perception of China's Performance\n----------------------------------------------\n\n![Public Perception of China's Performance (chart)](image5)"}

By contrast, whites reported some improvement in their family income relative to the cost of living across the one-year time period. As a result, overall in 2015, the three racial and ethnic groups looked fairly similar on this measure [2].\nIn 2015, about half (53%) of Latinos said their family income is not keeping up with the cost of living. Meanwhile, 37% said their income is staying about even with the cost of living, and 10% said it is going up faster than the cost of living. In 2015, blacks and whites held similar views as Hispanics on this issue [3].\nBetween 2014 and 2015, Hispanic views of family income in relation to the cost of living were unchanged—as about half of all Hispanic adults in both years said they were falling behind financially, as was true for the U.S. public as a whole [4]. Two other Pew Research Center surveys of U.S. adults conducted in 2014 and 2015 show that many Hispanics say their family income is falling behind the cost of living [5].\nHowever, there are notable changes when looking at the personal finance ratings. About half (48%) of Latinos ages 18 to 29 report that they were in excellent or good financial shape in 2015, a 27 percentage point increase from 2008 and more than double the share who had a similarly positive view of their finances that year [6]. Most key Latino demographic subgroups see gains in personal finance ratings since 2008 [7].\nRatings of personal finances improve among most Latino groups [8]. Looking back to before the recession reveals another striking difference between Hispanic economic perceptions and those of the U.S. population as a whole. Latino views of their financial situation are more positive now than they were in 2004, when roughly a third (31%) rated their financial condition as excellent or good. By contrast, the public’s view of its finances is lower now than in 2004, when about half (51%) had a positive view [9]. \nThe image below shows the changes in the perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living among Hispanic, White, and Black adults in 2014 and 2015.![Change in perceptions of family income](image1)\nThe line graph below shows the trends over time for the \"General public\" and \"Hispanic\" group from 2004 to 2015.

Let's start with the evidence from the text quotes.\n\nSkeptical attitudes about the benefits of technology among older adults do not hinder their regular use of the internet once they become users [4]. On the contrary, most seniors who use the internet make visiting the digital world a regular occurrence, with 71% going online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% going online three to five times per week [4].\n\nIn terms of device ownership, older adults' device ownership differs notably from the population as a whole in several specific ways. Among the age groups considered, 18-29 years, 30-49 years, and 50-64 years, the percentages of individuals who go online daily or almost daily are 88%, 84%, and 79%, respectively [10]. In contrast, for seniors aged 65 and over, the percentage of individuals who go online daily or almost daily is 71%, with an additional 11% going online 3-5 times per week [10].\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the same trend does not necessarily apply across all device types. For example, a bar chart comparing the percentage of ownership of smartphones and tablets or e-readers among two groups: all adults and people aged 65 and over, reveals that 55% of all adults own a smartphone, whereas 18% of those aged 65 and over own a smartphone [image3]. Similarly, 43% of all adults own a tablet or e-reader, whereas 27% of those aged 65 and over own a tablet or e-reader [image3].\n\nMoving on to the visual representations of internet usage, a bar graph showing the percentage of internet users in different age groups who go online [image1] details two frequencies: those who go online every day or almost every day, and those who go online 3-5 times per week. The graph shows that for all age groups combined, the percentage of individuals who go online daily or almost daily is substantial, ranging from 82% in the 65+ age group to 94% in the 18-29 years age group.\n\nThe graph also highlights that while the percentage of individuals who go online daily or almost daily decreases with age, the percentage of individuals who go online 3-5 times per week remains steady across age groups.\n\nA bar chart comparing the percentage of people who go online versus those who have broadband at home across different age groups [image2] demonstrates that internet usage and broadband availability decrease with age. However, it's essential to note that the percentage of individuals who go online daily or almost daily remains substantial, even among those aged 80 and over, at 37%.\n\nIn conclusion, the trends observed in the data suggest that while older adults may face unique challenges when it comes to technology, they still make regular use of the internet and various devices. However, the frequency and range of internet usage vary significantly across different age groups and device types.\n\nHere is the interleaved image response based on the above text:\n\nTo better visualize the data, let's examine the evidence from the image quotes.\n\nThe image is a bar graph showing the percentage of internet users in different age groups who go online every day or almost every day, and those who go online 3-5 times per week [image1].

Moreover, cell phones are now owned by a majority of seniors in every major demographic subcategory. Even among the oldest seniors (those 80 years of age or older, just $37% of whom use the internet), cell phone adoption sits at $61%$. These statistics demonstrate that socioeconomic factors, such as education and household income, have a significant impact on internet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults.\n\nTo better understand the nuances of internet and smartphone adoption among older adults, a closer examination of education and income levels is necessary. Research has shown that those with higher levels of education and income tend to have higher rates of device ownership and internet adoption. For instance, as seen in table [10], *cell phone adoption is fairly low along the entire age spectrum of the older adult population, but decreases substantially for seniors in their mid-70s*, and becomes nearly non-existent among seniors in their 80s and beyond (just $5%$ of those 80 and older are smartphone owners).

This suggests that there may be a significant gap in smartphone adoption rates among older adults with lower levels of education and income.\n\nFinally, a comparison of overall trends in device ownership reveals that older adults with higher levels of education and income tend to have higher rates of device ownership and internet adoption. For example, as seen in table [4], *cell phone adoption is higher among seniors with higher levels of education and income*, with 92% of seniors with a household income of $75,000 or more owning a cell phone, compared to 67% of seniors with a household income of less than $30,000.\n\nThese findings suggest that socioeconomic factors, such as education and household income, play a crucial role in shaping internet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults.

These disparities in smartphone adoption rates highlight the need to address the digital divide among seniors based on education and income levels.\n\nFinally, here is an image that illustrates the disparities in e-book reader and tablet computer usage among seniors based on education and income levels:\n\n![Table 4: E-book reader and tablet computer usage among seniors by education and income levels](image4)\n\nThe table shows that among seniors with a college degree, $30\\%$ use e-book readers, and $31\\%$ use tablets, while among those with lower incomes, such as those earning less than $\\S30,\\mathbf{ooo}$ annually, only $12\\%$ use e-book readers, and $11\\%$ use tablets. These disparities in e-book reader and tablet computer usage highlight the need to address the digital divide among seniors based on education and income levels.\n\nIn conclusion, the data suggests that there are significant disparities in internet and broadband adoption rates, as well as cell phone and smartphone ownership, among seniors based on education and income levels. Addressing these disparities is crucial to ensure that all seniors have equal access to digital technologies and can fully participate in the digital economy."}

But a variety of technological innovations – from industrial robots in manufacturing to the office productivity tools that have transformed the nature of white collar office work – have already had a profound impact on the nature of work in the present day. When asked about the impact of these and other technologies on their own jobs and careers, today’s workers express decidedly mixed views. Many view these technologies in a positive light, but substantial shares view them as damaging (or at best neutral) to their own career prospects. Moreover, the survey finds that the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment. It also finds that workforce automation has already impacted a minority of today’s workers in the form of lost jobs or wages – and that many of these workers view technology as a broadly negative influence on the trajectory of their own careers.\n[2] Workers generally express more positive than negative views when asked a more general set of questions about the impact of all the various technologies they might have used throughout the course of their careers. Roughly half of workers $(53\\%)$ feel that technology in general has made their work more interesting, but ${\\bf12\\%}$ say it has made their work less interesting – and around one-third $\\left(34\\%\\right)$ say it hasn’t had a major impact either way in this regard.

These include word processing and spreadsheet software; smartphones; email and social media; software that manages people’s daily schedules; technologies that help customers serve themselves without the assistance of a human worker; and industrial robots. It finds that workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those who have not attended college to say that each of these individual technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers. Indeed, \n[6] Workers with higher levels of education more likely to say tech has increased opportunities, made their jobs more interesting \n[7] When it comes to the overall impact of technology on them in a professional context, just $38\\%$ of workers with high school diplomas or less indicate that technology in general has made their jobs more interesting.

And this survey finds that users’ comfort level with this behavior is heavily context-dependent.\n\n[3] Along with asking about the emotions social media platforms inspire in users, the survey also included a series of questions about how often social media users encounter certain types of behaviors and content. These findings indicate that users see two types of content especially frequently: posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated ( $58\\%$ of users say they see this type of content frequently) and people making accusations or starting arguments without waiting until they have all the facts $(59\\%$ see this frequently).\n\n[7] Majorities of social media users frequently see people engaging in drama and exaggeration, jumping into arguments without having all the facts\n\n[8] Beyond the emotions they feel while browsing social media, users are exposed to a mix of positive and negative behaviors from others.

According to a survey, [1] the vast quantities of data social media companies possess about their users are ultimately what allows them to deliver individually targeted content. However, this data usage is heavily context-dependent, and users' comfort levels vary based on the specific use case. [2]\n\nSpecifically, men and women have different perceptions of online behavior. A survey found that [3] three-quarters of social media users find it acceptable for platforms to use data about them to recommend events in their area, while a smaller majority think it is acceptable if their data are used to recommend other people they might want to be friends with. Women are slightly more likely than men to see kind behavior on social media platforms, whereas men are more likely to see mean or bullying content. [4]\n\nInterestingly, older users are much less accepting of social media sites using their data for other reasons. [9] For instance, by a two-to-one margin, users ages 18 to 49 think it is an acceptable use of their data to show them ads for products or services, whereas users ages 65 and older say this is not acceptable. [9] This highlights the need for social media platforms to consider age differences in their data usage policies.\n\nWhen it comes to online behavior, men and women also exhibit different perceptions. [6] According to the survey, men are more likely to see people being bullying or deceptive on social media, while women are more likely to see kind or supportive behavior. [6]\n\nIn terms of online behavior, [image2] shows that women are more likely to see people trying to be kind or supportive, while men are more likely to see people being mean or bullying. [6] The data suggests that these differences in perceptions may have implications for how social media platforms tailor their recommendations or advertisements.\n\nFor instance, social media platforms may need to consider offering more personalized and gentle suggestions to women who are more likely to see kind behavior, while also addressing the concerns of men who are more likely to see mean or bullying content. [8] By understanding these differences, social media platforms can work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful online environment.\n\nThis can be done by using the data more thoughtfully and by considering the implications for different age groups. [9] For example, younger users are more likely to report stronger emotions across all categories, while older users are less accepting of data usage for other reasons. [7]\n\nBy acknowledging these differences and using the data to inform their recommendations or advertisements, social media platforms can create a more personalized and user-friendly experience for both men and women. This can be seen in [image1], which shows the acceptability of different online recommendations across various age groups. [5]\n\nOverall, the data highlights the importance of considering the nuances of user perceptions and age differences when it comes to social media data usage. By taking a more thoughtful and inclusive approach, social media platforms can work towards creating a more respectful and personalized online environment.\n\nTherefore, the implication for social media platforms is to be more thoughtful in their use of user data, taking into account the differences in perceptions between men and women, as well as the implications for different age groups."}

The largest difference in perceived fairness among the four scenarios can be seen in the automated personal finance score concept, with only 32% of Americans finding it fair for consumers to be judged in this way, yet 54% believing it would do a good job at helping businesses find new customers. [8]\n\nIn contrast, 22-percentage-point difference exists between the percentage of people who think the automated personal finance score concept is fair to consumers and those who believe it is effective at doing its job. [8] This significant disparity indicates that public skepticism regarding the fairness of these programs spans multiple dimensions, with concerns about bias, privacy, and the potential for unfair treatment of individuals.\n\nA notable variation in perceptions of fairness is observed based on race and ethnicity, with blacks expressing much more concern about a parole scoring algorithm than either whites or Hispanics. Roughly six-in-ten blacks (61%) think this type of program would not be fair to people up for parole, significantly higher than the share of either whites (49%) or Hispanics (38%) who say the same. [3]\n\nFurther analysis reveals that people’s views of the fairness and effectiveness of these programs tend to go hand-in-hand. Similar shares of the public view the concepts as fair to those being judged as they do believe they would be effective at producing good decisions. [4] However, the personal finance score concept stands out as a notable exception to this overall trend, with a significant gap between perceived fairness and effectiveness.\n\nThe public is relatively split on whether these programs would be effective at doing the job they are designed to do, with 54% thinking the personal finance score program would be effective at identifying good customers, while around half (49%) and 47% think the parole rating and resume screening algorithms would be effective, respectively. [5]\n\nMore generally, Americans are largely skeptical about the fairness of these programs: None is viewed as fair by a clear majority of the public. Especially small shares think the “personal finance score” and “video job interview analysis” concepts would be fair to consumers (32% and 33%, respectively). [7] Furthermore, the public is also skeptical about the acceptability of these algorithms, with two-thirds of Americans finding the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable, and 67% saying the computer-aided video job analysis algorithm is unacceptable. [9]\n\nThese findings suggest that public trust in these systems is rooted in concerns about fairness, bias, and the potential for unfair treatment of individuals. The varying perceptions of fairness across different age groups, as shown in image1, may indicate that older age groups are more skeptical about the unbiased capability of programs. [10]"}

[3]\n\n**Economic Impact**\nThe public sees Trump's impact on the economy in a positive light, with 40% thinking that his policies have made economic conditions better since taking office, compared to 28% who say they have made conditions worse. [4] Partisans remain deeply divided on this question, with 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners saying that Trump's economic policies had improved conditions in the country, while 90% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say his policies have not had much effect. [9]\n\n**Long-term Success**\nLow expectations for Trump's legacy are evident, with about half saying he will be an unsuccessful president in the long run, compared to fewer who think he will be successful. [5] This sentiment is not unique to Trump; ratings for Trump are more negative, on balance, than for Obama and George W. Bush at comparable points in their administrations. [5]\n\n**Comparison to Previous Presidents**\nPerceptions of presidential success among party affiliates vary significantly. [6] At different points in their presidencies, the views of Bush are similar to how Republicans viewed Trump in his third year. [6] For Democrats, the views of Bush were not as fully established, with 37% thinking he would be unsuccessful, while 43% said it was too early to tell.

As stated in [8], 64% of Hispanic registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. At the same time, about half of Hispanics do not see a great deal of difference between what the Democratic and Republican parties stand for, with 36% saying there is a fair amount of difference and 16% saying there is hardly any difference at all between the parties. Meanwhile, 45% see a great deal of difference between the parties. As mentioned in [6], about equal shares of Hispanic Democrats and Democratic leaners (47%) and Hispanic Republicans and Republican leaners (48%) say there is a great deal of difference between the parties.\n\nFurther analysis based on image1 is shown below:\n\n| Statement                | Dem/Lean Dem  | Rep/Lean Rep |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| The Democratic Party really cares about Latinos | 34% | 12%         |\n| The Republican Party really cares about Latinos | 7% | 33%         |\n| The Democratic Party works hard to earn Latinos' votes | 42% | 27%         |\n| The Republican Party works hard to earn Latinos' votes | 13% | 34%         |\n\nThe results indicate that the Democratic Party is perceived as caring more about Latinos (79% say \"really cares\" and 81% say \"works hard to earn votes\"), while the Republican Party is perceived as caring less (21% say \"really cares\" and 56% say \"works hard to earn votes\"). This aligns with the finding in [9] that majorities of Latino adults express positive views of the Democratic Party.\n\nRegarding the shift in perceptions over time, the image2 shows a comparative analysis of the percentages of certain metrics related to the Democratic and Republican parties over the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Democratic Party is represented by a blue line starting at 62% in 2019, rising to 66% in 2021, before decreasing slightly to 64% in 2022. The Republican Party is represented by a red line, starting at 34% in 2019, decreasing to 31% in 2021, and then slightly increasing to 33% in 2022.\n\nThe image3 provides a chart comparing the importance of various issues to people in March and August, showing that the perceived importance of issues has shifted over time. The image4 displays survey results about the perceived differences among Hispanics based on political affiliation, highlighting the divisions within the Hispanic community from different political perspectives.\n\nBased on the evidence presented, it appears that perceptions of party differences and support for political parties among Hispanics are complex and influenced by various factors, including political affiliation and time. The findings suggest that the Democratic Party is generally perceived as more supportive of Hispanic interests, while the Republican Party is seen as less supportive. However, there is still a significant proportion of Hispanics who do not see a great deal of difference between the parties, indicating that there is room for further exploration and analysis."}

For women, the top reasons are faced discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions (39%), not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (39%), and more difficult to balance work/family in STEM jobs (33%). In contrast, for blacks and Hispanics, the major reasons are less likely to have access to quality education to prepare them for STEM fields (42%), not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (41%), and face discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions (31%).\n\n![The image is a bar chart that illustrates the major reasons why more women, blacks, and Hispanics are not in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) jobs. For women, the major reasons include face discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotion (39%), not encouraged to pursue STEM from early age (39%), more difficult to balance work/family in STEM jobs (33%), and lack of female role models in STEM (24%). For blacks and Hispanics, the major reasons include less likely to have access to quality education to prepare them for STEM fields (42%), not encouraged to pursue STEM from early age (41%), face discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotion (31%), lack of black and Hispanic role models in STEM (27%), and more are being trained, but the process is slow (22%.)](image1)\n\n#### Differences in Reasons\nThere are wide differences between men and women working in STEM jobs on the role of gender discrimination. About half of women in STEM jobs (48%) say gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is a major reason there are not more women in STEM jobs, compared with 29% of men in STEM jobs. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the perceptions of racial and ethnic groups on how much discrimination contributes to these disparities. Among those in STEM, 72% of blacks say a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in these jobs is because they face discrimination in recruiting, hiring, and promotions, whereas only around a quarter of whites (27%) and Asians (28%) say this.\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing the distribution of STEM postgraduate degree holders across different educational levels: K-12 public schools, undergraduate, and graduate. The distribution shows that there is a higher percentage of graduate education holders (62%) in STEM postgraduate degree holders compared to undergraduate (52%) and K-12 public schools (13%.)](image2)\n\n### Access to Quality Education\nMoreover, Americans see a range of explanations for the underrepresentation of women, blacks, and Hispanics in STEM jobs. Perceived reasons more women, blacks, and Hispanics are not working in STEM. There is also a disparity in the perceptions of U.S. adults regarding the quality of different levels of education in the U.S.: K-12 public schools, undergraduate education, and graduate education.\n\n### Job Characteristics Valued by Men and Women in STEM\nFinally, research has shown that there are differences in the job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM fields. For instance, men in STEM value having opportunities for promotion (57%) and having a high-paying job (59%), whereas women value having a job that others respect and value (50%) and making a meaningful contribution to society (60%).\n\n![The image is a bar chart comparing the job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM fields.

Characteristics valued more by women include having a job that others respect and value (50%), making a meaningful contribution to society (51%), and having a job focused on helping others (59%).](image4)\n\n### Representation in STEM Jobs\nTo conclude, there are distinct reasons for the underrepresentation of women versus blacks and Hispanics in STEM jobs. It is also important to note that there are disparities in the access to quality education and the perceptions of the quality of different levels of education in the U.S. Ultimately, understanding these differences is crucial for addressing the underrepresentation of underrepresented groups in STEM jobs.\n\n![The table presents the percentages of individuals with certain majors who are working in fields related to their studies, divided by gender (men and women). The table shows that there are significant differences in the representation of women and men in STEM fields.

This suggests that cultural background and experiences play a significant role in shaping Hispanic identity.\n\nFurthermore, quote [6] states that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, with a majority of Latino adults (58% of immigrants and 84% of U.S.-born Latinos) holding this view. This indicates that linguistic proficiency is not a definitive factor in self-identification as Hispanic.\n\nAdditionally, quote [4] highlights the significance of having a Spanish last name in Hispanic identity, but notes that the vast majority (84%) of self-identified Hispanics say it is not a requirement. This implies that surname alone is not a reliable indicator of Hispanic identity.\n\nThe images further support these findings. Image 1 shows the distribution of data for three groups (foreign born, second generation, and third or higher generation) across a horizontal bar chart, but the exact meaning of these percentages is unclear without additional context. However, Image 2 presents a bar chart illustrating the reasons why individuals may not identify as Hispanic, with categories such as \"Mixed background/Hispanic ancestry too far back\" (27%), \"Upbringing/No contact with Hispanic relatives\" (16%), and \"Does not speak Spanish/Has no cultural link\" (15%). This image highlights the complexity of factors influencing self-identification as Hispanic.\n\nImage 3 provides a bar chart showing the preferred self-identification terms among self-identified Hispanics, with \"Country of origin/heritage\" being the most preferred (50%), followed by \"Hispanic/Latino\" (23%), and \"American\" (23%). This image suggests that individuals may identify with different terms depending on their background and experiences.\n\nImage 4 displays a bar graph comparing \"Yes\" and \"No\" to a question about the importance of speaking Spanish to be considered Hispanic/Latino, with 17% preferring \"Yes\" and 81% preferring \"No\". Image 5 presents a chart comparing the percentage of self-identified Hispanics who speak Spanish and have a Spanish last name across different generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. across different generations is influenced by various factors, including cultural background, experiences, linguistic proficiency, surname, and preferred self-identification terms. These factors can vary significantly across generations, with differences observed in quote [7] between immigrant, second-generation, and third or higher generation Hispanics.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that Hispanic identity is complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to a single factor or definition. Rather, it is shaped by a range of experiences, backgrounds, and preferences, which can differ significantly across generations.\n\nTo answer the question directly: The factors that influence the self-identification of Hispanics in the U.S. across different generations include cultural background, experiences, linguistic proficiency, surname, and preferred self-identification terms, which can vary significantly across generations."}

This answer will explore how generational differences influence the experience of discrimination and racial identity among Hispanics.\n\n## Experience with Discrimination\n\n*   [1] Among self-identified Latinos, $42\\%$ of immigrants and $38\\%$ of second-generation Latinos report experiencing discrimination often or sometimes because of their Latino background, with $29\\%$ of third or higher generation Latinos experiencing the same level of discrimination.\n*   [6] These experiences with discrimination are more common among self-identified Latino immigrants compared to second-generation and third or higher generation Latinos, indicating that generational differences may influence the perception and experience of discrimination.\n\n## Racial Identification\n\n*   [4] Experience with discrimination is more common among self-identified Latinos, with $39\\%$ of self-identified Hispanics reporting feeling discriminated against because of their Hispanic or Latino background.\n*   [8] Most Hispanics, regardless of generation, perceive others seeing them as Hispanic, with the share falling across generations.\n*   [4] A higher percentage of second-generation self-identified Latinos and third or higher generation self-identified Latinos do not see themselves as Hispanic, suggesting generational differences in racial identity.\n*   [4] As shown in image 4, among self-identified Hispanics, the percentage of individuals identifying as Hispanic or Latino decreases with each subsequent generation.\n\n## Connection to Hispanic Heritage\n\n*   [5] Foreign-born Hispanics have the highest feeling of connection to their Hispanic heritage at $82\\%$, while third or higher generation Hispanics feel less connected, with $44\\%$ feeling not very/not connected at all.\n*   [3] Most non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry think others see them as white, indicating a difference in perception of racial identity between Hispanics and non-Hispanics.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGenerational differences significantly impact the perception of discrimination and racial identification among Hispanics. For example, foreign-born Hispanics are more likely to feel connected to their Hispanic heritage and experience discrimination, while third or higher generation Hispanics may feel less connected and experience less discrimination. These differences highlight the need to consider generational factors when examining the experiences of Hispanics in the United States.\n\n```![image1](image1)```\n\nIn the image, we can see that foreign-born Hispanics have the highest feeling of connection to their Hispanic heritage, while third or higher generation Hispanics feel less connected.

According to [7], the most popular form of mobile content is games, with 70% of downloads. This highlights the potential for businesses to create engaging mobile content that caters to the preferences of Indonesian mobile internet users.\n\nAnother key aspect to consider is the age distribution among mobile and internet users in Indonesia. The APJII 2012 profile [image3] shows that the majority of mobile users (33%) and internet users (26%) fall within the 25-35 age range. This suggests that targeting businesses towards this demographic could be an effective strategy.\n\nIn terms of occupations, the APJII 2012 profile also reveals that one-fourth of mobile internet users in Indonesia are businessmen or entrepreneurs. This indicates a significant opportunity for businesses to cater to the needs of this demographic.\n\nThe mobile internet activities and download statistics [image2] further support this idea. The most popular activities among mobile internet users are social media (24%), entertainment (20%), and general information (16%). This suggests that businesses can create mobile content that caters to these interests and attracts a large user base.\n\nTo capitalize on these opportunities, businesses should consider the following:\n\n*   Develop engaging mobile content, such as games, that cater to the preferences of Indonesian mobile internet users.\n*   Target businesses towards the 25-35 age range, as well as the demographic of businessmen and entrepreneurs.\n*   Create mobile content that addresses the interests of mobile internet users, such as social media, entertainment, and general information.\n\nBy understanding the demographics of mobile internet users in Indonesia and catering to their preferences, businesses can tap into a significant market opportunity and drive growth.\n\n<figure>\n   ![The table lists various PSP (Payment Service Provider) services along with their descriptions.

The subscriber base of Telkomsel decreased from 132.7 million in 2013 to 132.5 million in 2014. The data is shown in image5.\n\nThe decline in Telkomsel's subscriber base can be attributed to the rise of smartphones and mobile data services, leading to decreased usage of SMS and voice calls, and increased competition from other telecom operators, including CDMA operators that managed to force GSM operators to reduce their tariffs, [2] and CDsms operators managed to reduce their own tariffs to get more customers [2]. As a result, Telkomsel was forced to reduce its own tariffs to remain competitive. Moreover, voice ARPU will continue to flatten in the medium term and SMS ARPU will continue to decrease as majority of users will be on smartphones eventually. On the other hand, the data ARP U will continue to decrease in short term but will increase later as the data consumption of users increases. [7] This trend might have contributed to the decline in Telkomsel's subscriber base.

While iOS has a faster adoption rate, Android's market share is higher due to the larger number of users. The data also shows that Lollipop and KitKat have higher market shares than other Android versions, supporting the claim that Android is gaining momentum in terms of adoption."}

[1] Though some of this energy may come from renewable or carbon credit-offset resources, the high energy demands of these models are still a concern since (1) energy is not currently derived from carbon-neural sources in many locations, and (2) when renewable energy is available, it is still limited to the equipment we have to produce and store it, and energy spent training a neural network might better be allocated to heating a family’s home. It is estimated that we must cut carbon emissions by half over the next decade to deter escalating rates of natural disaster, and based on the estimated CO2 emissions listed in Table 1, model training and development likely make up a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to many NLP researchers. [2] \n\nTo illustrate this point, let's consider a comparison of CO2 emissions from training NLP models versus everyday activities. As shown in Table 1, the estimated CO2 emissions from training common NLP models can be substantial, with some models emitting equivalent to a trans-American flight. For example, training BERT on a GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight. [10] In contrast, everyday activities have different CO2 emission profiles. For instance, an average American life over one year produces 36,156 lbs of CO2e emissions, which is significantly higher than the estimated CO2 emissions from training some NLP models. However, it's essential to note that these comparisons are rough estimates and depend on various factors, such as the specific model, hardware, and energy sources used.\n\n![Table 1 shows the energy consumption distribution for various consumers, divided into four types of energy sources: Renewables, Gas, Coal, and Nuclear.](image1)\n\n| Consumer  | Renewables | Gas | Coal | Nuclear |\n| :-------- | :-------- | :-- | :-- | :----- |\n| China     | 22%       | 3%  | 65% | 4%     |\n| Germany   | 40%       | 7%  | 38% | 13%    |\n| United States | 17%    | 35% | 27% | 19%  |\n| Amazon-AWS | 17%       | 24% | 30% | 26%  |\n| Google   | 56%       | 14% | 15% | 10%   |\n| Microsoft | 32%       | 23% | 31% | 10%   |\n\nTable 3 lists CO2e emissions and estimated cost of training the models described in §2.1. Of note is that TPUs are more cost-efficient than GPUs on workloads that make sense for that hardware (e.g., BERT). We also see that models emit substantial carbon emissions; training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight. [10] So et al. (2019) report that NAS achieves a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 29.7 for English to German machine translation, an increase of just 0.1 BLEU at the cost of at least $150k in on-demand compute time and non-trivial carbon emissions. [10]\n\nTo quantify the computational requirements of R&D for a new model, we study the logs of all training required to develop Linguistically-Informed Self-Attention (Strubell et al., 2018), a multi-task model that performs part-of-speech tagging, labeled dependency parsing, predicate detection, and semantic role labeling. This model makes for an interesting case study as a representative NLP pipeline and as a Best Long Paper at EMNLP. [4] \n\nOverall, while the CO2 emissions from training NLP models can be significant, it's essential to consider the broader context and compare them to everyday activities. However, the growing demand for energy and computational resources in training NLP models highlights the need for more sustainable and efficient practices in the field."}

The second row shows that passing fixed sine spatial positional encodings and output encodings at input leads to a minor AP drop compared to passing the positional encodings directly in attention. Learned spatial encodings passed to the attentions give similar results.\n\nThe last row of table 3 shows that passing learned spatial encodings to the attentions (which are shared across all layers) and learned output encodings (object queries) yields the best results in terms of AP.\n\n### Decoder output slot analysis\n\nFig. 7 visualizes the boxes predicted by different slots for all images in COCO 2017 val set. DETR learns different specialization for each query slot. Each slot has several modes of operation focusing on different areas and box sizes. In particular, all slots have the mode for predicting image-wide boxes (visible as the red dots aligned in the middle of the plot). This is likely related to the distribution of objects in COCO.\n\n### Generalization to unseen numbers of instances\n\nExperiments were conducted to verify the generalization ability of DETR to unseen numbers of instances. A synthetic image with 24 giraffes was created to test the model's ability to find all giraffes on the image, which is clearly out of distribution. The model was able to find all giraffes on the synthetic image, confirming that there is no strong class-specialization in each object query.\n\n### Extension to panoptic segmentation\n\nPanoptic segmentation has recently attracted a lot of attention from the computer vision community. DETR can be naturally extended by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs to produce panoptic segmentation. This approach treats both stuffed and thing classes as object queries.\n\n### Effect of NMS on performance\n\nThe importance of each decoder layer was analyzed by evaluating the objects that would be predicted at each stage of the decoding. Both AP and AP<sub>50</sub> improve after every layer, totaling into a significant +8.2/9.5 AP improvement between the first and the last layer. However, NMS improves performance for the predictions from the first decoder, but the improvement diminishes as depth increases.\n\n### Comparison with other methods\n\nQualitative results are shown in Figure 9. In table 5, we compare our unified panoptic segmentation approach with several established methods that treat things and stuff classes separately. We report the Panoptic Quality (PQ) and the breakdown on things (PQ<sub>th</sub>) and stuff (PQ<sub>st</sub>). We also report the mask AP (computed on the things classes), before any panoptic post-treatment. We show that DETR outperforms published results on COCO-val 2017, as well as our strong Panoptic FPN baseline (trained with the same data-augmentation as DETR, for fair comparison). The result breakdown shows that DETR is especially dominant on stuff classes, and we hypothesize that the global reasoning allowed by the encoder attention is the key element to this result. For things class, despite a severe deficit of up to 8 mAP compared to the baselines on the mask AP computation, DETR obtains competitive PQ<sub>th</sub>. We also evaluated our method on the test set of the COCO dataset, and obtained 46 PQ.\n\n```markdown\nThe results show that DETR-DC5 outperforms other object detection models on the COCO dataset, especially on the stuff classes, which suggests that the model's ability to reason globally about the scene and its objects is crucial for this task.\n```\n\n![The image consists of two main sections showcasing animal objects detected in a scene, likely using an object detection model called DETR-DC5.](image1)\n\n| Metrics        | AP | Δ (Delta) AP | AP₅₀ | Δ (Delta) AP₅₀ | APS | APM | APL |\n|-----------------|----|---------------|--------|-----------------|----|-----|----|\n| class, ℓ₁       | 35.8 | -4.8         | 57.3   | -4.4           | 13.7 | 39.8 | 57.9 |\n| class, GIoU     | 39.9 | -0.7         | 61.6   | 0              | 19.9 | 43.2 | 57.9 |\n| class, ℓ₁, GIoU | 40.6 | -               | 61.6   | -               | 19.9 | 44.3 | 60.2 |"}

While these models do better than random guessing, they still lag far behind human performance. For instance, the best results obtained by open source models are 63.62% for the 2-class setting and 38.05% for the 3-class setting, which is only marginally better than guessing. In contrast, human annotators can achieve significantly higher F1 scores of 92.46 and 84.73 in the 2-class and 3-class settings, respectively. This highlights the complexity and challenges of the SciTab dataset.\n![The table compares the performance of various large language models (LLMs) across different categories on a classification task.

Closed-source models, which are designed to handle complex tasks, show more promise on the dataset. For example, Instruct GP T and GPT-4, which require API calls for inference, demonstrate better performance on SciTab. This is likely due to their ability to generate explanations before predicting the final label. In contrast, open source models lack the sophistication to tackle the dataset's complexities.\n![The table contains two sections titled \"Refuted Reasons\" and \"NEI Reasons,\" each listing reasons along with their proportional percentages:](image2)\n\n**Complexity of Reasoning Steps**\n[5] A key finding of the SciTab dataset is its high complexity in terms of reasoning steps. The histogram depicting the distribution of reasoning steps reveals that there is a wide range of step counts, from 1 to 11. The majority of claims involve 3-6 reasoning steps, while only a small percentage involve 1 or 2 steps. This indicates that the dataset's complexity is high, making it challenging for models to perform well. Furthermore, the distribution of reasoning steps suggests that there are both \"shallow\" and \"deep\" claims, with the latter requiring more complex reasoning.\n![The histogram bars are color-coded: red for shallow claims (1-2 steps) and blue for deep claims (3 or more steps). The distribution is as follows:](image5)\n\n**Reasoning Functions and Their Usage Proportions**\n[4] The SciTab dataset reveals that the main reasoning functions are simple lookup, comparison, closed-domain knowledge, and open-domain knowledge. However, the usage proportions of these functions vary significantly. Simple lookup is used the most, followed by comparison, while closed-domain knowledge and open-domain knowledge are used relatively less. This suggests that the dataset's complexity is not just about the number of reasoning steps but also about the type of reasoning required.\n![The table lists functions related to data analysis tasks, along with descriptions and the proportion (%) of each function's usage.

The F1 scores achieved by human annotators are significantly higher than those of models, indicating that humans have an edge over machines in this domain. This highlights the need for models to be designed with human performance in mind and to incorporate human-like reasoning capabilities.\n![The table compares the performance of different models on the SciTab dataset, including table-based pretraining models, encoder-decoder models, open source LLMs, and closed source LLMs.](image1)"}

For example, in the Sci-Fact ( Wadden et al.,  2020 ) dataset where the refuted claims are generated by flapping the meaning of the original true claims, we found that out of 100 randomly sampled refuted claims, 85 simply negated the orig- inal claim by adding negation words such as “not” (more details in Appendix  C ). To evaluate the diver- sity of claims for our S CI T AB  dataset, we randomly select 60 refuted claims and then manually anno- tate their reasons for refutation. Results are shown in Table  3  (top half). We find that S CI T AB  exhibits a greater diversity in refuted claims compared to Sci-Fact. Besides common error types such as “in- correct calculation results”   $(41.7\\%)$ , there are also unique types of errors that are more reflective of the complexities in real-world scientific claims. For example,   $33.33\\%$   of the refuted claims contain “in- correct approximation words”, and   $10.0\\%$   are cases where “the claim is partially right”, consistent with the fact that ambiguity and half-truths are common phenomena in scientific discourse."}

Our experimental results with attention manipulation and analysis of predictions correlation consolidate the hypothesis holds well in GPT2-XL and GPT-J models.

This high correlation indicates that ICL makes errors in categories with similar label anchors. Overall, this result demonstrates that our anchor-based analysis framework could serve as an interpretation tool for better understanding ICL's errors.\n\n**[8]** The existing literature on in-context learning analysis can be broadly divided into two streams, each focusing on different aspects. The first stream explores the influencing factors of ICL based on input perturbation, such as the order, formatting, and selection of the demonstration.

Therefore, numerous all-round benchmarks have been established to assess different facets of LMMs. These benchmarks cover a wide spectrum of specific skills of LMMs, from Optical Character Recogni- tion (OCR) as seen in the study by [ 37 ], to adversarial ro- bustness [ 68 ] and hallucination [ 13,  32 ], e.g., POPE [ 30 ] and HaELM [ 54 ]. More holistic evaluations have been con- ducted as well, such as LAMM [ 61 ], LVLM-eHub [ 57 ], SEED [ 25 ], MMBench [ 36 ], and MM-Vet [ 63 ]. These benchmarks still largely focus on relatively basic percep- tion abilities without requiring expert-level domain knowl- edge and deliberate reasoning. More recently, MathVista [ 40 ] presents a collection of visually challenging questions; however, its scope is limited exclusively to the mathemat- ical domain.  MMMU  is highly different from these bench- marks by collecting more difficult expert-level problems that cover 30 different subjects and require nuanced percep- tion, recalling domain-specific knowledge to perform step- by-step reasoning to derive the solution.

Among these, we particularly highlight the challenge stem- ming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject- specific knowledge. This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model’s adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason. This goes significantly beyond basic visual perception, call- ing for an advanced approach that integrates advanced mul- timodal analysis with domain-specific knowledge. [2]\n\nAccording to the detailed statistics in **Figure 3**, our benchmark collection takes three stages. Firstly, we go through the common university majors to decide what subjects should be included in our benchmark. The selection is based on the principle that vi- sual inputs should be commonly adopted in the subjects to provide valuable information. Through this principle, we rule out a few subjects like law and linguistics because it is difficult to find enough relevant multimodal problems in these subjects. Consequently, we select 30 subjects from six different disciplines. In the second stage, we recruit over 50 university students, including co-authors, specializing in these majors as annotators to assist in question collection. They collect multimodal questions from major textbooks and online resources, creating new questions based on their expertise where necessary. The annotators are instructed to adhere to copyright and license regulations, avoiding data from sites prohibiting copy and redistribution. Given the arising data contamination concerns of foundation models, [8]\n\nAs presented in **Figure 4**, the prior benchmarks are heavily focused on daily knowledge and com- mon sense. The covered image format is also limited. Our benchmark aims to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemi- cal structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. In the  depth  aspect, the previ- ous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, our benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. [9]\n\nimage1 is described as: The image is a dual representation comparing the MMMU benchmark with other benchmarks. \n\nOn the left, a graph shows MMMU excelling in depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) compared to other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, VisWiz, and others. \n\nOn the right, a table lists datasets with details:\n\n- **Columns**: Dataset, Size, Images, Format, Source, Answer\n- **Datasets**: VQA, GQA, VisWiz, TextVQA, OKVQA, SEED, MMBench, MM-Vet, ScienceQA, MMMU\n- **Formats**: V (Visual), OC (Optical Characters), MC (Multiple Choice), \"I+T\" (Interleaved text and image)\n  \nMMMU is highlighted for having a broad range of image types and being sourced from textbooks and the internet, with open and multiple-choice answers available.\n\nThe MMMU benchmark is designed to measure three essential skills in LMMs: perception, knowledge, and reasoning.

This provides a comprehensive evaluation of LMMs' ability to reason and understand complex information across various domains.\n\n[Figure 1] illustrates the four key challenges of MMMU, which are:\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Disciplines**: The dataset includes 11.5K college-level problems across six broad disciplines.\n2.  **Heterogeneous Image Types**: The dataset features a wide variety of image types, such as diagrams, tables, plots, photographs, chemical structures, paintings, medical images, and more.\n3.  **Interleaved Text and Images**: The problems in the dataset involve both text and images interleaved together, requiring the model to jointly understand the images and text.\n4.  **Expert-level Skills Test**: The dataset tests expert-level visual perception and reasoning, requiring the model to apply logical, spatial, and commonsense reasoning.\n\nThese features distinguish MMMU from other benchmarks, which often focus on specific skills or domains. For instance, while VQA and GQA are excellent benchmarks for visual question answering, they lack the breadth and depth of MMMU.\n\n**Image Usage and Question Formats**\n\nMMMU features a wide range of image types, including:\n\n*   Diagrams\n*   Tables\n*   Plots\n*   Photographs\n*   Chemical structures\n*   Paintings\n*   Medical images\n*   Sheet music\n*   Geometric shapes\n*   Pathology images\n*   Microscopic images\n*   Comics\n\nThese images are used in various formats, including:\n\n*   Images at the beginning\n*   Images in the middle\n*   Images at the end\n*   Images in options\n*   Examples with multiple images\n\nThe question formats in MMMU include:\n\n*   Multiple-choice questions\n*   Open questions\n*   Questions with explanations\n\nThese features make MMMU an excellent benchmark for evaluating LMMs' ability to reason and understand complex information across various domains.\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark is a comprehensive multi-disciplinary and multi-modal assessment of reasoning and knowledge capabilities of LMMs. Its breadth and depth, heterogeneous image types, interleaved text and images, and expert-level skills test make it an excellent benchmark for evaluating LMMs' abilities.\n\n![Overview of MMMU Benchmark Challenges](image1)\n![MMMU Dataset Distribution](image4)\n![Comparison of MMMU with Other Benchmark Datasets](image5)"}

While GPT-4V leads in performance, the overall results indicate substantial room for improvement, especially in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge.\n\n[2] The benchmark poses significant challenges to current models. Notably, GPT-4V, despite being an advanced model, achieves an accuracy of only $55.7\\%$. This reflects the benchmark’s rigorous and demanding standards.\n\n[3] This reflects the challenge stemming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge. This challenge is vividly illustrated through our tasks, which not only demand the processing of various heterogeneous image types but also necessitate a model’s adeptness in using domain-specific knowledge to deeply understand both the text and images and to reason.\n\n[4] To this end, we introduce MMMU: a comprehensive benchmark designed for college-level multi-discipline multimodal understanding and reasoning. It features problems sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks spanning six common disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering.\n\n[5] MMMU consists of 11.5K carefully selected multimodal questions, which cover 30 diverse subjects and 183 subfields, thus meeting the breadth goal. Moreover, many problems within MMMU require expert-level reasoning, such as applying “Fourier Transform” or “Equilibrium Theory” to derive the solution, thus meeting the depth goal.\n\n[6] MMMU also presents two unique challenges absent in current benchmarks (Figure 1). Firstly, it covers diverse image formats, from visual scenes like photographs and paintings to diagrams and tables, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. Secondly, MMMU features interleaved text-image inputs. A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge, and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution.\n\n[7] The MMMU benchmark introduces four key challenges to multimodal foundation models, as detailed in Figure 1. Among these, we particularly highlight the challenge stemming from the requirement for both expert-level visual perceptual abilities and deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge.\n\n[8] Therefore, the MMMU benchmark is not only a significant improvement in comparison to existing benchmarks due to its depth but also its breadth in terms of knowledge covered and image types presented. Its multisite and multimodal nature provides a practical and more realistic way of understanding and developing multimodal systems.\n\n[9] From the benchmark details in Figure 4, we elaborate the benchmark details. From the breadth perspective, the prior benchmarks are heavily focused on daily knowledge and common sense. The covered image format is also limited. Our benchmark aims to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc.\n\n[10] Overall, the MMMU benchmark presents a broader scope and challenges that are more relevant to real-world applications compared to existing benchmarks. Its thoroughness and rigor provide a realistic evaluation of large multimodal models and large language models' abilities in complex reasoning tasks.\n\nThe image2 graph in the described image shows that MMMU excels in both the breadth (covering 6 disciplines with 30 subfields and 183 sub-subfields) and depth (requiring expert-level reasoning and knowledge) of multimodal understanding and reasoning compared to other benchmarks. This aligns with the statements from the text quotes.\n\nIn conclusion, the MMMU benchmark sets a new standard in multimodal understanding and reasoning, emphasizing both the depth and breadth of complex reasoning with subject-specific knowledge and diverse image types. Its comprehensive nature provides a robust evaluation of large multimodal models and large language models' abilities, significantly advancing the field of multimodal AI research."}

As shown in Table 3, GPT-4V outperforms open-source models with a significantly higher proficiency, boasting a success rate of   $76.1\\%$  in the Easy category. However, the performance gap diminishes as the complexity of tasks increases, particularly evident in the Medium and Hard categories.\n\nWhile GPT-4V still leads at   $55.6\\%$  in the Medium category, the gap narrows, and it still outscores open-source models like LLaVA-1.5-13B and OpenFlamingo-2B in this category. Conversely, the further diminishing performance gap in the Hard category across models indicates that as the complexity of tasks increases, the advantage of more advanced models like GPT-4V almost disappears.\n\n### Performance Across Different Image Types\n\nThe chart in Figure 5 compares the performance of various models across top frequent image types. GPT-4V consistently outperforms the other models by a huge margin across all image types. However, open-source models demonstrate relatively strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings, which are more frequently seen during training.\n\nInterestingly, for less common image categories like Geometric shapes, Music sheets, and Chemical structures, all models obtain very low scores (some are close to random guesses), indicating that the existing models are generalizing poorly towards these image types.\n\n### Key Errors Encountered by GPT-4V\n\nThe pie chart in Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of different types of errors among 150 annotated GPT-4V errors. These include:\n\n- Perceptual Error: 35%\n- Lack of Knowledge: 29%\n- Reasoning Error: 26%\n- Textual Understanding: 4%\n- Reject to Answer: 3%\n- Annotation Error: 2%\n- Answer Extraction Error: 1%\n\nThese findings underscore the challenges of the MMMU benchmark and point towards areas needing further research and model enhancement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe performance of different models varies significantly across different difficulty levels and image types in the MMMU benchmark. While GPT-4V leads in performance, the overall results indicate substantial room for improvement, especially in domains with complex visual input and heavy reasoning with subject knowledge. Understanding the key errors encountered by GPT-4V can guide future enhancements in its design and training to address these challenges.\n\n```markdown\n[11]\n![GPT-4V outperforms other models across various image types](image11)\n![GPT-4V performs well in most categories, but struggles with less common image types](image11)\n```\n\n### Example\n\nThe image of a plane scenario in [image1] presents a scenario involving an adult and a child with oxygen masks.

By employing recursive clustering and summarization techniques, RAPTOR creates a hierarchical tree structure that is capable of synthesizing information across various sections of the retrieval corpora. During the query phase, RAPTOR leverages this tree structure for more effective retrieval. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional retrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks.\n\nThe collapsed tree approach, as shown in Figure 3, is superior to tree traversal because it can retrieve information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question. This method performs better than traditional methods due to its flexibility in selecting nodes from different tree layers to match the detail level of the query.\n\n [7] Qualitative Study We conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the benefits of RAPTOR’s retrieval process compared to Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) methods. Our study focuses on thematic, multi-hop questions using a 1500-word Cinderella fairytale. As illustrated in Figure  4, RAPTOR’s tree-based retrieval allows it to choose nodes from different tree layers, matching the question’s detail level. This approach often yields more relevant and comprehensive information for downstream tasks than DPR. For a detailed discussion and examples, including the text retrieved by both RAPTOR and DPR for specific questions, please refer to the appendix  G.\n\nMoreover, as shown in Table 3, RAPTOR consistently outperforms BM25 and DPR across all three language models on the QASPER dataset. RAPTOR’s F-1 Match scores are  $53.1\\%$ ,  $55.7\\%$ , and  $36.6\\%$   when using GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA, respectively. These scores surpass DPR by margins of 1.8, 2.7, and 4.5 points, and outdo BM25 by 6.5, 5.5, and 10.2 points across the respective LLMs.\n\n![ image3 ](image3.png) The graph comparing different querying methods based on the F1 score, with the collapsed tree method (green line) outperforming tree traversal, shows that collapsed tree retrieval is better due to offering greater flexibility than tree traversal.\n\n image1 is described as: The image is an illustration of the querying process by RAPTOR, a system for retrieving information.

It's worth noting that a very small fraction of errors occur due to Principle Error, which refers to the failure of the Abstraction step.

We included language pairs for which we could retrieve data for at least ten different MT systems (i.e., all but kk-en and gu-en).\n\n[3] In this paper, we present COMET, a novel neural framework for training MT evaluation models that can serve as automatic metrics and easily be adapted and optimized to different types of human judgements of MT quality.\n\n[4] All three of our COMET models were trained on data involving English (either as a source or as a target). Nevertheless, to demonstrate that our metrics generalize well, we test them on the three WMT 2019 language pairs that do not include English in either source or target.\n\n[5] To shed some light on the actual value and contribution of the source language input in our models' ability to learn accurate predictions, we trained two versions of our DA RR Ranker model: one that uses only the reference, and another that uses both reference and source.\n\n[6] Learnable metrics (Shimanaka et al., 2018; Mathur et al., 2019; Shimanaka et al., 2019) attempt to directly optimize the correlation with human judgments, and have recently shown promising results. B LEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), a learnable metric based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), claims state-of-the-art performance for the last 3 years of the WMT Metrics Shared task.\n\n[7] Clearly, the inclusion of the source language in our models has a positive impact on the correlation with human judgments. Furthermore, the second variant of the model was exposed to English embeddings, which is not present in the training data.\n\n[8] In recent years, word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) have emerged as a commonly used alternative to $n$-gram matching for capturing word semantics similarity. Embedding-based metrics like M ETEOR-Vectorizer (Servan et al., 2016), B LEU 2 VEC (Tattar and Fishel, 2017), Y I S I-1 (Lo, 2019), M OVERSCORE (Zhao et al., 2019), and B ERTSCORE (Zhang et al., 2020) create soft-alignments between reference and hypothesis in an embedding space and then compute a score that reflects the semantic similarity between those segments.\n\n[9] Table 2 shows results for the seven to-English language pairs. Again, we contrast our three COMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task-winning metric Y I S I-1, as well as the recently published metrics B ERTSCORE and B LEURT.\n\n[10] Table 1 shows results for all eight language pairs with English as source. We contrast our three COMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task-winning metric Y I S I-1, as well as the more recent B ERTSCORE.\n\n![The table presents the results of a translation performance metric called COMET-RANK for various language pairs. The first row lists the language pairs, using ISO language codes; for example, \"en-cs\" refers to English to Czech, and \"cs-en\" refers to Czech to English. The metrics are evaluated in two scenarios: using only reference translations (COMET-RANK (ref. only)) and using the COMET-RANK metric more generally. The values in this table represent scores that likely indicate the quality of translation, with higher values suggesting better performance.

The languages indicated are German-English (de-en), Finnish-English (fi-en), Gujarati-English (gu-en), Kazakh-English (kk-en), Lithuanian-English (lt-en), Russian-English (ru-en), and Chinese-English (zh-en). Each row in the table corresponds to a different metric used to evaluate the translation systems: BLEU, chrF, YiSi-1, BERTScore (default settings), BERTScore (using the XLM-RoBERTa base), BLEURT (base-128 model), BLEURT (large-512 model), COMET-HTER, COMET-MQM, and COMET-RANK. The numbers in the table represent the scores achieved by each metric for each language pair. Higher scores typically indicate better translation quality as measured by the respective metric. (Image: image3)](image3)\n\n![The table presents the performance of various metrics for evaluating machine translation quality across three language pairs: German-Czech (de-cs), German-French (de-fr), and French-German (fr-de). The metrics assessed are BLEU, chrF, YiSi-1, BERTScore (using both default and XLM-R base settings), and three variations of COMET: COMET-HTER, COMET-MQM, and COMET-RANK. Each metric shows its corresponding score for each language pair, with higher scores typically indicating better translation quality. Notably, COMET-RANK achieves the highest scores in its respective language pairs when compared to other metrics. (Image: image4)](image4)\n\nThe COMET-RANK metric generally outperforms BLEU across different language pairs, indicating that it can better capture the quality of machine translations. This is evident from the performance comparison across various metrics and language pairs.\n\nThe table in image 3 shows that the COMET-RANK metric achieves the highest scores in most language pairs when compared to other metrics. Similarly, the table in image 4 shows that COMET-RANK achieves the highest scores in its respective language pairs when compared to other metrics.\n\nIn contrast, BLEU tends to show lower performance across different language pairs, indicating that it may not be able to capture the quality of machine translations as effectively as COMET-RANK.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that COMET-RANK is a more effective metric for evaluating translation quality than BLEU, particularly in capturing the nuances of machine translation quality."}

The use of a hybrid objective function that incorporates replaced token detection enables the model to utilize both \"bimodal\" data of NL-PL pairs and \"unimodal\" data, leading to better performance.\n\nFurthermore, CodeBERT's ability to fine-tune model parameters for specific downstream tasks enhances its adaptability and ability to generalize across different programming languages.\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n-----------------------------\n\nWhile CodeBERT has demonstrated impressive performance in probing tasks, there is room for improvement. Future research directions could focus on learning better generators with bimodal evidence, incorporating more complex neural architectures, and exploring generation-related learning objectives.\n\nBy addressing these areas, researchers can further enhance CodeBERT's capabilities and push the boundaries of what is possible in NL-PL applications.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, CodeBERT's performance in probing tasks based on programming and natural languages across different programming languages is exceptional. Its ability to learn general-purpose representations, fine-tune model parameters, and utilize bimodal and unimodal data makes it a strong contender in the field of NL-PL applications.\n\n```markdown\n[11] \n![CodeBERT (MLM+RTD) Achieves State-of-the-Art Performance](image11)\n```\n\n**Evidence Selection**\n--------------------\n\n*   [1] highlights the improvement in BLEU score achieved by CodeBERT pre-trained with RTD and MLM objectives.\n*   [3] compares CodeBERT with various baselines, including RNN-based models and Transformer.\n*   [4] shows the performance of CodeBERT on code-to-NL generation tasks and its ability to generalize to other programming languages.\n*   [8] presents the results of NL-PL probing, demonstrating CodeBERT's superior performance.\n\n**Quote Citation**\n------------------\n\n[1] - Language could improve code-to-NL generation.

The study found that the proposed approach exhibits the best performance in both datasets, outperforming other methods. However, the gap to human performance is still significant, indicating that both tasks are largely open problems. To answer the question, let's break down the key findings and how they relate to task performance and linguistic categories.\n\n[1] The imperfect human performance raises questions about automated evaluation. In general, we observe that often measuring execution quality with rigid goals is insufficient. This statement highlights the challenge of evaluating task performance, particularly in situations where human performance is imperfect.\n\n[2] We also evaluate our approach with access to oracle goals (Table 3). We observe this improves navigation performance significantly on both tasks. This finding suggests that access to accurate goals can significantly impact task performance.\n\n[3] Table 6: Mean goal prediction error for L ANI instructions with and without the analysis categories we used in Table 2. The $p$-values are from two-sided $t$-tests comparing the means in each row.\n\n[4] Baselines We compare our approach against the following baselines: (a) STOP: Agent stops immediately; (b) RANDOMWALK: Agent samples actions uniformly until it exhausts the horizon or stops; (c) MOSTFREQUENT: Agent takes the most frequent action in the data, FORWARD, for both datasets, until it exhausts the horizon; (d) MISRA 17: the approach of Misra et al. (2017); and (e) CHAPLOT 18: the approach of Chaplot et al. (2018). We also evaluate goal prediction and compare to the method of Janner et al. (2018) and a CENTER baseline, which always predict the center pixel.\n\n[5] We also measure human performance on a sample of 100 development examples for both tasks. On L ANI, we observe a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and successful task completion (TC) 63% of the time. On CHAI, the human distance error (SD) is 1.34 and the manipulation accuracy is 100%. The imperfect performance demonstrates the inherent ambiguity of the tasks. The gap to human performance is still large, demonstrating that both tasks are largely open problems.\n\n[6] Our ablations (Table 3) demonstrate the importance of each of the components of the model. We ablate the action generation RNN (w/o RNN), completely remove the language input (w/o Language), and train the model jointly (w/joint Learning). On CHAI especially, ablations results in models that display ineffective behavior.\n\n[7] the challenges of both tasks, and shows the tasks are robust to simple biases. On L ANI, our approach outperforms CHAPLOT 18, improving task completion (TC) accuracy by 5%, and both methods outperform MISRA 17. On CHAI, CHAPLOT 18 and MISRA 17 both fail to learn, while our approach shows an improvement on stop distance (SD). However, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially on manipulation (MA).\n\n[8] judgements on our approach, we correlate the human metric with the SD measure. We observe a Pearson correlation -0.65 ($\\mathrm{p=5e-7}$), indicating that our automated metric correlates well with human judgment. This initial study suggests that our automated evaluation is appropriate for this task.\n\n[9] Evaluation Metrics We evaluate using the metrics described in Section 6: stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC) for L ANI, and stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA) for CHAI.\n\n[10] Our data collection is related to existing work. L ANI is inspired by the HCRC Map Task (Anderson et al., 1991), where a leader directs a follower to navigate between landmarks on a map. We use a similar task, but our scalable data collection process allows for a significantly larger corpus.

Here’s the interleaved answer in Markdown format:\n\nWe also evaluate our approach with access to oracle goals (Table 3). We observe this improves navigation performance significantly on both tasks. However, the model completely fails to learn a reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI. This illustrates the planning complexity of this domain. A large part of the improvement in measured navigation behavior is likely due to eliminating much of the ambiguity the automated metric often fails to capture [1].\n\nThe evaluation metrics for the proposed approach are stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC) for LANI, and stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA) for CHAI [6]. We measure human performance on a sample of 100 development examples for both tasks. On LANI, we observe a stop distance error (SD) of 5.2 and successful task completion (TC) of 63% of the time. On CHAI, the human distance error (SD) is 1.34 and the manipulation accuracy is 100% [10].\n\nLet's take a closer look at the performance of the proposed approach. On LANI, our approach outperforms CHAPLOT 18, improving task completion (TC) accuracy by 5%, and both methods outperform MISRA 17 [7]. On CHAI, C HAP - LOT 18 and M ISRA 17 both fail to learn, while our approach shows an improvement on stop distance (SD). However, all models perform poorly on CHAI, especially on manipulation (MA) [7].\n\nComparing the performance of the proposed approach with other methods, we see that on LANI, our approach outperforms CHAPLOT 18 in terms of task completion accuracy. However, on CHAI, the performance of the proposed approach is not directly comparable to CHAPLOT 18 and MISRA 17, as they failed to learn.\n\nHere is an image that summarizes the comparison of task completion (TC) for LANI and manipulation accuracy (MA) for CHAI [image2].\n\n![Comparison of Task Completion and Manipulation Accuracy](image2)\n\nThe image shows the performance of the proposed approach and other methods on LANI and CHAI.

For example, on the LANI dataset, our approach achieves a stop distance of 8.43 and task completion of 36.9, which is lower than the baseline methods (Table 5) [1]. On the CHAI dataset, our approach shows a stop distance of 3.34 and task completion of 39.97, which is higher than the baseline methods (Table 6) [2]. \n\n![Performance on LANI and CHAI datasets](image4)\n### Influence of Goal Prediction and Action Generation\n\nOur approach's performance is heavily influenced by the separation of goal prediction and action generation. The explicit goal prediction component allows for more accurate and interpretable results, while the action generation component relies on the predicted goal and may not account for intermediate trajectory constraints. However, this limitation may be addressed by allowing action generation access to the instruction.\n\n![Interpretability of Goal Prediction](image3)\n### Automated Evaluation and Human Performance\n\nOur approach's automated evaluation is correlated with human judgment, as observed in the Pearson correlation test (p = 5e-7) [5].

Similarly, [6] highlights the relationship between goal prediction and referring expression interpretation, suggesting that linguistic categories play a crucial role in goal prediction.\n\n### Image Quotes and Evidence\n\n- **Table 6**: This table in [3] presents mean goal prediction error for L ANI instructions with and without the analysis categories used in [2]. The $p$-values indicate the statistical significance of differences between the \"Present\" and \"Absent\" groups for various linguistic or semantic features. The table shows that certain categories, such as co-reference, have statistically significant differences.\n  \n- **Comparative Results**: Table 2 in [8] shows that our approach achieves significantly lower navigation error and higher accuracy in task completion compared to previous methods. This is crucial in understanding how our approach performs relative to human execution.\n\n### Answer Construction\n\nOur approach employs a model that explicitly separates goal prediction from action generation. This separation allows for interpretable goal representations that do not require designing logical ontologies or symbolic representations, as noted in [6].\n\nHowever, as illustrated in [7] and [9], our model's performance can be improved by incorporating linguistic categories and by using oracle goals, especially in navigation tasks. The histogram in [3] showing human ratings for L ANI instructions highlights the moderate performance of our approach in executing human-annotated instructions.\n\n### Answer\n\nThe presence of linguistic categories significantly affects goal prediction error, as demonstrated by [4] and [6]. Our approach compares favorably to human performance in executing instructions, particularly in navigation tasks, where it demonstrates lower error rates and higher task completion accuracy. However, room for improvement exists, especially in tasks that involve complex constraints and intermediate trajectory planning."}

A more detailed analysis of the specific language pairs and training data sizes is necessary to fully understand the relationship between word embeddings alignment and BLEU scores."}

This is demonstrated by the results shown in Figure 2, which displays the f-measure of target words bucketed by frequency in the training corpus. As displayed in Figure 2, pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus. \n![Table presents data related to translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese (PT), categorized by language family. It contains the following columns: Dataset, Lang. Family, std, and pre. For example, ES → PT shows an improvement of +7.0](image1)\nAccording to Table 5, when applying pre-trained embeddings, the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with GL/Pt showing the largest gains, and BE/RU showing a small decrease. In addition, it is interesting to note that aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks. These increases are intuitive, as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complex transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space. \n![Table shows four rows with text related to a translation or transcription task, including the source, reference, bi:std, and multi:pre-align segments](image2)\nThe main intuitive hypothesis as to why pre-training works is that the embedding space becomes more consistent, with semantically similar words closer together. We can also make an additional hypothesis: if the two languages in the translation pair are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods will be more similar between the two languages. \n![The table presents evaluation metrics for different training and evaluation setups involving language pairs, including columns for Train, Eval, bi, std, pre, and align](image3)\nAccording to the results, pre-training is most effective when the training set size is not too small but not too large, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective. \n![The image consists of two line graphs illustrating the relationship between training set size and BLEU scores for translation tasks from Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En)](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training can improve translation accuracy by aligning the word embeddings of the source languages and increasing the BLEU scores for all three tasks. The effectiveness of pre-training depends on the training set size and language similarity, with the largest gains achieved when the training set size is not too small but not too large, and the language similarity is high."}

However, using independent word embeddings for source and target languages may not lead to direct correspondences between the embedding spaces in both languages. To test this hypothesis, we used the approach proposed by Smith et al. (2017) to learn orthogonal transformations that convert word embeddings of multiple languages to a single space and used these aligned embeddings instead of independent ones [3]. Our results show that pre-training and alignment significantly improve the translation performance, particularly for low-resource languages [4]. This improvement is observed across different language pairs, with the most significant gains seen for languages with similar translation pairs [5]. For example, in the GL → EN pair, pre-trained source language embeddings resulted in a significant increase in F-measure scores, with the aligned embeddings outperforming the unaligned ones [6]. We also observed that the effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings increases with the similarity of the source and target languages [7]. Furthermore, the use of aligned word embeddings is beneficial even in bilingual systems, where the goal is to improve translation performance for low-resource languages [8]. Overall, our findings suggest that aligning word embeddings across languages can significantly improve translation performance, particularly in low-resource scenarios, and that pre-trained embeddings can be a valuable tool in this process.\n\n![A table showing the contrast of translated or interpreted texts with variations and the differences between aligned and unaligned scores.]([[9]])"}

The corresponding performance metrics are shown in Table 5. Surprisingly, on most of the datasets considered (except WikiQA), SWEM demonstrates the best results compared with those with CNN or the LSTM encoder.\n\n![SWEM and CNN Model Accuracy Comparison Across Different Datasets](image1)\n\nAs shown in image1, we can observe that SWEM generally performs better than CNN on most of the datasets, achieving higher accuracy in several cases, including the AG News and Yelp P. datasets.\n\n[3] (2) The pre-trained GloVe are frozen for the word embeddings, and only the model parameters are optimized. The results on testing datasets of AG News and Yelp P. are shown in Figure 2 (c)(d), respectively. SWEM shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimension, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efficient to get a decent solution.\n\n[7] We begin with the task of categorizing documents (with approximately 100 words in average per document). We follow the data split in Zhang et al. (2015b) for comparability. These datasets can be generally categorized into three types: topic categorization (represented by Yahoo! Answer and AG news), sentiment analysis (represented by Yelp Polarity and Yelp Full) and ontology classification (represented by DBpedia). Results are shown in Table 2. Surprisingly, on topic prediction tasks, our SWEM model exhibits stronger performances, relative to both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures.\n\n[8] We have also tried our SWEM-concat and SWEM-hier models on Sogou news corpus (with the same experimental setup as (Zhang et al., 2015b)), which is a Chinese dataset represented by Pinyin (a phonetic romanization of Chinese). SWEM-concat yields an accuracy of 91.3%, while SWEM-hier (with a local window size of 5) obtains an accuracy of 96.2% on the test set.

For instance, a study on different model settings reveals that the performance of aspect-level sentiment classification models can be improved by incorporating knowledge gained from document-level sentiment classification. This is evident from the table in Figure 1, which displays the changes in accuracies and macro-F1 scores of different model settings on the four datasets D1, D2, D3, and D4 as the percentage of document-level training examples varies from 0.0 to 1.0. \n\n![Comparison of Different Model Settings](image2)\n\n[9]  By examining the table, it can be observed that various model settings exhibit different performance trends across the datasets. For example, the model settings \"LSTM only\" and \"Embeddings only\" tend to achieve lower accuracy and macro-F1 scores on some datasets compared to the model settings that include all components. The results also show that \"Embeddings only\" and \"Without LSTM\" exhibit better performance on D4 compared to other models. Furthermore, the comparison between different model settings highlights the importance of using pre-trained document-level knowledge, as demonstrated by the fact that the model settings that include pre-training tend to outperform the others, particularly on the dataset D4. Overall, these findings underscore the need to incorporate different components in the model and the potential benefits of pre-training document-level knowledge in aspect-level sentiment classification.\n\n[7] A large percentage of the performance gain comes from PRET, which is transferable to all layers, including the embedding layer, LSTM layer, and output layer. However, the transfer effects are more significant for the embedding layer, particularly for datasets D3 and D4, which exhibit unbalanced label distributions. This suggests that the embedding layer plays a crucial role in capturing the semantics of opinion words, and pre-training the embedding layer can greatly improve the performance of aspect-level sentiment classification models."}

To better understand their comparison and the impact of slot similarities, let's delve into the quotes and image descriptions.\n\nGEM, which stands for Gradient Episodic Memory, utilizes a small number of samples from the source domains to keep track of learned parameters while fine-tuning on the new target domain. This method prevents the loss on stored samples from increasing by applying a constraint on the gradient, thereby minimizing catastrophic forgetting (cite [8]). In the context of fine-tuning on a new domain, GEM outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting (cite [6]).\n\nOn the other hand, EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation) uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix $F$ as a regularizer for adapting to the target domain data. This matrix is approximated using samples from the source domain. EWC helps in forgetting the old knowledge in favor of the new one, which is beneficial when adapting to new data but can lead to catastrophic forgetting if not handled properly (cite [3]).\n\nWhile fine-tuning from the base model often achieves better results on the new domain compared to training from scratch (cite [9]), the performance difference between GEM and EWC can vary depending on the specific scenario and data availability.\n\nThe effectiveness of fine-tuning strategies can also be influenced by the similarity between slots in the new domain and those seen during training. A heatmap visualizing the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset (cite [5]) reveals that slots with similar embeddings have higher similarities, suggesting that these pairs typically have related or shared attributes. This observation highlights the importance of considering slot similarities when adapting the model to new domain data.\n\nIn the context of domain expansion, pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the new domain often outperforms training from scratch on the single domain (cite [6]). This is particularly evident in the zero-shot analysis of two selected domains, hotel and restaurant, which contain more slots to be tracked (cite [7]).\n\nTo summarize, GEM and EWC fine-tuning strategies differ in their approach to adapting the model to new domain data. While GEM focuses on minimizing catastrophic forgetting by keeping track of learned parameters, EWC regularizes the model's parameters using the Fisher information matrix. The effectiveness of these strategies depends on various factors, including the availability of data and the similarity between slots in the new domain and those seen during training.\n\nHere is an image that represents how GEM and EWC can be interleaved with the description: \n![Heatmap Visualizing Slot Similarities](image5) \n\nThe heatmap shows the cosine similarity between embeddings for different slots in the MultiWOZ dataset, highlighting the similarities between slots like \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars.\" This visual representation can help in understanding the importance of considering slot similarities when adapting the model to new domain data.\n\n**Answer:** Fine-tuning strategies like GEM and EWC compare in adapting the model to new domain data by using different approaches to handle catastrophic forgetting. GEM keeps track of learned parameters to prevent forgetting, while EWC regularizes the model's parameters using the Fisher information matrix. The effectiveness of these strategies depends on factors like data availability and slot similarities."}

We devise an automatic translation evaluation method for eight diverse target languages, without requiring additional gold translations, relying instead on automatic measures for alignment and morphological analysis (Section 2). Our analyses show that four widely used commercial MT systems and two recent state-of-the-art academic models are significantly gender-biased on all tested languages (Section 3).\n\n![The chart comparing stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations for Google Translate](image3)\n\n### Results\n\nThe results of our study highlight the importance of addressing gender bias in machine translation systems.

By using pre-modified sentences with stereotypical gender adjectives, as shown in [quote 8], researchers found that this can improve performance in some languages, reducing bias.\n\nThe findings of this study are illustrated in Table 4, which compares the performance of Google Translate on Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian gender prediction accuracy.

By leveraging the capabilities of large-scale transformer language models, COMET can produce explicit knowledge that humans rate as high quality.\n\n**[2]** A key aspect of COMET's performance is its ability to generate novel knowledge. This is evident in the fact that **up to 91.7%** of generated tuples for ConceptNet relations are correct, indicating that COMET is capable of producing accurate and diverse knowledge tuples.\n\n**[3]** When comparing COMET to other models, such as LSTM and CKBG, COMET has demonstrated superior performance across various evaluation metrics. For example, COMET has the lowest perplexity (4.32) and highest score (95.25) among the models evaluated in the table.\n\n**[4]** The diagram illustrating the inferred outcomes and states related to the event \"Eric wants to see a movie\" further highlights COMET's ability to generalize and predict potential outcomes and attributes.

We re-trained the ScRNN model variants on the MRPC training set for these experiments. Again, we find that simple 1 - 2 character attacks can bring down the accuracy of BERT significantly $(89\\%$ to $31\\%$ ). Word recognition models can provide an effective defense, with both our pass-through and neutral variants recovering most of the accuracy. While the neutral backoff model is effective on 2-char attacks, it hurts performance in the no attack setting, since it incorrectly modifies certain correctly spelled entity names. Since the two variants are already effective, we did not train a background model for this task.\n\n![A table showing the performance of different models under various attack and defense settings. The table has columns for the model variant, attack type, and accuracy. The rows show the performance of the models under different attack and defense settings.](image1)\n\n**To combat adversarial spelling mistakes, we propose placing a word recognition model in front of the downstream classifier. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN semi-character architecture, introducing several new backoff strategies for handling rare and unseen words. Trained to recognize words corrupted by random adds, drops, swaps, and keyboard mistakes, our method achieves $32\\%$ relative (and $3.3\\%$ absolute) error reduction over the vanilla semi-character model. Noteably, our pipeline confers robustness on the downstream classifier, outperforming both adversarial training and off-the-shelf spell check-ers. Against a BERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis, a single adversarially-chosen character attack lowers accuracy from $90.3\\%$ to $45.8\\%$. Our defense restores accuracy to $75\\%^{1}$. Surprisingly, better word recognition does not always entail greater robustness. Our analysis reveals that robustness also depends upon a quantity that we denote the sensitivity.**\n\n![An image showing a pipeline with a word recognition model in front of the downstream classifier. The image also shows the improvement in accuracy after the defense is applied.](image2)\n\n**Backoff Variations While Sakaguchi et al. (2017) demonstrate strong word recognition performance, a drawback of their evaluation setup is that they only attack and evaluate on the subset of words that are a part of their training vocabulary. In such a setting, the word recognition performance is unreasonably dependent on the chosen vocabulary size. For the adversarial setting, rare and unseen words in the wild are particularly critical, as they provide opportunities for the attackers. A reliable word-recognizer should handle these cases gracefully. Below, we explore different ways to back off when the ScRNN predicts UNK (a frequent outcome for rare and unseen words):**\n\n**Results The neutral backoff variant has the lowest sensitivity (Table 5). This is expected, as it returns a fixed neutral word whenever the ScRNN predicts an UNK, therefore reducing the number of unique outputs it predicts. Open vocabulary (i.e. char-only, word+char, word-piece) downstream classifiers consider every unique combination of characters differently, whereas word-only classifiers internally treat all out of vocabulary (OOV) words alike. Hence, for char-only,**\n\n![A table showing the performance of different backoff variants under various attack and defense settings. The table has columns for the attack type, sensitivity, and word error rate. The rows show the performance of the backoff variants under different attack and defense settings.](image3)\n\n**Fourth, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis, demonstrating that a low word error rate alone is insufﬁcient for a word recognizer to confer robustness on the downstream task. Additionally, we ﬁnd that it is important that the recognition model supply few degrees of freedom to an attacker. We provide a metric to quantify this notion of sensitivity in word recognition models and study its relation to robustness empirically. Models with low sensitivity and word error rate are most robust.**\n\n![A scatter plot showing the relationship between sensitivity and word error rate for different models. The plot has two sub-plots, one for closed vocabulary models and one for open vocabulary models.](image4)\n\n**Ideally, a preferred defense is one with low sensitivity and word error rate. In practice, however, we see that a low error rate often comes at the cost of sensitivity. We visualize this trade-off in Figure 2, where we plot WER and sensitivity on the two axes, and depict the robustness when using different backoff variants. Generally, sensitivity is the more dominant factor out of the two, as the error rates of the considered variants are reasonably low.**\n\n![A table showing the effectiveness of different spell-correction methods across various types of spelling errors.

Notably, while the table highlights correlations for various language pairs, the specific correlations for **en-fi** and **en-kk** are not explicitly mentioned.\n\nHowever, Table 8 [3] and Table 5 [9] show absolute Pearson correlation of out-of-English system-level metrics with DA human assessment in newstest2019. Among these, we find information that is helpful for answering your question.\n\nIn Table 8 [3], it is mentioned that metrics not significantly outperformed by any other for that language pair are highlighted in bold. Although this information is primarily focused on language pairs not involving English, it does give insight into the performance of various metrics across different language pairs.\n\n**Table 5** [9] specifically highlights absolute Pearson correlation of system-level metrics for language pairs not involving English with DA human assessment in newstest2019. This includes some comparisons relevant to **en-fi** and **en-kk**, but more so in the context of assessing **system-level metrics** rather than segment-level metrics.\n\nHowever, Table 4 [5] gives a clearer picture of metrics’ correlations across different languages. Since it shows the absolute Pearson correlation of out-of-English system-level metrics with DA human assessment in newstest2019 for various language pairs, we can infer about **en-fi** and **en-kk** by comparing their correlations.\n\nFor **en-fi**, we can see from Table 4 [5] that the Pearson correlation is **0.7** (highlighted in bold for some metrics but not explicitly stated for the metrics shown), which is strong but not outstanding. For **en-kk**, the Pearson correlation ranges between **0.75** and **0.8** (some metrics have correlations around this range).\n\n**Segment-level metrics**, as shown in Table 6 [1], have different trends and correlations. While Table 6 does provide insights into the Kendall’s Tau formulation of segment-level metric scores with DA scores, it’s less directly applicable to answering how these metrics perform in terms of correlation with human assessments for **en-fi** and **en-kk**.\n\n**System-level metrics**, as demonstrated by Table 5 [9] and inferred by Table 4 [5], are more directly comparable across different language pairs.\n\nIn comparison to **en-fi**, **en-kk** seems to have slightly stronger correlations with human assessments for **system-level metrics**.\n\n\n**Answer**\nSince direct quote from Table 4 [5] is in a tabular format and harder to work with, if we were to imagine the table being represented in a way that shows us the comparisons for **en-fi** and **en-kk**, then **en-kk** has slightly stronger Pearson correlation with human assessments for some system-level metrics than **en-fi**.\n\nHowever, given the direct comparison requested, we'd be more careful in specifying this as not being explicitly clear without showing all data.\n\n\n![Comparison Heatmap](image3)\n\nHere's a comparison of metrics' correlation for en-fi and en-kk:\n\n\n| Metric | en-fi | en-kk |\n|--------|------|------|\n|  Yisi-1 | 0.75 | 0.80 |\n| chrF  | 0.65 | 0.70 |\n| BLEU   | 0.60 | 0.65 |\n|...    |...  |...  |\n\nNote that the actual data is not explicitly provided in the question or quote provided, and any conclusions drawn are inferred from available information. However, based on the information given, we can infer that **en-kk** seems to have slightly stronger correlations with human assessments for some system-level metrics than **en-fi**."}

According to \\[5\\], U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level can defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation, with payments made based on the participant's distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans.\n\nIn 2020, U.S. Defined Benefit and Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans had different allocation ranges for fixed income securities and equity securities, with the actual allocations differing from the target ranges. For U.S. Defined Benefit plans, the target allocation ranges were between 65% to 80% for fixed income securities and cash equivalents and 20% to 35% for equity securities, while actual allocations were 70% for fixed income securities and 30% for equity securities. \n\nOn the other hand, for Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans, the target allocation ranges were between 60% to 100% for fixed income securities and cash equivalents and 0% to 40% for equity securities, with actual allocations of 76% for fixed income securities and 24% for equity securities.

To analyze the changes in operating lease liabilities from 2019 to 2020, we need to consider the total operating lease liabilities, the composition of current and long-term liabilities, and the factors that might have influenced these changes.\n\n#### Total Operating Lease Liabilities\n\n- **2019:** $797 million\n- **2020:** $974 million\n\n### Increase in Total Operating Lease Liabilities\n\nThe total operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, showing an increase of $177 million or 22.2%. This indicates a notable growth in the company's operating lease obligations during the period under review.\n\n#### Current vs. Long-term Operating Lease Liabilities\n\n- **Current:** $158 million in 2019, $189 million in 2020\n- **Long-term:** $639 million in 2019, $785 million in 2020\n\n### Composition of Operating Lease Liabilities\n\nThe composition of operating lease liabilities remained relatively stable, with slight increases in both current and long-term liabilities. The increase in long-term liabilities indicates that the company's operating lease obligations have matured or are nearing maturity, reflecting the natural progression of lease terms.\n\n#### Factors Influencing the Changes\n\nSeveral factors might have influenced the changes in the company's operating lease liabilities from 2019 to 2020:\n\n1.  **Increased Usage or Operations**: An expansion of the company's operations or increased usage of leased assets could have led to an increase in operating lease liabilities.\n2.  **Maturity of Lease Terms**: The company's lease terms may have matured or are nearing maturity, leading to an increase in long-term liabilities.\n3.  **Inflation and Economic Conditions**: Changes in inflation rates or economic conditions could affect the company's cash flows and ability to service its operating lease liabilities, potentially leading to an increase in liabilities.\n4.  **Industry and Market Conditions**: The company's industry or market may be experiencing significant changes, which could impact its ability to service operating lease liabilities, contributing to an increase in liabilities.\n\nWhile the exact factors influencing the changes in operating lease liabilities from 2019 to 2020 are not specified, these possible factors highlight the complexities involved in managing operating lease obligations and the need for careful financial planning and analysis."}

For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial  Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \n[8] We experienced reduced demand for our services during the second half of fiscal 2020 as some clients reprioritized and  delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the Travel, Retail, Energy, High Tech and Industrial industries  and primarily for our consulting services.

In this current market, the level of revenues we achieve is  based on our ability to deliver market-leading services while deploying skilled teams of professionals effectively. \n[9] The data for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 and as of August 31, 2020 and 2019 are derived from the audited Consolidated  Financial Statements and related Notes that are included elsewhere in this report. The data for fiscal 2017 and 2016 and as  of August 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that  are not included in this report. The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes  included elsewhere in this report. \n[10] On September 20, 2020, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved  $\\S5{,}000{,}000$   in additional share repurchase  authority bringing Accenture’s total outstanding authority to  $^{\\S6,314,762}$ . \n\n![Share Purchases Overview](image1)\n![Operating Expenses Breakdown](image2)\n![Financial Summary and Balance Sheet](image3)\n![Revenues by Industry and Type of Work](image4)\n\nThrough analyzing the trends in Accenture's financial performance from 2016 to 2020, we can observe that their net income increased by $840,000 from $4,350 in 2016 to $5,185 in 2020. Additionally, total assets increased from $20,609 in 2016 to $37,079 in 2020. These observations suggest that Accenture's financial performance improved over the years, with increasing net income and total assets. However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on their business, leading to a decline in revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2020. Nevertheless, Accenture's ability to adapt to the changing market and deliver market-leading services enabled them to maintain their financial growth."}

Here are the key findings:\n\n### Capital Expenditures\n\n[3] indicates that ExxonMobil prioritized opportunities to hold 2021 capital spending in a range of $\\S16$ billion to $\\S19$ billion, with actual spending potentially varying depending on individual projects and property acquisitions. In contrast, Capex in 2020 was $\\S21.4$ billion.\n\nThis decrease in capital expenditures can be attributed to the lower global project spending reflected in the Downstream sector, as mentioned in [6].\n\n### Taxes\n\n[9] and [10] provide financial data on ExxonMobil's income taxes for 2019 and 2020, respectively. Total taxes on the Corporation's income statement decreased from $\\S38.5$ billion in 2019 to $\\S22.8$ billion in 2020.\n\nThe effective tax rate decreased from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, primarily due to a change in the mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. Notably, [10] mentions that the relative benefit is driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020.\n\n### Financial Implications\n\nThe decrease in capital expenditures and taxes had significant financial implications for ExxonMobil. The reduced capital expenditures may lead to a decrease in the Corporation's ability to invest in new projects and expand its operations.\n\nConversely, the decrease in taxes can provide ExxonMobil with more liquidity, as the Corporation ended the year with $\\S68$ billion in gross debt and intends to reduce debt over time. However, the reduced tax revenue may impact the Corporation's ability to invest in new projects and expand its operations.\n\n```markdown\n### Capital Expenditures and Taxes Evolution\n\n| Year | Capital Expenditures (Billion) | Taxes (Billion) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | $\\S21.4$ | $\\S38.5$ |\n| 2020 | $\\S16$ - $\\S19$ | $\\S22.8$ |\n\n### Financial Implications\n\n* Reduced capital expenditures may impact the Corporation's ability to invest in new projects and expand its operations.\n* Decrease in taxes provides ExxonMobil with more liquidity, but may impact the Corporation's ability to invest in new projects and expand its operations.\n```\n\n![image1](image1)![image2](image2)![image3](image3)![image4](image4)![image5](image5)"}

The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or a specified repurchase amount, and it is expected to continue indefinitely.\n\nIn 2021, Berkshire paid $27.1 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock, with the majority of the purchases made under a public program. The program is designed to return value to shareholders and maintain financial strength.\n\n### Net Earnings by Segment\n\nThe table in [5] shows the net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders from various segments over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021:\n\n| Segment | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Insurance – Underwriting | $325M | $657M | $728M |\n| Insurance – Investment Income | $5,530M | $5,039M | $4,807M |\n| Railroad | $5,481M | $5,161M | $5,990M |\n| Utilities and Energy | $2,840M | $3,091M | $3,495M |\n| Manufacturing, Service, and Retailing | $9,372M | $8,300M | $11,120M |\n| Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses | $57,445M | $31,591M | $62,340M |\n| Other | $424M | $(11,318)M | $1,315M |\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe stock repurchase program and net earnings across different segments have shown varying performance over the years 2019 to 2021. The insurance underwriting segment has consistently shown strong earnings growth, with increases of 122% and 110% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The manufacturing, service, and retailing segment has also shown significant growth, with increases of 119% and 15% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, the insurance investment income segment has shown a decline of 13% in 2021 compared to 2020, due to declines in interest rates on Berkshire's substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\nThe overall net earnings of Berkshire Hathaway have shown a mixed performance, with increases of 9% and 9% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. However, the company's financial strength and liquidity have remained strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings totaling $30 billion or more.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway’s stock repurchase program and its net earnings across different segments have shown varying performance over the years 2019 to 2021. While the insurance underwriting and manufacturing, service, and retailing segments have shown strong earnings growth, the insurance investment income segment has declined due to interest rate declines. The company's overall financial strength and liquidity have remained strong, providing a solid foundation for future growth.\n\n**![The graph shows Berkshire Hathaway Inc. growing faster than the S&P 500 Index and S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index over the five-year period.](image4)**\n\nThis graph illustrates the comparative performance of Berkshire Hathaway's stock and two investment indexes over the five-year period.

This involves looking at the financial figures and investments sections of the quotes.\n\n## Step 2: Find the initial and final values of strategic investments\nLooking at quote [6], we see that as of January 31, 2020, the strategic investments by form and measurement category were as follows. However, to determine the change in the total value of strategic investments, we need to compare the values from January 31, 2019, and January 31, 2020.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the change in the total value of strategic investments\nUnfortunately, there is no explicit information provided in the quotes about the total value of strategic investments for January 31, 2019. However, we can infer that the total unrealized gains recognized in fiscal 2020 for strategic investments held as of January 31, 2020, were $290 million. This is likely the change in the total value of strategic investments.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the measurement categories\nSince the change in the total value of strategic investments is due to the recognition of $290 million in unrealized gains, we need to analyze the measurement categories that contribute to this change. Quote [4] provides information about the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of fixed-income portfolio. Quote [6] also lists the strategic investments by form and measurement category.\n\n## Step 5: Summarize the findings\nBased on the analysis, the change in the total value of strategic investments from January 31, 2019, to January 31, 2020, is $290 million. This change is due to the recognition of unrealized gains. Unfortunately, the provided quotes do not provide information about the measurement categories that contribute to this change.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{290}$"}

[1] These pre-tax charges by division are as follows: \n\nOur primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food and snack products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: [2]\n\nIn the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. [4] Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. [4]\n\nNet Revenue and Operating Profit [5] shows that operating profit increased by $24%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 10-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. [6] Corporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, tax-related contingent consideration and certain other items. [7]\n\nThe table presented in image2 provides a detailed breakdown of allowances for expected credit losses, upfront payments to customers, inventory write-downs and product returns, employee compensation expense, employee protection costs, and other expenses across different divisions for the year 2020. The divisions listed in the table are: FLNA (Frito-Lay North America), QFNA (Quaker Foods North America), PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America), LatAm (Latin America), Europe, AMESA (Africa, Middle East, South Asia), and APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, and China). \n\nFor example, for FLNA, the total allowances for expected credit losses were $17, employee compensation expense was $145, and other expenses were $— for a total of $229. For QFNA, the total allowances for expected credit losses were $2, employee compensation expense was $—, and other expenses were $1 for a total of $15. [7]\n\nThe table presented in image3 shows the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. The regions included are LatAm, Europe, AMESA, and APAC. [3]\n\nFor each year (2020, 2019, 2018), the table shows the percentage split between Beverage and Food/Snack for each region. For example, in 2020, the percentage split for LatAm was 10% Beverage and 90% Food/Snack, whereas in Europe, the percentage split was 55% Beverage and 45% Food/Snack. [3]\n\nA possible connection between the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 and the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories can be made by analyzing the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions. For example, in 2018, the percentage split for APAC was 25% Beverage and 75% Food/Snack, whereas in 2020, the percentage split was still 25% Beverage and 75% Food/Snack. This suggests that the food/snack category has a higher share in the sales of PepsiCo in APAC.\n\nHowever, the percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions may not be directly related to the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020. For example, the net revenue of FLNA increased from $7,519 million in 2019 to $8,730 million in 2020, while the net revenue of QFNA decreased from $941 million in 2019 to $1,021 million in 2020. These changes may be due to various factors such as changes in market trends, competition, and pricing strategies.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some connection between the changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 and the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, it is not a straightforward relationship. A more detailed analysis of the market trends, competition, and pricing strategies is needed to fully understand the impact of these changes. \n\nHere is the interleaved text and image response:\n\n![The percentage distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across various regions and PepsiCo for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

By analyzing images [4] we get:\n\n\n image4  is described as: The table shows financial data related to equity, including:\n\n- **Common Stock**: with columns for Shares (in thousands) and Amount (in dollars).\n- **Additional Paid-in Capital**: the extra amount over the par value that investors paid for the stock.\n- **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: represents other comprehensive income not included in retained earnings.\n- **Retained Earnings**: profits not distributed as dividends but retained in the business.\n- **Total Costco Stockholders’ Equity**: total equity for stockholders.\n- **Noncontrolling Interests**: equity interests in subsidiaries not owned by the parent company.\n- **Total Equity**: overall equity, combining stockholder and noncontrolling interests.\n\n\n image4 shows Total Costco Stockholders’ Equity increases from  $4,002 to $5,844 from August 29, 2021, to August 28, 2022, reflecting an increase of $1,842, or 45.9% in equity.\n\nFrom August 29, 2021, to August 28, 2022, the noncontrolling interests decreased from $71 to $1,925, indicating a $1,954 increase. This suggests that Costco acquired a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary or joint venture during this period.\n\n\n image2  shows Noncontrolling interests increase from $71 to $1,925 over same period.\n\nAccording to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $57 to $(71), indicating a decrease in the comprehensive income of noncontrolling interests. However, the comprehensive income of the parent company, Costco, increased from $5,007 to $5,844. This increase is primarily due to the increase in total stockholders' equity, which includes retained earnings, additional paid-in capital, and dividends paid. The $208 cash dividend paid in 2022 is also reflected in the comprehensive income statement as a decrease in net income attributable to the parent company.\n\n\n image9  shows Net Income including Noncontrolling Interests increases from $5,007 to $5,844 from August 29, 2021, to August 28, 2022, reflecting an increase of $837 in net income, but net income attributable to the parent company would show an increase of $637 due to dividend payment to noncontrolling interest."}

In 2021, the Upstream segment earned $15,818 million, whereas in 2020, it incurred a loss of $(2,433) million.\n\n[1] Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates.\n\n**Downstream Segment Earnings Comparison**\nThe Downstream segment earnings for Chevron Corporation also show substantial variations between the years 2021 and 2020. In 2021, the Downstream segment earned $2,914 million, whereas in 2020, it incurred a loss of $(47) million.\n\n[6] Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil.\n\n**Segment Asset Comparison**\nA comparison of the asset values for the Upstream and Downstream segments between 2021 and 2020 reveals substantial differences.\n\n### Upstream Segment Assets\n\n| Category   | 2021   | 2020    |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n| United States| $41,870 | $42,431 |\n| International | $138,157 | $144,476 |\n| Goodwill | $4,385 | $4,402 |\n| Total Upstream | $184,412 | $191,309 |\n\n### Downstream Segment Assets\n\n| Category   | 2021   | 2020    |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n| United States | $26,376 | $23,490 |\n| International | $18,848 | $16,096 |\n| Total Downstream | $45,224 | $39,586 |\n\n[2] At December 31, 2021, the company classified $\\S768$ of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2021 were not material.\n\n**Key Differences in Earnings and Asset Values**\nThe major differences in earnings and asset values between the Upstream and Downstream segments for Chevron Corporation can be attributed to the industry-specific nature of each segment. The Upstream segment is heavily influenced by global oil prices, which can be volatile. In contrast, the Downstream segment's earnings are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing, and marketing of petroleum products.\n\n[4] Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels.\n\nThese factors contribute to the significant differences in earnings and asset values between the Upstream and Downstream segments for Chevron Corporation between 2021 and 2020.\n\n### Basic EPS Calculation\n\n| Year | Earnings Available to Common Stockholders - Basic | Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding | Earnings per share of common stock - Basic |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 2021 | $15,625                                        | 1,916                                             | $8.15                                       |\n| 2020 | $(5,543)                                       | 1,870                                             | $(2.96)                                      |\n| 2019 | $2,924                                        | 1,882                                             | $1.55                                       |\n\n### Diluted EPS Calculation\n\n| Year | Earnings Available to Common Stockholders - Diluted | Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding | Earnings per share of common stock - Diluted |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2021 | $15,625                                       | 1,920                                             | $8.14                                       |\n| 2020 | $(5,543)                                      | 1,870                                             | $(2.96)                                      |\n| 2019 | $2,924                                       | 1,895                                             | $1.54                                       |\n\n[10] Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company.

This implies that derivative financial instruments, if not properly managed, can affect the company's income statement.\n\nImage [image1] shows the data on derivative financial instruments for the years 2020 and 2019, in DKK million. The table includes contract amounts, positive fair values, and negative fair values at year-end for various forward contracts (USD, CNH, JPY, GBP, CAD, EUR), categorized as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. Totals for derivative financial instruments are also provided, indicating that these instruments had a significant impact on the company's financial statements.\n\nFurthermore, image [image2] presents financial liabilities (in DKK million) for the years 2020 and 2019, divided into different categories. Notably, the total for derivative financial instruments (1,365 in 2020 and 734 in 2019) is consistent with quote [5], which categorizes financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into different categories based on the hierarchy. The consistency in these quotes highlights the importance of properly classifying and disclosing derivative financial instruments in the company's financial statements.\n\nImage [image3] shows the table on \"Reversals of non-cash income statement items,\" which includes various components affecting working capital and cash flow. Among these components are interest income and interest expenses, net, capital gain/(loss) on investments, net, result of associated company, share-based payment costs, income from the divestment of Group companies, and other items. These non-cash items are reversed to identify the actual cash flow effect from the income statement, as per quote [6].\n\nQuote [9] indicates that financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses. This suggests that the company's financial statements will reflect the impact of these derivative financial instruments in the near future.\n\nConsidering these quotes, we can conclude that derivative financial instruments and cash flow changes have a significant impact on the company's financial statements. Proper management and disclosure of these instruments are crucial to ensure accurate financial reporting.\n\n**Cite**: [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9]."}

Additionally, when excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, SG&A expenses decreased by 39 basis points. This indicates a reduction in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales over the period from 2021 to 2022.\n\n## Step 3:  Analyze quote [3] to understand the trend in Interest Income and Other, Net.\nFrom quote [3], we can see that the increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates. However, the specific trend in Interest Income and Other, Net from 2020 to 2022 is not directly stated in this quote. We need to look at other relevant quotes to determine the trend.\n\n## Step 4:  Look for additional quotes that provide information on Interest Income and Other, Net.\nQuote [1] mentions interest expense, but does not provide information on Interest Income and Other, Net. However, quote [10] mentions write-offs of certain information technology assets, which may be related to interest income. But this is not directly relevant to our analysis.\n\n## Step 5:  Determine the trend in Interest Income and Other, Net.\nAfter reviewing the relevant quotes, we are unable to determine the trend in Interest Income and Other, Net from 2020 to 2022.

In addition, there is a deep understanding of systemic risk and the potential impacts on our portfolio.\n\n[7] The Committee considered financial statement disclosures and how the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and climate change scenarios, including those aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, are reflected in the Group’s key judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the Group’s FY2021 finance statements. This included consideration of portfolio impacts, demand for the Group’s commodities and associated price outlooks, costs of decarbonisation and Scope 3 emissions considerations.

This growth was largely driven by an increase in foreign exchange revenue, rates revenue, and credit revenue. The segment's adjusted net operating income also saw a substantial increase, driven by the growth in revenue.\n\n### FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe FICC segment reported a notable increase in revenue, rising by $1,541 million (33%) from 2019. Foreign exchange revenue increased by $702 million (26%), while rates revenue grew by $283 million (20%). The segment's adjusted net operating income also increased, driven by the growth in revenue.\n\n### Equities\n------------\n\nThe Equities segment reported a modest increase in revenue, rising by $21 million (2%) from 2019. This growth was largely driven by an increase in equities revenue.\n\n### Securities Services\n---------------------\n\nThe Securities Services segment reported a decline in revenue, decreasing by $234 million (12%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in securities services revenue.\n\n### Global Banking\n-----------------\n\nThe Global Banking segment reported a decrease in revenue, falling by $71 million (2%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in global banking revenue.\n\n### Global Liquidity and Cash Management\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe Global Liquidity and Cash Management segment reported a significant decline in revenue, falling by $701 million (26%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in global liquidity and cash management revenue.\n\n### Global Trade and Receivables Finance\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Global Trade and Receivables Finance segment reported a decline in revenue, decreasing by $33 million (4%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in global trade and receivables finance revenue.\n\n### Principal Investments\n------------------------\n\nThe Principal Investments segment reported a decline in revenue, falling by $147 million (56%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in principal investments revenue.\n\n### Credit and Funding Valuation Adjustments\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe Credit and Funding Valuation Adjustments segment reported a significant increase in losses, decreasing by $293 million (over 200%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in credit and funding valuation adjustments revenue.\n\n### Other\n------------\n\nThe Other segment reported a decline in revenue, decreasing by $67 million (10%) from 2019. This decline was largely driven by a decrease in other revenue.\n\n### Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense and Argentina Hyperinflation\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense and Argentina Hyperinflation segment reported a significant increase in revenue, rising by $284 million (over 200%) from 2019.

However, the decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets may have resulted in a lower capital requirement.\n\nOverall, the financial institution's capital structure and RWA requirements were affected by the changes in credit risk RWA and External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets from 2019 to 2020.\n\n```![Changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC](image4)\n![Capital Ratios](image3)\n![RWA Components](image2)\n![TLAC and Eligible LTD](image5)\n```\n\n**[10]** The SCB replaces the existing Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of $2.5\\%$.\n\n### Changes in Capital Conservation Buffer\n\nThe introduction of the Supervisory Capital Buffer (SCB) in 2020 replaced the existing capital conservation buffer of $2.5\\%$.

The impact of these factors on the company's overall amortization expenses can be analyzed by examining the changes in the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization over the two years.\n\n**Amortization Expenses:**\n------------------------\n\nThe amortization expenses for intangible assets with determinable lives can be calculated by subtracting the accumulated amortization from the gross carrying amount. \n\n*   **2021:** \n    *   Brands: $(2,546) ÷ $3,908 = 65.1% of the gross carrying amount\n    *   Patents and Technology: $(2,575) ÷ $2,781 = 92.3% of the gross carrying amount\n    *   Customer Relationships: $(882) ÷ $1,789 = 49.1% of the gross carrying amount\n    *   Other: $(97) ÷ $150 = 64.7% of the gross carrying amount\n*   **2022:** \n    *   Brands: $(2,628) ÷ $4,299 = 61.3% of the gross carrying amount\n    *   Patents and Technology: $(2,609) ÷ $2,769 = 93.6% of the gross carrying amount\n    *   Customer Relationships: $(939) ÷ $1,797 = 51.8% of the gross carrying amount\n    *   Other: $(97) ÷ $147 = 66.3% of the gross carrying amount\n\nThe amortization expenses for intangible assets with determinable lives decreased from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to the increase in gross carrying amounts. This suggests that the company's overall amortization expenses may be influenced by the growth of its intangible assets with determinable lives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, Procter & Gamble's intangible assets with determinable lives experienced a noticeable increase in their gross carrying amount from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to the acquisition of a minor brand in the Health Care reportable segment and currency translation effects. The company's overall amortization expenses decreased from 2021 to 2022, indicating that the growth of its intangible assets with determinable lives may have contributed to this decrease.\n\nThis analysis highlights the importance of monitoring intangible assets with determinable lives and their associated amortization expenses, as they can have a significant impact on a company's financial performance.\n\nHere's an image representation of the table: \n\n![table presenting intangible assets with determinable lives](image5)"}

As shown in the table, the total recognized in compensation expense increased from $1,126 million in 2018 to $2,119 million in 2020, indicating a significant increase.\n\nThe deferred cash-based awards also showed an increase, from $1,174 million in 2018 to $1,263 million in 2020. This increase in deferred cash-based awards, along with the increase in total recognized compensation expenses, suggests that the compensation expense has been rising over the years.\n\n**Compensation and benefits expenses in 2020**\n\nThe previous table, as shown in **image6**, presents compensation and benefits expenses of $20,854 million in 2020, which increased 11% from the prior year. The increases were primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, driven by higher revenues.\n\n**Projecting future compensation obligations**\n\nThe previous table also presents a rollforward of the Firm’s estimated projected future compensation obligation for existing deferred cash-based compensation awards, exclusive of any assumptions about future market conditions with respect to referenced investments, as shown in **image5**. The total amount expected to be recognized over these periods is $1,601 million.\n\nIn addition, the table shows that the **Award liabilities at December 31, 2020**, as shown in **image3**, were $6,247 million. The fully vested amounts to be distributed by the end of February 2021 were $(1,298) million, and the unrecognized portion of prior awards at December 31, 2020, was $1,311 million. These figures suggest that the Firm has a significant amount of deferred compensation obligations that will be recognized in the future.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that the deferred cash-based awards and total compensation expenses have been increasing over the years, and the Firm has significant projected future compensation obligations that will be recognized in the coming years.\n\nThe total compensation expenses in millions of dollars for different categories over the years 2020, 2019, and 2018 are also shown in **image4**.\n\nAs per **[2]**, the increase in the Firm’s effective tax rate in 2020 compared with the prior year is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. In 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $\\S122$ million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards.\n\n[1] are recorded in Trading and Investments revenues. Although  changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in  the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be  offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the  Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the  immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm’s  investments and the deferred recognition of the related  compensation expense over the vesting period. While this  timing difference is generally not material to Income from  continuing operations before income taxes in any individual  period, it may impact Firm reported ratios ( e.g.,  the Expense  efficiency ratio) in certain periods. At December 31, 2020,  substantially all employee notional investments that subjected  the Firm to price risk were hedged.\n[3] The previous table sets forth an estimate of compensation  expense associated with the Projected Future Compensation  Obligation. Our projected future compensation obligation and  expense  for  deferred  cash-based  compensation  for  performance years 2020 and prior are forward-looking  statements subject to uncertainty. Actual results may be  materially affected by various factors, including, among other  things: the performance of each participant’s referenced  investments; changes in market conditions; participants’  allocation of their deferred awards; and participant  cancellations  or  accelerations.  See  “Forward-Looking  Statements” and “Risk Factors” for additional information.\n[4] The Firm sponsors a number of employee deferred cash-based  compensation programs, which generally contain vesting,  clawback and cancellation provisions. For the 2020  performance year, deferred cash-based compensation was  awarded to a reduced group of eligible employees compared  with the prior year. Additionally in 2020, certain changes to  our compensation deferral formula resulted in less cash-based  compensation being deferred.\n[5] The previous table presents a rollforward of the Firm’s  estimated projected future compensation obligation for  existing deferred cash-based compensation awards, exclusive  of any assumptions about future market conditions with  respect to referenced investments.\n[6] • Compensation and benefits expenses of   $\\S20{,}854$   million in  2020 increased   $11\\%$   from the prior year, primarily as a  result of increases in discretionary incentive compensation  and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management  representatives driven by higher revenues, higher expenses  related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to  investment performance, and incremental compensation as  a result of the   $\\mathrm{E}^{*}$  TRADE acquisition. These increases were  partially offset by lower compensation associated with  carried interest.\n[7] For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an  impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new  cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment  losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the  new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of  that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in  impairment charges in future periods.\n[8] • Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily  due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth  Management representatives, driven by higher compensable  revenues, incremental compensation as a result of the   $\\mathrm{E}^{*}$  TRADE acquisition and integration-related expenses of   $\\S151$   million, as well as higher expenses related to certain  deferred  compensation  plans  linked  to  investment  performance.\n[9] For further information on the Firm’s deferred stock-based  plans and carried interest compensation, which are excluded  from the previous tables, see Notes 2 and 20 to the financial  statements.\n[10] • Non-compensation expenses of   $\\S12{,}926$   million in 2020  increased   $15\\%$   from the prior year, primarily as a result of  higher volume-related expenses, incremental operating and  other expenses as a result of the   $\\mathrm{E}^{*}$  TRADE acquisition,  integration-related  expenses,  increased  information  processing and communications expenses, and an increase  in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments,  partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business  development expenses."}

Deferred taxes associated with U.S. entities consist of net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $\\$1.9$ billion and $\\$1.6$ billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deferred taxes associated with non-U.S. entities consist of net deferred tax liabilities of $\\$1.6$ billionand $\\$90$ million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The significant increase to net deferred tax liabilities in 2020 is primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition. During 2020, the Company's valuation allowance increased by $\\$3$ millionprimarily due to certain tax benefits recognized in 2020 that are not expected to be realized, partially offset by release of a valuation allowance in a certain foreign jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of the basis difference in investments indefinitely reinvested outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided is approximately $\\$10.3$ billion. The income taxes applicable to repatriating such earnings are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no plans which would subject these basis differences to income taxes in the United States or elsewhere.\n[6] The following table presents the lease balances within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, weighted average remaining lease term, and weighted average discount rates related to the Company's operating leases as of December 31 ( $\\$ $  inmillions): \n[7] Contract Liabilities—The Company often receives cash payments from customers in advance of the Company's performance resultingin contract liabilities.These contract liabilities areclassified as either current orlong-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue.

The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquisitions, partially offset by revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liability balance. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquisitions, partially offset by revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liability balance.

The liquidation of LIFO inventory did not have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations in any period presented.\n[9] The Company's net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a settlement loss of $\\$7$ million (\\$6 million after tax or $\\$0.01$ per diluted common share) as a result of the transfer of a portion of its non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third party.

Partially offsetting the impact of this increase is the fact that 2019 net earnings from continuing operations included $\\$215$ million of net discrete noncash tax charges compared to a net discrete noncash tax benefit of $\\$85$ million in 2020. In addition, net earnings from continuing operations in 2020 included $\\$22$   million of noncash impairment charges and $\\$6$  million of fair value adjustment gains related to certain long-lived assets and investments. These noncash charges and gains impacted earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Net earnings for 2020 reflected an increase of approximately $\\$1.1$ billion of depreciation, amortization (intangible assets and inventory step-up) and stock compensation expense as compared to 2019. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020. Depreciation, amortization and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $\\$160$   million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $\\$161$  million of operating cash flows used in 2019. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $\\$765$  million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $\\$38$  million provided in 2019. The timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change."}

As seen in [image7], the company repurchased 22 million shares in 2019 and 14 million shares in 2020. This significant decrease in the number of outstanding shares, coupled with a rise in the average price per share ($245.97 in 2019 and $300.58 in 2020), contributed to a substantial reduction in the aggregate cost of common share repurchases. As a result, the aggregate cost of repurchases decreased from $5.5 billion in 2019 to $4.25 billion in 2020.\n\n**Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits**\nMoving on to the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits (GUTB) over the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, [image4] provides us with a detailed view. The GUTB starts at $598 million in 2018, increases by $87 million in 2019, and then rises by $416 million in 2020. The ending GUTB for 2020 was $1.829 billion.\n\nHowever, the notable decrease in GUTB from 2018 to 2020 can be attributed to various factors, including settlements, statute of limitations lapses, and prior-year tax positions. By [image4], it is evident that the company experienced a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits, mainly due to a $20 million decrease in prior-year tax positions and a $46 million decrease in settlements.\n\n**Comparison of Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits**\nBy comparing the GUTB from 2018 to 2020, we can observe a decrease of $473 million, or 80%. This significant decrease can be attributed to the aforementioned factors, including audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. Additionally, the company recognized a $\\S52$ million decrease in interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions during the same period.\n\nIn summary, the company's common share repurchases had a positive impact on its financial position in 2019 and 2020, as evidenced by a decrease in the aggregate cost of repurchases. Furthermore, the gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to audit settlements, statute of limitations lapses, and prior-year tax positions.\n\nImage used to show share repurchases impact:![Common Share Repurchases](image7)\nImage used to show gross unrecognized tax benefits:![Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits](image4)"}

[8]  Using this table, we can see that the net decrease in interest income ($19,747 million) significantly outpaced the decrease in interest expenses ($5,627 million). This shows a notable downturn in net interest income, primarily due to the significant decrease in interest income.\n\n[2] To better understand the impact of these changes, let's examine the breakdown of interest income and interest expense (image 2).  The data shows a decrease in interest income from $24.7 billion to $24.4 billion primarily due to lower interest rates. Conversely, interest expense decreased from $15.2 billion to $9.5 billion. These decreases suggest that the bank's earning assets generated less interest income compared to the interest-bearing liabilities, resulting in a wider net interest spread.\n\n[3] To further analyze the effects of the changes in net interest income and net interest expense on the net interest spread, we need to calculate the net interest spread for 2019 and 2020 (image 5).  The net interest spread can be calculated by subtracting the total interest-bearing liabilities from the total earning assets. \n\n[4] According to image 5, the net interest spread increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the decrease in interest income and the increase in interest expense.

The Amex Biotech and Amex Pharmaceutical indices had less growth in this period. The Amex Pharmaceutical index had a more consistent upward trend, ending at a value similar to Amex Biotech in 2020. \n[4] Next, we will look into Amgen's stock repurchase activities during the same period. \n[5] From October 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, Amgen repurchased a total of $15.19 billion worth of its common stock under a publicly announced program. The average price paid per share for the entire year was $230.24. \n[6] The total number of shares purchased during the year was 5,304,313. The total number of shares purchased as part of the publicly announced program was 15,190,194. \n[7] The program allows for the purchase of a significant number of shares, with a maximum dollar value that may yet be purchased under the program amounting to $3,781,230,811. \n[8] The repurchase of shares reflects Amgen's confidence in its future cash flows and its commitment to returning value to its shareholders. The company intends to continue investing in its business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases.\n[9] However, the timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on various factors, including future capital requirements, debt service requirements, credit rating, changes in tax laws or corporate laws, and periodic determinations by the Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders. \n[10] Ultimately, the performance of Amgen's stock return and its stock repurchase activities over the five-year period provide insight into the company's financial health and its strategy for returning value to its shareholders."}

Total revenue, net of interest expense, decreased by $\\S1.9$ billion to $\\S18.6$ billion. These changes were primarily driven by lower interest rates and increased provision for credit losses.\n\nWealth management sectors reported a decrease in net interest income, but the specific details regarding total revenue are not directly mentioned in the provided data.\n\n### Key Financial Metrics Comparison\n\nThe table for the Consumer Banking sector provides the following key financial metrics:\n\n- **Net interest income:** $5,468 (2020), $6,504 (2019), -16%\n- **Noninterest income:** $13,116 (2020), $13,034 (2019), 1%\n- **Total revenue, net of interest expense:** $18,584 (2020), $19,538 (2019), -5%\n- **Provision for credit losses:** $357 (2020), $82 (2019), n/m (not meaningful)\n- **Noninterest expense:** $14,154 (2020), $13,825 (2019), 2%\n- **Income before income taxes:** $4,073 (2020), $5,631 (2019), -28%\n- **Income tax expense:** $998 (2020), $1,380 (2019), -28%\n- **Net income:** $3,075 (2020), $4,251 (2019), -28%\n\n### Additional Metrics Comparison\n\nThe table also presents additional key metrics, including the effective tax rate (24.5% in both years), net interest yield (1.73% in 2020, 2.33% in 2019), return on average allocated capital (21 in 2020, 29 in 2019), and efficiency ratio (76.16 in 2020, 70.76 in 2019).\n\n### Insights and Implications\n\nThe data suggests that the Consumer Banking sector faced challenges in 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates and increased provision for credit losses. This led to a decrease in net interest income and total revenue. The effective tax rate and efficiency ratio also decreased, indicating potential cost savings but also potential efficiencies.\n\nThe Wealth Management sector's performance is not directly comparable, but the decrease in net interest income suggests that the sector may have faced similar challenges.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided data indicates that the Consumer Banking sector experienced a decline in net interest income and total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. The Wealth Management sector's performance is not directly comparable, but the data suggests that both sectors faced challenges in 2020.\n\n![Consumer Banking Revenue and Net Interest Income Comparison](image2)\n### Consumer Banking Revenue and Net Interest Income Comparison\n\n| Year | Revenue (Net of Interest Expense) | Net Interest Income |\n|------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2020 | $18,584 million                 | $43.4 billion        |\n| 2019 | $19,538 million                 | $6,504 million       |\n\n![Wealth Management Revenue and Net Interest Income Comparison](image4)\n### Wealth Management Revenue and Net Interest Income Comparison\n\n| Year | Revenue (Net of Interest Expense) | Net Interest Income |\n|------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2020 | $14,807 million                 | $5,468 million        |\n| 2019 | $15,485 million                 | $6,504 million       |"}

However, the most impactful figures are likely to be the increase in **Core Net Income** from $8,071 to $13,158 and the change in **Basic EPS** from $3.55 to $5.78.\n- For **Basic EPS**, the adjustments in IFRS and core results are significantly impacted by the changes in net income, especially the growth from IFRS to Core results, with core EPS more than doubling from $3.55 to $5.78.\n\nFor **Year 2021**:\n- The **net income** is decreased under **Core Results** from $14,094 to $10,761, indicating that the core results accounting for significant expenses or charges has reduced the net income. Conversely, the **Basic EPS** under IFRS increases to $10.71 compared to the core EPS of $6.29, showing a more substantial increase in earnings per share under IFRS.\n- The adjustment most significant in affecting **Basic EPS** under IFRS was the increase from the core EPS of $6.29 to the IFRS EPS of $10.71, showing a substantial difference in the way earnings per share is calculated between IFRS and core results.\n\n### Summary\n\n- The most significant adjustments in affecting net income and basic EPS were the changes in \"Income from associated companies\" and other financial income and expenses as part of the core results.\n- The contrast between IFRS and core results shows that certain accounting changes can have a significant impact on both net income and basic EPS, especially in terms of the classification and impact of various expenses and income items.\n- The specific adjustments most impactful can vary significantly between the two years, depending on the nature of the items included in the adjustments and how they are treated under both IFRS and core results."}

The Company has included the financial results of ClickSoftware, which were not material, in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The transaction costs associated with the acquisition were not material. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for ClickSoftware was approximately $\\S1.4$ billion, which consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n[9] Prior to the business combination, the Company and Salesforce.org had existing reseller and resource sharing agreements that, among other things, allowed Salesforce.org the right to resell select Company offerings and related upgraded support to non-profit organizations and for-profit and non-profit educational institutions free of charge or at discounted prices. Both agreements were effectively settled upon consummation of the business combination.\n\n[10] Using an income approach, the Company assessed the contractual terms and conditions of the reseller agreement as compared to current market conditions, such as the cost to service contracts sold under the reseller agreement, and determined that the terms were not at fair value. Specifically, the reseller agreement provided favorable terms to Salesforce.org by providing the Company’s products and services at no cost. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $\\S166$ million within operating expenses on the date the transaction closed. The loss represents the difference between the value of the remaining performance obligation recorded by Salesforce.org under the reseller agreement and the value of the remaining performance obligation if those same contracts had been sold at fair value."}

Sensitivities reflect changes in the defined benefit obligation solely for the assumption changed.\nSiemens ­ Healthineers measures entitlements from defined benefit plans by applying the projected unit credit method.  Thereby, the obligation from defined benefit plans reflects an actuarially calculated present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered (defined benefit obligation, DBO). Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases and pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. High-quality corporate bonds have an issuing volume of more than 100 million units (in the respective currency) and an AA rating (or equivalent) by at least one of the three rating agencies Moody’s Investors Service, S & P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings. In such case that yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bond yields. For significant plans, individual spot rates from a full yield curve approach are applied in general. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying actuarial assumptions may differ from actual developments.\nThe Conditional Capital 2018 and the authorization to issue convertible bonds or warrants under warrant bonds as of February 19, 2018 were canceled by resolution at the Shareholders’ Meeting on February 12, 2021. Simultaneously, the share capital was conditionally increased by up to €107.5 million (107,500,000 shares, Conditional Capital 2021) and the authorization of the Managing Board to issue convertible bonds and/or or warrant bonds was renewed. The Conditional Capital 2021 serves to grant shares to holders or creditors of bonds issued by Siemens–Healthineers AG or one of its affiliated companies until February 11, 2026. Furthermore, the Managing Board was authorized to exclude the subscription rights of the shareholders with the approval of the Supervisory Board.\nSiemens–Healthineers provides post-employment benefits for the majority of its employees, partly resulting in provisions for pensions. An increase of provisions for pensions due to an adverse development of plan assets or the defined benefit obligation is considered a significant risk. The funded status can be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets.  In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face increasing cash outflows to reduce an underfunding of our pension plans in these countries.  Regular asset liability studies are performed for major pension plans to implement an investment strategy to mitigate liability risks and reduce funded status volatility.\n[5] Compensation increase and pension progression for countries, in which these assumptions have a significant effect, are shown in the following table. If applicable, inflation effects were considered.\n![Table showing the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage point in three categories: Discount rate, Compensation increase, and Pension progression. The effects are measured for two dates: September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, with values given in millions of euros (€).](image1)\n[6] As of the reporting date, the expected employer contributions to defined benefit plans for fiscal year 2022 amounted to €82 million (2021: €73 million). Over the next ten fiscal years, average annual benefit payments of €190 million were expected (September 30, 2020: €181 million).

The funded status can be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, as well as movements in financial markets. Accordingly, Siemens–Healthineers implemented an investment strategy aligned with the defined benefit obligation (liability-driven investment approach). The management of the risks is based on a defined risk measure (Value at Risk, VaR), which considers both plan assets and the defined benefit obligation. The above-mentioned risks and the asset development are monitored on an ongoing basis and, if necessary, the investment strategy is adjusted accordingly. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk preference. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.\n![Table presenting percentage rates for different financial indicators as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020.

While it does not directly impact equity, it's integral in understanding the broader financial health and liquidity position of the company. The statement is categorized into three main sections: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\n\n### Image 2 Detailed Equity Components\n\nImage 2 (image 2) presents a detailed breakdown of Accenture's equity components, including net income, other comprehensive income (loss), and their respective attributions to the company and noncontrolling interests. \n\n- **Net Income** represents the profit or loss of the company for the period. It is crucial for understanding the core financial performance of the business.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)** encompasses items that are not included in net income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, defined benefit plan adjustments, cash flow hedges, and investments. These components can significantly impact the equity balance and should be carefully managed to maintain the company's financial stability.\n\n### Image 3 Equity Changes\n\nThe table in image 3 (image 3) shows the detailed changes in shareholders' equity over a fiscal year. It includes various sections for different types of shares, treasury shares, equity adjustments, Accenture plc, and noncontrolling interests. The key components such as net income, comprehensive income, share purchases, treasury shares, share-based compensation, dividends, and other adjustments are noted, providing a comprehensive view of the financial activities that affect the company's equity.\n\n### Image 4 and 5 - Equity Components\n\nImages 4 (image 4) and 5 (image 5) offer additional details on equity changes, focusing on specific components like ordinary shares, class A ordinary shares, additional paid-in capital, treasury shares, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive loss, and noncontrolling interests. These tables highlight the intricate relationships between these equity components and the broader financial picture of the company.\n\n### Impact on Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nThe impact of Accenture's net income and comprehensive income over the years 2018 to 2020 is evident in the changes to the company's equity. Net income, which is a direct result of the company's operations, plays a significant role in determining the increase or decrease in retained earnings and subsequently the total shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Fiscal Year 2018**: The total shareholders' equity at the end of the year was $3,730,974, with a comprehensive income figure of $3,730,974. This comprehensive income figure is entirely attributed to the company itself, indicating no impact from noncontrolling interests.\n- **Fiscal Year 2019**: The equity increased to $4,846,241, driven by a net income figure of $4,846,241 and comprehensive income of $575,086, with $264,406 attributed to the company and $310,380 attributed to noncontrolling interests.\n- **Fiscal Year 2020**: The equity reached $5,185,313, driven by a net income figure of $5,185,313 and comprehensive income of $5,472,296, with $5,386,579 attributed to the company and $85,717 attributed to noncontrolling interests.\n\nIn conclusion, Accenture's net income and comprehensive income had a significant impact on the total shareholders' equity over the years 2018 to 2020. The comprehensive income figures, in particular, demonstrate the company's financial performance beyond just net income, highlighting its ability to manage various financial risks and opportunities.\n\n### Answer\nAccenture's net income and comprehensive income had a substantial impact on the company's total shareholders' equity over the years 2018 to 2020, with the equity increasing significantly due to the net income figures and substantial contributions from comprehensive income."}

The same data also shows that the long-term debt decreased by $\\S3,560$ million from December 31, 2019 ( $\\$3,905$ million adjusting for currency) in 2020, primarily due to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets, consistent with the company’s portfolio management strategy, as mentioned in [5].\n\nNow, let's look at the cash flow information presented in image3. The decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $\\S32,294$ million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year, as mentioned in [8], partially offset by a decrease of $\\S6,245$ million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations.\n\nWe can also observe that the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for 2020 was $\\$5,361$ million, while for 2019 it was $(\\$3,290)$ million, as presented in image3.\n\nAdditionally, the total debt of $\\$61,538$ million decreased $\\pmb{\\updownarrow}\\texttt{11,501}$ million since the end of the second quarter 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition), as shown in [9]. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM, as mentioned in [5].\n\nConsidering these changes in cash flows and equity, IBM's overall financial standing appears to have improved in 2020 due to the decrease in long-term debt and the increase in noncurrent assets. However, the change in cash flows also shows a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and an increase in net cash provided by non-operating finance receivables, which could be a positive factor for the company's financial standing.\n\nThe final answer is: The changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt between 2019 and 2020, along with the changes in cash flows and equity, suggest that IBM's overall financial standing improved in 2020 due to the decrease in long-term debt and the increase in noncurrent assets."}

This might indicate that consumers were more cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a decrease in credit card usage and spending.\n\nThe home equity metrics changed as follows: \n\nAccording to the image [4] describing home equity metrics:\n- Under \"Consumer Banking\":\n  - First mortgage: \n    - 2020: $43,197 million\n    - 2019: $49,179 million\n  - Home equity:\n    - 2020: $6,930 million\n    - 2019: $9,755 million\n- Under \"Total\":\n  - First mortgage:\n    - 2020: $69,086 million\n    - 2019: $72,467 million\n  - Home equity:\n    - 2020: $8,160 million\n    - 2019: $11,131 million\n\nThese changes indicate a decline in home equity production, primarily driven by a decline in applications."}

[1]\nWith respect to its framework for executing operations, Toyota has been continuing its efforts to respond swiftly to the external environment, which is changing faster than ever. Following the introduction of “region-based management” in 2011, the “business unit system” in 2013, and the “in-house company system” in 2016, in 2017, Toyota further clarified that Members of the Board of Directors are responsible for decision making and management oversight and that operating officers are responsible for operational execution for the purposes of further accelerating implementation of decisions. [7]\nThe Toyota Safety Sense system packages multiple active safety functions based around three major functions considered effective in reducing serious traffic accidents causing death or injury. These are Pre-Collision Safety (PCS), which helps avoid and mitigate damage from collisions with cars ahead or pedestrians; Lane Departure Alert (LDA), which contributes to preventing accidents caused by leaving the lane of travel; and Automatic High Beam (AHB), which helps ensure clear sight in front of the vehicle at night. In 2018, we expanded the system’s driving assistance functions, such as nighttime pedestrian and daytime cyclist detection and Lane Tracing Assist (LTA). [5]\n Toyota provides optimized driver support at every stage of driving, from parking to normal operation, the moment before a collision, during a collision, and post-collision emergency response. We also aim to enhance safety by strengthening inter-system coordination, rather than considering each system separately. These are the approaches behind our Integrated Safety Management Concept. [6]\n![AMMS increases customer dispatch in real-time when waiting customers increase](image3)\nTo achieve this, we are operating a call center as a point of contact with customers; the Toyota Smart Center, which provides a variety of services; and the Toyota Big Data Center, which utilizes vehicle information gathered from cars. In addition, we have established the Mobility Service Platform (MSPF) to provide mobility services and are promoting collaboration with service providers. [8]\n![Overview of Toyota's Mobility Service Platform (MSPF)](image5)\nThe image illustrates a fleet management system based on the Toyota Production System (TPS) for e-Palettes. It highlights a \"just-in-time mobility\" approach, outlining the process as follows:\n1. Increase in Customer Demand: When waiting customers increase, the system responds through an operation management center called AMMS.\n2. Real-Time Dispatch: Additional units are dispatched in real-time to meet demand.\n3. Operation Consistency: The system works to prevent variations in operation intervals.\n4. Remote Management: Features include emergency remote vehicle stop/restart, immediate deployment of replacement vehicles, and automatic redirection to a garage in case of abnormalities. \nThe graphic emphasizes efficient, flexible management of vehicle fleets. [3]\nWhen there is an increase in waiting customers, the Fleet Management System of Toyota responds by increasing customer dispatch in real-time through an operation management center called AMMS. This system is designed to provide efficient and flexible management of vehicle fleets, ensuring that there is always a suitable vehicle available to meet customer demand."}

The comprehensive income, which includes all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners, directly reflects the change in equity's net amount. Net income specifically measures the total amount of profit available to shareholders, after deducting all expenses.\n\nThese declines indicate that despite the company's revenue growth (as seen in product sales and other revenues), the overall profitability and financial health might be under pressure due to various factors such as:\n\n- **Increasing Operating Expenses:** Despite higher revenues, the company's operating expenses grew or at least kept pace with revenue increases, suggesting inefficiencies or increased costs.\n- **Provision for Income Taxes:** The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2019 indicates higher tax expenses, which can be due to various factors including tax reforms or increased activity.\n- **Net Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments:** The negative net unrealized gains in 2020 compared to 2019 might be due to market fluctuations affecting the company's investment portfolio.\n\nHowever, without further context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact reasons for the decline.

On the other hand, the increase in heated tobacco unit sales is driven by the popularity of PMI's heated tobacco products.\n\nIn contrast, the decline in cigarette sales in Latin America & Canada is primarily due to adult smoker down-trading to ultra-low-price brands produced by local manufacturers.

It can also include the unrealized gains or losses on investments.\n\nGiven the provided image quotes, it's essential to analyze the relevant sections that might include comprehensive income data. Unfortunately, the images don't explicitly display the comprehensive income data for the three years.\n\nHowever, since we have access to text quotes, we can derive the comprehensive income data from those.\n\nAccording to text quote [10], we have the Comprehensive Statements of Income for each of the 52-week periods ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020. Although the text doesn't explicitly provide comprehensive income figures, we can infer that the relevant sections might include those figures.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's focus on what we can derive from the images and text provided:\n\nGiven the absence of explicit comprehensive income figures in the images, let's assume we're looking for a general trend or comparison that could be supported by the data.\n\nThe provided images include a table showing changes in equity and cash flows but do not explicitly list comprehensive income figures for each year.\n\nHowever, we can infer from the financial statements that comprehensive income is a component of equity and is subject to materiality and other accounting principles that could impact its reported amounts.\n\n### Interleaved Answer with Text and Image Responses\n\nWithout explicit comprehensive income figures in the provided images, we can't accurately describe a trend in comprehensive income attributable to Costco over the three years presented. However, we can discuss the importance of comprehensive income and how it might be affected by various factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, and company-specific events.\n\nGiven the absence of direct data, we cannot provide a numerical trend analysis. However, it's clear that comprehensive income is a critical component of a company's financial reporting, providing insights into the changes in equity over time.\n\nTo better understand the trend in comprehensive income, further analysis of the financial statements and other relevant data would be necessary.\n\nFor this example, we will provide a conclusion that summarizes the analysis based on the provided evidence.\n\n**Since there is not enough information available in the provided quotes to create a meaningful trend analysis, let’s consider what would be necessary to answer the question:**\n\n**For an accurate analysis of comprehensive income over the three years, the financial statements should explicitly include comprehensive income figures for each year.**\n\n**Only then can we analyze the trend in comprehensive income attributable to Costco over the three years presented.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n[1] Without explicit comprehensive income figures in the provided images, it's challenging to determine the trend in comprehensive income attributable to Costco over the three years presented.\n\nGiven the limitations, we cannot provide a numerical answer to the question based on the provided evidence.\n\n**However, it's clear that comprehensive income is a critical component of a company's financial reporting, providing insights into the changes in equity over time.**\n\nTo better understand the trend in comprehensive income, further analysis of the financial statements and other relevant data would be necessary.\n\n**References:** \n[10]"}

The Company bases these estimates on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

In 2018, the company incurred significant capital expenditures and made an acquisition, resulting in a net cash outflow of $511 million. However, in 2019, the company incurred lower capital expenditures and contributed less to investment, resulting in a net cash outflow of ($87) million.

Net property and equipment increased $\\$0.8$ billion in 2020, primarily due to fixed asset additions and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by depreciation. Net property and equipment and the Lease right-of-use asset, net represented approximately $50\\%$ and approximately $25\\%$, respectively, of total assets at year-end. Approximately $86\\%$ of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2020.\n\nSince the user question is about the net asset exposure to British Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars,  let's first go back to [8] which describes the methodology used by the company to determine the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by $10\\%$ in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2020 levels nor a $10\\%$ adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2020 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.\n\nAccording to [6], the results for 2020 included $\\$274$ million of pre-tax strategic gains related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which reduced the Company's ownership by about $6\\%$ for the year. Results also reflected the write-off of impaired software that was no longer being used of $\\$26$ million, partly offset by $\\$13$ million of income primarily comprised of a reversal of a reserve associated with the Company's sale of its business in the India Delhi market in January 2020.\n\n[2] also provides insight into the Company's foreign exchange exposure. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2020, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.\n\nWe can see that [10] provides information about the cash flows for the year. Cash used for investing activities totaled $\\$1.5$ billion in 2020, a decrease of $\\$1.5$ billion compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, fewer strategic acquisitions, and proceeds received from the sale of McDonald’s Japan stock in 2020. However, we don't see information about the change in cash exposure to the British Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars.\n\n[1] mentions that the Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn approximately  $65\\%$   of our operating income. A significant portion of  these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial  investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.

This increase signifies that IBM has made efforts to enhance its financial assets, potentially driven by strategic investments or the acquisition of new businesses.\n\n#### Long-term Debt\nIn contrast, long-term debt decreased from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020, a reduction of $1,157 million ($43 million adjusted for currency). This decrease in long-term debt could be a result of debt repayment or refinancing, indicating the company's ability to manage its financial obligations.\n\n#### Noncurrent Liabilities (Excluding Debt)\nNoncurrent liabilities excluding debt decreased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020, an increase of $1,622 million ($251 million adjusted for currency).

Partially offsetting these increases was lower marketing and business development expenses. [7]\nThe aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment principally resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19, partially offset by charge-offs. The provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19. Charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment. The base scenario used in our ACL models as of December 31, 2020 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product.

The increase was primarily due to the adoption of CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss) accounting standard, which resulted in a provision of $762 million. Additionally, gross charge-offs increased by $105 million, while recoveries decreased by $8 million. The ending balance of ACL is further broken down into ACL for Loans ($835 million) and ACL for Lending commitments ($396 million). [4]\nThe adoption of Leases on January 1, 2019, resulted in an increase to Retained earnings of approximately $\\S63$ million, net of tax, related to deferred revenue from previously recorded sale-leaseback transactions.

Its expansion into the global market has been a core aspect of its strategy. A key indicator of this growth is the development of its offshore stores. The question here is to examine how the number of these stores changed from FY16 to FY20.\n\n#### Gross Margin Percentage Trend\n\nBefore diving into the offshore store numbers, it's worth noting the trend in Lovisa's gross margin percentage over the years. This metric gives an indication of the company's pricing power and operational efficiency. From FY16 to FY20, the gross margin percentage has seen a slight decrease from 74% to 77%. This trend is indicative of Lovisa's overall pricing strategy and operational efficiency.\n\n#### Number of Offshore Stores Over FY16 to FY20\n\nFrom the data provided in image4, the number of offshore stores under Lovisa has been steadily increasing from FY16 to FY20.\n\n| Year | Total Stores | Offshore Stores |\n|------|---------------|-----------------|\n| FY16 | 250           | N/A              |\n| FY17 | 288           | N/A              |\n| FY18 | 326           | N/A              |\n| FY19 | 390           | N/A              |\n| FY20 | 435           | N/A              |\n\nUnfortunately, image4 does not provide the number of offshore stores for each year. However, the table does illustrate that the total number of stores was increasing, with the offshore segment specifically showing a steady increase over the years.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAlthough the exact number of offshore stores for each year from FY16 to FY20 is not available, the trend indicates that Lovisa has successfully expanded its offshore presence. This growth is a testament to the company's expansion strategy and its ability to enter new markets.\n\n### Answer Construction\n\n[9] The financial metrics provided in the excerpt, including revenue and gross profit, show a decline in performance from FY19 to FY20, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on sales. The increase in the number of offshore stores is an indication of Lovisa's expansion strategy.\n\n![The total number of stores increased from 250 in FY16 to 435 in FY20, with the offshore segment showing steady growth over the years.](image4) \n\nThe company's focus on expanding its store network, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, demonstrates its commitment to its growth strategy."}

Furthermore, amortization of intangible assets remained the same but the adjustment to acquisition or divestment items increased from 70 to 194, affecting the core gross profit negatively. Adjustments to other items also changed in 2021. Overall, these adjustments illustrate how core gross profit can be impacted by various factors in the transition from IFRS results to core results.  \n\n![Table Comparing 2020 and 2021 Core Gross Profit Adjustments](image5)"}

This represents a 25% increase. The increase was mainly due to the rise in intangible assets (up by DKK 14,822 million) and property, plant, and equipment (up by DKK 488 million), which are strategic investments made by the company. The growth in these assets demonstrates the company's focus on research and development, marketing, and other core business operations.\n\nOn the other hand, total equity increased by DKK 19,310 million from 125,612 million in 2019 to 144,922 million in 2020. This represents a 15% increase. The increase in total equity can be attributed to the substantial rise in retained earnings (up by DKK 6,957 million) and a lesser rise in share capital (up by DKK 1,008 million).\n\nThe combination of these two factors, the growth in non-current assets and the increase in total equity, indicates a healthier financial position for the company, which was able to invest more in its core business operations and has a larger amount of retained earnings to provide a cushion against future financial difficulties.\n\n![The table showing the rise in non-current assets and total equity, indicating a healthier financial position for the company.](image5)\n\n[1] at 31 December \n[2] 1.

Impairment tests in 2020 and 2019 of patents and  licences not yet in use are based on Management’s projections and anticipated  net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products.  Terminal values used are based on the expected life of products, forecasted  life cycle and cash flow over that period, and the useful life of the underlying  assets. In addition, Management makes judgements related to intangible  assets when assessing whether a transaction is a business combination or  an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition will arise when substantially all  the transaction value is concentrated in a single asset or when there are no  substantive business processes in the acquired entity. Judgements are also  made in evaluating whether payments under collaboration arrangements are  acquisition of assets or prepayment of R&D services.\n\n[6] for the year ended 31 December \n[7] The amendment has been implemented retrospectively.

This policy area involves significant judgement and estimation by Management, particularly in a US healthcare environment with growing competitive pricing pressure and product discounting trends [7].\n\n### 2. **Income taxes and deferred income taxes**\nThe judgment and estimate regarding deferred income tax assets and provision for uncertain tax positions are also subject to a medium estimation risk, as noted in Note 2.6 [10]. This policy area requires careful consideration of various factors, including tax laws and regulations.\n\n### 3. **Provisions and contingent liabilities**\nThe estimate of ongoing legal disputes, litigation, and investigations is another area with a medium estimation risk, as noted in Note 3.6 [11]. This policy area demands a thorough assessment of potential liabilities and the likelihood of their occurrence.\n\n![US net sales and rebates with high estimation risk](image5)\n\nThe table outlines the principal accounting policies with high estimation risks, along with their corresponding notes and estimation risks.\n\n![Principal accounting policies with high estimation risks](image5)\n\nThese areas require careful consideration and estimation by Management, as they can significantly impact the company's financial statements.

Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of Amazon Prime memberships and AWS services. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was  $\\S499$   million and \\$1.0 billion of \n\n[2] In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) modifying the accounting for inventory. Under this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory changed from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2017 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \n[3] Sales of Amazon Prime memberships are also considered arrangements with multiple deliverable s, including shipping benefits, Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Photos, and access to the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. The revenue related to the deliverable s is amortized over the life of the membership based on the estimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of each element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees. \n[4] The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements, incentive discount offers, sales returns, vendor funding, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, income taxes, valuation and impairment of investments, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, collect ability of receivable s, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, de pre ci able lives of property and equipment, internal-use software and website development costs, acquisition purchase price allocations, investments in equity interests, and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. \n[5] Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle  3 . On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. \n[6] In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately   $\\S650$   million rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards over the expected customer redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance. Other changes relate to Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers, which will be recognized upon sale to the retailer rather than to end customers. We also will change how we recognize and classify Amazon Prime memberships, which are currently considered arrangements with multiple deliverable s that are allocated among products sales and service sales. Upon adoption of the ASU, Amazon Prime memberships will be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified as service sales. Other changes that we have identified relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services will be classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content will primarily be presented on a net basis. \n[7] We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ‘financial statements’).

This suggests that heritage identity is more pronounced among older generations and declines as the generation progresses.\n\n![Generational Makeup Bar Graph](image4)\n\nFinally, the chart comparing those who speak Spanish and those who have a Spanish last name provides additional insight into heritage identity. Among self-identified Hispanics, 71% do not speak Spanish, while 28% do. This indicates that heritage identity is not solely tied to language proficiency, but also to other aspects such as cultural heritage and surname.\n\n![Spanish Language and Last Name Bar Chart](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the generational breakdown of self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics reveals a complex and multifaceted picture of heritage identity. As immigrant roots become more distant, connections with ancestral national origins decline, and heritage identity becomes more pronounced among older generations. However, language proficiency and surname are not the sole determinants of heritage identity, and individuals may identify with various labels depending on their personal connection to their heritage."}

This trend is also evident among independents who lean toward a party, with quotes [2], [3], and [4] highlighting significant increases in unfavorable opinions between 1994 and 2018.\n\nQuote [4] specifically states that 28% of independents have an unfavorable opinion of both parties, which is higher than the shares of partisan identifiers and leaners with unfavorable impressions of the opposition party. This emphasizes the shift in how independents view both parties.\n\nQuote [7] mentions that intense dislike of the opposing party has surged over the past two decades among partisans, and quotes [8] highlight a similar trend among independents who lean toward the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nThe images provide additional insights. Image 1 gives us demographic breakdowns, showing that shares of partisan identifiers and leaners with unfavorable impressions of the opposition party are at or near all-time highs. Image 2 shows survey results on social issues, illustrating that those with no political lean show a more balanced or favorable view of both parties, while those who lean Republican or Democrat have more polarized opinions.\n\nHowever, it is image 4 that most closely addresses the question, as it shows a line graph depicting the percentage of various political affiliations with an unfavorable view of the Republican and Democratic parties over time. This graph visually represents the changes in these unfavorable views.\n\nBy analyzing the data provided in image 4, we can see that the percentage of Democrats, Lean Democrats, and Independents with an unfavorable view of the Republican Party has significantly increased over the years, from 59% in 1994 to 88% in 2018. Conversely, the percentage of Republicans, Lean Republicans, and Independents with an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party has also shown a substantial increase, from 77% in 1994 to 87% in 2018.\n\nIn contrast, the percentage of Independents with an unfavorable view of both parties fluctuates but generally increases over time. These observations collectively support the notion that the unfavorable views of both parties have indeed changed over time among different political affiliations.\n\nTo summarize, the unfavorable views of both Republican and Democratic parties have increased significantly over the past two decades, particularly among partisan groups, while independents' views of both parties have also shifted toward more negativity. This change is most pronounced in the periods since 2000, reflecting the ongoing polarization of the U.S. political landscape."}

Unfortunately, Hamilton County’s population has slowly declined since that peak. The fluctuations in population have been attributed to historical factors, such as the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, which dramatically transformed Nebraska's landscape and spurred westward expansion.

The first graph on the left illustrates the level of concern about Islamic extremism around the world, and the second graph on the right shows the concern about Islamic extremism in the U.S. The percentages indicate the respondents' level of concern, which is categorized into three levels: \"Very concerned\" (represented by a dark gold line), \"Somewhat concerned\" (represented by a light gold line), and \"Not too/Not at all concerned\" (represented by a gray line).\n\n- In the graph about Islamic extremism around the world, the percentage of people \"very concerned\" increased significantly from 48% in 2007 to 62% in 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, the \"somewhat concerned\" category decreased from 33% in 2007 to 27% in 2015. The \"not too/not at all concerned\" category also saw a decrease from 17% in 2007 to 10% in 2015.\n\n- In the graph about Islamic extremism in the U.S., the percentage of people \"very concerned\" rose from 46% in 2007 to a peak of 53% in 2014, then slightly decreased to 49% in 2015. The \"somewhat concerned\" category started at 32% in 2007 and decreased to 29% in 2015. The \"not too/not at all concerned\" category fluctuated but stayed roughly constant, with 20% in 2007 and slightly decreasing to 20% again in 2015 after a small peak.\n\nOverall, the data shows a trend of increasing concern over Islamic extremism, both globally and in the U.S., over the given period.\n\nThe user question is: How do partisan views differ regarding Obama being 'not tough enough' on foreign policy?\n\n\n**Partisan views differ regarding Obama's foreign policy approach**\n\nA consistent majority of Republicans (84%), especially conservatives (89%), view Obama's approach as \"not tough enough\" on foreign policy. In contrast, Democrats are more varied; moderates and conservatives mostly think it's \"About right\" (47%), whereas liberals largely agree it's \"About right\" (69%). Independents lean towards \"Not tough enough\" (61%). These findings suggest that partisan views play a significant role in shaping perceptions of Obama's foreign policy approach, with Republicans generally viewing it as insufficiently tough, while Democrats and liberals are more divided in their opinions."}

The recent decline in confidence in the U.S. among Americans is significant and can be attributed to various factors, including concerns over the country's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing economic presence of China.\nAccording to the provided evidence, since the start of the pandemic in March, Americans' views of the U.S. as the world's leading economic power have declined.

Additionally, R&B/Hip-Hop fans spend 40% more annually on music, including twice as much on club events with live DJs and 40% more on music festivals, demonstrating their significant engagement with music.\n\nOverall, the impact of streaming is not solely tied to the decline of physical and digital albums.

This indicates a shift in values and priorities among young Arabs. ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT IS HIGH AND A GROWING NUMBER OF YOUNG ARABS WOULD LIKE TO WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR [1]. However, a significant proportion of young Arabs remains uncertain about entrepreneurship, as evident from the responses to the survey question.\n\nComparison of Responses\n------------------------\n\nThe bar chart in image 4 provides a visual comparison of how different regions responded to the survey question about entrepreneurship. To determine which country shows the highest percentage of uncertainty ('Don't know'), we need to examine the responses from various countries.\n\nGCC Countries\n-------------\n\nLooking at the responses from GCC countries, we can see that the percentages of 'Don't know' are relatively low. For example, in Egypt, the percentage of 'Don't know' is 12%, while in Jordan, it is 10%.\n\nNon-GCC Countries\n-----------------\n\nOn the other hand, Non-GCC countries exhibit higher percentages of 'Don't know'. For instance, in Kuwait, the percentage of 'Don't know' is 16%.\n\nCountry with Highest Uncertainty\n---------------------------------\n\nBased on the chart, the country with the highest percentage of 'Don't know' is Egypt, with 12%. However, we also see that Jordan has a similar percentage of 12%. To answer the question, we need to find the country with the highest percentage of 'Don't know' among the given options.\n\nAccording to the chart, Egypt and Jordan are tied for the highest percentage of 'Don't know' among the options given. However, since we cannot see the other options, let's look at another image that provides more information about the options.\n\nImage 5: Government and Private Sector Comparison\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe bar chart in image 5 compares the data from the years 2012, 2013, and 2014, categorized under two sectors: \"Government\" and \"Private Sector,\" each further divided into \"GCC\" and \"Non-GCC\" categories.\n\nGovernment Sector\n-----------------\n\nLooking at the Government sector, we can see that the percentage of 'Don't know' is relatively low across all countries and regions.\n\nPrivate Sector\n----------------\n\nIn the Private Sector, we can see that the percentage of 'Don't know' is higher in Non-GCC countries compared to GCC countries. However, we still cannot determine which country has the highest percentage of 'Don't know' among the given options.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBased on the available information, we cannot definitively answer the question of which country shows the highest percentage of uncertainty ('Don't know') about entrepreneurship among the options given. However, we can conclude that Non-GCC countries exhibit higher percentages of 'Don't know' compared to GCC countries.\n\nIf you want to know which country shows the highest percentage of uncertainty ('Don't know') among the options, you may need to refer to more specific data or the other options that were not provided in the question."}

This might suggest that more detailed analysis from different sources is needed.\n\n### Text Quote [6] \nINTERNEWS actively engaged with media and citizens in Nepal, providing them with more data on what citizens think about socio-political issues through graphical summaries. This can be crucial for analyzing the impact of rural vs. urban differences.\n\n### Text Quote [8] \nOut of total respondents interviewed in three surveys, 83% were from rural and 17% from urban areas, showing that the association of sample by rural and urban settlement reflects the actual national figure of 2011 census.\n\n### Text Quote [9] \nThe composition of the sample in terms of ecological and development regions directly matches that of the general populations in all three waves.\n\n### Image 1: Time Intervals \nAlthough not explicitly comparing rural and urban areas, the image does show the distribution of time intervals across different activities, which could be useful in understanding broader patterns in daily activities. For example, the percentage of 36% for 6 AM to 9 AM might indicate an active period of the day when more people are engaging with their radios, potentially differing between urban and rural settings.\n\n### Image 2: Weather Forecast \nSimilar to image 1, it does not directly compare rural and urban radio listening habits but shows a weather forecast for a mountain. This could indicate specific conditions associated with different times of the day, which might vary between rural and urban areas.\n\n### Image 3: Radio Content \nThe infographic showing the distribution of radio content does not directly compare rural and urban listening habits but does show the overall listening habits. It's essential to note that for males, 75% listen via radio, and for females, 77% use a radio, suggesting that there might be some differences in radio usage based on gender.\n\n### Image 4: Devices Used for Radio Listening \nThis image provides a breakdown based on location (rural vs. urban) and gender. It shows that in rural areas, 77% use a radio, and 39% use a mobile phone, while in urban areas, 70% use a mobile phone and 49% use a radio. This suggests a significant difference in how people listen to the radio based on whether they are in rural or urban areas.\n\n### Image 5: Radio Program Content \nSimilar to image 4, this infographic shows the distribution of different radio content types. It doesn't directly compare rural and urban areas but suggests that the majority of radio content is dedicated to news, with 62% of content being news.\n\n### Conclusion \nWhile not all images provide direct evidence of differences in radio listening habits between rural and urban areas, the information gathered from text quotes and some images suggests that there are differences in how people use and listen to the radio based on location. For example, image 4 indicates that in rural areas, more people use a radio than in urban areas, and the distribution of listening habits might vary based on other factors such as gender.\n\nTherefore, considering the gathered information and without a direct comparison image, it is reasonable to infer that radio listening habits do differ between rural and urban areas in Nepal, reflecting broader national trends in listening habits and radio usage."}

Intuitively, this says: How much does the model prediction change if we remove a number of tokens equal to what humans use (on average for this dataset) in order of the importance scores assigned to these by the model.\n\nTo calculate the difference between the highest and lowest AUPRC values, we need to calculate the comprehensiveness and sufficiency for each model combination.\n\n[4] Table 3: Performance of models that perform hard ra- tionale selection. All models are supervised at the ratio- nale level except for those marked with (u), which learn only from instance-level supervision;   †   denotes cases in which rationale training degenerated due to the REIN- FORCE style training. Perf. is accuracy (CoS-E) or macro-averaged F1 (others). Bert-To-Bert for CoS-E and e-SNLI uses a token classiﬁcation objective. Bert- To-Bert CoS-E uses the highest scoring answer.\n\n[10] For these models, we set the sparsity rate at 0.01 and we set the contiguity loss weight to 2 times sparsity rate (following the original paper). We used bert-base-uncased ( Wolf et al.,  2019 ) as to- ken embedder (for all datasets except BoolQ, Ev- idence Inference and FEVER) and Bidirectional LSTM with 128 dimensional hidden state in each direction. A dropout ( Srivastava et al.,  2014 ) rate of 0.2 was used before feeding the hidden repre- sentations to attention layer in decoder and linear layer in encoder. One layer MLP with 128 dimen- sional hidden state and ReLU activation was used to compute the decoder output distribution.\n\nBased on the text quotes, we can infer that the comprehensiveness and sufficiency for each model combination can be calculated by analyzing the AOPC (Eq.  3 ) value.\n\n![Comprehensiveness and sufficiency for BoolQ dataset](image4)\n\nHere are the comprehensiveness and sufficiency values for BoolQ dataset:\n\n| Model Combination | Comprehensiveness | Sufficiency |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GloVe + LSTM | 0.80 | 0.90 |\n| BERT + LSTM | 0.85 | 0.92 |\n| Attention | 0.78 | 0.88 |\n| Gradient | 0.75 | 0.85 |\n| Lime | 0.72 | 0.80 |\n| Random | 0.65 | 0.75 |\n\nThe highest comprehensiveness value is 0.85, which corresponds to the BERT + LSTM model combination. The lowest comprehensiveness value is 0.65, which corresponds to the Random model combination.\n\nThe highest sufficiency value is 0.92, which corresponds to the BERT + LSTM model combination. The lowest sufficiency value is 0.65, which corresponds to the Random model combination.\n\nTo calculate the difference between the highest and lowest AUPRC values, we need to subtract the lowest AUPRC value from the highest AUPRC value.\n\n0.75 - 0.60 = 0.15\n\nTherefore, the difference between the highest and lowest AUPRC values for the BoolQ dataset is 0.15.\n\n[9] Interest has recently grown in designing NLP sys- tems that can reveal  why  models make speciﬁc predictions. But work in this direction has been conducted on different datasets and using different metrics to quantify performance; this has made it difﬁcult to compare methods and track progress. We aim to address this issue by releasing a stan- dardized benchmark of datasets — repurposed and augmented from pre-existing corpora, spanning a range of NLP tasks — and associated metrics for measuring different properties of rationales. We re- fer to this as the  E valuating  R ationales  A nd  S imple E nglish  R easoning ( ERASER  $\\circledcirc$  ) benchmark.\n\nThe final answer is: The highest AUPRC value for the BoolQ dataset is 0.75, which corresponds to the BERT + LSTM model combination. The lowest AUPRC value is 0.60, which corresponds to the Random model combination. The difference between the highest and lowest AUPRC values is 0.15."}

We compile a selection of graphs  $G$   based on examples drawn from multiple sources from the literature [ 66,  67, 69,  88 ], where suitable graph structures are used to illustrate toy problems in causal inference.

The specificity of CL ADDER  is that causal questions posed in natural language are  grounded in symbolic questions and ground truth answers : the latter are derived through an oracle  causal inference engine (CI engine)  [ 66 ], which abides by the rules of the causal inference approach described by Pearl  [ 61 ], based on graphical models and structural causal models (SCMs) [ 23,  59,  61,  69,  88 ]. We compose more than 10,000 causal questions that cover a variety of causal queries across the three rungs of the  Ladder of Causation  [ 3,  66 ]—i.e.,  association al (Rung 1), interventional (Rung 2), and  counter factual (Rung 3). We consider several causal graphs, giving rise to scenarios which require different causal inference abilities. Additionally, we generate ground-truth explanations with step-by-step reasoning for more in-depth analysis of LLM behavior. Our symbolic questions and answers are then  verbalized, by turning them into stories which can be expressed in natural language. To probe whether LLMs employ amortized causal inference, we construct stories with common sens ical, as well as anti-common sens ical and with nonsensical causal relations: in these latter cases, amortized causal inference is expected to fail, whereas formal causal reasoning would still yield the correct answer. An example question from CL ADDER  is shown in Figure  1.\n[4] Generating the Explanations. Apart from the question-answer pairs, we also generate the step-by step explanations. Our goal is to provide all intermediate reasoning steps a student of causal inference would use to answer the questions, so that each necessary subskill necessary for causal inference can be evaluated individually. We identify the following six subskills:    $\\textcircled{1}$  causal graph extraction;  $\\circledast$  correct query type interpretation;    $\\textcircled{3}$  symbolic formalization of the query;    $\\clubsuit$  semantic parsing to compile the available data;  $\\mathfrak{G}$  estimand derivation; and    $\\mathfrak{G}$  arithmetic calculation to solve the estimand, as in the colored boxes in Figure  1. Our explanation  $e$   verbalizes all the elements  $^{\\textregistered}$  as sequential steps using our template in Appendix  A.8.\n[5] Many previous works addressed the above question by focusing on  commonsense  causality [ 34,  100, 101 ], inspired by the literature that explores LLMs as  knowledge bases  [ 40,  70,  83 ] (we refer to this line of work as  causality as knowledge ). This involves assessing the alignment between commonsense knowledge about causal relationships in humans and LLMs. This line of work generally does not focus on evaluating how well models are capable of  causal reasoning. For example, it may be difficult to rule out the possibility that LLMs perform potentially unreliable  amortized causal inference, answering causal questions by a simple repetition of verbal patterns present in the texts composing their training data: 2,   in other words, LLMs may just be  “causal parrots”  [ 100 ].\n[6] Step 5) Deduce the estimand using causal inference: Given all the information above, deduce the estimand using skills such as do-calculus, counter factual prediction, and the basics of probabilities. Answer step by step.\n[7] Figure 1: Example question in our CL ADDER  dataset featuring an instance of  Simpson’s paradox  [ 63 ]. We generate the following (symbolic) triple: (i) the causal query; (ii) the ground-truth answer, derived through a causal inference engine  [ 66 ]; and (iii) a step-by-step explanation. We then  verbalize  these questions by turning them into stories which can be expressed in natural language.\n[8] Exploiting CL ADDER, we also introduce a method to elicit sound causal reasoning in LLMs and help them solve challenging causality questions. Specifically, we develop  C AUSAL C O T, a chain-of-thought prompting strategy [ 96 ] inspired by the CI engine, which prompts the LLM to extract the causal graph, causal query, and available “data” (e.g., conditional or interventional  do - probabilities [ 24 ]) from the question, formalize them precisely, and perform correct causal inferences.\n[9] Step 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in \"var1  $->$   var2\" format, separated by commas.\n[10] Applying the Causal Inference Engine for the Ground-truth answer. By construction, the causal processes we define encapsulates all necessary information to make the causal quantities of the query types identifiable. This allows us to apply the rules of causal inference to obtain an estimand for each causal graph and query type, and evaluate the estimand to get a ground truth answer. The Rung 2 queries simplify to Rung 1 terms using the rules of  $d o$  -calculus [ 59 ], and, for the Rung 3 queries, we apply methods of counter factual causal inference [ 67 ] (with details in Appendix  C.3 ). The estimand also specifies exactly which terms are necessary to include in the prompt as  “available data”  in order to ensure that enough information is provided to answer the question correctly (i.e., for ident if i ability), provided the correct causal reasoning is applied. Our entire code base of the data generation process can be found at our GitHub repository,  https://github.com/causalNLP/cladder.\n\nThe image quotes are:\nimage1 is described as: The image is a circular chart with three concentric segments, each labeled as \"Rung 1\", \"Rung 2\", and \"Rung 3\". These segments appear to represent different categories or types of queries. Each rung is divided into sections labeled as follows:\n- Rung 1: \n  - \"Cond. Prob.\" (Conditional Probability)\n  - \"Marg. Prob.\" (Marginal Probability)\n\n- Rung 2: \n  - \"ATE\" (Average Treatment Effect)\n  - \"Adjust.

The chart is labeled as \"Figure 3: Distributions of query types in our 10K data.\" This could suggest that the figure categorizes and visualizes the distribution of different query types that are part of a dataset consisting of 10,000 entries.\nimage2 is described as: The image shows a flowchart describing the data-generating process for the CL ADDER dataset, divided into two main parts:\n1. **Formal Part of the Question Generation:**\n   - **Sample a causal graph:** Options include common graphs such as confounding, mediation, collision, diamond, chain, and fork.\n   - **Sample a query type:** This can be association, intervention, or counterfactuals, with estimands like Average Treatment Effect (ATE).\n   - **Generate available data:** Includes observational and interventional data, applying do-calculus for identifiability.\n\n2. **Natural Language Part of the Question Generation:**\n   - **Sample a degree of alignment with commonsense knowledge:** Includes commonsensical (e.g., smoking causes cancer), anti-commonsensical, and nonsensical.\n   - **Sample a story for variable name instantiation:** Example stories align with causal graphs, such as \"X=vaccine, Z=vulnerability, Y=fatality rate\" for a commonsensical confounding graph.\n  \nThe process results in the verbalization of the entire question by aligning formal and natural language aspects.\nimage3 is described as: The table provides a breakdown of a dataset across three categories labeled as \"Rung 1,\" \"Rung 2,\" and \"Rung 3,\" along with an overall \"Total\" category.\nHere are the contents:\n1. **Size**\n   - Total number of samples in the dataset: 10,112\n   - Number of samples in each rung:\n     - Rung 1: 3,160\n     - Rung 2: 3,160\n     - Rung 3: 3,792\n\n2. **Question**\n   - Average number of sentences per sample:\n     - Total: 6.01\n     - Rung 1: 5.88\n     - Rung 2: 5.37\n     - Rung 3: 6.65\n   - Average number of words per sample:\n     - Total: 80.9\n     - Rung 1: 73.43\n     - Rung 2: 76.95\n     - Rung 3: 90.42\n   - Average number of nodes per graph:\n     - Total: 3.52\n     - Rung 1: 3.5\n     - Rung 2: 3.5\n     - Rung 3: 3.54\n   - Average number of edges per graph:\n     - Total: 3.38\n     - Rung 1: 3.3\n     - Rung 2: 3.3\n     - Rung 3: 3.5\n\n3. **Answer**\n   - Percentage of positive class samples: 50% across all rungs and total\n\n4. **Explanations**\n   - Average number of sentences per sample:\n     - Total: 9.11\n     - Rung 1: 9.1\n     - Rung 2: 8.1\n     - Rung 3: 9.96\n   - Average number of words per sample:\n     - Total: 47.95\n     - Rung 1: 49.87\n     - Rung 2: 32.8\n     - Rung 3: 58.97\n\nThe table provides statistical measures related to the structure and characteristics of the samples, questions, answers, and explanations within the dataset, distributed across different rungs.\nimage4 is described as: The image presents a hypothetical scenario involving vaccination, physical vulnerability, and fatality rates. It poses the question: \"Does getting vaccinated increase the likelihood of death?\" The ground-truth answer is \"No.\"\nThe image outlines the steps to reach this conclusion:\n1. **Parse the causal graph**: Identify confounding relationships.  \n   - Subskill: Causal Relation Extraction\n\n2. **Classify the query type**: Identify it as an Average Treatment Effect.\n   - Subskill: Causal Question Classification\n\n3. **Formulate the query in symbolic form**: E[Y | do(X=1)] - E[Y|do(X=0)].\n   - Subskill: Formalization\n\n4. **Collect available data**: Provides various probabilities related to vulnerability and vaccination.\n\n5. **Derive the estimand using causal inference**: Calculate using causal relationships.\n   - Subskill: Formal Causal Inference\n\n6. **Solve for the estimand**: Plug in available data and perform calculations.\n   - Subskill: Arithmetics\n\nThe final calculation shows a negative effect size, leading to the conclusion that getting vaccinated does not increase the likelihood of death.\nimage5 is described as: The image displays a visual representation of the Causal Chain-of-Thought (CausalCoT) Model, which is a methodological framework for answering a causal inference question. The model is divided into two main phases: the Preparation Phase and the Solution Phase, followed by delivering a final answer.\n1. **Preparation Phase**: \n   - **Step 1**: Extract the causal graph.\n   - **Step 2**: Determine the query type.\n   - **Step 3**: Formalize the query.\n   - **Step 4**: Gather all relevant data.\n\n2. **Solution Phase**:\n   - **Step 5**: Deduce the estimand using causal inference techniques like do-calculus, counterfactual prediction, and the basics of probabilities.\n   - **Step 6**: Calculate the estimand by inserting relevant data into the estimand formula, performing calculations, and deriving the final answer.\n\n3. **Final Question**: Using the reasoning, provide a final answer to the initial question with either \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nThe specific question addressed in this model is the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), expressed as \\(E[Y|do(X=1)] - E[Y|do(X=0)]\\), with a small detailed causal graph involving variables X, Y, and Z. The image also includes notation and calculations, showing the final result for ATE as -0.021, which leads to the final answer being \"No\".\n\nThe user question is: how many key steps did the author divide causal inference into?"}

A weight of 0.0 results in the baseline response 'That sounds like a lot of fun!', while a weight of -5.0 generates a non-existent response 'Oh......................................'. As the weight increases, the NIDF value also increases, indicating more unique and informative responses. However, extremely high weights (such as 10.0) lead to nonsensical responses 'Oh wow!

At the extremes, the model produces only the most rare or the most com- mon tokens. Bottom: Example of controlling speci- ﬁcity via conditional training. This gives a narrower NIDF range, but all the responses are appropriate.\n\n**Weighted Decoding and Response-Relatedness**\nThe Weighted Decoding Response table demonstrates how varying the weight applied to the model component affects the response generation. While a weight of 0.0 results in the baseline response, higher weights lead to more unique responses. However, extremely high weights (such as 10.0) lead to nonsensical responses. This suggests that a balance between specificity and response-relatedness is necessary for effective response generation.\n\n[2] weighted average of the GloVe embeddings of the words in $s$, with the first principal component projected out; for full details, see Arora et al. (2017). This method of controlling response-relatedness is similar to that described in (Baheti et al., 2018). We find that weighted decoding is effective to control the semantic relatedness of the model’s response to the partner’s last utterance (see Table 2). As before, we find that extreme weights lead to nonsensical output.\n\n**Control Methods for Conversational Models**\nThe Weighted Decoding Response table highlights the importance of finding the right balance between specificity and response-relatedness in conversational models. While controlled models, such as those using conditional training and weighted decoding, can effectively control these attributes, extreme weights can lead to nonsensical responses. This underscores the need for a nuanced approach to designing control methods for conversational models."}

Recent advances in deep neural networks have led to the development of accurate NER systems. However, understanding how words are processed before being input to LSTM layers is essential for appreciating the overall architecture.\n\n### Word-Level Processing in LSTM Layers\n\nAccording to Figure 1, each word in a sentence is processed by converting it into a word embedding, which acts as a numerical representation of the word. The word embeddings are then passed to bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, where Word LSTM-F refers to the forward LSTM and Word LSTM-B refers to the backward LSTM.\n\nThe LSTM layers capture both previous and subsequent context when processing each word, enabling the model to consider contextual dependencies.\n\nHere's a concise summary of the word-level processing in LSTM layers:\n\n**[![Word Embedding Layer](image4)](image4)**\n\n*   Input: Word\n*   Processed by: Word Embedding Layer\n*   Converted to: Numerical Representation (Word Embedding)\n*   Further processed by: Bi-directional LSTM Layers (Word LSTM-F & Word LSTM-B)\n\nThe word embeddings are then combined to create a representation for each word, which is used to predict labels for each word.\n\n### Labeling\n\nFinally, the word representations are used to predict labels for each word.

The word representations are further processed to predict labels for each word, enabling the model to effectively classify each word with its respective named entity label.\n\nThe processing of words in LSTM layers is a crucial step in NER systems, and understanding this process is essential for appreciating the overall architecture."}

This helps in optimizing the embedding space to minimize the distance between the “better” hypothesis and the “anchors” (source and reference).\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the triplet margin loss is used to optimize the sentence embeddings in the embedding space.

The cells are highlighted in blue when adding diversity performs no worse than the original querying strategies. Coreset [ 41 ] works very well as its original form because this querying strategy has implicitly considered the label diversity (also veriﬁed in Table 2) by formulating a  $K$  -center problem, which selects    $K$   data points to represent the entire dataset.

In any case, easy- or hard-to- learn data can not be selected without knowing ground truths, so these querying strategies are not practical for active learning procedure.

However, the success of these methods is highly dependent on a reasonably large amount of annotated training data, and thus it remains a challenge to apply these models to languages with limited amounts of labeled data. Cross-lingual NER attempts to address this challenge by transferring knowledge from a high-resource source language with abundant entity labels to a low-resource target language with few or no labels. Specified in this paper, we attempt to tackle the extreme scenario of unsupervised transfer, where no labeled data is available in the target language.\n\n[1]  Our method performs competitively, considering that we use a much smaller dictionary than  Mayhew et al.

To improve robustness to word order differences, we propose to use self-attention, which allows for a degree of flexibility with respect to word order.\n\nOur method for improving lexical mapping across languages uses bilingual word embeddings, while incorporating self-attention to better handle word order differences.

This suggests that when models are constrained by repetition, they are less likely to produce questions.\n\nHowever, as noted in [3], by adjusting the repetition control using a variable `z`, question-asking can be increased without introducing the risk of degenerate output. This means that with a high enough value of `z`, the model can still produce a high frequency of questions.\n\nFurthermore, [10] emphasizes that conditional training, which we use to control question-asking, is preferable to weighted decoding because it allows for a range of question-asking frequencies, from 0% to 100%, without introducing the risk of degenerate output. This supports the idea that repetition control can affect question-asking frequency.\n\nTo visualize this effect, consider image4, which shows a line graph comparing the frequency of question-asking across different methods controlling question-asking. The repetition-controlled CT method (purple line with squares) shows a more gradual increase in question percentage compared to the question-controlled CT method (blue line with circles), which approaches near 100% at higher control levels.\n\nIn summary, the presence of repetition control can reduce the frequency of question-asking in generated text. However, by adjusting the repetition control using a variable `z`, it is possible to increase question-asking frequency without introducing degenerate output.\n\n### Interleaved Text and Image Response\n\nControlling for repetition, specificity, and question-asking all lead to large engagingness improvements over the greedy and beam-search baseline models.\n\n![The repetition-controlled CT method (purple line with squares) shows a more gradual increase in question percentage compared to the question-controlled CT method (blue line with circles), which approaches near 100% at higher control levels.](image4)\n\nThis suggests that by adjusting the repetition control, we can modulate the frequency of question-asking in generated text, which can impact the engagingness of dialogues."}

The process involves iterative ly refining search queries based on the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive Retrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu- ally converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide the retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained retrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that systematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It can be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where the user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The recursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with the search outcomes. \n![Image of Table categorizing different evaluation metrics or criteria](image1)\n\nOn the other hand, Adaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced. \n![Table categorizing various tasks related to QA, dialog, information extraction, reasoning, and other NLP applications](image2)\n\nThe comparison of the three retrieval processes shows their unique characteristics and purposes.

We ﬁnd that one can integrate information across documents, but nei- ther excels at selecting relevant information from a larger documents set, as their accuracy increases sig- niﬁcantly when given only documents guaranteed to be relevant. The best model reaches   $54.5\\%$   on an annotated test set, compared to human performance at  $85.0\\%$ , indicating ample room for improvement.\n[2] The  Document-cue  baseline can predict more than a third of the samples correctly, for both datasets, even after sub-sampling frequent document-answer pairs for W IKI H OP. The relative strength of this and other baselines proves to be an important is- sue when designing multi-hop datasets, which we addressed through the measures described in Sec- tion 3.2. In Table 4 we compare the two relevant baselines on W IKI H OP  before and after applying ﬁltering measures. The absolute strength of these baselines before ﬁltering shows how vital address- ing this issue is:   $74.6\\%$   accuracy could be reached through exploiting the  cooccurrence  $(d,c)$   statistic alone. This underlines the paramount importance of investigating and addressing dataset biases that oth- erwise would confound seemingly strong RC model performance.\n![Document-cue baseline accuracy before and after filtering on WIKIHOP: 36.7% and 74.6% respectively](image5)\n\n[7] We conducted further experiments to examine the RC models when presented with only the relevant documents in    $S_{q}$ , i.e., the chain of documents lead- ing to the correct answer. This allows us to investi- gate the hypothetical performance of the models if they were able to select and read only relevant docu- ments: Table 6 summarizes these results. Models improve greatly in this  gold chain  setup, with up to  $81.2\\%~/~85.7\\%$   on W IKI H OP  in the masked set- ting for    $B i D A F$ . This demonstrates that RC models are capable of identifying the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are mentioned, which is particularly evident for M ED H OP, where docu- ments tend to discuss only single drug candidates. In the  masked  gold chain setup, models can then pick up on what the masking template looks like and achieve almost perfect scores. Conversely, these results also show that the models’ answer selec- tion process is not robust to the introduction of un- related documents with type-consistent candidates. This indicates that learning to intelligently select rel- evant documents before RC may be among the most promising directions for future model development.\n![Document-cue model's accuracy in the gold chain setup on WIKIHOP: up to 81.2%](image4)\n[4] Both neural RC models are able to largely retain or even improve their strong performance when an- swers are masked: they are able to leverage the tex- tual context of the candidate expressions. To under- stand differences in model behavior between W IK - I H OP  and M ED H OP, it is worth noting that drug mentions in M ED H OP  are normalized to a unique single-word identiﬁer, and performance drops under masking. In contrast, for the open-domain setting of W IKI H OP, a reduction of the answer vocabulary to 100 random single-token  mask  expressions clearly helps the model in selecting a candidate span, com- pared to the multi-token candidate expressions in the unmasked setting. Overall, although both neural RC models clearly outperform the other baselines, they still have large room for improvement compared to human performance at  $74\\%\\,/\\,85\\%$   for W IKI H OP.\n![Model's performance with and without masking on WIKIHOP](image2)"}

The bars are color-coded to represent \"shallow\" claims (1–2 reasoning steps) and \"deep\" claims (3 or more reasoning steps). The distribution indicates that 86% of the claims require 3 or more reasoning steps, demonstrating the complexity of reasoning in S CI T AB.\n\nThis provides insight into the model's ability to generate text based on the complexity of the reasoning involved in verifying the claims.\n\n### Table of Functions\n\nThe table lists functions related to data analysis tasks, along with descriptions and the proportion (%) of each function's usage. The functions include simple lookup, comparison, closed-domain knowledge, open-domain knowledge, commonsense knowledge, and others. The table shows that simple lookup and comparison are the most commonly used functions, followed by closed-domain knowledge and commonsense knowledge.\n\nThis provides information on the model's ability to generate text based on the functions used in data analysis tasks.\n\n### Human-Model Collaboration Process\n\nThe image illustrates the human-model collaboration process for constructing S CI T AB, consisting of three steps: data preparation, automatic claim generation, and manual claim verification. Each step is connected visually, showing the flow from data preparation to claim verification.\n\nThis provides insight into the model's ability to generate text based on the human-model collaboration process.\n\n### Green and Grey Rectangles\n\nThe question asks for the numbers of green and grey rectangles in the first figure of the paper, listed in descending order.

We also obtained the performance of 'Ours (VAE)' on the Yelp dataset as a reference.\n\nFrom text quote [1], we see that the model 'Ours (VAE)' achieves high style-transfer accuracy (STA) in both experiments.\n\nText quote [1] states that Our method achieves high style-transfer accuracy (STA) in both experiments.

The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised signals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from the LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective fine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse downstream applications.

Let's look at the image and the text quotes.\n\nFirst, let's examine the image response that illustrates information that will support the answer to the user question:\n![Table summarizing dataset characteristics](image5)\n\n\nNow, let's examine the text quotes.\n[1] All datasets in ERASER were tokenized using spaCy 11   library (with SciSpacy ( Neumann et al., 2019 ) for Evidence Inference). In addition, we also split all datasets except e-SNLI and CoS-E into sentences using the same library. \n[4] For these models, we set the sparsity rate at 0.01 and we set the contiguity loss weight to 2 times sparsity rate (following the original paper). We used bert-base-uncased ( Wolf et al.,  2019 ) as to- ken embedder (for all datasets except BoolQ, Ev- idence Inference and FEVER) and Bidirectional LSTM with 128 dimensional hidden state in each direction. A dropout ( Srivastava et al.,  2014 ) rate of 0.2 was used before feeding the hidden repre- sentations to attention layer in decoder and linear layer in encoder. One layer MLP with 128 dimen- sional hidden state and ReLU activation was used to compute the decoder output distribution. \n[6] As deﬁned, the above measures have assumed discrete rationales  $r_{i}$ . We would also like to eval- uate the faithfulness of continuous importance scores assigned to tokens by models. Here we adopt a simple approach for this. We convert soft scores over features    $s_{i}$   provided by a model into discre ationales    $r_{i}$   by taking the op  $-k_{d}$   v es, where  $k_{d}$   is a threshold for dataset  d. We set  $k_{d}$   to the average rationale length provided by humans for dataset    $d$   (see Table  4 ). Intuitively, this says: How much does the model prediction change if we remove a number of tokens equal to what humans use (on average for this dataset) in order of the importance scores assigned to these by the model. Once we have discretized the soft scores into ra- tionales in this way, we compute the faithfulness scores as per Equations  1  and  2.\n[7] Table 6: General dataset statistics: number of labels, instances, unique documents, and average numbers of sen- tences and tokens in documents, across the publicly released train/validation/test splits in ERASER. For CoS-E and e-SNLI, the sentence counts are not meaningful as the partitioning of question/sentence/answer formatting is an arbitrary choice in this framework. \n[9] Table 5: Detailed breakdowns for each dataset - the number of documents, instances, evidence statements, and lengths. Additionally we include the percentage of each relevant document that is considered a rationale. For test sets, counts are for all instances including documents with non comprehensive rationales. \n[10] BoolQ  ( Clark et al.,  2019 ) The BoolQ dataset re- quired substantial processing. The original dataset did not retain source Wikipedia articles or col- lection dates. In order to identify the source paragraphs, we download the 12/20/18 Wikipedia archive, and use FuzzyWuzzy  https://github. com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy  to identify the source paragraph span that best matches the original re- lease. If the Levenshtein distance ratio does not reach a score of at least 90, the corresponding in- stance is removed. For public release, we use the ofﬁcial validation set for testing, and repartition train into a training and validation set. \nThe user question is: Which dataset has the highest average number of sentences per document?\n\nAccording to the [7], The datasets listed include MultiRC, Evidence Inference, Exhaustive Evidence Inference, Movie Reviews, Exhaustive Movie Reviews, FEVER, BoolQ, e-SNLI, and CoS-E. Each dataset may serve different purposes such as reasoning, inference, or sentiment analysis, and the table lays out how comprehensive (in terms of evidence and rationales) and sizable each dataset is.  \nFor the answer to the question of which dataset has the highest average number of sentences per document, we find that the Movie Reviews has an average of 36.8 sentences per document. \n\nIn conclusion, to answer the question, The dataset with the highest average number of sentences per document is Movie Reviews, with an average of 36.8 sentences per document. \n\nHere is the Markdown interleaved text and image response:\nThe dataset with the highest average number of sentences per document is Movie Reviews, with an average of 36.8 sentences per document.\n![Movie Reviews](image4) Movie Reviews instance is a movie review with parts of the text highlighted as rationales.

The model then chooses a relation ($r_t$), which is \"PUBLISHER\" for this instance. Given the parent entity, the model identifies the specific entity to render ($e_t$), which is \"Nintendo\" in this case, from the local knowledge graph.\n\nThe entity to render is determined through a multi-step process involving type of mention, parent entity selection, relation identification, and local knowledge graph exploration. \n\n**Conclusion**\nThe model decides which entity to render in the context of 'published by' through a multi-step process involving type of mention, parent entity selection, relation identification, and local knowledge graph exploration. Specifically, the model first determines the type of mention, then selects the parent entity, chooses a relation, and finally identifies the specific entity to render from the local knowledge graph."}

That means di- rectly adding logic without any constraints will bring some uncer- tainty; 3) Typically, a higher logical inconsistency corresponds to a poorer micro-F1, however, rectifying logical inconsistency does not necessarily lead to the same degree of increase in micro-F1.\n\n[6] In Figure 7, We conduct a case study of Llama- 13B’s answers to the same input before and after pre-training. From Figure 7 we can see that LlaMA2-13B-PT could output the correct answers after pre-training on  LLM-LR, which validates the effectiveness of our pre-training approach.\n\n[7] The image illustrates an ablation study of ChatGPT for demonstrations and iterative retrieval, focusing on the impact of logical constraints on performance and consistency.

The architecture of the LOGIC-LM model is illustrated in the figure shown in![Figure5](image5). The modules work in tandem to tackle a problem presented in natural language.\n\nThe **Problem Formulator** module, comprising the Language Processing Model (LLM), is responsible for converting a natural language problem into a symbolic representation. This is achieved through in-context learning, which enables the model to learn the representation of the problem based on the context provided. The Problem Formulator utilizes LLMs to generate a symbolic representation of the problem, comprising rules, facts, and queries. These representations are designed to be understood by the Symbolic Reasoner.\n\nThe **Symbolic Reasoner** component is a deterministic symbolic solver that performs logical inference on the formulated problem. It leverages various methods, including Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, and Constraint Optimization, to deduce the solution to the problem. The choice of method depends on the nature of the problem, with Logic Programming applied to problems involving rules, First-order Logic Provers employed for logical entailment, and Constraint Optimization utilized for problems involving constraints.\n\nFinally, the **Result Interpreter** module translates the symbolic answer derived by the Symbolic Reasoner into a comprehensible form. This module is responsible for providing a natural language answer to the original problem posed.\n\nThrough this modular design, the LOGIC-LM model can efficiently process a wide range of problem types, from logic and reasoning problems to constraint satisfaction problems and analytical reasoning tasks.

Traditional metrics have focused on basic, lexical-level features such as counting the number of matching n-grams between the MT hypothesis and the reference translation. Metrics such as B LEU and M ETEOR remain popular as a means of evaluating MT systems due to their light-weight and fast computation.\n[3] The MQM corpus is a proprietary internal database of MT-generated translations of customer support chat messages that were annotated according to the guidelines set out in Burchardt and Lommel (2014). This data contains a total of 12K tuples, covering 12 language pairs from English to: German (en-de), Spanish (en-es), Latin-American Spanish (en-es-latam), French (en-fr), Italian (en-it), Japanese (en-ja), Dutch (en-nl), Portuguese (en-pt), Brazilian Portuguese (en-pt-br), Russian (en-ru), Swedish (en-sv), and Turkish (en-tr).\n[4] Table 1 shows results for all eight language pairs with English as source. We contrast our three C OMET models against baseline metrics such as B LEU and CHR F, the 2019 task winning metric Y I S I -1, as well as the more recent B ERTSCORE. We observe that across the board our three models trained with the C OMET framework outperform, often by significant margins, all other metrics. Our DA RR Ranker model outperforms the two Estimators in seven out of eight language pairs.\n[7] 4 clearly show that for the translation ranking architecture, including the source improves the overall correlation with human judgments. Furthermore, the inclusion of the source exposed the second variant of the model to English embeddings which is .\n[8] Table 2: Kendall’s Tau (τ) correlations on language pairs with English as a target for the WMT19 Metrics DA RR corpus. As for B ERTSCORE, for B LEURT we report results for two models: the base model, which is comparable in size with the encoder we used and the large model that is twice the size.\n[9] Human judgements of MT quality usually come in the form of segment-level scores, such as DA, MQM and HTER. For DA, it is common practice to convert scores into relative rankings (DA RR) when the number of annotations per segment is limited (Bojar et al., 2017b; Ma et al., 2018, 2019). This means that, for two MT hypotheses h_i and h_j of the same source s, if the DA score assigned to h_i is higher than the score assigned to h_j, h_i is regarded as a “better” hypothesis.\n[10] To shed some light on the actual value and contribution of the source language input in our models’ ability to learn accurate predictions, we trained two versions of our DA RR Ranker model: one that uses only the reference, and another that uses both reference and source. Both models were trained using the WMT 2017 corpus that only includes language pairs from English (en-de, en-cs, en-ﬁ, en-tr). In other words, while English was never observed as a target language during training for both variants of the model, the training of the second variant includes English source embeddings. We then tested these two model variants on the WMT 2018 corpus for these language pairs and for the reversed directions (with the exception of cs-en because cs-en does not exist for WMT 2018). The results in Table  show that our three models trained with the C OMET framework outperform, often by significant margins, all other metrics. Our DA RR Ranker model outperforms the two Estimators in seven out of eight language pairs. Also, even though the MQM Estimator is trained on only 12K annotated segments, it performs roughly on par with the HTER Estimator for most language-pairs, and outperforms all the other metrics in en-ru."}

Word-level embeddings provide a semantic representation of each word in a vector form, capturing its meaning and relationships with other words.\n\n[1] The hierarchical CRF model consists of three components: a character-level neural network, ei- ther an RNN or a CNN, that allows the model to capture subword information, such as morpholog- ical variations and capitalization patterns; a word- level neural network, usually an RNN, that con- sumes word representations and produces context sensitive hidden representations for each word; and a linear-chain CRF layer that models the de- pendency between labels and performs inference. [2] Figure 1 shows an example of the embeddings and translations learned with our approach trained on Spanish and English data from the experiments (see $\\S4$ for more details). As shown in the ﬁgure, there is usually a noticeable difference between the word embeddings of a word pair in different languages, which is inevitable because different languages have distinct traits and different mono- lingual data, and as a result it is intrinsically hard to learn a perfect alignment. This indicates that models trained directly on data using the source [3] During learning, all word embeddings are nor- malized to lie on the unit ball, allowing every training pair an equal contribution to the objective and improving word translation accuracy (Artetxe et al., 2016). When training the NER model, however, we do not normalize the word embeddings, because preliminary experiments showed the orig- inal unnormalized embeddings gave superior re- sults. We suspect this is due to frequency infor- mation conveyed by vector length, an important signal for NER. (Named entities appear less fre- quently in the monolingual corpus.)

Recent works mainly perform soft bag-level noise reduction strategies to ﬁnd the relatively better samples in a sentence bag, which is suboptimal compared with making a hard decision of false positive samples in sen- tence level. In this paper, we introduce an adversarial learning framework, which we named DSGAN, to learn a sentence- level true-positive generator. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks, we re- gard the positive samples generated by the generator as the negative samples to train the discriminator. The optimal generator is obtained until the discrimination ability of the discriminator has the greatest decline.

The main results are shown in Ta- ble  3. We can clearly ﬁnd that the proposed GCAN signiﬁcantly outperforms the best competing meth- ods over all metrics across two datasets, improving the performance by around   $17\\%$   and   $15\\%$   on aver- age in Twitter15 and Twitter16, respectively. Even without the proposed graph-aware representation, GCAN-G can improve the best competing method by   $14\\%$   and  $3\\%$   on average in Twitter15 and Twit- ter16, respectively. Such promising results prove the effectiveness of GCAN for fake news detec- tion. The results also imply three insights. First, GCAN is better than GCAN-G by   $3.5\\%$   and   $13\\%$  improvement in Twitter15 and Twitter16, respec- tively. This exhibits the usefulness of graph-aware representation. Second, the dual co-attention mech- anism in GCAN is quite powerful, as it clearly out- performs the best non-co-attention state-of-the-art model CSI. Third, while both GCAN-G and dE- FEND are co-attention-based, additional sequential features learned from the retweet user sequence in GCAN-G can signiﬁcantly boost the performance. [3]\n[4] Data.  Two well-known datasets compiled by  Ma et al.  ( 2017 ), Twitter15 and Twitter16, are uti- lized. Each dataset contains a collection of source tweets, along with their corresponding sequences of retweet users. We choose only “true” and “fake” labels as the ground truth. Since the original data does not contain user proﬁles, we use user IDs to crawl user information via Twitter API. [5]\n[6] Explainability on Retweet Propagation.  We aim to exploit the retweet order in propagations to unfold the behavior difference between fake and real news. We randomly pick three fake (F1-F3) and three true (T1-T3) source stories, and plot their weights from source-propagation co-attention (Sec- tion  4.5 ), as exhibited in Figure  6, in which the horizontal direction from left to right denotes the order of retweet. The results show that to determine whether a story is fake, one should ﬁrst examine the characteristics of users who  early  retweet the source story. The evidences of fake news in terms of user characteristics may be evenly distributed in the propagation. [7]\n[7] This paper deals with fake news detection un- der a more realistic scenario on social media. We predict whether a source tweet story is fake, given only its  short text  content and its  retweet sequence of users, along with  user proﬁles. That said, we detect fake news under three settings: (a) short-text source tweet, (b) no text of user comments, and (c) no network structures of social network and diffu- sion network. Moreover, we require the fake news detection model to be capable of  explainability, i.e., highlighting the evidence when determining a story is fake. The model is expected to point out the suspicious retweeters who support the spreading of fake news, and highlight the words they especially pay attention to from the source tweet. [8] Competing Methods.  We compare our GCAN with the state-of-the-art methods and some base- lines, as listed below.

(2)  SVM-TS  ( Ma et al.,  2015 ): a linear support vector machine classi- ﬁer that utilizes the source tweet and the sequence of retweet users’ proﬁles. (3)  mGRU  ( Ma et al., 2016 ): a modiﬁed gated recurrent unit model for rumor detection, which learns temporal patterns from retweet user proﬁle, along with the source’s features. (4)  RFC  ( Kwon et al.,  2017 ): an ex- tended random forest model combining features from retweet user proﬁles and the source tweet. (5) CSI  ( Ruchansky et al.,  2017 ): a state-of-the-art fake news detection model incorporating articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news by using LSTM and calculating the user scores. (6)  tCNN  ( Yang et al.,  2018 ): a modi- ﬁed convolution neural network that learns the lo- cal variations of user proﬁle sequence, combining with the source tweet features. (7)  CRNN  ( Liu and Wu,  2018 ): a state-of-the-art joint CNN and RNN model that learns local and global varia- tions of retweet user proﬁles, together with the resource tweet. (8)  dEFEND  ( Shu et al.,  2019a ): a state-of-the-art co-attention-based fake news detec- tion model that learns the correlation between the source article’s sentences and user proﬁles. [9] This paper solves the fake news detection prob- lem under a more realistic scenario on so- cial media. Given the source short-text tweet and the corresponding sequence of retweet users without text comments, we aim at pre- dicting whether the source tweet is fake or not, and generating explanation by highlight- ing the evidences on suspicious retweeters and the words they concern. We develop a novel neural network-based model, Graph-aware Co- Attention Networks (GCAN), to achieve the goal. Extensive experiments conducted on real tweet datasets exhibit that GCAN can signiﬁ- cantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by  $16\\%$   in accuracy on average. In addition, the case studies also show that GCAN can produce reasonable explanations. [10] Early Detection.  We further report the perfor- mance (in only Accuracy due to page limit) by varying the number of observed retweet users per source story (from  10  to  50 ), as exhibited in Fig- ure  2  and Figure  3. It can be apparently found that our GCAN consistently and signiﬁcantly outper- forms the competitors. Even with only ten retweet- ers, GCAN can still achieve   $90\\%$   accuracy. Such results tell GCAN is able to generate accurate early detection of the spreading fake news, which is cru- [5]\n![Tweet Data](image3)\n\n[4]\n![Training on Twitter15](image5)\n\nBy examining Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets, it can be seen that Twitter15 contains more source tweets, true tweets, and users compared to Twitter16. For instance, Twitter15 contains 742 source tweets, 372 true tweets, and 190,868 users, whereas Twitter16 contains 412 source tweets, 205 true tweets, and 115,036 users. As a result, Twitter15 presents a more extensive range of possible fake news cases, which GCAN can analyze more effectively.\n![Comparing Datasets](image3)\nAccording to the table presented in [3], Twitter15 contains 742 source tweets, while Twitter16 contains 412 source tweets. Similarly, Twitter15 has 372 true tweets, whereas Twitter16 contains 205 true tweets. Consequently, Twitter15 has a higher number of source tweets and true tweets compared to Twitter16."}

Figure 3 shows the performance of tree traversal with different top-sizes and collapsed tree with different maximum token numbers. The collapsed tree approach consistently performs better. We believe collapsed tree retrieval is better due to offering greater flexibility than tree traversal; i.e., by searching through all the nodes simultaneously, it retrieves information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question.\n\n[3] One drawback, however, of the collapsed tree approach is that it requires cosine similarity search to be performed on all nodes in the tree. However, this can be made more efficient with fast $k$-nearest neighbor libraries such as FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019).\n\n[9] The tree traversal method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are considered at the next layer and the top $\\cdot\\mathrm{k}$ nodes are selected from this pool again based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated until we reach the leaf nodes.\n\nThese sections highlight the performance differences between the collapsed tree and tree traversal methods, indicating that the collapsed tree approach generally outperforms tree traversal in terms of F1 score across different context lengths.\n\n### The Image\n\nimage3 is described as: The image is a graph comparing different querying methods based on the F1 score. The x-axis represents the Context Length, ranging from 0 to 2500. The y-axis shows the F1 score, ranging from 40 to 65.\n\nThere are two lines representing different methods:\n- **Collapsed tree** (green line): Shows results over various context lengths. It peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, slightly decreasing as the context length increases to 2500.\n- **Tree Traversal** (blue line): Shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length, but overall performs lower than the collapsed tree method.\n\n### The Answer\n\nBased on the information provided, the collapsed tree querying method generally outperforms the tree traversal method in terms of F1 score across different context lengths. The collapsed tree approach is able to achieve higher F1 scores, particularly at longer context lengths, due to its ability to retrieve information from all nodes simultaneously, offering greater flexibility than the tree traversal method."}

[1]\n\nTo further distinguish the difference between  MMMU  and other existing ones, we elaborate the benchmark details in Figure 4. From the  breadth  perspective, the prior bench- marks are heavily focused on daily knowledge and com- mon sense. The covered image format is also limited. Our benchmark aims to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemi- cal structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. In the  depth  aspect, the previ- ous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge or simple physical or temporal reasoning. In contrast, our benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge. [2]\n\nIn this context, we evaluate various models including LLMs and LMMs. In each type, we consider both closed- and open-source models. Our evaluation is conducted under a  zero-shot  set- ting to assess the capability of models to generate accurate answers without fine-tuning or few-shot demonstrations on our benchmark. For all models, we use the default prompt provided by each model for multi-choice or open QA, if available. If models do not provide prompts for task types in  MMMU, we conduct prompt engineering on the validation set and use the most effective prompt for the zero-shot setup in the main experiments. We also report the few-shot results of some selected models in the Appendix. All experiments are conducted with NVIDIA A100 GPUs. [7]\n\nTo this end, we introduce  MMMU : a comprehensive benchmark designed for college-level multi-discipline mul- timodal understanding and reasoning. It features problems sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks span- ning six common disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Sci- ence, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering.  MMMU  consists of  11. 5 K carefully selected multimodal questions, which cover  30  diverse sub- jects and  183  subfields, thus meeting the  breadth  goal. Moreover, many problems within  MMMU  require expert-level reasoning, such as applying “Fourier Transform” or “Equi- librium Theory” to derive the solution, thus meeting the depth  goal.  MMMU  also presents two unique challenges ab- sent in current benchmarks ( Figure 1 ). Firstly, it covers di- verse image formats, from visual scenes like photographs and paintings to diagrams and tables, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. Secondly,  MMMU  features interleaved text-image inputs. A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge, and conducting complex reasoning based on the understanding and knowledge to reach a solution.

It works on the principle of allowing coffee grounds to pass through a mesh or perforated surface while keeping the liquid on top. This design is particularly useful for users who want to minimize mess and cleanup.

It was heralded as the largest single building in the world by gross floor area, measuring in at 1,700,000 square metres, and opened in 2013 after only three years of construction.The timing was unfortunate: Deng Hong, the founder of the company developing the project, was arrested that year on corruption charges.

The general thrust of MIC 2025 is to spur innovation in manufacturing and encourage homegrown products. The central government has since selected a few cities to “pilot” this scheme. In 2017, Chengdu became the fourth city nationally and the only city in the western region to be designated a pilot zone for MIC 2025.\n[5] More recently, the city played host to G20 finance ministers and central bank governors during their convention in July last year, and the city is currently developing a 5.1 square kilometre area that it dubs the “Financial City” (one of the main strips in Financial City is Jiaozi Avenue). Many financial institutions have already moved to there, following clients who have relocated to the surrounding CBD.\n[6] The place where top diplomats reside on trips to Chengdu.

Chengdu’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturer Sinotruk, for example, delivered 1,500 heavy-duty trucks to Myanmar in July this year. The Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridor is expected to be another of China’s commercial thoroughfares bringing business to Chengdu.\n[9] are now on display at the Jinsha Museum in Chengdu, including the Golden Sun Bird disc (see photo on page 8), which has since become the official logo of the city. \n[10] Chengdu’s appointment as a pilot zone may not be entirely good news for foreign companies, however, as the MIC 2025 plan has faced critic is is m as being protectionist. The European  Union  Chamber  of Commerce in China issued a lengthy report on the plan accusing the government in Beijing of attempting to “severely curtail the position of foreign business” with its “large-scale import substitution plan aimed at national ising key industries”.

According to image2, the percentage of healthcare organizations adopting electronic medical records (EMRs) increased from 61% in 2005 to 62% in 2006. Similarly, the adoption of bar coded medication management systems, computerized practitioner order entry (CPOE), and other clinical decision support systems also showed steady growth.\n\nOn the other hand, image2 also highlights some areas of concern. For instance, the adoption of point-of-care decision support systems decreased from 41% in 2005 to 37% in 2006. This decrease may be attributed to the challenges in achieving end-user acceptance and proving the quantifiable benefits of these systems.\n\n**Changes in Functions Related to Patient Information and Clinical Orders**\n====================================================================\n\nAccording to image4, the current usage of access to patient clinical information is relatively low, at 45%. However, this is expected to increase to 53% in two years, indicating a positive trend in the adoption of healthcare IT. Similarly, physician access for clinical orders is also expected to increase from 44% to 57% in two years.\n\nThese trends suggest that healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting IT solutions to improve patient care and clinical outcomes. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as achieving end-user acceptance and proving the return on investment (ROI) of these systems.\n\n**Challenges and Barriers to Adoption**\n-------------------------------------\n\nImage5 highlights some of the challenges faced by healthcare organizations in adopting healthcare IT. The top challenges include:\n\n* Proving IT quantifiable benefits/ROI (10% in 2005 and 10% in 2006)\n* Difficulty achieving end-user acceptance (8% in 2005 and 8% in 2006)\n* Lack of clinical leadership (10% in 2006)\n* Lack of top management support (7% in 2005 and 7% in 2006)\n\nThese challenges underscore the need for healthcare organizations to address these issues to ensure successful adoption and utilization of healthcare IT.\n\n```markdown\n![Image 1: Bar chart comparing patient satisfaction, Medicare cutbacks, reducing medical errors, cost pressures, clinical transformation, integration and interoperability, improving quality of care, adoption of new technology, improving operational efficiency, and providing IT to ambulatory facilities.](image1)\n![Image 2: Bar graph comparing results from 2005 and 2006 across various categories related to healthcare information systems.](image2)\n![Image 3: Bar chart comparing results from 2005 and 2006 for various activities or features related to healthcare or organizational services.](image3)\n![Image 4: Horizontal bar chart comparing current usage versus projected usage in two years for various organizational functions.](image4)\n![Image 5: Bar chart comparing survey results between 2005 and 2006 regarding various challenges faced by healthcare organizations.](image5)\n```"}

It consists of several stages, including data collection, analysis, and decision-making. To comprehend how the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics complement each other, let's first explore what each term means.\n\n**Analytics Value Chain** is a framework that outlines the steps involved in transforming data into value. It includes the following stages:\n- **Reporting**: The initial stage where data is used to raise questions and provide information. Reporting is about eliciting what happened, how many, how often, and where.\n- **Ad-Hoc Reports**: The stage where data is used to address specific queries, such as \"How many, how often, where?\"\n- **Query Drilldown (OLAP)**: This stage involves answering the question \"Where exactly is the problem?\"\n- **Alerts**: Alerts determine what actions are needed based on the data.\n- **Statistical Analysis**: This stage explores why things are happening and seeks to understand the underlying causes.\n- **Forecasting**: Forecasting considers what will happen if current trends continue.\n- **Predictive Modelling**: Predictive modeling predicts what will happen next.\n- **Optimisation**: Optimisation evaluates what's the best that can happen.\nThe Analytics Value Chain diagram [image2] shows the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, increasing both business value and degree of intelligence as one moves up the hierarchy.\n\n**Levels of Analytics**, on the other hand, refers to the different stages of maturity in the Analytics Value Chain. These levels represent a progression from basic reporting to advanced predictive analytics. The levels are often categorized into four main stages:\n- **Standard Reports**: The initial stage where data is used to raise questions and provide information.\n- **Ad-Hoc Reports**: The stage where data is used to address specific queries.\n- **Query Drilldown (OLAP)**: This stage involves answering the question \"Where exactly is the problem?\"\n- **Alerts**: Alerts determine what actions are needed based on the data.\n- **Statistical Analysis**: This stage explores why things are happening and seeks to understand the underlying causes.\n- **Forecasting**: Forecasting considers what will happen if current trends continue.\n- **Predictive Modelling**: Predictive modeling predicts what will happen next.\n- **Optimisation**: Optimisation evaluates what's the best that can happen.\n\nThe progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, as depicted in the Analytics Value Chain diagram [image2], aligns with the Levels of Analytics. Business Intelligence includes stages 1 to 4, while Business Analytics includes stages 5 to 8.\n\nThe image [image4] illustrates a data-driven process that transforms data into value, from data storage to reporting, analysis, action, and finally to value. This process embodies the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics, where each stage builds upon the previous one to create actionable insights and value.\n\nTo complement each other, the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics require a strong data leadership that understands and supports the needs of the business. This leadership enables the analytics organization to perform at its best, to be happy and productive, and to maximize its impact. A collaborative, inclusive, open, and inquisitive Chief Data Officer/Chief Analytics Officer is essential to drive the organization towards a data-driven culture.\n\nIn conclusion, the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics work together to transform data into actionable insights and value. By understanding the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics and the different stages of maturity, organizations can unlock the full potential of data-driven decision-making and create a culture that values data-driven insights."}

Although the actual percentages are not provided in the question, this tool likely provides a more detailed breakdown of the conversions by channel combination.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information, we can make an educated inference that the combination of Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels likely accounts for a substantial percentage of total conversions, possibly in the range of 100% - 120%, considering the significant contributions of these channels.\n\nHere is the interleaved answer with images:\n![Contribution of Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels to total conversions](image5)\n\n[10] Multi-Channel Conversion Visualizer, supports analyzing different combinations of channels to understand their impact on total conversions.\n\nTo further refine our answer, we can evaluate the signals and relationships presented in the provided text quotes and image responses. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the combination of Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels likely accounts for a significant portion of total conversions.\n\nFor example, Direct accounts for 62.67%, Organic Search for 40.12%, and Referral for 18.49% of total conversions.\nTherefore, assuming that these three channels are independent, we can calculate the percentage of total conversions involving the combination of these channels as follows:\nPercentage of total conversions involving Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels = (Percentage of total conversions involving Direct) + (Percentage of total conversions involving Organic Search) + (Percentage of total conversions involving Referral)\n= 62.67% + 40.12% + 18.49%\n= 121.28%\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the channels are independent, which might not be the case in reality. Nevertheless, this gives us an estimate that the combination of Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels likely accounts for around 121.28% of total conversions, which seems unrealistic. A more realistic estimate would be around 100% - 120% of total conversions, considering the significant contributions of these channels.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, we can infer that the combination of Direct, Organic Search, and Referral channels likely accounts for a significant percentage of total conversions, possibly in the range of 100% - 120%."}

Here's a breakdown of the significant changes:\n\n- **Internal Breach of Security**: In 2005, 56% of respondents were concerned, while in 2006, this percentage dropped to 51%.\n- **HIPAA Compliance**: The percentage of respondents concerned about HIPAA compliance increased from 35% in 2005 to 18% in 2006.\n- **External Breach of Security**: The percentage of respondents concerned about external breaches increased from 25% in 2005 to 12% in 2006.\n- **Unauthorized Use of Data by Third Parties**: The percentage concerned about this issue increased from 18% in 2005 to 12% in 2006.\n- **Physician's Lack of Confidence**: The percentage concerned about physicians' lack of confidence decreased from 7% in 2006 (no data available in 2005) to 7% in 2006.\n\nThese changes suggest that there was a shift in the perception of security concerns among healthcare professionals over the period of 2005 to 2006. However, specific security concerns remained relatively consistent, with a focus on internal security breaches, HIPAA compliance, external breaches, and the unauthorized use of data by third parties.\n\n### Implementation of Security Tools\n\nImage [6] provides insights into the implementation of security tools in 2006. Here are the key points:\n\n- **Firewalls**: The percentage of hospitals with firewalls today is 98%, compared to 53% in two years.\n- **User Access Controls**: The percentage of hospitals with user access controls today is 88%, compared to 53% in two years.\n- **Audit Logs**: The percentage of hospitals with audit logs today is 85%, compared to 60% in two years.\n- **Multi-Level Passcodes**: The percentage of hospitals with multi-level passcodes today is 75%, compared to 50% in two years.\n- **Off-Site Storage**: The percentage of hospitals with off-site storage today is 74%, compared to 58% in two years.\n- **Electronic Signature**: The percentage of hospitals with electronic signatures today is 71%, compared to 61% in two years.\n- **Data Encryption**: The percentage of hospitals with data encryption today is 71%, compared to 55% in two years.\n- **Disaster Recovery**: The percentage of hospitals with disaster recovery measures in place today is 68%, compared to 74% in two years.\n\nThese statistics show a promising increase in the implementation of security tools among healthcare institutions over the next two years. The focus on security measures such as firewalls, user access controls, audit logs, and data encryption indicates a growing concern for information security among healthcare providers.\n\n### Future Trends in Security Tools\n\nThe graph illustrating the diffusion of innovations model [3] in image [3] provides a general framework for understanding the future trends in security tool adoption. The model categorizes adopters into innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards based on their time since introduction and percentage of adoption.\n\nGiven the current adoption rates and growth trends in security tools, the future will likely see a continued focus on improving these measures, especially in the implementation of more advanced technologies such as electronic signatures, data encryption, and off-site storage. However, the curve's slow progression towards the late majority and laggards phases indicates that healthcare institutions will face challenges in adopting more complex security solutions, particularly within the next two years.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of security concerns in the healthcare sector showed a mixed trend between 2005 and 2006, with some concerns decreasing and others remaining constant. The implementation of security tools in hospitals, however, indicates a positive trend, with a focus on basic security measures that were lacking or insufficient in the past.\n\nFuture trends in security tools will likely focus on enhancing the implementation of existing security measures and gradually introducing more advanced solutions, albeit at a slower pace due to the nature of the adoption curve. This will be crucial for maintaining the information security posture of healthcare institutions, particularly in the face of increasing concerns and threats in the sector."}

In the context of this question, we're examining changes in time spent on activities that are grouped together in the data.\n\nThe first step is to identify the groups in the data, which are watching films and fitness activities. These two activities are seen as separate and distinct [1], and are grouped together due to their proximity in the data (i.e., they appear together in the charts).\n\nThe time spent on these activities is represented on a clock face in the image [image3]. The two clock faces represent the years 2005 and 2010, and show that there has been a decrease in time spent on watching films from 35% in 2005 to 22% in 2010. At the same time, there has been an increase in time spent on fitness activities from 5% in 2005 to 17% in 2010.\n\nThese changes in time spent on these activities can be seen as a simplification of the original data, where the complexity of the original data is eliminated [2] to reveal a more regular and orderly pattern. This is an example of the law of good Gestalt, which prioritizes conciseness and simplicity in perception [9].\n\n![A decrease in time spent watching films and an increase in time spent on fitness activities from 2005 to 2010](image3)\n\nOverall, this suggests that there has been a shift in lifestyle trends during this period, with a decrease in leisure activities and an increase in physical activity.

[1] It begins with the parental generation, where two alleles (different forms of a gene) are inherited by each offspring. [2] In the context of pea plants, one allele may be dominant (expressing a particular trait) and the other recessive (not expressing the trait). [3] The image [image3] illustrates different genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, highlighting the interactions between dominant and recessive alleles. \n\nFor example, in a cross between a purple-flowered plant (PP) and a white-flowered plant (pp), the F1 generation will be heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype. [4] When these heterozygous individuals are crossed, the gametes produced contain a 1:1 ratio of dominant (P) and recessive (p) alleles. [5] This results in the F2 generation exhibiting a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white and a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. [6] The visualization in the image [image4] helps to illustrate this process, showing the parental generation, gamete formation, F1 hybrid generation, and the segregation of alleles in the F2 generation. [7] It is worth noting that Mendel's work challenged the traditional views of inheritance, including the concept of pangenesis proposed by Aristotle. [8] Instead, Mendel demonstrated that heritable factors, now referred to as genes, are passed from parents to offspring. [9] The process of Mendelian inheritance involves the combination of genetic information from both parents, leading to unique traits expressed in offspring. [10] This unique combination of genes gives rise to variations in traits among individuals. \n\n![The F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white, demonstrating the effect of dominant and recessive alleles.](image5)"}

In the case of the multi-line graph chart, our perception creates a visual structure that reveals trends over time.\n\nThe **Proximity** principle (image description for image4) suggests that we see objects or data points that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group. In this chart, the multiple lines with different colors are grouped together to illustrate changes in the data over time.\n\nThe **Continuity** principle (image description for image4) implies that we perceive a smooth flow or pathway in the data, which helps us identify trends. The graph's continuous nature allows us to see the relationships between the different data points and lines.\n\nThe **Closure** principle (quote [4]) also plays a role in our perception of the chart. We tend to perceive the data as a whole, even if parts of it are missing or incomplete. This closure helps us identify trends and patterns in the data.\n\nBy applying the principles of Gestalt psychology, we can observe that the multi-line graph chart reveals trends in the data over the six months, such as fluctuations in the data values and changes in the patterns of each dataset.\n\nThis means that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form.

It encompasses several strategies for **Needs Exploration**, including:\n\n- **Active stakeholder participation**\n- **High-level requirements specification**\n- **Split (A/B) testing**\n- **Detailed requirements specification**\n- **Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)**\n- **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming**\n- **Look-ahead modeling**\n\nEach of these strategies is designed to capture the requirements effectively, making the solution more responsive to stakeholder needs. The approach is flexible and allows for adjustments throughout the process.\n\n#### Elicitation Methods\nElicitation Methods are techniques used to gather information and elicit requirements from stakeholders. In the context of DAD, **Elicitation Methods** include:\n\n- **Work item pool**\n- **Work item stack**\n- **Requirements backlog**\n- **Formal change management**\n- **None** for certain stakeholders\n\n- **Business value**\n- **Risk**\n- **Due date**\n- **Operational emergency**\n- **Dependency**\n\n- **During iteration**\n- **Future iterations**\n- **Never**\n\n- **Active stakeholder participation**\n- **Indirectly via proxies**\n- **Indirectly via electronic means**\n- **None**\n\n- **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming**\n- **Look-ahead modeling**\n- **All-hands demos**\n- **Iteration demos**\n\n### Comparison and Analysis\n\n- **Flexibility**: Both Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods provide flexible approaches to capturing and eliciting stakeholder requirements. However, **Needs Exploration** is more about understanding the needs before implementing any method.\n- **Approach to Stakeholders**: Needs Exploration can involve more direct engagement with stakeholders, whereas Elicitation Methods often rely on less direct approaches.\n- **Capturing Requirements**: Needs Exploration seems to be more focused on the process of capturing requirements through a variety of strategies. Elicitation Methods, on the other hand, provide the tools and techniques for capturing these requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while both Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods play critical roles in addressing stakeholder requirements in agile management, they serve different purposes and can be applied at different stages of the process. Needs Exploration sets the foundation for understanding stakeholder needs, while Elicitation Methods provide the tools to gather and elicit those requirements effectively.\n\n```![Agile Needs Exploration Elicitation Methods Comparison](image5)\n```\n\nThis comparison highlights the importance of understanding stakeholder needs and the different strategies available to elicit and capture those requirements."}

The columns \"Items with Errors\" and \"Pages\" highlight the quantity and distribution of errors in markup. For instance, the \"hatom\" data type has an error rate of 137/137 (100%), indicating a significant issue. Similarly, the \"Article\" data type has an error rate of 49,222/130,554 (38%), highlighting the need for accurate markup.\n\n[2] On the other hand, meta description issues can also impact SEO performance, as depicted in image1. The graph labeled \"Time spent downloading a page (in milliseconds)\" shows fluctuations, but the table shows that 2,215 pages have duplicate meta descriptions, 21 pages have long meta descriptions, and 1,450 pages have short meta descriptions. While the graph does not directly show the impact of meta descriptions, it is essential to ensure that meta descriptions are concise and accurate to improve page load times and user experience.\n\n[3] Furthermore, image3 shows the cumulative number of backlinks for the domain \"gorentals.co.nz\" over time, from June 2006 to October 2014.

However, it does not provide direct insight into how errors in structured markup or meta descriptions impact SEO.\n\n[4] To better understand the impact of structured markup errors and meta description issues on SEO performance, it is crucial to analyze the specific sections of the table and the image. For instance, the \"Article\" data type has a higher error rate (49,222/130,554) compared to the \"hatom\" data type (137/137).

The top priorities for 2006 were:\n\n*   **Reduce Medical Errors/Promote Patient Safety**, with 50% of respondents in 2006 citing this as a top priority, compared to 45% in 2005.\n*   **Implement an EMR**, with 45% of respondents in 2006 citing this as a top priority, compared to 36% in 2005.\n*   **Connecting IT at Hospital and Remote Locations**, with 36% of respondents in 2006 citing this as a top priority, compared to 29% in 2005.\n\nThese changes in priorities reflect the growing importance of patient safety and electronic medical records in healthcare IT implementation.\n\n### Patient Satisfaction and Financial Support\n\nRegarding patient satisfaction, **image2** shows that the percentage of patients who were satisfied with their care decreased from 51% in 2006 to 44% in 2005. This suggests that healthcare organizations faced challenges in improving patient satisfaction between 2005 and 2006.\n\nIn terms of financial support, **image5** shows that the percentage of respondents who cited lack of financial support as a challenge decreased from 20% in 2006 to 18% in 2005. This suggests that healthcare organizations made progress in securing financial support for their IT initiatives between 2005 and 2006.\n\n### Electronic Medical Records\n\n**image3** shows that the percentage of respondents who implemented electronic medical records (EMRs) increased from 61% in 2005 to 62% in 2006. This suggests that healthcare organizations made progress in implementing EMRs between 2005 and 2006.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe challenges faced by healthcare organizations in 2005 and 2006 were significant, with a focus on financial support, staffing resources, and vendor delivery. However, the priorities for healthcare IT implementation changed, with a growing emphasis on patient safety, electronic medical records, and connecting IT at hospital and remote locations. These changes reflect the evolving needs of healthcare organizations and the importance of effective IT implementation in improving patient care.\n\n### Image: **image4**\n![Priorities for Healthcare IT Implementation in 2005 and 2006](image4)\nThis image shows the priorities for healthcare IT implementation in 2005 and 2006, highlighting the growing importance of patient safety and electronic medical records."}

In 2016, the GDP further rose to 1217.02 billion RMB, with a growth rate of +7.7% [5]. These values can be better represented graphically as shown in **image5**![Increased GDP 2014-2016](image5).\nThe data from [5] indicates a steady increase in the total GDP from 2014 to 2016, demonstrating a high growth rate.\n\n### Changes in GDP Distribution Across Industries\n\n[1] The Financial City is being developed in three stages, and in its third stage, it will build industry parks tailored to their occupants, such as China UnionPay. Fang Zhao, chairman of the government-owned Chengdu Financial City Investment and Development Group, claimed last year that roughly  $90\\%$   of  phase I and phase II properties had been purchased, with 329 institutions collectively investing Rmb42 billion in the area.  \n[7] Chengdu’s High-Tech Zone is ranked third among China’s innovation centres in terms of capacity and innovation. Comprised of over 80,000 enterprises the zone contributed Rmb144 billion to the city’s GDP in 2016.  \nThese points indicate an increase in the secondary industry GDP, with a growth rate of +7.2% in 2015 and +6.7% in 2016 as per **image1**![GDP Distribution 2015-2016](image1).\n\n### Other Industry Growth\n\n[2] Chengdu aspires to be an important automobile manufacturing base by 2020, boosting its production capacity to 3 million cars   – or more than double the 1.15 million vehicles the city produced in 2016.\n[4] Li Donghui, the executive vice-president of Geely, expects his company’s total annual output value in Chengdu to reach Rmb100 billion when all the projects are finished. But evidently Geely doesn’t expect all of the output to be sold domestically. “We will build the Chengdu base into one of our most important strategic centres for new energy vehicles to serve the markets along the Belt and Road,” Li said.\n[8] After less than a year of operation, Taikoo Li generated Rmb1.9 billion in sales, making it the fourth highest grossing mall in Chengdu.\nThese points indicate that the tertiary industry is also on the rise with significant sales from Taikoo Li in **image2**![Retail Sales Taikoo Li](image2).\n\n### Property Market Strength\n\n[10] Another key strength in Chengdu’s live ability – and one that wasn’t measured by the index – is the property market. Chengdu has an economy about half the size of Beijing’s but its average property price is close to three- quarters less, just Rmb7,983 per square metre. Even in the central areas, the average cost is still low, at roughly Rmb13,600 per square metre.\nThe data points from [10] suggest a low average property price across industries, which may attract more investors and residents."}

Notably, the percentage of time spent with family and friends decreased from 35% to 21%, while watching films increased from 20% to 22%. In contrast, fitness and shopping remained relatively stable, but with a slight decrease in the latter. The image also shows that the proportion of time spent on net surfing decreased, and hobbies decreased by a small margin.\n    \nOn the other hand, the banana export data depicted in image3 shows a declining trend over the years 1994 to 2005. The export volume from Ecuador and Costa Rica increased, while the Philippines, Guatemala, and Honduras experienced a decrease. The decrease in export volume is more pronounced in the latter years, which might be attributed to factors such as changes in global demand, economic conditions, or competition from other producers. \n    \nThe decrease in spending time with family and friends and the decline in banana exports over the years 2005 to 2010 might be indicative of a broader societal trend towards more solitary activities and a shift away from traditional export-oriented economies. The changes in weekend activity distribution may reflect a desire for greater leisure time and relaxation, while the decline in banana exports may be a sign of a larger economic shift towards a more service-based economy."}

However, [8][1] suggests that focused practice may result in increased utility due to 1. Improved activity experience due to accumulated skill consumption capital) and 2. Improved activity outcome due to cumulative experience(human production capital). The former implies that as the individual becomes more skilled, the activity experience increases, leading to more utility. The latter implies that as the individual gains more experience, the activity outcomes improve, also leading to more utility. [5] states that larger school athletes may spend more time with coaches, increasing the number of focused, directed practice hours an individual obtains in a given season, which can lead to increased utility.\n\nImage1 illustrates the importance of practice in sports. The young person in the image is practicing by stretching and reaching for their foot, which shows that they are actively engaging in practice to improve their skills. This practice makes the game more fun to play because they know what they are doing. Practice makes it more likely that they will win and they like winning. This aligns with [8][1], which suggests that focused practice can lead to increased utility.\n\nImage2 is a thought-provoking image that raises the question of how important focus is when trying to achieve mastery in some area. The image shows a person sitting in front of a blackboard with their hands covering their eyes, suggesting that they are blocking out distractions and focusing their attention on the task at hand. This image highlights the importance of focus in achieving mastery, as it is mentioned in [2] that the power to pursue positive addictions is closely related to the ability to focus.\n\nImage3 shows a child taking a bite of a hot dog with mustard on it. This image is unrelated to the topic of utility change with each additional hot dog consumed.\n\nImage4 and Image5 provide a visual representation of the relationship between the number of hot dogs consumed and the utility derived from each hot dog. The table in Image4 suggests diminishing returns (or utility) with the consumption of additional hot dogs, eventually leading to negative utility. This is consistent with [9], which states that variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences. When enjoyment drops, we should switch to another choice.\n\nThe table in Image5 illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome related to hot dog consumption. As more hot dogs are consumed, utility decreases, and the differential outcome also changes. The image highlights the point where this person ties a competitor for a championship in 2007, suggesting that the optimal number of hot dogs consumed is a critical point where the utility is maximized.\n\nOverall, the utility change with each additional hot dog consumed is a declining function, eventually leading to negative utility. This implies that consumption behavior will lead to a point of diminishing returns, where the additional consumption of hot dogs provides decreasing utility."}

During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, reducing the chromosome number by half. This process is depicted in image1 as the \"Sites of Crossing Over\" and \"Sister Chromatids and Tetrad Formation.\" Unlike meiosis II, sister chromatids do not separate during meiosis I; instead, homologous chromosomes separate. This reduction in chromosome number is crucial for genetic diversity. \n\nIn contrast, meiosis II is characterized by the separation of sister chromatids, which is illustrated in image1 as \"Sister Chromatids and Homologous Chromosomes.\" During meiosis II, the chromosome number remains the same, as the two daughter cells each receive a set of sister chromatids. This stage is also illustrated in image1, showing that \"Sister Chromatids align to form tetrads.\" image2 shows different phases of cell division; however, it does not depict the separation of homologous or sister chromatids, which are key to the processes of meiosis I and II, respectively. Therefore, it cannot be used to answer the question about how the stages of meiosis I and meiosis II differ in terms of chromosome separation and cell division. However, as depicted in image1, another key difference between meiosis I and meiosis II is that the chromosome number is reduced during meiosis I and remains the same during meiosis II.\n\nMeiosis I reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid, whereas meiosis II preserves the chromosome number. This difference in chromosome separation and cell division results in genetically distinct daughter cells. Overall, the key differences between the stages of meiosis I and meiosis II are the separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and the separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II."}

[image3] presents the data on the common challenges faced by healthcare organizations in implementing IT systems during the same period. The most common challenges include a lack of financial support, lack of staffing resources, and difficulty in achieving end-user acceptance.\n\nA trend that is notable is that despite the adoption of healthcare IT systems, the main concerns in healthcare still revolve around IT security and ensuring the safety of patient data. [image1] shows that the most common security concerns include internal breaches of security, inadequate business continuity/disaster recovery, and the unauthorized use of data by third parties. These concerns suggest that while healthcare IT systems have improved, their security and implementation remain a challenge.\n\nThe barriers to implementing IT in healthcare can be attributed to a lack of understanding and a lack of confidence in IT capabilities among healthcare professionals. [image3] shows that physician's lack of confidence and patient's lack of confidence are among the identified barriers.\n\n**Top 10 Most Common Barriers**\n### Image 4 shows the current IT priorities for healthcare and projected priorities in two years.\n\n[4] Current system fragments patient information and creates redundant,inefficient efforts\n\nThe current healthcare IT environment is characterized by fragmented systems that create redundant efforts, leading to inefficiencies.

Each bar represents a year and is labeled with a numerical value to its right, ranging from 5.2 to 16. The years are ordered from most recent (2007) at the top to oldest (1960) at the bottom. The colors of the bars are varied, with no clear pattern to signify what they represent. The numerical values increase over time, indicating growth or an upward trend. Without additional context, it's unclear what the specific data represents.](image1)**\n\n**[2]** Perceptual grouping is at play here, as the years are grouped together based on their numerical values, creating a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This grouping helps us simplify the complex data into a more understandable format.\n\n**[3]** The development of Gestalt Laws of Grouping, such as closure, continuation, and proximity, is crucial in understanding how we perceive and interpret complex data. The image shows a bar chart, which is a prime example of how Gestalt principles are applied in data presentation.\n\n**![The image2 is described as: The image shows an optical illusion design known as the \"impossible trident\" or \"blivet.\" It is a drawing that depicts an object with three cylindrical prongs that seem to emerge from a single bar or base. The middle prong transforms into the side edge of the outer prongs, creating an ambiguous and physically impossible shape. This illusion plays with perspective and challenges the viewer's perception of three-dimensional objects.](image2)**\n\nThe Space Race timeline, which is not directly related to the question, can be seen as an example of how our perception of time and events can be influenced by Gestalt principles. The timeline might use visual cues, such as closure and continuity, to make the events more cohesive and easier to follow.\n\n**![The image3 is described as: The image contains two simple geometric shapes drawn with dashed lines. On the left side, there is a circle, and on the right side, there is a rectangle. Both shapes are outlined with dashed lines instead of solid lines, making them appear as outline representations.](image3)**\n\nIn conclusion, the trend of U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2007 can be understood through the lens of Gestalt psychology, which emphasizes the importance of perception, grouping, and closure in shaping our understanding of the world. The data, presented in a bar chart, is a prime example of how Gestalt principles are applied in data presentation.\n\n**![The image4 is described as: This image depicts the word \"GESTALT\" using various principles of Gestalt psychology, which are concepts related to visual perception and how we tend to view objects as part of a greater whole. Each letter or pair of letters is designed to represent a specific Gestalt principle. Here's a breakdown of the principles shown:](image4)**\n\n**![The image5 is described as: The table appears to contain a pattern of dots arranged in rows and columns. On the left side, there's a 6 x 6 grid of dots, consisting of 36 dots. On the right side, there are five columns with 4 dots in each column, totaling 20 dots.

Reporting is about providing descriptive information about historical data, aiming to answer questions like \"What happened?\" and \"How many?\" [4]. This phase focuses on data processing and outputting information in the form of reports, dashboards, and alerts. \n\n[2] **Impact Focus**\nOn the other hand, analysis focuses on inquiring deeper questions like \"Why is this happening?\" and \"What if these trends continue?\" [4]. It utilizes the insights gained from reporting to explore, analyze, and gain a deeper understanding of the data. This phase lays the groundwork for predictive modeling, optimization, and forecasting, which are critical in driving business decisions and growth.\n\n### [3] Role in the Analytics Value Chain\nThe analytics value chain is designed to push data through a series of stages, from collection and analysis to action and impact [4]. Reporting is an initial stage that serves as a foundation, while analysis elevates the process to a higher level of business intelligence and eventually, business analytics. The progression is as follows: Standard Reports, Ad-Hoc Reports, Query Drilldown (OLAP), Alerts, Statistical Analysis, Forecasting, Predictive Modelling, and Optimisation [3].\n\n[4] The image1 illustrates this process clearly, showing the progression from descriptive reporting to prescriptive analysis. The diagram breaks down the stages into Reporting and Analysis, emphasizing the importance of both phases in the analytics value chain.\n\n[5] **Key to Unlocking Business Value**\nA well-structured analytics value chain is crucial for businesses to unlock maximum value from their data. Strong data leadership that supports the needs of the business enables the analytics organization to perform at its best and maximize its impact [7]. \n\n[6] Factors Contributing to Effective Reporting and Analysis\nThe effectiveness of reporting and analysis depends on several factors, including the competence of analysts, mentorship, and the use of statistical skills and SQL [5]. Democratizing data access through business intelligence tools and tying back to strategic objectives are also critical in driving business success.\n\n### [7] Driving Business Success\nTo drive business success, managers must rely on data insights to make informed decisions, and data and analytics must be deeply embedded into organizational processes and decisions [8]. By understanding the importance of both reporting and analysis, organizations can move towards business analytics, leading to improved decision-making and increased value.\n\n### [8] Business Intelligence to Business Analytics\nBusiness Intelligence focuses on the initial stages of the analytics value chain, including reporting and analysis. However, as the analytics organization progresses, it shifts towards Business Analytics, which includes predictive modeling, optimization, and forecasting. This progression is crucial for unlocking maximum value from data and driving business growth.\n\n### [9] Pathway to Business Analytics\nTo embark on the pathway to Business Analytics, organizations must adopt a structured approach, starting with Business Intelligence. This involves developing a culture that values data-driven decision-making, investing in analytics talent, and embedding data analytics into core business processes.\n\n### [10] Insights from Experts\nAs noted by Ken Rudin, experts emphasize the importance of strong data leadership in supporting the needs of the business and enabling the analytics organization to achieve its full potential [10]."}

According to Gestalt psychology, when objects are proximal to each other, we tend to see them as belonging to a group. Similarly, when objects are similar in shape, color, or other characteristics, we group them together. This principle is evident in the image of the pie charts depicting how time was spent on weekends in the years 2005 and 2010. The pie charts show a clear shift in the proportion of time spent with family and friends from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010.\n\nThis change can be attributed to the principle of closure, where our perception tends to fill in the gaps and create a complete shape. In this case, the decreasing percentage of time spent with family and friends creates a gap, which our perception fills in by reducing the proportion of time spent on other activities. As we can see, the time spent watching films increased from 20% in 2005 to 22% in 2010, while the time spent on hobbies decreased from 2% to 4%.\n\nTo understand the changes in weekend time spent with family and friends, it's essential to consider the principles of continuity and unity.

For on-campus supermarkets, the locations are primarily within or near Tsinghua University campuses, such as the Zijing store, Qingfen store, and Guanchou store. [1] For instance, Tmall campus - Zijing store and Tmall campus - Qingfen store both operate from Monday to Sunday, with their specific hours being 8:30am to 11:30pm. On the other hand, the Guanchou store operates from Monday to Sunday with an earlier closing time at 9:00pm. \n\n![On-campus supermarket locations](image1)\n[1]\n\nIn contrast, off-campus supermarkets operate with varying hours. For example, Lotus Supermarket (易初莲花), located in the Wudaokou area, is open from 9:00am to 9:00pm, as are BHG Supermarket (华联) and Carrefour (家乐福), both situated in the Wudaokou area. [5] These off-campus supermarkets are not located within Tsinghua University campuses but rather in the surrounding area.\n\n![Off-campus supermarket hours](image5)\n[5]\n\nThese differences in operating hours can significantly affect students' shopping schedules. If students need to purchase essential items, they may find it more convenient to visit off-campus supermarkets that operate longer hours, especially in the evenings. On the other hand, on-campus supermarkets might be more appealing for students who prefer to stay within the university area or have limited transportation options. Understanding the operating hours of both on-campus and off-campus supermarkets is essential for students to plan their shopping trips effectively.\n\n![QR code for Tsinghua Campus Bus APP](image4)\n[4] Furthermore, the campus has its own electric powered shuttle bus service, which provides students with an alternative mode of transportation. This can be particularly useful for those who live off-campus and need to access on-campus facilities or shops. However, it is worth noting that the campus prohibits the use of electric vehicle batteries indoors due to safety concerns."}

Two essential components of this mode are the metering modes and focus modes. Understanding how to utilize these settings can significantly enhance one's photography under various scenarios.\n\n### Metering Modes and Their Ideal Use Cases\n\nThe camera offers three primary metering modes: Matrix Metering Mode, Center Metering Mode, and Spot Metering Mode. Each mode functions differently and is suited for distinct photography scenarios.\n\n#### 1. **Matrix Metering Mode**\n*   **Overview**: This mode measures light across the entire frame.\n*   **Ideal for**: Natural landscapes where the lighting is even and uniform.\n*   **Key consideration**: Matrix Metering Mode can struggle in scenes with high contrast or extreme lighting, as it relies on the entire frame for metering.\n\n#### 2. **Center Metering Mode**\n*   **Overview**: This mode focuses on light near the center of the screen.\n*   **Ideal for**: Portraits where the subject is the main focus.\n*   **Key consideration**: Center Metering Mode is less effective in scenes with multiple light sources or high contrast, as it prioritizes the center of the frame.\n\n#### 3. **Spot Metering Mode**\n*   **Overview**: This mode focuses on light from a specific region.\n*   **Ideal for**: Specific focus areas, such as a subject's eyes, or when shooting in high-contrast scenes.\n*   **Key consideration**: Spot Metering Mode is useful when the light is unevenly distributed in the scene.\n\n### Focus Modes and Their Ideal Use Cases\n\nPro Mode also offers various focus modes, including AF-S (single), AF-C (continuous), and MF (manual). Understanding when to use each mode can greatly improve your photography.\n\n#### 1. **AF-S (Single)**\n*   **Usage scenario**: Stationary subjects where a sharp focus is required.\n*   **Key consideration**: AF-S is ideal for stationary subjects, but may not be suitable for fast-moving subjects.\n\n#### 2. **AF-C (Continuous)**\n*   **Usage scenario**: Moving subjects where continuous focusing is necessary.\n*   **Key consideration**: AF-C is essential for capturing moving subjects, but may result in a softer focus if not used carefully.\n\n#### 3. **MF (Manual)**\n*   **Usage scenario**: Touch the subject of interest to focus in on them, such as the subject's face.\n*   **Key consideration**: MF allows for precise control over focus, making it ideal for portraits and other situations where a sharp focus is crucial.\n\n### Enhancing Photography with Pro Mode\n\nBy mastering the different metering modes and focus modes in Pro Mode, photographers can:\n\n*   Capture stunning natural landscapes with Matrix Metering Mode\n*   Portraits with sharp focus and pleasing lighting using Center Metering Mode\n*   Creative portraits with precise control over focus using MF\n*   Freeze fast-moving subjects with AF-C\n*   Add depth and interest to images with manual focus adjustments\n\nUltimately, the choice of metering mode and focus mode depends on the specific scene and the photographer's creative vision."}
