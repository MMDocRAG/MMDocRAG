The lack of black and Hispanic role models is also cited by 32% of STEM workers, compared to 27% in non-STEM jobs [1]. Discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions is another critical factor, with 34% of STEM workers attributing underrepresentation to a lack of belief in their ability to succeed, and 32% each to the lack of role models and racial/ethnic discrimination [4]. Many Americans believe limited access to quality education is a major reason for the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics, with 42% of the general population and 73% of black STEM workers holding this view [6].

According to text quote [3], both Clinton and Trump voters give Trump relatively better or worse ratings on the same issues, with confidence in Trump being weaker on foreign policy among both his supporters and Clinton’s supporters. Specifically, text quote [7] highlights that only about half (47%) of Trump voters express a great deal of confidence in him on foreign policy, while image1 shows that among Clinton voters, only 6% have a great deal of confidence, with 63% expressing no confidence at all. This stark contrast is further emphasized by image5, which visually represents the disparity in confidence levels between the two groups.\n\nRegarding expectations for race relations, text quote [1] indicates that half of Trump voters (50%) expect race relations to get better, while just 9% think they will get worse.

This sentiment was particularly strong among Clinton voters, with 84% expecting race relations to worsen [1]. In contrast, Trump voters were more optimistic, with half expecting improvement and 38% seeing no difference [5]. This division is reflected in the partisan differences in expectations for partisan relations, where Trump voters were more optimistic about improvements compared to Clinton voters [6][8][9].\n\nThe perceived implications of having enthusiastic supporters for a president are illustrated by the willingness to give Trump a chance. Among all voters, 59% were willing to give Trump a chance, but this varied significantly by vote choice: 83% of Trump voters were willing, while only 35% of Clinton voters were [image1]. This willingness to give Trump a chance was higher among Clinton voters who were willing to give him a chance (46%) compared to those who were not (20%) [image1].\n\nComparing expectations for race relations and partisan relations, voters in 2016 were more skeptical about improvements in race relations than in partisan relations.

According to text [7], [8], and [9], a record 92% of voters felt there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared to past elections, reflecting a widespread perception of increased negativity. This sentiment is visually supported by image1, which shows a steep rise in the percentage of voters who perceived more mudslinging in 2016 compared to previous years.\n\nThis heightened negativity is further reflected in voter evaluations of political entities. Text [4], [5], and [6] indicate that voters gave low grades to the Republican and Democratic parties, with only 22% and 26% respectively awarding an A or B, and a high percentage (30% for the Republican Party and 28% for the Democratic Party) giving them failing grades. The press and pollsters also received poor ratings, with only 22% and 21% respectively receiving A or B grades, as shown in text [3] and image4. This dissatisfaction with political entities is likely a direct result of the perceived negativity in the campaign, as voters may have associated the parties and media with the negative tone of the election.\n\nAdditionally, text [1] and [6] highlight the emotional divide among voters, with Trump supporters feeling hopeful and proud, while Clinton supporters felt uneasy, sad, and scared. This emotional divide is visually represented in image3, showing the stark contrast in feelings between the two groups.

According to text [1], public concerns that anti-terrorism policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties have dropped to 28%, while 56% now believe these policies do not go far enough to protect the country. This trend is further highlighted in text [2], which notes a dramatic decline in concerns over government restrictions on civil liberties since Edward Snowden's NSA surveillance revelations in July 2013, where 47% were concerned about overreach compared to 35% who felt policies did not go far enough. Text [5] confirms that by a two-to-one margin, Americans are more concerned that anti-terrorism policies do not adequately protect the country.\n\nThe shift in opinion is particularly pronounced among Republicans, as stated in text [4], with 71% now saying policies do not go far enough, up from 38% in July 2013. Democrats have also shifted, with 54% now expressing similar concerns, up from 38% in 2013. Text [7] indicates that conservative Republicans, moderate and liberal Republicans, and conservative and moderate Democrats are more concerned about insufficient protection, while liberal Democrats are split between concerns about overreach and insufficient protection.\n\nImage2 illustrates these trends over time, showing a rise in the belief that policies do not go far enough to protect the country, peaking at 58% in 2014, and a decline in concerns about overreach.

By December 2015, these numbers had flipped, with 66% expressing confidence in success and only 27% in failure [9]. This indicates a significant increase in optimism about the campaign's outcome.\n\nHowever, current ratings of how well the campaign is going remain negative, with 58% saying it is not going too well or not at all well, and only 35% saying it is going very or fairly well [4]. This suggests that while there is growing confidence in the campaign's eventual success, the immediate effectiveness is still viewed skeptically.\n\nThere are also wide partisan divides in these perceptions. Democrats are more likely to view the campaign as going at least fairly well (45%) compared to Republicans (26%) and independents (33%) [2]. Despite these differences, there is a consensus across political affiliations that the campaign will ultimately be successful, with 65% of Republicans, 72% of Democrats, and 62% of independents agreeing [2].\n\nConcerns about the campaign vary by political affiliation as well. Republicans are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the militants (75%), while Democrats are more concerned about over-involvement (81%) [5][10]. This reflects differing priorities and levels of engagement with the issue among political groups.\n\nOverall, while there is a growing belief in the campaign's success, the current state of the effort is still seen negatively, and political divisions persist in both the assessment of the campaign's progress and the nature of the concerns surrounding it.\n\n![Public perception of the U.S. military campaign against ISIS evolving from July 2015 to December 2015](image5)\n\n![Partisan differences in concerns about the U.S. military campaign against ISIS](image3)\n\n![Current ratings of the U.S. military campaign against ISIS](image4)\n\n![Approval ratings for the U.S. military campaign against ISIS over time](image2)"}

Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, there has been a decline in this view among both Republicans and Democrats over time. According to text quote [3], the share of Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019.

At that time, fully 47% wanted to cooperate less with America. [3] For Germans of differing political stripes, the differences are less dramatic. Supporters of the CDU/CSU, as well as those who support the SPD and Greens, name France as the first or second-most important partner, followed by the U.S. [4] In the U.S., political affiliation dictates who people think is the most important foreign policy partner. While both Republicans and Democrats agree that the UK is their most important partner, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are keener on Israel as a partner (26%) than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (9%). Democrats also place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico for their top foreign policy affiliate.

Republicans are significantly more likely to say the U.S. should get tougher on China on economic issues (instead of trying to strengthen economic relations), to describe China as an enemy of the U.S. – rather than as competitor or partner – and to have very cold feelings toward China. They are also more likely to support limiting the ability of Chinese students to study in the U.S.\n\n[3] Among Americans ages 50 and older, roughly seven-in-ten are in favor of limiting Chinese students. Those ages 30 to 49 are evenly split between support and opposition, while nearly two-thirds of Americans 18 to 29 oppose the idea. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to favor limitations on the number of Chinese students attending U.S. college or universities.\n\n[4] Negative ratings for Xi are high across demographic and partisan groups, though there are a few modest differences. Men are somewhat more likely than women to distrust Xi, with half of American men saying they have no confidence at all in Xi. Half of White adults likewise say they have no confidence at all in Xi. In comparison, 31% of Hispanic adults and 29% of Black adults hold the same opinion.\n\n[6] Yet, while the U.S. public generally welcomes international students, people are more divided when it comes specifically to Chinese students. A majority of Americans (55%) support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S., including about one-in-five Americans who strongly support this idea. On the other hand, 43% oppose limitations on Chinese students, with 18% strongly opposed.\n\n[7] Majority of Americans support limits on Chinese students in U.S. universities.\n\n[8] At least half of White, Black and Hispanic Americans would at least somewhat support limits on Chinese students in the U.S. Among those who have obtained a college degree, more oppose than support restricting the number of Chinese students at American institutions. A majority of those without a college degree are in favor.\n\n[10] Across age groups, older Americans are more likely to have no confidence in the Chinese president. While 53% of those 65 and older say they have no confidence at all in Xi, only 35% of those 18 to 29 say the same.\n\n![Republicans and conservatives are more likely to support limiting Chinese students than Democrats and liberals](image"}

According to [5], negative feelings toward China have grown among both Republicans and Democrats, but the partisan gap has widened. Image2 illustrates this trend, showing that the percentage of Americans who feel \"cold\" toward China rose from 46% in 2018 to 67% in 2021, with Republicans leading at 79%. Additionally, the share of Americans prioritizing limiting China's power and influence increased from 32% in 2018 to 63% in 2021, particularly among Republicans.\n\nMajor concerns driving these perceptions include human rights issues, as highlighted in [1] and [6], with half of Americans now viewing China's human rights policies as a serious problem, up 7 percentage points since 2020. Image3 shows that \"human rights\" is the most cited concern, with 20% of respondents mentioning it, followed by economic issues like \"Made in China\" manufacturing at 19%. Political system concerns, such as dictatorship and communism, also contribute, with 17% of respondents citing these.\n\nDespite these concerns, there is a significant portion of Americans who support prioritizing economic relations with China, even if it means not addressing human rights issues, as shown in image1, where 70% support promoting human rights even if it harms economic relations, while 26% prioritize economic relations over human rights. Image4 and image5 further indicate that a majority support (55%) and oppose (43%) certain policies, reflecting a complex mix of economic and human rights considerations in American views of China.\n\nIn summary, American perceptions of China have become more negative from 2018 to 2021, driven by growing concerns over human rights and economic issues, with a pronounced partisan divide."}

According to [9], four problems stand out as very serious: cyber attacks, job losses to China, China’s growing military power, and China’s policies on human rights. These concerns have grown over the past year, as shown in image1, where the percentage of Americans viewing these issues as serious has increased. For example, concerns about cyberattacks from China rose from 58% in 2020 to 65% in 2021, a +7% change.\n\nThe economic relationship between the U.S. and China is also a significant concern, with [1] noting that two-thirds of Americans describe economic relations as somewhat or very bad. This is reflected in image1, where the U.S. trade deficit with China increased from 42% to 43% in 2021, a +1% change. Additionally, image2 shows that only 53% of Americans have confidence in Biden to deal effectively with China, compared to 60% confidence in his ability to handle world affairs in general, indicating a specific lack of trust in his China policy.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing these concerns, image3 reveals a preference for promoting human rights over strengthening economic ties, with 70% of Americans favoring human rights even if it harms economic relations, compared to 26% prioritizing economic relations. This aligns with [10], which states that half of Americans now see China’s policy on human rights as a very serious problem.\n\nThe perception of China has also become more negative over time, as seen in image4. The most common negative adjectives used to describe China are \"human rights\" (20%) and \"economy\" (19%), with \"COVID-19\" and \"population size\" also notable. Conversely, positive adjectives like \"pollution\" and \"people\" are much less common.\n\nPartisan differences are evident in image5, where Republicans are more likely to view limiting China’s power as a top priority and to feel \"cold\" toward China.

According to the text, Hispanics with a positive view of their current financial situation are more likely to expect their family's finances to improve over the next 12 months [3]. This optimism extends to their children's financial futures, with 72% of Hispanic adults expecting their children to be better off financially than themselves [6]. However, views differ by educational attainment. Among those with at least some college experience, 69% expect their children to be better off, while 71% of those with less than a high school education share the same expectation. Interestingly, high school graduates are more optimistic, with 79% predicting their children will be better off [5].\n\nThe image5 illustrates these differences in expectations by educational level. It shows that 79% of Hispanics with less than a high school education expect their children to be better off, compared to 69% of those with some college experience or more. This aligns with the text, highlighting that educational attainment impacts financial optimism for future generations.\n\nAdditionally, the image5 reveals that older Hispanics are more pessimistic about their children's financial futures. Among those aged 65 and older, only 52% expect their children to be better off, compared to 75% of those aged 18-29 and 76% of those aged 30-49 [9]. This age-related difference underscores the varying levels of optimism across generations.\n\nThe image1 provides a broader context, showing that Hispanic optimism about financial improvement has been increasing over time, surpassing the general public's expectations. From 2004 to 2015, Hispanic expectations rose from 76% to 81%, while the general public's expectations decreased from 70% to 61%. This trend supports the text's assertion that Hispanics are generally more optimistic about their financial futures and those of their children [4].\n\nIn summary, current financial situations and educational levels play a crucial role in shaping Hispanics' expectations for their children's financial futures.

The Hispanic poverty rate was 23.6% in 2014, below the 2010 peak of 26.5% but still above pre-recession levels. Net worth declined significantly for Hispanic households, unlike white households, continuing to fall after the recession.

[2] and [7] indicate that the share of Latinos expecting their finances to improve increased from 67% in 2011 to 81% in 2015, a 14-point rise.

According to the data, the Hispanic unemployment rate has been consistently higher than that of non-Hispanics, even though both groups have seen improvements since the Great Recession. The unemployment rate for Hispanics peaked at 12.8% in 2010 and has since declined to 6.4% in 2015, but it remains above its pre-recession low of 5% in 2006 and is still higher than the non-Hispanic rate of 4.8% in the same period [6][5]. This persistent higher unemployment rate among Hispanics contributes to their economic challenges.\n\nEconomic perceptions also differ, with Hispanics being more optimistic about the current and future economic conditions compared to the general public. In 2015, 35% of Hispanics believed economic conditions were good or excellent, and 34% expected them to improve in the coming year, which is higher than the 25% and 17% respectively for non-Hispanics [9]. This optimism contrasts with the reality of stagnant median household income and higher poverty rates among Hispanics. The median household income for Hispanics was $42,491 in 2014, unchanged since the Great Recession, while the poverty rate was 23.6%, still above pre-recession levels [3]. These economic conditions have led to a larger percentage decline in net worth for Hispanic households compared to other groups, with their net worth continuing to fall after the recession [3].\n\nDespite these challenges, there is a sense of upward mobility among Hispanic adults, with 72% expecting their children to be better off financially than themselves [5]. This optimism is reflected in the data showing that Latinos with some college experience or U.S.-born Latinos are more likely to rate their personal financial situation positively [4]. However, those with less education or who are immigrants have lower financial ratings [4].\n\nThe data from the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, conducted by Pew Research Center, supports these findings, showing that while Hispanics are more likely to support economic policies like increasing the minimum wage, their economic realities, including higher unemployment and lower household income, highlight ongoing disparities [1][2][3][4][6][7][8][9].\n\n![Hispanic unemployment rate remains higher than non-Hispanic](image5)\n\n![His"}

This widespread skepticism, despite some believing in their effectiveness, underscores the public's cautious approach to these systems.\n\nThe automated scoring of people up for parole is viewed as fair by 50%, aligning closely with its effectiveness rating of 49% [image3], suggesting a more balanced perception. In contrast, the automated video job interview analysis and personal finance score systems show smaller effectiveness-fairness gaps, indicating that while concerns about fairness persist, they are somewhat mitigated by perceived effectiveness.\n\nThese differences imply that public trust in automated systems is context-dependent, with fairness concerns being a critical factor. The criminal risk score, despite its controversial nature, is seen as fairer, possibly due to its perceived role in justice.

Public health officials, such as those at the CDC, receive a net rating of 63% excellent or good, while Donald Trump receives a net rating of only 37% [4]. This disparity is particularly pronounced among Republicans, with a significant drop in their positive ratings for CDC officials from 84% in March to 53% [3]. In contrast, Democrats maintain a high positive rating for public health officials at 72% [3].\n\nThe survey also highlights that the public attributes the continued outbreak to several factors. The most significant factor is that not enough people are adhering to social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, with 75% considering it a major reason [8]. Additionally, 58% believe that restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places, and 53% cite an inadequate response from the federal government as major reasons [8]. These perceptions are further divided along partisan lines, with Democrats more likely to blame the federal government's response and lifting restrictions too quickly [9].\n\nWhen it comes to responsibility for COVID-19 policies, the public is divided, with 48% attributing it to the federal government and 51% to state and local governments [10].

According to the text quotes, a substantial share of Latinos, including immigrants, Spanish speakers, Catholics, and evangelicals, believe that Democrats work hard to earn their votes [2]. However, only about one-in-five Latinos think Republicans work hard to earn their votes [3]. Among Latino Republicans, 40% believe Republicans work hard to earn their votes, compared to only 13% of Latino Democrats [3]. This suggests that while Democrats are perceived as more actively seeking Latino support, Republicans have a smaller, more divided perception of their efforts [7].\n\nThe image quotes provide further insights. Image1 shows that a higher percentage of Democrats (36%) than Republicans (19%) believe that Democrats work hard to earn Latino votes, with significant differences among groups like foreign-born Latinos (44% Democrats vs. 23% Republicans) and Spanish-dominant Latinos (48% Democrats vs. 24% Republicans) [1].

According to the text quotes, Black STEM employees are particularly likely to report experiencing discrimination at work, with 62% of Black individuals in STEM jobs saying they have faced such issues compared to 44% of Asians and 42% of Hispanics [3][5][7]. This is significantly higher than the 13% of Whites in STEM jobs who report similar experiences [5]. The image5 illustrates this disparity, showing that 62% of Black individuals and 42% of Hispanics report discrimination, compared to 44% of Asians and only 13% of Whites.\n\nGender-based discrimination is also prevalent, with women in STEM jobs more likely than men to report experiencing workplace discrimination due to their gender. Half (50%) of women in STEM jobs say they have experienced discrimination, compared to 41% of women in non-STEM jobs and just 19% of men in STEM jobs [6]. Image1 highlights this, showing that 50% of women in STEM jobs have experienced gender-related discrimination, compared to 19% of men. Women in computer jobs face even higher rates, with 74% reporting gender discrimination, as seen in image3, which is 58 percentage points higher than men in computer jobs.\n\nThe types of discrimination women face include earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent (29%), experiencing repeated, small slights (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders (18%) [6]. Image1 further supports this, showing that 44% of women in STEM jobs feel their gender has made it harder to succeed, compared to 48% of men. Women in computer jobs report even higher rates of these issues, with 74% experiencing gender discrimination, as depicted in image3.\n\nIn terms of job clusters, discrimination varies. Image4 shows that sales engineers have a 7% average discrimination rate, while speech language pathologists have a 96% rate, indicating significant variation across STEM fields.

According to [1], most women in STEM jobs in majority-male workplaces experience gender discrimination. This is supported by image1, which shows that 78% of women in STEM jobs in mostly male workplaces have experienced gender discrimination at work, compared to 44% in other settings. Additionally, these women are more likely to feel that their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job, with 48% reporting this compared to only 12% in majority-female workplaces [8].\n\n[2] and [3] highlight that women in STEM working in male-dominated environments perceive more gender inequities. They often feel they need to prove themselves to be respected by coworkers, and they are more likely to see behaviors like working harder and being assertive as necessary to advance in their careers. This is further illustrated in image4, where women in male-dominated workplaces are 48% more likely to feel the need to prove themselves at work, compared to 52% in more balanced settings.\n\n[6] and [8] emphasize that women in male-dominated STEM workplaces are significantly more likely to experience various forms of gender discrimination, including earning less than a man doing the same job, being treated as incompetent, and receiving less support from senior leaders. Image1 confirms this, showing that 78% of women in these environments have experienced discrimination, compared to 43% in other settings.\n\n[9] notes that women in STEM jobs overall are more likely than men to experience workplace discrimination due to gender, with 50% reporting such experiences. However, this rate is even higher for women in male-dominated workplaces, as depicted in image1, where 78% report discrimination, compared to 41% of women in non-STEM jobs and 19% of men in STEM jobs [10].\n\nIn contrast, image4 shows that women in more balanced workplaces are less likely to experience discrimination and feel the need to prove themselves.

According to the text quotes, the share of U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents and immigrant grandparents who self-identify as Hispanic decreases to 77% by the third generation, and further to 50% by the fourth or higher generation [1]. This trend is also reflected in the image1, which shows that 65% of foreign-born Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, while this percentage increases to 36% for the second generation and 26% for the third or higher generation. This indicates that as generations progress, the sense of being a typical American grows, potentially leading to a decrease in self-identification as Hispanic.\n\nAnother factor is the importance of speaking Spanish and having a Spanish last name. The text quotes indicate that speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, with 84% of second-generation Latinos and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos holding this view [6]. Similarly, having a Spanish last name is not seen as crucial for Hispanic identity, with 84% of self-identified Hispanics stating it is not necessary [4].

The reasons include mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and few Hispanic cultural links, as shown in image2. For example, 27% do not consider themselves Hispanic due to a mixed background or distant Hispanic ancestry, 16% due to upbringing or lack of contact with relatives, 15% due to not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link, 12% due to identifying as another race, and 9% because they were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American.\n\nLastly, the text quotes highlight that racial and ethnic identity"}

Eight-in-ten immigrants (82%) say they feel very or somewhat connected with their country of origin, while this drops to 69% for second-generation Hispanics and further to 44% for third or higher generations [7]. This trend is visually represented in image4, which shows a clear decrease in the percentage of self-identified Hispanics feeling very or somewhat connected to their family's country of origin as generations progress.\n\n[2] The perceived impact of Hispanic heritage on life also varies by generation. Hispanic heritage has had the greatest impact on the lives of second-generation Hispanics, with half (52%) saying their Hispanic background has been an advantage in their lives [8]. This advantage perception is less pronounced among immigrant Hispanics (28%) and third or higher generation Hispanics (24%). Image5 illustrates this, showing a peak in perceived advantage among second-generation Hispanics, which diminishes in subsequent generations.\n\n[3] Additionally, the use of Spanish as a dominant language decreases across generations. Among self-identified Hispanics, 36% are Spanish dominant, but this drops to 24% for third or higher generations, as shown in image1. This decline in language use is linked to a reduced connection to the home country.\n\n[4] Experiences with discrimination related to being Hispanic are less frequent among higher generations. While 39% of self-identified Hispanics say they have felt discriminated against, this is less common among non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, where only 7% report discrimination [1][2]. Image2 supports this, showing that self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry rarely (5%) or never (87%) experience discrimination.\n\n[5] Despite the decline in Spanish use, there is widespread support for its use in the future. 88% of self-identified Hispanics believe it is important for future generations to speak Spanish [9]. This underscores a cultural preservation sentiment despite generational shifts.\n\nIn summary, connections to Hispanic heritage and perceived advantages are strongest among second-generation Hispanics, with both declining in subsequent generations. Language use and discrimination experiences also reflect these generational differences, highlighting a complex interplay of cultural identity and generational assimilation."}

This encoding captures the meaning of the user's utterance.\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The encoded user utterance, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state [4][7]. This state helps track the user's goals and the conversation context.\n\n3. **Knowledge Base Query**: Based on the dialogue state, the system generates a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot. This information is used to formulate a query command to a knowledge base (KB) to retrieve relevant information [4][5].\n\n4. **Policy Network**: The policy network uses the dialogue-level LSTM state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results to determine the next system action [1][9]. This action is a dialogue act that guides the system's response.\n\n5. **Natural Language Generation**: The final system response is generated using a template-based natural language generator (NLG). The NLG template is delexicalized, with placeholders replaced by values from the estimated user goal or KB entities, depending on the system action [6].\n\nThe process is end-to-end differentiable, allowing all components to be trained together, optimizing the entire system's performance [8].\n\n![System generates a response by encoding user input, tracking dialogue state, querying a knowledge base, determining the next action via a policy network, and generating a natural language response.](image2)\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, tracking the dialogue state, querying a knowledge base, determining the next action using a policy network, and generating a natural language response through a template-based NLG."}

This is in contrast to other datasets like Many Modal QA, MIMOQA, and WebQA, which either focus on answer modality choice, lack fine-grained entities, or have more general questions and answers. [2] The SnapNTell benchmark is designed to evaluate models' abilities in accurately identifying entities and generating detailed, entity-specific knowledge. [3] The dataset creation methodology involves selecting a diverse set of entity names from 22 categories, including landmark, painting, sculpture, food, fruit, vegetable, mammal, amphibian, insect, fish, bird, reptile, celebrity, instrument, plant, electronics, tool, transportation, sport, book, household, and car. This diversity is highlighted in image1, which shows the number of entities across these categories, totaling 7,568 unique entities. [4] SnapNTell's dataset features a diverse range of fine-grained entities, each accompanied by images and explicitly named in the answers, and knowledge-intensive QA pairs. [5] Compared to ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, SnapNTell surpasses in variety of categories, number of distinct entities, and QA pairs, with 10 images per entity and longer average answer lengths.

The results show that ProgramFC using FLAN-T5-small (80M parameters) achieves comparable performance to the much larger FLAN-T5-XXL (11B) model with end-to-end reasoning for 4-hop claims. This suggests that ProgramFC's structured approach mitigates the need for larger model sizes, which is crucial for complex reasoning tasks.\n\n[9] highlights that while chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on HOVER 2-hop and FEVEROUS, it underperforms on HOVER 3-hop and 4-hop compared to ProgramFC. This indicates that ProgramFC's step-by-step reasoning is more effective for complex claims.\n\n[10] notes that ProgramFC's performance drop from 2-hop to 4-hop claims is smaller (11.7%) compared to DeBERTaV3-NLI's drop (21.7%), showing its robustness across increasing complexity.\n\n### Retrieval Recall Differences\n\n[4] and [6] discuss the retrieval performance of ProgramFC versus one-step retrieval. ProgramFC uses an iterative step-by-step BM25 retriever, which outperforms the one-step retriever on all datasets, with the largest improvement of 37.1% on HOVER 4-hop. This is because iterative retrieval guided by the reasoning program can uncover information not present in the original claim.\n\n### Image Analysis\n\n- **image3** shows the F1 scores for ProgramFC and FLAN-T5 across different model sizes and task complexities. The graphs indicate that ProgramFC maintains higher F1 scores, especially for smaller models, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.\n- **image2** compares retrieval recall between one-step and ProgramFC. ProgramFC consistently outperforms one-step retrieval, with significant improvements on HOVER 4-hop, supporting the text's claim about iterative retrieval benefits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5, especially in complex tasks, by leveraging structured reasoning programs that reduce the need for large model sizes and improve retrieval recall through iterative evidence gathering.

This hypothesis leads to three practical applications: anchor re-weighting to improve ICL accuracy, demonstration compression to accelerate ICL inference, and an analysis framework to diagnose ICL errors.\n\n[4] explains that the correlation between the model output and attention distributions on label words is determined by the similarity of key vectors. This similarity can lead to potential label confusion, and the distances between these vectors can correspond to the category confusion of the model.\n\n[5] notes that the acceleration effect is more pronounced in the GPT-J model compared to GPT2-XL, indicating its potential for larger language models.\n\n[6] describes the experimental settings, including the choice of models and datasets. The GPT2-XL model is chosen due to its moderate size and decent ICL performance. Datasets used include SST-2, TREC, AGNews, and EmoC.\n\n[7] specifies the use of GPT2-XL and TREC dataset for analysis due to varying confusion levels between categories.\n\n[9] states that the proposed approximation metric can identify the most confusing cases and performs well for highly confusing categories, indicating that ICL errors occur in categories with similar label anchors.\n\n### Image Analysis\n\n- **image1** shows a table comparing the performance of different methods (Vanilla In-Context Learning and Anchor Re-weighting) across datasets (SST-2, TREC, AGNews, EmoC).

Experimental results show that DSC consistently achieves the highest F1 score across all datasets, especially on imbalanced datasets. This is evident in the results for the paraphrase identification task on MRPC and QQP datasets, where BERT+DSC outperforms other variants [5].\n\n![BERT+DSC consistently achieves the highest F1 score across MRPC and QQP datasets](image5)\n\n[2] For the SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0 datasets, BERT+DSC significantly outperforms XLNet in terms of F1 score.

It is noted that systems perform better on stereotypical roles (e.g., female nurse) and worse on anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., male receptionist).\n- **[8]** mentions that adding stereotypical adjectives like \"handsome\" and \"pretty\" to sentences can improve translation accuracy in some languages, such as Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, as shown in **Table 4**.\n- **[7]** and **[9]** highlight that languages with grammatical gender (e.g., Spanish, French) can be biased in translation, and **[9]** provides an example where a biased translation changes the gender of a doctor from female to male.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image1** shows a bar chart comparing translation accuracy on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across languages.

This adjustment helps align the translation with societal gender stereotypes, reducing the impact of anti-stereotypical biases (image1, image3). However, this method is not universally effective and requires careful implementation to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.\n\n![Stereotype-based adjustments improve gender bias accuracy by increasing translation accuracy on stereotypical roles across languages.](image1)\n\n![Adding stereotypical adjectives significantly improves accuracy in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian."}

The peak performance reduces to 53%, with mean and median at 50%, indicating that the adversarial setup eliminates spurious statistical cues, leading to random accuracy.\n\n[2] and [3] explain that the adversarial examples are created by negating claims and inverting labels, which mirrors the distribution of cues around both labels, thus eliminating the problem of statistical cues over labels.

The human evaluation shows a statistically significant relative performance increase of 18% over the top baseline [1]. The image1 table provides detailed results for different decoding methods, showing that greedy decoding achieves the highest average performance (77.53%) compared to other methods like beam search and random sampling. This indicates that greedy decoding closely approaches human performance, with an average score of 86.18% for human validation of gold ATOMIC [7]. This suggests that greedy decoding is the most effective method for generating high-quality commonsense inferences.\n\n### Impact of Training Data Variations\n\nThe text mentions that COMET can produce coherent and novel generations even with only 10% of the training data, but using only 1% diminishes quality [8]. Image3 shows that with 10% training data, COMET achieves a BLEU-2 score of 9.54 and a novelty metric (N/U o) of 58.34, which are significantly better than the 1% training data results (BLEU-2: 5.08, N/U o: 49.36). This demonstrates that a moderate amount of training data is crucial for maintaining high performance and novelty in generated knowledge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe performance of COMET decoding methods, particularly greedy decoding, closely matches human validation, indicating its effectiveness in generating high-quality commonsense inferences. Additionally, having a sufficient amount of training data (10%) is essential for maintaining strong performance metrics, as shown by the improved BLEU-2 and novelty scores compared to minimal training data scenarios.\n\n![Greedy decoding approaches human performance closely](image1)\n![10% training data maintains high performance](image3)\n\nIn summary, greedy decoding is the most effective method for generating commonsense inferences, closely matching human validation, and a moderate amount of training data is crucial for maintaining high performance metrics."}

COMET achieves the lowest perplexity (PPL) score of 4.32, indicating high confidence in its predictions. It also has a high classifier score of 95.25%, suggesting that the generated tuples are correct according to the classifier. The novelty metrics N/T sro and N/T o are 59.25% and 3.75%, respectively, showing that COMET generates a significant number of novel tuples. The human evaluation score of 91.69% further confirms the high quality of COMET's generated knowledge.\n\nThe graph in image2 shows that as the edit distance increases, the percentage of novel tuples decreases, while classifier accuracy remains high. This implies that COMET can generate novel knowledge that is still accurate, even when the generated tuples are significantly different from the training data.\n\nThe detailed comparison in image4 shows that COMET outperforms other models across various relation types, with the highest scores in categories like xWant and xReact, indicating its effectiveness in generating diverse and accurate knowledge.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCOMET demonstrates superior performance on the ConceptNet dataset compared to other models, with low perplexity, high classifier scores, and significant novelty in generated tuples.

For the en-fi language pair, metrics like `YiSi-0`, `YiSi-1`, and `YiSi-1_srl` have high correlations (0.989, 0.982, and 0.985 respectively), indicating strong alignment with human assessments. For en-kk, `YiSi-0` and `YiSi-1` also show high correlations (0.991 and 0.989), suggesting robust performance [1][5][10].\n\n- **Image3** and **Image5** display heatmaps of metric correlations across language pairs. The en-fi and en-kk pairs show a clear diagonal pattern, indicating that most metrics correlate well with each other and with human assessments. Metrics like `YiSi-1`, `BEER`, and `chrF+` are consistently highlighted, showing strong performance across these pairs [3][4][7][8].\n\n- **Image2** illustrates the conversion of DA scores into better/worse judgments, which is crucial for evaluating metric performance. The concordance between human judgments and metric outputs is visually represented, with `Conc` and `Disc` indicating agreement and disagreement, respectively. This helps in understanding how well metrics align with human assessments [2].\n\nIn summary, for the en-fi and en-kk language pairs, metrics such as `YiSi-0`, `YiSi-1`, and `BEER` show high correlation with human assessments, as evidenced by their bolded values in the tables and consistent diagonal patterns in the heatmaps."}

In 2020, the company's capital expenditures decreased to $21.4 billion from $31.148 billion in 2019, as shown in image1 and image3. This reduction was part of a strategic effort to manage costs in response to lower global demand and prices for oil and natural gas, as indicated by the decline in average realizations from $56.32 per barrel in 2019 to $35.41 in 2020, as seen in image2. The decrease in capital spending was also influenced by the company's focus on reducing debt, which increased to $68 billion by the end of 2020, as noted in [4].\n\nThe financial implications of these changes were notable. ExxonMobil's income tax expense turned into a benefit of $5.6 billion in 2020, compared to a $5.3 billion expense in 2019, due to asset impairments, as detailed in [10] and image4. The effective income tax rate dropped to 17% in 2020 from 34% in 2019, reflecting a shift in the mix of results across different tax jurisdictions.

This reduction contributed positively to the non-GAAP measure.\n- **Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges**: These charges were $255 million in 2020, compared to $55 million in 2019. The increase in these charges negatively impacted the non-GAAP measure.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe APAC segment's reported GAAP measure decreased by 22% from 2019 to 2020, while the core non-GAAP measure decreased by 5%. The reduction in restructuring and impairment charges positively affected the non-GAAP measure, but the increase in inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges had a negative impact.\n\n![Impact of restructuring and impairment charges and inventory fair value adjustments on APAC's core non-GAAP measure](image3)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe APAC segment's reported GAAP measure decreased by 22% in 2020, while the core non-GAAP measure decreased by 5%, primarily due to increased inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges, partially offset by reduced restructuring and impairment charges."}

The acquisition required significant capital outlay, which increased investing cash outflows, while the financing needed for the acquisition boosted financing inflows.\n2. **Capital Expenditures**: Investments in intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment for capacity expansions, as mentioned in text quote [2], also contributed to the increase in investing cash outflows.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSiemens Healthineers' cash flows from financing activities increased significantly in 2021 due to financing the acquisition of Varian, while cash outflows from investing activities increased due to the acquisition and capital expenditures. The key factors driving these changes were the acquisition of Varian and investments in capacity expansions.\n\n![Siemens Health"}

In 2020, changes in financial assumptions contributed to actuarial gains of €72 million. However, in 2021, these changes led to actuarial losses of €26 million. This shift from gains to losses suggests that the financial assumptions used in 2021 were less favorable compared to those in 2020, likely due to changes in discount rates or other financial metrics. The discount rate, a critical assumption, increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021, as shown in **image3**. This increase in the discount rate would typically reduce the present value of future liabilities, but the overall impact was negative, indicating other factors such as lower returns on plan assets or higher benefit payments may have played a role.\n\n![Changes in financial assumptions led to actuarial losses of €26 million in 2021 compared to gains of €72 million in 2020](image5)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe changes in financial assumptions, particularly the increase in the discount rate, contributed to actuarial losses of €26 million in 2021"}

This reduction indicates a lower expected return on assets in 2020 compared to 2019. The actual return on plan assets is not explicitly provided in the text or images, but the change in the expected return can be inferred from the net periodic benefit costs and the total plan assets.\n\nThe total plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit increased from $960 million in 2019 to $987 million in 2020, as seen in **image4**. This increase suggests that despite the lower expected return on assets, the overall value of the plan assets grew, possibly due to contributions or other factors not directly related to the return on assets.\n\n### Quote Citation\n\n- The expected return on plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit in 2019 and 2020 is shown in **image1**:\n  - ![Expected return on plan assets decreased from $9 million in 2019 to $7 million in 2020](image1)\n- The total plan assets for the U.S. Defined Benefit in 2019 and 20"}

This significant increase can be attributed to the growth in revenue across all regions, particularly in the Americas, which accounted for approximately 96% of total revenue in both years [7]. The table in image2 shows the revenue breakdown by geography, confirming the increase in total revenue from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020.\n\n### Unearned Revenue\nThe unearned revenue, which represents amounts invoiced in advance, also saw a notable increase. The unearned revenue at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 was $8,564 million, and it increased to $10,662 million by the end of the year [4]. This is a $2,098 million increase, as shown in image4. The increase in unearned revenue is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals, seasonality, and the compounding effects of new business [9]. Additionally, the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019 contributed $131 million to the contract asset balance, which is part of the unearned revenue [2].\n\n### Implications\nThe increase in unearned revenue suggests that the company has more future revenue recognized over time, indicating strong customer commitments and potentially higher future revenue recognition. However, it also means that a larger portion of the revenue is deferred, which could affect short-term cash flow and financial metrics. The company's ability to manage these deferred revenues and convert them into recognized revenue will be crucial for sustaining growth.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total revenue increased significantly from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, driven by growth across all regions. The unearned revenue also increased from $8,564 million to $10,662 million, reflecting higher customer commitments and deferred revenue.

The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant, amortized over the requisite service period [6]. The total stock-based expense for 2022 was $528 million, a decrease from $540 million in 2021 and $558 million in 2020 [3].

The increase in total loans suggests a strategic focus on expanding lending activities.\n- **WFAM Assets Under Management**: [6] mentions that Wells Fargo announced the sale of WFAM in February 2021, which was completed on November 1, 2021. The sale of WFAM resulted in a significant decrease in assets under management, as seen in image5, from $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021 to $0 at the end of 2021. This strategic divestiture indicates a shift in focus away from asset management towards other core banking activities.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Total Assets**: Image3 shows that total assets increased from $1,024,429 million in 2020 to $1,119,638 million in 2021, a 9.3% increase. This aligns with the text's indication of growth in total loans and other asset categories.\n- **WFAM Assets Under Management**: Image5 illustrates the dramatic decline in WFAM assets under management from $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021 to $0 by the end of 2021, due to the sale of WFAM. This reflects a strategic decision to streamline operations and focus on core banking services.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe increase in total assets, driven by commercial loan growth, indicates a strategic expansion in lending activities to capitalize on market demand. Conversely, the sale of WFAM assets under management reflects a strategic shift to divest non-core business segments, aligning with a focus on core banking operations and risk management. This dual approach suggests a balanced financial strategy aimed at growth in core areas while optimizing the asset portfolio.\n\n![Total assets increased from $1,024,"}

This increase was driven by higher demand in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [1][5][8].\n- **Consumer Loans**: Decreased from $409,220 million to $382,274 million, a decline of $26,946 million. This was mainly due to a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, with $17.8 billion transferred to loans held for sale (LHFS) and $72.6 billion in originations [1][8].\n\n### Deposit Changes:\n- **Total Deposits**: Increased from $1,404,381 million to $1,482,479 million, a rise of $78,098 million.

The Global Banking and Markets segment showed resilience despite the global economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. According to [4], Global Markets increased adjusted revenue due to strong performance, offsetting lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments. The segment managed to reduce gross Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs) by $37 billion globally, achieving this without increasing trading value at risk (VaR). This performance is reflected in the adjusted revenue figures, where Global Markets saw a significant increase of $1,562 million, a 27% rise from 2019 [image4]. \n\nIn contrast, the Corporate Centre faced challenges, with adjusted results showing a decline. The adjusted results for the Corporate Centre in 2020 were $262 million, a 60% increase from 2019, but this was largely due to a significant reduction in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which dropped by $1,056 million, a 97% decrease [image3]. Operating expenses also decreased by $273 million, a 36% reduction from 2019, contributing to a profit before tax of $1,311 million, up 42% from 2019. However, the Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) excluding significant items and UK bank levy dropped to 3.1%, down from 9.8% in 2019 [image1].\n\nThe Corporate Centre's adjusted revenue was negative at $(262) million in 2020, a 60% increase from 2019, primarily due to changes in legacy portfolios and other adjustments [image2]. The segment's net operating income was $(262) million, a 60% increase from 2019, indicating a significant improvement in financial performance despite the overall negative figure.\n\nOverall, while Global Banking and Markets performed well, the Corporate Centre's financial performance was mixed, with improvements in certain areas offset by negative net operating income.\n\n![HSBC's adjusted results showing a decline in profit before tax and RoTE in 2020 compared to 2019](image1)\n\n![Corporate Centre's adjusted revenue showing a negative net operating income"}

This increase can be attributed to various factors, including changes in derivative assets and liabilities, as detailed in the images.\n\n### Largest Derivative-Related Gain or Loss in 2021\n\nThe text quote [10] mentions derivative instruments measured at fair value and their classification. Image3 shows the net amounts presented for derivative assets and liabilities not designated as hedging instruments:\n\n- **Derivative Assets - not designated**: $313 million\n- **Derivative Liabilities - not designated**: $72 million\n\nThe largest derivative-related gain or loss in 2021 is shown in image2, where the total gain/loss from commodity contracts is $795 million. This significant loss is primarily due to the negative impact on sales and other operating revenues, as indicated by the $685 million loss in that category.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChevron's net equity for CPChem increased by $511 million from 2020 to 2021. The largest derivative-related gain or loss in 2021 was a $795 million loss, mainly due to a $685 million loss in sales and other operating revenues.\n\n```markdown\n![Chevron's net equity for CPChem increased by $511 million from 2020 to 2021](image1)\n\n![The largest derivative-related gain or loss in 2021 was a $795 million loss, mainly due to a $685 million loss in sales and other operating revenues](image2)\n``"}

According to text quote [3], the adjusted EBIT increased by 40% from the prior year, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.4% for fiscal year 2021 compared to 15.5% in 2020. This increase was mainly due to the strong margin development in the Diagnostics segment, driven by high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, and the first-time earnings contribution from Varian. The Varian segment alone reported an Adjusted EBIT of €221 million in the period from April 15 through September 30, 2021, with a margin of 17.0% [2][4].\n- Image4 shows that the total Adjusted EBIT for Siemens Healthineers increased from €2,248 million in 2020 to €3,142 million in 2021. The Varian segment's contribution of €221 million in 2021 is highlighted, indicating its significant impact on the overall increase in Adjusted EBIT.\n\n**Net Assets Impact:**\n- The acquisition of Varian led to an increase in net debt. Text quote [7] states that net debt increased by €10,416 million to €11,901 million in fiscal year 2021, mainly due to finance transactions related to the acquisition of Varian. Image1 confirms this, showing a substantial increase in net debt from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021.\n- Additionally, the acquisition resulted in an increase in operating net working capital. Text quote [4] mentions that operating net working capital increased by €720 million to €3,270 million, with €592 million of this increase attributed to the acquisition of Varian. Image2 illustrates the increase in operating net working capital from €2,550 million in 2020 to €3,270 million in 2021.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n"}

This indicates a significant positive impact on sales prices.\n- **Operating Cash Costs**: [8] notes that total expenses excluding net finance costs increased by 20%, including higher price-linked costs and net impairment charges. This suggests an increase in operating cash costs.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image1** provides a detailed breakdown of the factors affecting Underlying EBITDA:\n  - **Sales Prices**: The net price impact shows a positive change of $16,970M due to higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, partially offset by lower prices for metallurgical coal and LNG.\n  - **Operating Cash Costs**: The change in controllable cash costs includes higher inventory drawdowns and increased costs at Escondida and Spence, partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe increase in sales prices significantly boosted BHP's Underlying EBITDA by $16,970M, while higher operating cash costs, including increased inventory drawdowns and costs at Escondida and Spence, reduced it by $342M. Overall, the net positive impact from sales prices outweighed the negative impact from operating cash costs, leading to a substantial increase in Underlying EBITDA from $22,071M in FY2020 to $37,379M in FY2021.\n\n![Sales prices and operating cash costs significantly impacted BHP's Underlying EBITDA, with higher sales prices driving a substantial increase and higher operating costs partially offsetting this gain.](image1)\n\nChanges in sales prices and operating cash costs led to a significant increase in BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021, with higher sales prices contributing positively and increased operating costs partially offsetting this gain."}

However, this was still lower than the 2018 figure of $15,056 million. The increase was driven by higher revenue in Global Markets, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, which rose by $702 million (26%) and $283 million (20%) respectively [image4]. Despite this, the overall net operating income was impacted by lower interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments [1].\n\n**Profit Before Tax:**\n- The profit before tax dropped significantly from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020, a decrease of $342 million (7%) [image3]. This decline was primarily due to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, which increased by $1,056 million (over 200%) from 2019, reflecting the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic [2][3][6]. Additionally, the net interest margin decreased by 26 basis points due to lower global interest rates [2].\n\n**Contributing Factors:**\n- **Global Markets Performance:** Despite the overall decline, Global Markets managed to increase revenue with a decrease in RWAs and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR), contributing positively to net operating income [1].\n- **Covid-19 Impact:** The pandemic led to increased expected credit losses and a challenging economic outlook, particularly in Europe, MENA, and North and Latin America, negatively affecting profit before tax [3][5].\n- **Cost Reductions:** Adjusted operating expenses were reduced by $280 million (3%), partly offsetting the revenue decline [8].\n- **Regulatory and Economic Conditions:** Lower global interest rates and regulatory changes also played a role in the financial performance [1][6].\n\nIn summary, while Global Markets saw some positive revenue growth, the overall decline in net operating income and profit before tax was largely due to increased credit losses and the economic impact of the Covid-19"}

The image4 shows that the net operating income for 2020 was $15,303 million, compared to $14,869 million in 2019, indicating a $434 million increase or a 3% rise. This improvement can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Global Markets**: The adjusted revenue increased by $1,562 million or 27% from 2019 to 2020.

The stable gross margin indicates efficient cost management despite the increase in costs, which is crucial for sustaining profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category's revenue and cost of revenues both increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, contributing positively to the company's overall financial performance by driving revenue growth while maintaining a stable gross margin. This suggests effective management of costs relative to revenue increases in this segment.\n\n![Salesforce Platform and Other revenue growth from 2019 to 2020](image3)  \n![Total cost of revenues increase from 2019 to 2020](image5)"}

This increase was primarily due to:\n- An increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility.\n- An increase in Investment securities, mainly due to the E*TRADE acquisition.\n- Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments.\n- An increase in Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains.\n- Increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility under the Advanced Approach for CVA.\n\nThe image2 shows the detailed breakdown:\n- **Credit Risk RWA Balance at December 31, 2019**: $342,684 million (Standardized) and $228,927 million (Advanced).\n- **Credit Risk RWA Balance at December 31, 2020**: $387,066 million (Standardized) and $284,930 million (Advanced).\n- The total change in Credit Risk RWA was $51,493 million (Standardized) and $51,597 million (Advanced).\n\n### External TLAC as a Percentage of RWA\nFrom the text [3], External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital, excluding noncontrolling minority interests, and eligible Long-Term Debt (LTD).

However, the text notes that these risks are no longer significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021.

This can impact the availability of key products and affect distribution to operational facilities and customers. [2][8]\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- **Proactive Measures:** Nestlé has implemented policies and procedures to ensure the health and safety of its people, products, and sites. It also has business continuity and disaster recovery plans for key sites, along with active price risk management on key commodities. [2][8]\n\n**Relation to Factory Distribution:**\n- **Geographical Spread:** The distribution of Nestlé's factories across various regions, as shown in images 1, 3, 4, and 5, helps mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions. For example, the Americas (image 3) and Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (image 5) have multiple factories, which can provide redundancy and flexibility in operations. This geographical diversification helps in managing disruptions by allowing the company to reroute supplies and maintain production levels even if one region faces challenges. [6][8]\n\n**Visual Evidence:**\n- **Factory Locations:** Images 1, 3, 4, and 5 show the distribution of Nestlé's factories across different countries, highlighting the company's strategy to spread its operations globally. This spread is a key mitigation strategy against localized disruptions, ensuring that production can continue even if one area is affected by external factors. ![Nestlé's factory distribution across different regions](image1) ![Nestlé's factory distribution in the Americas](image3) ![Nestlé's factory distribution in Europe, Middle East, and North Africa](image5)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNestlé's strategic distribution of factories across various regions, as illustrated in the images, aligns with its risk management strategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions. By having a widespread presence, the company can better manage and respond to disruptions, ensuring continuity in product availability and maintaining its operational efficiency.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nNestlé mitigates supply chain disruptions through proactive policies and geographical diversification of its factories, as shown in the images, ensuring operational resilience."}

This decline was primarily due to the significant decrease in net interest income and the substantial decrease in net interest expense [image2]. \n\n- **Net Interest Income**: The decrease in net interest income was mainly driven by lower interest rates and volume changes in various assets, such as residential mortgage and credit card loans [image2]. Despite efforts to deploy excess deposits into securities and benefit from reduced deposit and funding costs, the overall impact was a net decrease of $1,974 million [image2].\n- **Net Interest Expense**: The net interest expense decreased by $4,452 million, largely due to lower rates and volume changes in interest-bearing deposits, particularly in U.S. interest-bearing deposits and savings accounts [image2]."}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, although it was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. The image1 table confirms this with a net interest income of $5,468 million in 2020, down from $6,504 million in 2019, a 16% decrease.\n- **Total Revenue**: Text quote [2] indicates that net income for Consumer Banking decreased by $6.5 billion to $6.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses, and higher expenses. The total revenue, net of interest expense, decreased by 1% from $13,034 million in 2019 to $13,116 million in 2020, as shown in image1.\n\n### Wealth Management:\n- **Net Interest Income**: Text quote [1] mentions that the MLGWM revenue decreased by 5% primarily due to lower interest rates, but was partially offset by higher market valuations and positive AUM flows.

This decrease was due to higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, despite higher net earnings excluding non-cash charges related to the Canadian tobacco litigation and the loss on deconsolidation of RBH [10].\n\n### Investing Activities\n- **Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion** from 2019 to 2020. This reduction was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted for derivatives [9].\n\n### Financing Activities\n- **Net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion** from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends, partially offset by debt activity [4].\n\n### Impact on Cash Balance\n- The overall cash balance at the end of 2020 was $7,285 million, compared to $8,000 million at the end of 2019. The decrease of $715 million reflects the combined effects of reduced net cash from operating activities, lower net cash used in investing activities, and increased net cash used in financing activities [image3].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe changes in net cash from operating, investing, and financing activities resulted in a net decrease in the overall cash balance at the end of 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in operating cash flows and the increase in financing cash outflows contributed to a lower cash balance, despite a reduction in cash used for investing activities.\n\n![Net cash used in financing activities increased by $0.4 billion from 2019 to 2020](image3)\n\n![Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion from 2019 to 2020](image2)\n\n![Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion from 2019 to 2020](image"}

The absolute amount increased from RMB14,967 million in 2019 to RMB18,992 million in 2021, reflecting a growth in service costs.\n- **Other Cost of Revenues**: This includes employee benefits, advertising agency fees, and other costs. It increased by 20.0% from RMB1,794 million in 2019 to RMB2,848 million in 2021, primarily due to higher agency fees and payment channel fees [8].\n\n### Operating Expenses\nFrom the text and image3, the operating expenses are broken down into selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses:\n\n- **Selling and Marketing Expenses**: These increased from RMB2,041 million in 2019 to RMB2,678 million in 2021, with a slight decrease in percentage from 43.0% to 40.0%.\n- **General and Administrative Expenses**: These increased from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,099 million in 2021, with a slight decrease in percentage from 57.0% to 60.0%.\n\n### Analysis\nThe company's cost structure shows a consistent increase in both service costs and other cost of revenues, indicating higher operational and external costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses, despite a slight decrease in percentage, suggests ongoing investment in R&D and administrative functions [3][9]. The slight decrease in the percentage of selling and marketing expenses might indicate improved efficiency in these areas [5].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe company's financial management appears to be focused on expanding its competitive advantages through increased R&D investment and managing operational costs.

This decrease is attributed to the impact of COVID-19, as mentioned in text quote [6]. The decline in spending for travel and entertainment remained lower compared to 2019, indicating reduced consumer activity in these sectors.\n- **Debit Card Purchase Volumes**: In contrast, debit card purchase volumes increased from $360,672 million in 2019 to $384,503 million in 2020, as seen in image2. This increase suggests that consumers shifted their spending to debit cards, possibly due to increased savings or reduced credit usage during the pandemic.\n\n### Home Equity Metrics:\n- **Home Equity Production**: Text quote [5] indicates that home equity production decreased by $2.8 billion in Consumer Banking and $3.0 billion for the total Corporation in 2020, primarily due to a decline in applications. This is further supported by image4, which shows a decrease in home equity from $9,755 million in 2019 to $6,930 million in 2020 in Consumer Banking, and from $11,131 million to $8,160 million overall.\n- **Outstanding Balances**: Text quote [9] mentions that outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. This aligns with the lower home equity production figures.\n\n### Consumer Behavior Indications:\n- The decrease in credit card purchase volumes and home equity production, alongside the increase in debit card usage, suggests that consumers were more cautious with their spending and borrowing during 2020. The economic uncertainty and government stimulus measures likely influenced these behaviors, with consumers opting for more secure payment methods and reducing their reliance on credit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe changes in credit card and home equity metrics between 2019 and 2"}

For coal, the Underlying EBITDA decreased by US\\$1.3 billion to US\\$288 million in FY2021, primarily due to lower prices and volumes. Lower volumes reduced Underlying EBITDA by US\\$168 million, while controllable cash costs increased by US\\$102 million, driven by higher maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and increased stripping volumes. However, cost reduction initiatives partially offset these increases [2]. The average realized sales price for metallurgical coal decreased from US\\$130.97 per tonne in 2020 to US\\$106.64 in 2021, and hard coking coal (HCC) prices dropped from US\\$143.65 to US\\$112.72 per tonne, reflecting the impact of lower prices on revenue and profitability [10].\n\nFor nickel, the Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US\\$296 million to US\\$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, despite being partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs due to the stronger nickel price [1]. The average realized nickel price increased from US\\$13,860 per tonne in 2020 to US\\$16,250 in 2021, supported by strong demand and supply disruptions [10]. The impact of a US\\$1/t increase in nickel price on Underlying EBITDA is US\\$1 million, highlighting its significant contribution to financial results [image1].\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include fluctuations in commodity prices, which affect cash flows and asset values [5].

However, these were partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. Net interest income in 2021 included $518 million from PPP loans and $1.1 billion from GNMA loan securitization pools.\n- **Noninterest Income**: Text [3] also mentions that noninterest income was affected by various factors, including gains on sales of equity securities, impairment charges related to rail cars, and valuation losses on retained litigation risk.

According to [3], Toyota developed a fleet management system for the e-Palette based on the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS) to ensure effective, efficient, and accurate operation. This system is designed to monitor vehicles remotely and operate them in a just-in-time fashion according to the conditions of the surrounding environment.\n\n![Toyota's fleet management system ensures vehicles are dispatched \"when needed, where needed, and in the amount needed.\"](image3)\n\nThe system's response to an increase in waiting customers is illustrated in image3. When waiting customers increase, the AMMS (Operation management center) dispatches an additional unit in real time to meet the demand. This ensures that the operation intervals are prevented from varying, maintaining a consistent and efficient service. The system also includes features for emergency remote vehicle stop/start and immediate development of replacement vehicles, which are automatically sent to the garage in the event of an abnormality. This comprehensive approach ensures that the fleet is always ready to meet customer needs promptly and efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nToyota's Fleet Management System responds to an increase in waiting customers by dispatching additional units in real time, ensuring consistent operation intervals and maintaining efficient service delivery.\n\n[3]"}

This indicates an increase in the valuation allowance by $99 million from 2021 to 2022.\n- **Impact on Deferred Tax Assets**: The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2022 and 2021 include deferred income tax assets of $445 million and $444 million, respectively, as stated in text quote [10]. The slight increase in deferred tax assets from $444 million to $445 million suggests that the increase in the valuation allowance had a minimal impact on the net deferred tax assets.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: Image 3 shows the deferred tax assets and liabilities for 2022, 2021, and 2020. The deferred income tax assets are $443,651 million in 2022 and $443,089 million in 2021, with a slight increase of $562 million. The deferred income tax liabilities are $724 million in 2022 and $754 million in 2021, showing a decrease of $30 million. The net deferred tax assets (assets minus liabilities) increased from $368,335 million in 2021 to $369,927 million in 2022, a small increase of $1,592 million.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe valuation allowance increased by $99 million from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to foreign tax credits that the Company believes will not be realized. Despite this increase, the net deferred tax assets saw a slight increase of $1,592 million, indicating that the impact of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets was minimal.\n\n![The valuation allowance increased by $99 million from 2021 to 2022, with a minimal impact on net deferred tax assets.](image3"}

This substantial increase was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs from the previous year [4]. The comprehensive income also improved, with a net loss of $6,165 million in 2020 turning into a gain of $17,348 million in 2021 [8]. The increase in comprehensive income was influenced by favorable foreign currency effects and higher unrealized holding gains on securities [8].\n\nThe financial activities that contributed to these changes include:\n\n- **Operating Activities**: Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $27,314 million in 2019 to $29,187 million in 2021, driven by higher net income and adjustments for depreciation, depletion, and amortization [2].\n- **Investing Activities**: Significant cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions, such as the Noble Energy acquisition, were offset by proceeds from asset sales [2].\n- **Financing Activities**: Net cash used for financing activities decreased, reflecting reduced net borrowings and dividend payments [2].\n\nThese changes reflect improved operational performance and strategic financial management, leading to a stronger financial position for Chevron Corporation.\n\n![Chevron Corporation's net income and comprehensive income improved from 2020 to 2021, with net income turning from a loss to a profit and comprehensive income showing a significant gain.](image4)\n\n![Financial activities, including operating, investing, and financing, contributed to the changes in net income and comprehensive income.](image2)"}

This long-term commitment has laid the groundwork for advanced battery technologies.\n\n[2] Toyota aims to reduce battery costs by 50% compared to the Toyota bZ4X in the second half of the 2020s through integrated vehicle and battery development.\n\n[8] Specifically, Toyota plans to reduce battery costs by 30% or more by developing new materials and structures. Additionally, improving power consumption by 30% will lead to reduced battery capacity requirements, further reducing costs.\n\n[9] The e-Palette, used in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, demonstrates Toyota's focus on integrating mobility with information systems and community coordination, highlighting the importance of efficient battery use.\n\n[5] Toyota is developing next-generation lithium-ion batteries with longer service life, greater energy density, more compact size, and lower costs. This includes innovations in liquid-based battery materials and all-solid-state batteries.\n\n![Highly balancing 5 factors to provide reliable batteries](image1)\n\n![Greater than 30% reduction in cost of a single battery and 30% improvement in power efficiency = 30% reduction in battery capacity (30% cost reduction)](image2)\n\n![Taking on the challenge of developing a wide range of batteries for the second half of the 2020s](image3)\n\nThe evolution of battery control models is crucial for optimizing battery performance and efficiency. By focusing on safety, security, and long service life, Toyota ensures that batteries can be used with peace of mind throughout their lifetime. This is achieved through innovations in battery materials, manufacturing processes, and new structures that match the vehicle's needs. For instance, the development of low-cost materials like cobalt-free and nickel-free options, along with manufacturing process innovations, directly contributes to reducing battery costs. Improved power efficiency, as seen in the Toyota bZ4X, allows for a 30% reduction in battery capacity, translating to a 30% cost reduction.

This indicates a positive impact on Underlying EBITDA from increased sales prices.\n  - [5] notes that petroleum revenue decreased due to lower production but increased due to higher average realized prices, suggesting a positive impact from price increases.\n\n- **Volumes**:\n  - [6] states that record volumes were achieved at WAIO and the highest annual production at Olympic Dam, but these were offset by expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence and adverse weather events, indicating mixed volume impacts.\n  - [8] mentions lower production at Petroleum but higher volumes at WAIO, showing a net positive volume impact.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image5** provides detailed breakdowns:\n  - **Net Price Impact**: \n    - For 2020, the net price impact was US\\$16,995 million, driven by higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, offset by lower prices for metallurgical coal and LNG.\n    - For 2021, the net price impact was US\\$16,071 million, with similar drivers but adjusted for changes in volumes and costs.\n  - **Change in Volumes**:\n    - In 2020, the change in volumes was a negative US\\$312 million, due to lower grades at Escondida and Spence and adverse weather.\n    - In 2021, the change in volumes was a negative US\\$109 million, with record volumes at WAIO and Escondida but lower volumes at other operations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe increase in Underlying EBITDA from 2020 to 2021 was significantly driven by higher sales prices across various commodities, which more than offset the negative impacts from volume changes and other costs.

The high level of committed credit facilities, as seen in image3, suggests a proactive approach to ensuring access to capital, while the substantial long-term debt, as detailed in image2, indicates a strategy that leverages debt to finance its operations and growth.

This indicates a strategic shift in the company's financial activities, focusing more on growth and expansion through acquisitions in 2020.\n\n![Net cash used in investing activities increased significantly from 2018 to 2020, primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition and other investments, while total operating cash flows remained relatively stable and increased year-over-year.](image4)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe net cash used in investing activities increased dramatically from 2018 to 2020, driven by major acquisitions like the Cytiva Acquisition, while total operating cash flows remained relatively stable and increased year-over-year, indicating a strategic focus on growth through investments in 2020."}

Initially, in 1998, the majority of investments were concentrated in the seed stage, with 78% allocated to early-stage funding [1][image1]. This indicates a focus on supporting nascent startups during their initial phases. By 2000, there was a notable diversification, with a larger portion of investments moving to early-stage funding, accounting for 59% [1][image1]. This shift suggests an increased interest in companies that had progressed beyond the seed stage but were still in their early development phases.\n\nBy 2007, the distribution had further evolved, with mid-stage investments becoming more prominent, making up 74% of the fund [1][image1]. This change highlights a strategic shift towards supporting companies that had demonstrated some growth and were closer to scaling up. The scarcity of VC money in Europe, which led to higher capital efficiency and yield, likely influenced this trend, as investors became more selective and focused on funding companies with proven potential [4].\n\nThe accompanying financial data shows that the total investment amounts also varied across these stages. The 1998 fund had a total investment of €5.3 million, with a significant portion in the seed stage [image3]. The 2000 fund increased to €9.8 million, reflecting a higher allocation to early-stage investments [image3]. By 2007, the total investment dropped to €3.8 million, but the distribution across stages became more balanced, with a larger share in mid-stage funding [image3]. This indicates that while the total investment decreased, the focus on later-stage funding increased, aligning with the trend of supporting more mature companies.\n\nComparing these stages to the US, the graph shows that European funds lagged behind in terms of investment amounts, with a gap of 1.5 to 2.5 times less than the US [image4]. However, the shift towards mid-stage funding in Europe suggests a strategic move to bridge this gap by investing in companies with higher growth potential.\n\nThe timeline graph further illustrates the trend of increasing investment in later stages over the years [image5]. The lines show a gradual rise in later-stage investments, indicating a maturing venture capital ecosystem in Europe that is now more focused on supporting companies through their growth phases.\n\nIn conclusion"}

Image1 shows that 74% of women in computer jobs have experienced gender-related discrimination at work, compared to only 16% of men in computer jobs, highlighting a significant disparity. Image3 confirms that 50% of women in STEM jobs have experienced discrimination, compared to 19% of men. Image5 indicates that women in STEM jobs working in majority-male environments (78%) are more likely to experience discrimination than those in more balanced or female-majority workplaces (44%).\n\nThese findings are consistent across various STEM fields, as shown in image2, where women's representation varies significantly, with speech language pathologists at 96% and engineers at 14%. Image4 reveals that while 22% of women in STEM jobs have experienced sexual harassment, only 7% of men have, and 55% of women perceive sexual harassment as a problem in their workplace, compared to 28% of men.\n\n### Conclusion\nWomen in STEM jobs experience significantly more gender discrimination than men, with higher rates of perceived inequities and challenges in career advancement."}

For instance, 7% of self-identified Hispanics often interact with Hispanic culture, but this drops to 6% among third or higher generations [3][image3].

The earliest settlers found a shorter route west to Fort Kearny by cutting across present-day Hamilton County, which later became known as the Nebraska City-Fort Kearny cut-off [1]. This route was crucial for early exploration and settlement. The arrival of the railroad in 1879 marked another pivotal moment, with the Burlington & Missouri line extending through the county and connecting to other major cities by 1927, providing essential market access for agricultural products [2][6]. \n\nSeveral major automobile routes also serve Hamilton County. State Highway 14 connects Central City to Aurora, while US Highway 34 runs east to west from York to Grand Island, and Interstate 80 bisects the county, just south of Aurora [8]. These routes have been vital for transportation and commerce.\n\nThe map of Hamilton County highlights key communities such as Aurora, Giltner, Hampton, Hordville, Marquette, Murphy, Phillips, and Stockham [5]. Aurora, in particular, is a significant town, as it is a major intersection for highways and railroads, making it a central hub in the county [10].\n\n![Hamilton County Nebraska map showing major routes and communities](image5)\n\nThe map illustrates the grid-like Public Land Survey system, which divided the land into townships and sections, aiding pioneers in acquiring land systematically [9].

Initially, the population surged due to the arrival of settlers and the establishment of infrastructure like the railroad and rural schools. However, over time, agricultural changes and consolidation led to a decline in population in most rural areas, except for Aurora, which saw gains.\n\n### Population Trends\n\n- **1870 to 1890**: The population grew dramatically from 130 to 14,059, peaking in 1890. This growth was fueled by the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad, which attracted settlers and facilitated migration [9][5].\n- **1900 to 1940**: The population peaked again in 1900 at 13,337, then fluctuated slightly before declining to 9,982 by 1940. This period saw the establishment of rural communities and schools, but also the beginning of farm consolidation [3][6].\n- **Post-1940**: The population continued to decline until the mid-20th century, with a low of 8,714 in 1960. The mechanization of agriculture and increased farm sizes led to fewer farms and a smaller rural population [4].\n- **1980 to 2000**: A slight recovery occurred, with the population rising from 9,301 in 1980 to 9,403 in 2000, primarily in Aurora, which defied the trend of small towns struggling [2].\n\n### Historical Factors\n\n- **Homestead Act and Railroad**: These acts encouraged westward expansion and settlement, leading to rapid population growth in the late 19th century [9].\n- **Agricultural Changes**: Mechanization and consolidation reduced the number of farms, impacting rural populations [4].\n- **Rural School Districts**: Initially numerous, these districts consolidated over time, reflecting population changes [6].\n- **Ethnic Settlements**: Ethnic groups like Germans and Danes settled in clusters, creating strong community centers like Zion Lutheran Church and St. John’s, which served as focal points [7][8].\n\n### Visual Evidence\n\n- **Image3**: The census data table shows the population peaks and declines over the years, highlighting the trends discussed.\n- **Image5**: The map of Hamilton"}

This is significantly higher than the confidence in his ability to work effectively with Congress, where only about a third of Americans express confidence [8]. Republicans are broadly confident in Trump on most issues, but they rate him lower on working with Congress [9]. Specifically, 89% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are confident in Trump’s ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries, compared to just 19% of Democrats and Democratic leaners [5]. Democrats are deeply skeptical that Trump is avoiding potential conflicts of interest, with 69% saying they are not at all confident that Trump keeps his business interests separate from his presidential decisions [6].\n\nThe image quotes provide further details. Image1 shows that 62% of the public lacks confidence in Trump's ability to work effectively with Congress, while 51% are confident in his ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries. Image4 illustrates that among Republicans, 83% are very or somewhat confident in Trump's ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements, whereas only 31% are very or somewhat confident in his ability to work effectively with Congress. In contrast, among Democrats, 70% lack confidence in his ability to negotiate trade agreements, but 89% lack confidence in his ability to work with Congress.\n\nCombining these insights, we see a stark contrast in confidence levels. Republicans are more confident in Trump's ability to negotiate trade agreements than to work with Congress, while Democrats are skeptical on both fronts but particularly so regarding trade agreements. This highlights a partisan divide in confidence, with Republicans showing higher confidence in Trump's trade negotiation skills compared to his congressional relations, and Democrats expressing low confidence in both areas, especially trade agreements.\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more confident in Trump's ability to negotiate trade agreements than to work with Congress, while Democrats are skeptical of both, particularly trade agreements.

According to the text quotes, roughly half of Americans believe China will have less influence in world affairs after the coronavirus outbreak [4], [3]. This perception is more prevalent among Republicans, with 60% of them holding this view, compared to 40% of Democrats [1]. Age also plays a role, with older adults (65 and older) being 16 percentage points more likely than younger adults (under 30) to think China's global influence will diminish [1].

This suggests variability in the evaluation process.\n2. **Image Quote [image2]**: This image provides specific percentages of agreement among annotators for Chameleon against Gemini+ and GPT-4V+. It shows that for Chameleon vs. Gemini+, 31.5% of cases had all three annotators agree, 58.1% had two out of three agree, and 10.3% had no agreement. For Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, the numbers were 35.4%, 55.2%, and 9.3% respectively.\n\n### Answer Construction\n\nThe annotator agreement levels for Chameleon against other models in relative evaluations are as follows:\n\n- **Chameleon vs. Gemini+**:\n  - All 3 annotators agree: 31.5%\n  - 2 of 3 annotators agree: 58.1%\n  - No Agreement: 10.3%\n\n- **Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+**:\n  - All 3 annotators agree: 35.4%\n  - 2 of 3 annotators agree: 55.2%\n  - No Agreement: 9.3%\n\nThese statistics indicate that there is a moderate level of agreement among annotators when evaluating Chameleon against Gemini+ and GPT-4V+. The majority of cases (58.1% and 55.2%) had at least two annotators agreeing, suggesting a reasonable level of inter-annotator reliability. However, the presence of 10.3% and 9.3% disagreement in these comparisons indicates variability in the evaluation process, which may affect the reliability of the results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe inter-annotator reliability for Chameleon's performance is moderate, with a significant portion of cases showing agreement among annotators.

Adding logical constraints into LLM instructions can provide stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. The performance of incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass that of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image4**: This image shows the Micro-F1 performance and logical inconsistency (LI) for MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets with and without logical constraints (w/o. Ic and w. Ic) as the number of demonstration samples increases. The left graph shows Micro-F1, and the right graph shows logical inconsistency.\n\n### Interleaved Answer:\nThe number of demonstration samples significantly impacts the Micro-F1 performance in both MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets. Initially, increasing the number of demonstrations from 1 to 5 leads to a noticeable improvement in Micro-F1. However, beyond 5 demonstrations, the improvements plateau, as shown in the left graph of image4. This aligns with [10], which states that increasing demonstrations beyond 5 yields limited gains.\n\nIncorporating logical constraints into the prompts enhances performance even with fewer demonstrations. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints can outperform using 10 demonstrations without them, as seen in image4. This indicates that logical constraints are crucial for optimizing performance, as they provide stable improvements and can compensate for the lack of additional demonstrations.\n\n![Logical constraints improve performance with fewer demonstrations](image4)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of demonstration samples initially boosts Micro-F1 performance, but the gains diminish after 5 demonstrations. Logical constraints enhance performance, allowing fewer demonstrations to achieve better results than a larger number without constraints. This highlights the importance of logical constraints in optimizing LLM performance.\n\n**Answer**: The number of demonstration samples initially improves Micro-F1 performance, but gains plateau after 5 samples. Logical constraints enhance performance, enabling fewer demonstrations to outperform more without constraints."}

This strategy involves using both critic and refinement models to provide feedback and improve the output.\n- **[6]** mentions that external knowledge sources, such as RARR, REFEED, and LLM-Augmenter, are used to refine outputs by prompting the LLM to question its outputs and then using an external retriever to find relevant evidence.\n- **[7]** and **[9]** discuss how self-correction and external feedback can be used to refine outputs iteratively, with the LLM acting as both the generator and the critic.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image1** illustrates the 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy, showing that the language model generates outputs, which are then refined using external models/tools like knowledge sources, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines. This external feedback helps in correcting factual inaccuracies and improving the quality of the output.\n\n### Interleaved Answer:\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances the refinement of outputs by leveraging external models and tools to provide detailed and accurate feedback after the initial generation. This approach, as shown in **image1**, involves the language model generating an output, which is then evaluated by a critic model. The critic model utilizes external resources such as knowledge bases, trained models, and search engines to provide feedback. This feedback is crucial for correcting factual errors and improving the overall quality of the output. For instance, models like RARR and REFEED use external knowledge to refine outputs by prompting the LLM to question its own responses and then retrieving relevant evidence to correct them [6]. This strategy is more flexible and transparent compared to self-correction, as it incorporates diverse and informative feedback without needing to update the model parameters [5].\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances output refinement by utilizing external models and tools to provide accurate and detailed feedback, ensuring factual correctness and improving overall quality.\n\n![Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback Enhances Output Refinement](image1)"}

It starts with the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding and then considers the children of these nodes, repeating the process until reaching the leaf nodes. The text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context [7].\n  - **Control**: By adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer, the method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved, starting with a broad outlook and progressively focusing on finer details [9].\n\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval**:\n  - **Process**: This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones. It flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level for comparison, which offers greater flexibility and retrieves information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [1][3].\n  - **Advantage**: The collapsed tree approach consistently performs better due to its ability to search through all nodes simultaneously, unlike tree traversal, which maintains a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details regardless of the question [1].\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image2** illustrates the difference between the two retrieval methods:\n  - **Tree Traversal Retrieval (A)**: Shows a hierarchical tree structure where nodes are selected layer-by-layer, and the retrieved context is formed by concatenating the text from these nodes.\n  - **Collapsed Tree Retrieval (B)**: Depicts a flattened tree structure where all nodes are evaluated collectively, and the most relevant ones are selected for retrieval.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ fundamentally in their approach to retrieving information. Tree Traversal Retrieval uses a hierarchical, layer-by-layer method, selecting nodes based on their position in the tree, which can limit flexibility in matching the question's detail level. In contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes simultaneously, providing greater flexibility and better performance by retrieving information at the appropriate granularity for each question.\n\n![Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information by layer-by-layer selection versus simultaneous evaluation of all nodes.](image2)\n\n**"}

According to the text, DETR uses a set of learned object queries that are transformed into output embeddings by the decoder. These object queries are initially set to zero and are passed through the transformer decoder along with output positional encodings. The decoder then produces the final set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes through multiple multi-head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention mechanisms [5]. The use of object queries allows the model to globally reason about all objects together using pairwise relations between them, while leveraging the whole image as context [5]. This approach eliminates the need for hand-designed components like non-maximal suppression and spatial anchors, simplifying the detection pipeline [1].\n\nThe architecture diagram in image3 illustrates this process.

Specifically, the model's ability to produce questions is hindered by the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from generating common question bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\". To address this, an extra setting `z = 10 (boost)` is introduced, which disables `extrep bigram` during beam search but uses it for reranking, allowing the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams.\n\n![Repetition control reduces question-asking frequency by discouraging common question bigrams, but a boost setting can mitigate this issue](image3)\n\n[4] and [5] discuss the importance of controlling repetition alongside other attributes like specificity and question-asking. The models that control repetition show significant improvements in engagingness.\n\n![Repetition control affects question-asking frequency, with a boost setting achieving higher question rates](image4)\n\nImage4 shows the percentage of utterances containing questions across different question-asking control levels. Without repetition control, the question-asking rate increases steadily. However, with repetition control, the rate is lower, especially at higher control levels. The `boost` setting (z=10) achieves a higher question rate, approaching the target for question-controlled CT.\n\nIn summary, repetition control initially reduces the frequency of question-asking due to the discouragement of repeated bigrams. However, introducing a boost setting allows the model to overcome this limitation and achieve higher question-asking rates, demonstrating that repetition control can be effectively managed to maintain or enhance question-asking frequency.\n\n**Answer:** Repetition control initially reduces question-asking frequency by discouraging repeated bigrams, but a boost setting can mitigate this, allowing the model to achieve higher question rates."}

This is done through in-context learning, where the model is prompted with examples and instructions to determine if further questions are needed [9].\n\n2. **Question Generator**: The question generator module also uses InstructGPT to generate relevant questions necessary for verifying the claim.

This is achieved through the use of a pre-trained BERT model to encode information about the dialogue context along with each domain-slot pair, resulting in contextualized representations conditioned on the domain-slot information. The model then utilizes a slot gate to handle special types of values, applying a two-way linear mapping to find text spans for non-categorical slots and selecting the most plausible values from picklists for categorical slots based on the contextual representation [3].\n\nThe architecture of the DS-DST model, as shown in image3, illustrates this process. It uses BERT to encode the candidate-value list and domain-slot pairs, and the recent dialog context separately. The model calculates cosine similarity between the aggregated representation of the dialog context and a reference candidate to determine the best match [1]. This approach ensures that the model can effectively leverage both the dialog context and slot-specific information to make accurate predictions.\n\nThe effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated in the results shown in image1, where the DS-DST model achieves a joint accuracy of 51.21%, outperforming BERT-DST (43.40%) and other models like ToD-BERT (48.00%). This improvement is attributed to the strong interactions between slots and dialog context, highlighting the model's ability to better match candidate values with the dialogue context [2].\n\nIn summary, the DS-DST model determines the matching between candidate values and the dialogue context by leveraging BERT to encode contextualized representations and using cosine similarity to find the best match, facilitated by direct interactions between the dialog context and domain-slot pairs.

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement. For example, in deductive reasoning, the model might translate a statement like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb, then the light bulb is glowing\" into logical predicates such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)` [4][5][8].\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**:\n   - Once the problem is formulated symbolically, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference. Different types of reasoning problems use different solvers. For instance, deductive reasoning might use a logic programming engine like Pyke, while first-order logic problems might use Prover9 [5][8]. The solver processes the symbolic formulation to derive conclusions.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - The final step involves translating the symbolic answer back into natural language. This ensures the output is understandable and correctly answers the original question. For example, if the solver determines that \"Nails cannot conduct electricity,\" the result interpreter will present this conclusion clearly [1][2].\n\nThe model also incorporates a self-refinement module that uses error messages from the symbolic solver to iteratively improve the symbolic formulation, enhancing accuracy [2].\n\n![LOGIC-LM Workflow](image5)\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the reasoning process is both logical and transparent, leveraging the strengths of both large language models and symbolic solvers to achieve more accurate and faithful results compared to methods relying solely on chain-of-thought prompting [6][7].\n\n**Answer**: The LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first translating it into a symbolic representation, then using a symbolic solver to perform logical inference, and finally interpreting the results back into natural language, ensuring accurate and transparent reasoning."}

However, LLaMA models excel in recall by producing longer answers with more citations. This suggests a trade-off between precision and recall, with GPT-4 being more precise and LLaMA models being more recall-oriented.\n\n[9] highlights that specific questions yield better performance metrics than general questions because they provide clearer instructions on the required knowledge, leading to better text-citation alignment and higher evaluation scores.\n\n[10] states that OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and ChatGPT, have better text quality compared to LLaMA family models, which aligns with their citation evaluation results.\n\n### Image Analysis\n\n- **image3** shows the performance metrics of GPT-4 and ChatGPT under different settings.

The model samples a batch of equal size from each source at each iteration.\n- **[9]** states that all sources of supervision are useful, with crowdsourced examples making the biggest impact. Head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **image1** shows the performance breakdown for different type granularity and supervision data. It highlights the impact of removing each data source on the Ultra-Fine category:\n  - **All Data**: Ultra-Fine F1 is 14.6.\n  - **–Crowd**: Ultra-Fine F1 drops to 8.4.\n  - **–Head**: Ultra-Fine F1 slightly improves to 8.5.\n  - **–EL**: Ultra-Fine F1 increases to 16.0.\n\n### Answer Construction:\nThe exclusion of different data sources significantly impacts the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category. According to **image1**, removing the crowdsourced data (Crowd) results in the most substantial drop in Ultra-Fine F1 score, from 14.6 to 8.4. This indicates that crowdsourced examples are crucial for predicting ultra-fine labels. Removing head word supervision (Head) has a minimal impact, with a slight increase to 8.5, suggesting it is less critical for ultra-fine predictions. Interestingly, excluding entity linking (EL) improves the Ultra-Fine F1 to 16.0, possibly due to the elimination of noise or redundancy from KB and Wikipedia definitions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe exclusion of crowdsourced data severely hampers the model's ability to predict ultra-fine labels, while removing head word supervision has a negligible effect. Excluding entity linking actually improves performance, likely due to reduced noise.\n\n![Exclusion of crowdsourced data significantly reduces Ultra-Fine F1 score](image1)"}

The key point is that only completing part of this chain does not count; the full journey from data collection to impact is essential. This chain emphasizes the importance of each step in creating value from data. The image4 illustrates this chain visually, showing the progression from data to reporting, analysis, action, and ultimately value. This sequential process highlights that each stage builds on the previous one, ensuring that insights are not just generated but also acted upon to create tangible outcomes.\n\n### Levels of Analytics\n\nThe Levels of Analytics, depicted in image2, categorize analytics into different stages based on the degree of intelligence and business value they provide. These levels range from Standard Reports, which answer \"What happened?\" to Optimization, which seeks \"What's the best that can happen?\" This hierarchy shows a progression from descriptive analytics (reporting past events) to predictive and prescriptive analytics (forecasting future events and suggesting actions). The image2 graphically represents this progression, showing how each level adds more intelligence and value, moving from basic reporting to advanced modeling and optimization.\n\n### Complementarity\n\nThe Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics complement each other by providing a framework for both the process and the sophistication of analytics. The Analytics Value Chain outlines the necessary steps to transform data into value, while the Levels of Analytics define the depth and type of insights that can be generated at each step. Together, they ensure that data is not only collected and analyzed but also used to make informed decisions and drive actions that lead to significant business impact.\n\n- **Data Collection and Reporting**: The Analytics Value Chain starts with data collection, which aligns with the Standard Reports level in the Levels of Analytics. This foundational step ensures that the data is available for further analysis.\n- **Analysis and Insights**: Moving through the Analytics Value Chain, data is analyzed, which corresponds to the higher levels of analytics (e.g., Statistical Analysis, Predictive Modeling). These levels provide deeper insights, answering \"Why?\" and \"What will happen next?\"\n- **Action and Impact**: The final stages of the Analytics Value Chain involve taking action and achieving impact, which is supported by the highest levels of analytics (e.g"}

This process is crucial for the transition from mitosis to cytokinesis. The spindle fibers, which were previously involved in chromosome separation, start to disassemble [6]. The chromosomes themselves begin to decondense, returning to their less visible chromatin form [6].\n\nCytokinesis, which often overlaps with telophase [1], involves the division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, this is achieved through the formation of a cleavage furrow, as illustrated in image5, where the cleavage furrow is shown constricting the cell. This furrow deepens until it pinches the cell in two, resulting in the formation of two separate daughter cells. In plant cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cell plate, which eventually develops into a new cell wall, though this is not depicted in the provided images.\n\nThe images provided, particularly image5, visually demonstrate these processes. Image1 and image2 show cells in different stages of division, with image1 likely depicting a cell in metaphase or early telophase, and image2 showing a cell in a later stage of cytokinesis.

In a monohybrid cross, such as the one involving purple and white flowers, the parental generation (P generation) consists of true-breeding plants with homozygous genotypes (PP for purple flowers and pp for white flowers). When these plants are crossed, all F1 generation plants are heterozygous (Pp) and exhibit the dominant phenotype (purple flowers) due to the presence of the dominant allele (P).\n\nIn the F2 generation, the F1 plants (Pp) self-pollinate, leading to a segregation of alleles during gamete formation. Each F1 plant produces gametes with either the P or p allele. The possible combinations of these gametes result in the following genotypic ratios: 1 PP (homozygous dominant), 2 Pp (heterozygous), and 1 pp (homozygous recessive). This 1:2:1 ratio is a direct outcome of Mendel's law of segregation, which states that alleles separate during gamete formation.\n\nPhenotypically, the dominant trait (purple flowers) is expressed in the presence of at least one dominant allele (PP or Pp), while the recessive trait (white flowers) is only expressed when both alleles are recessive (pp). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1, with three plants showing purple flowers and one showing white flowers. This ratio is a result of the independent assortment of alleles and the dominance of the purple allele over the white allele.\n\n![Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the principles of segregation and independent assortment of alleles.](image5)\n\n### Answer:\nMendelian inheritance explains the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the dominance of the purple allele over the white allele, resulting in three purple-flowered plants for every one white-flowered plant."}

The F1 generation shows all purple flowers, and the F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white.\n- **Text Quote [4]**: This quote mentions that in a heterozygous individual, expression of both alleles results in an intermediate phenotype, which is relevant for understanding how traits are expressed in the F2 generation.\n- **Text Quote [7]**: This quote explains that offspring inherit unique sets of genes from two parents, leading to variations in traits, which is crucial for understanding the F2 generation's diversity.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Image4**: This image provides a detailed diagram of Mendel's monohybrid cross. It shows the genetic makeup of the P plants (PP and pp), the F1 hybrids (Pp), and the F2 generation (PP, Pp, and pp). The phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3 purple to 1 white, and the genotypic ratio is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp.\n\n### Answer Construction:\nIn the F2 generation of Mendel's monohybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio observed is 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower. This is because the dominant allele (P) for purple flowers masks the recessive allele (p) for white flowers in the heterozygous individuals (Pp). The genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp. This means that out of the offspring, 25% will be homozygous dominant (PP), 50% will be heterozygous (Pp), and 25% will be homozygous recessive (pp).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1 (purple:white), and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (PP:Pp:pp).\n\n![Phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 3:1 (purple:white), and the genotypic ratio is 1:2"}

It appears that these two countries do not have specific legislation governing the granting of asylum and refugee status. In all the other surveyed jurisdictions, these issues are governed by national laws and executive regulations issued by authorities in charge of resolving migration-related issues. Most of the countries included in this survey require an applicant’s physical presence at the border or within the country’s territory. In some countries (Argentina, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey), a time limit for the period when an application can be submitted is in place. Canada and Mexico each accept asylum applications from outside of the country. Canada processes such applications as a part of its visa application process, while Mexico allows submitting a petition from outside of the country for political asylum only. Brazil, as a party to the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum of the Organization of American States, allows applicants to request diplomatic asylum in Brazilian embassies abroad. Australia and Canada allow humanitarian protection and refugee status requests from abroad when protection is sought through a resettlement program administered by the United Nations, another designated referral agency, or by private sponsorship.

Putin to face a “war crime trial.” Germany and France expelled a total of 75 Russian diplomats, and President Emmanuel Macron of France said the European Union should consider sanctions against Russian coal and oil. “This guy is brutal,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Putin. “And what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it.” In Moscow on Monday, Mr. Putin said nothing about his war in Ukraine, but his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the Kremlin “categorically” denied “any allegations” of Russian involvement in the atrocities. Instead, Russia’s state media aired relentless conspiracy theories about what it said was a Ukrainian fabrication, while the authorities threatened to prosecute anyone who publicly blamed Russians for the Bucha. While Russian troops have battered Ukraine, officials in China have been meeting behind closed doors to study a Communist Party-produced documentary that extols President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a hero. The humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union, the video says, was the result of efforts by the United States to destroy its legitimacy. With swelling music and sunny scenes of present-day Moscow, the documentary praises Mr. Putin for restoring Stalin’s standing as a great wartime leader and for renewing patriotic pride in"}

In the multi-line graph chart (image4), the lines and points are closely clustered in certain areas, suggesting that there are periods where multiple data points show similar trends or values. This clustering indicates that during these periods, the variables being measured likely experienced similar conditions or influences.\n\n[2] The law of continuity [2] suggests that elements tend to be grouped if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly [7]. Observing the graph, we can see that some lines follow a consistent upward or downward trajectory, indicating a trend over time. For instance, certain lines show a steady increase from June to December, while others fluctuate more irregularly. This continuity helps in identifying stable or changing patterns in the data.\n\n[3] The graph spans from June to December, and by applying these Gestalt principles, we can infer that there are distinct periods of stability and change. For example, the lines that show a consistent upward trend might represent variables that improved or increased over time, while those with more erratic paths could indicate variables with less predictable behavior.\n\n[4] Additionally, the law of similarity [5] can be applied to the colors and line styles, which help differentiate between various data sets. The consistent use of color and line type for each data series aids in perceiving each series as a whole, making it easier to track individual trends over the six months.\n\nIn conclusion, the multi-line graph chart shows trends of both stability and variability over the six months, with some data points and lines indicating consistent increases or decreases, while others fluctuate more irregularly. This suggests that while some variables had predictable changes, others were more influenced by varying factors.\n\n![Trends in the multi-line graph chart over the six months show periods of stability and change, with some lines indicating consistent increases or decreases and others fluctuating irregularly.](image4)"}

However, the image quotes provide visual representations. Image 3 shows a map with red dots indicating volcanoes around the world. This map uses a simple dot density approach to represent the distribution of volcanoes, with red dots scattered across various continents, highlighting areas with higher concentrations.\n\n### Geographical Distribution of Public Libraries in the Netherlands\n\n[2] The text describes maps of public library branches in the Netherlands, layered by province and postal codes. Image 1 shows a screenshot of the Wikidata Query Service interface, where a map option is highlighted, indicating the ability to visualize data geographically. Image 2 and Image 5 display maps with red dots representing public libraries in the Netherlands. These maps are more detailed, showing a high density of red dots concentrated in urban areas, with fewer dots in rural regions, reflecting the distribution of libraries across the country.\n\n### Comparison in Data Presentation\n\n[3] Both types of maps use red dots to represent data points, making them visually similar in terms of color and symbol choice. However, the maps differ in scope and detail. The volcano map in Image 3 covers a global scale, showing a broad distribution across continents, while the public library maps in Image 2 and Image 5 focus on a specific country, the Netherlands, with a more granular view of library locations.\n\n[4] The public library maps provide additional context, such as the ability to filter by province and postal codes, as mentioned in the text. This allows for a more detailed analysis of library distribution within the Netherlands. In contrast, the volcano map offers a general overview without such detailed filtering options.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe geographical distributions of volcanoes globally and public libraries in the Netherlands are visually represented using red dots on maps. While both maps use a similar visual approach, the public library maps in the Netherlands offer more detailed and localized data presentation, allowing for a granular analysis of library distribution within the country, whereas the volcano map provides a broad, global overview of volcanic activity.\n\n![Comparison of data presentation: Volcanoes globally and public libraries in the Netherlands](image3) ![Public libraries in the Netherlands](image2) ![Public libraries"}

According to image2, the adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) increased from 62% in 2005 to 61% in 2006, indicating a slight decline. However, other systems like Bar Coded Medication Management and Computerized Practitioner Order Entry (CPOE) saw significant increases, with CPOE rising from 50% to 52%. This suggests a growing focus on medication safety and order accuracy. Meanwhile, Digital Picture Archiving (PACS) saw a decrease from 42% to 22%, highlighting a potential shift in priorities or challenges in implementing this technology.\n\nIn contrast, image3 reveals that several barriers to implementing IT in healthcare remained consistent or increased during the same period. For instance, the lack of financial support rose from 20% in 2005 to 18% in 2006, and the vendor's inability to effectively deliver products increased from 13% to 17%. These barriers suggest ongoing challenges in resource allocation and vendor reliability, which may have impacted the adoption trends observed.\n\nDespite these barriers, the overall increase in adoption for many systems indicates a push towards more integrated and efficient healthcare IT solutions. The comparison between the adoption trends and barriers highlights the persistent challenges in healthcare IT implementation, such as financial constraints and vendor performance, which need to be addressed to further advance the integration of IT in healthcare.\n\n![Adoption Trends in Healthcare IT from 2005 to 2006](image2)\n![Barriers to Implementing IT in Healthcare from 2005 to 2006](image3)\n\nThe trends in healthcare IT adoption from 2005 to 2006 show an increase in the implementation of systems like Bar Coded Medication Management and CPOE, while facing persistent barriers such as financial support and vendor reliability."}

The following figure shows how heart rate is displayed during an outdoor run.\n\n![Heart rate zones displayed during an outdoor run](image2)\n\n[2] After completing your workout, you can check your average heart rate, maximum heart rate, and heart rate zone on the workout results screen.\n\n[8] ● If you select Maximum heart rate percentage as the calculation method, the heart rate zone for different types of workout activities (Extreme, Anaerobic, Aerobic, Fat-burning, and Warm-up) is calculated based on your maximum heart rate (\"220 – your age\" by default). Heart rate = Maximum heart rate × Maximum heart rate percentage. ● If you select HRR percentage as the calculation method, the heart rate interval for different types of workout activities (Advanced anaerobic, Basic anaerobic, Lactic acid, Advanced aerobic, and Basic aerobic) is calculated based on your heart rate reserve (HRmax - HRrest). Heart rate = Heart rate reserve × Heart rate reserve percentage + Resting heart rate.\n\n[6] During a workout, press the Up button to pause or end the running course, lock the screen, or adjust the volume for prompts during the workout. Press the Down button to switch between screens and view different workout data. (Take Outdoor Run mode as an example. During the workout, you can view a range of data displayed next to Heart rate, Pace, Distance, Time, Steps, Cadence, Total calories, and Total climbing.

Here's how the ECU functions within the engine management system:\n\n1. **Fuel Injection Control**:\n   - The ECU controls the opening of injectors, ensuring precise fuel delivery [1]. This is illustrated in image5, where the ECU receives input from sensors like the mass air flow sensor and throttle position sensor, which then directs fuel to the appropriate injectors.\n\n2. **Ignition Timing Adjustment**:\n   - The ECU adjusts the ignition timing to enhance power and economy [6]. This is part of its broader function to manage engine parameters based on sensor data.\n\n3. **Idle Speed Control**:\n   - The ECU monitors engine RPM through the crankshaft position sensor and controls idle speed using a programmable throttle stop or idle air bypass control step motor [5]. This ensures stable engine operation at idle.\n\n4. **Overall Engine Management**:\n   - As an electronic control unit, the ECU determines fuel, ignition timing, and other parameters for the internal combustion engine [4]. It uses multidimensional maps calculated by sensor devices to make these decisions.\n\n5. **System Integration**:\n   - The ECU integrates with various subsystems, including the fuel supply, fuel metering, and air supply systems, as shown in image2. It receives data from these systems and sends control signals to maintain optimal engine performance.\n\n6. **Sensor Data Utilization**:\n   - The ECU utilizes data from sensors such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, and crankshaft sensor, as depicted in image5. This data helps in making real-time adjustments to engine operation.\n\nIn summary, the ECU is the central processing unit that coordinates and controls the engine's operation by integrating sensor data and adjusting fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed to ensure efficient and effective engine performance.\n\n![The ECU is the central processing unit that coordinates and controls the engine's operation by integrating sensor data and adjusting fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed to ensure efficient and effective engine performance.](image1)"}

The most notable change is the increase in time spent with family and friends from 35% in 2005 to 21% in 2010, while the time spent watching films increased from 20% to 22%. Other activities like shopping, eating out, and reading remained relatively stable or decreased slightly.\n\n- **Image 1** highlights statistics from a training program, showing 425 registered participants from 105 countries, 70,000 minutes watched online, and 2,000 clicks on lecture videos. This indicates a significant global interest in educational content.\n\n### Gestalt Laws Application\n\n- **Proximity** [6]: The data points in Image 2 are grouped by year, allowing us to easily compare changes over time. The proximity of related data points helps in identifying trends, such as the slight increase in film-watching and the decrease in family time.\n\n- **Continuity** [5]: The consistent representation of activities across both years allows for a smooth comparison, showing a gradual shift in preferences.\n\n- **Closure** [10]: The visual representation in Image 2 fills in the gaps between the years, helping us perceive the overall trend despite the absence of intermediate data.\n\n### Linking Trends\n\nThe increase in online engagement in educational content (Image 1) could be linked to the slight increase in time spent watching films (Image 2). Both activities involve screen time and passive consumption of content. The global participation in the training program suggests a growing interest in structured learning, which might have influenced individuals to allocate more time to watching educational videos rather than traditional family activities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in weekend activities, particularly the increase in film-watching, can be linked to the global trend of increased educational participation. The rise in online learning opportunities may have shifted leisure time towards more structured and educational content consumption, reflecting broader societal changes in how people allocate their time.\n\n![Gestalt psychology principles applied to interpret changes in weekend activities and educational trends](image5)"}

The GHSI provides coverage for hospitalization and surgery due to illness, including mental illness, and accidental bodily injury, while the GPAI offers coverage for accidental death, permanent disability, and medical costs from accidents. Eligibility for GHSI includes full-time international students and Singapore permanent residents, and GPAI is available for undergraduates and optional for full-time graduate students [1][3][10].\n\nFor hospitalization, eligible students can use the GHSI scheme. The underwriter of GHSI will prepare a Letter of Guarantee (LOG) that can be presented to the hospital in lieu of a cash deposit, subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance scheme [4]. Students can seek reimbursement for hospitalization fees incurred in Singapore government/restructured hospitals, such as those listed in image1, which includes hospitals like National University Hospital and Singapore General Hospital. The insurance company will review and determine the reimbursed amount based on the scheme’s terms and conditions [10].\n\nIn case of hospitalization, students can also contact the SAO-Student Support for assistance, as being away from home can be especially lonely when ill or hospitalized [6]. The SAO-Student Support is located on level 4 of the Student Services Centre, and contact details are provided in image5, including a 24-hour Campus Security Hotline for emergencies.\n\nFor well-being support, the Student Wellbeing Centre offers professional counseling services, which are free and held in strict confidence. Students can make an appointment at the Centre, located at University Health Service, #02-01, 36 Nanyang Avenue, or call (65) 6790 4462 during office hours [7].

These processes are designed to facilitate a deep understanding of requirements and to adapt to changing stakeholder needs throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n#### Needs Exploration\n\n[8] Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is a process decision framework that emphasizes the importance of understanding and exploring needs early in the project. This is evident in the \"Needs Exploration\" phase, which focuses on gathering and refining requirements to align with business goals. The framework encourages active stakeholder participation through various methods such as high-level requirements specification, split (A/B) testing, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). These methods ensure that stakeholders are directly involved in the development process, providing continuous feedback and ensuring that the solution meets their needs.\n\n![Produce a Potentially Consumable Solution](image2)\n\nThe image above illustrates the \"Produce a Potentially Consumable Solution\" process, highlighting the integration of Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods. Techniques like Just-in-time (JIT) model storming and look-ahead modeling are used to explore and validate requirements, ensuring that the solution is aligned with stakeholder expectations.\n\n#### Elicitation Methods\n\n[1] Facilitates requirements envisioning and modeling, which is crucial for understanding stakeholder needs. Elicitation Methods involve various strategies to gather requirements, such as work item management, prioritization, and change acceptance. These methods help in managing the dynamic nature of stakeholder needs by allowing for flexibility and adaptability.\n\n![Address Changing Stakeholder Needs](image1)\n\nThe image above shows the \"Address Changing Stakeholder Needs\" process, which includes strategies like work item management and stakeholder interaction with the team. Techniques such as active stakeholder participation, either directly or via proxies, and electronic means, ensure that stakeholders remain engaged and their needs are continuously addressed.\n\n#### Stakeholder Interaction\n\n[5] Product owners dealing with complex domains may need support, especially when stakeholders are geographically distributed. This necessitates the use of Business Analysts (BAs) at each location to facilitate effective communication and requirement gathering. The framework supports this by providing structured methods for stakeholder interaction,"}
