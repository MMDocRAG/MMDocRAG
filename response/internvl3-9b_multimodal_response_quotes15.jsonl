Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n**Military Force and Defense Spending:**\n- **Americans** are more likely to believe that military force is sometimes necessary to maintain order in the world. About eight-in-ten Americans agree, compared to only about half of Germans [4]. This reflects a significant difference in attitudes towards the use of military force.\n- **Defense Spending**: Americans are less inclined to think European allies should increase their defense spending. In 2019, 35% of Americans favored an increase, while 50% wanted to keep spending the same, a shift from 2017 when 45% supported increased spending [1]. Germans are divided on this issue, with 40% wanting to increase spending and 41% maintaining current levels [3, 5]. This indicates a more nuanced perspective in Germany compared to the more unified American stance.\n\n**Age Demographics and U.S.-Germany Relations:**\n- **Younger Populations** have more positive views of the U.S.-German relationship. In the U.S., 82% of those aged 18-29 view the relationship positively, compared to 73% of those aged 65 and older [2]. Similarly, in Germany, 34% of young people aged 18-29 see relations as good, compared to only 31% of those aged 65 and older [2].

This difference is also reflected in their stance on NATO's Article 5 obligations, where 60% of Americans support defending allies against Russia, while an equal share of Germans oppose it [9]. \n\nRegarding defense spending, Americans have shifted from advocating for increased spending in 2017 to maintaining current levels in 2019, with 50% supporting this [2]. In contrast, Germans are divided, with 40% wanting to increase spending and 41% maintaining it [10]. Image4 illustrates this shift, showing a decline in American support for increased defense spending over the years.\n\nThe U.S. military presence in Germany is viewed differently too. While 85% of Americans see it as crucial to U.S. security, only half of Germans agree [3], and 45% disagree [5]. Image3 highlights this contrast, showing that 78% of Americans agree, compared to 47% of Germans.\n\nIdeological differences further emphasize these divides.

However, Hispanic rates remain higher than those of non-Hispanic workers, which were at 4.8% in 2015. This is evident in the graph where the Hispanic line consistently stays above the non-Hispanic line, indicating persistent challenges in employment recovery.\n\nEconomic perceptions, as shown in image4, highlight that Hispanics are more optimistic about their financial futures. In 2015, 73% of Hispanics expected their family finances to improve, compared to 61% of the general public. This optimism is supported by the fact that 72% of Hispanic adults believe their children will be better off financially than they are, as seen in image3. Despite this, median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession, remaining at $42,491 in 2014, as shown in image2. This stagnation contrasts with the general public's median income, which has risen to $53,700, indicating a widening income gap.\n\nFurthermore, Hispanic households have experienced a larger percentage decline in net worth compared to other groups, continuing to fall after the recession, as mentioned in text quote [3]. This disparity in wealth accumulation, combined with higher unemployment rates, contributes to ongoing income and wealth disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations.

Those who are highly aware of the concept of automation are more likely to express enthusiasm, with 47% of those who have heard a lot about it being very or somewhat enthusiastic, compared to 30% of those who have heard a little and just 18% of those who have heard nothing. However, this awareness also correlates with higher levels of worry; 76% of highly aware individuals express some level of worry, similar to those with lower awareness (72% and 69%, respectively). \n\nIn terms of expected outcomes, awareness affects perceptions of both positive and negative impacts. Highly aware individuals are more likely to expect negative outcomes, such as increased inequality (76%), while those with lower awareness are less likely to anticipate such outcomes. Positively, awareness does not significantly alter the expectation of increased efficiency (43% of highly aware vs. 56% of less aware), but it does not boost the belief in the creation of many new, well-paying jobs (25% of highly aware vs. 75% of less aware). \n\nThis is supported by the data showing that while awareness increases the likelihood of recognizing the realistic nature of automation, it does not necessarily translate to optimism about job creation. The image data further illustrates these trends, with higher percentages of aware individuals expressing concerns and less optimism about job creation.\n\n![Americans' awareness and perceptions of automation](image3)\n\nIn summary, Americans' awareness of automation leads to a balanced view of both enthusiasm and worry, with higher awareness correlating with greater concern about negative outcomes like inequality, but not necessarily with increased optimism about job creation."}

Image3 supports this by showing that discrimination is a significant factor for both women and blacks/Hispanics, with 39% of women and 27% of blacks/Hispanics citing it as a major reason for their underrepresentation.\n\nFurthermore, the text quotes indicate that women are more inclined to consider work-life balance important, with 49% valuing it compared to 18% of men [7]. This is reflected in image1, which shows that only 18% of respondents prioritize flexibility to balance work/family needs, suggesting that women may face more challenges in balancing these obligations. The text also notes that women are more likely to feel that their gender makes it harder to succeed, with concerns about pay gaps and unequal treatment [3]. Image4 reinforces this by showing that women value jobs that others respect and value, and making a meaningful contribution to society more than men do, which can be influenced by gender stereotypes and discrimination.\n\nThe image2 data on the distribution of STEM majors further illustrates the challenges women face. For instance, in health-related fields, where women are more likely to work, only 38% of women are majoring in health-related fields, compared to 61% of men [5]. This suggests that women may be steered away from these fields due to societal expectations and lack of encouragement from an early age, as highlighted in text quote [4]"}

Additionally, they feel less likely to believe they can succeed in STEM (23%) and face challenges balancing work/family responsibilities (33%).\n\nFor blacks and Hispanics, the main reasons include limited access to quality education (42% of Americans and 73% of blacks in STEM), lack of encouragement (41%), and discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions (27%). There is a significant racial disparity in perceptions, with 72% of blacks in STEM attributing underrepresentation to discrimination, compared to 27% of whites and 28% of Asians.\n\nImage1 highlights these differences, showing that women and blacks/Hispanics both cite discrimination and lack of encouragement as major barriers, but women also emphasize work/family balance and self-doubt, while blacks/Hispanics focus more on educational access and role models.\n\nImage2 and Image3 illustrate the educational pathways, showing that while access to quality education is a concern, the perception of discrimination varies across racial groups and educational levels.\n\nIn summary, while both groups face similar barriers like discrimination and lack of encouragement, women emphasize personal challenges and self-doubt, whereas blacks and Hispanics highlight systemic issues like educational access and role models. ![Major reasons for underrepresentation in STEM jobs](image1)"}

Initially, the system employs a visual encoder to process the input image, generating an image embedding. This embedding is then used to navigate through a previously constructed memory index, which stores multimodal embeddings of images and text descriptions. The system retrieves the top-k categories most similar to the input image based on these embeddings, effectively filtering out less relevant options.\n\nThe retrieved categories serve as a preliminary filter, narrowing down the possibilities to those most likely relevant. However, to refine this initial retrieval and improve accuracy, the system utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ranking. The MLLMs assess the contextual appropriateness of each retrieved class name with the input image, employing advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to make more informed predictions. This ranking process ensures that the final predictions are not only accurate but also contextually aware, enhancing the model's performance in few-shot and zero-shot recognition tasks.\n\nFor object detection tasks, the system takes an additional step by cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing them to a fixed proportion. This pre-processing helps the MLLMs focus on the relevant objects within the image. Furthermore, a blurring technique is applied to non-target areas, directing the model's attention toward the objects of interest and facilitating their identification.\n\nThe integration of retrieval and ranking processes, as illustrated in image3, shows the flow from image encoding to memory retrieval and MLLM ranking, culminating in the predicted label. Image4 provides a detailed flowchart of the pre-processing steps, embedding, and retrieval process, highlighting how the system handles multiple bounding boxes and retrieves relevant categories. The results, as shown in image5, demonstrate the system's effectiveness across various datasets, achieving higher accuracy in fine-grained visual recognition and few-shot image classification tasks.\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects by efficiently encoding and storing embeddings, retrieving relevant categories, and leveraging MLLMs for contextually aware ranking, all while employing specific pre-processing techniques tailored for object detection tasks.

For coreference resolution, the multitask system scores 58.0, which is higher than the single-task score of 55.3. \n\nIncluding coreference links significantly benefits precision and recall. Image1 illustrates that the system with coreference links maintains higher precision across varying pseudo-recall percentages. Image6 highlights that the knowledge graph with coreference links has a higher recall, as evidenced by the precision/recall curves, where the curve with coreference links remains above the one without.

For example, GloVe without R-GCN results in a 8.0-point decrease in accuracy on the unmasked validation set, as shown in image2. This highlights the importance of the R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relations, even without accessing context.\n\n- **Relation Types**: The ablation study shows that removing relation types (No relation types in image1) results in marginal improvements over ELMo alone. This suggests that a GCN operating over a naive entity graph does not add much value, indicating the need for a more informative graph construction and sophisticated parameterization.\n\n- **Specific Relation Types**: The ablation of DOC-BASED, MATCH, and COREF relations shows that the model relies heavily on DOC-BASED connections, as removing them leads to a drop in performance. MATCH and COREF have a marginal impact, likely because MATCH captures easy coreference cases, and COREF may not be reliable out-of-domain.

The output layer, being more task-specific, provides less benefit. Specifically, the transfer of the embedding layer is particularly helpful on datasets D3 and D4, where the label distribution is extremely unbalanced, and sentiment information is not adequately captured by GloVe word embeddings alone. This is evident from the higher improvements observed in these datasets when the embedding layer is transferred.\n\nWhen varying the percentage of document-level training examples, as shown in image3, there is a clear trend of increasing accuracy and macro-F1 scores with more document-level data. For datasets D1 and D2, improvements are stable across all percentages. However, for datasets D3 and D4, there is a sharp increase in macro-F1 scores when the percentage of document-level examples reaches 0.4. This suggests that the model benefits more from document-level knowledge in datasets with smaller neutral examples, as these datasets have a more significant impact on macro-F1 scores due to their small neutral class sizes.\n\nIn summary, the model's performance is enhanced by transferring the LSTM and embedding layers, with the most significant gains observed on datasets D3 and D4. Increasing the percentage of document-level training examples consistently improves performance, with notable gains in macro-F1 scores for D3 and D4 at higher percentages.\n\n![Performance Trends](image3)"}

For instance, in the restaurant domain, TRADE achieves a joint accuracy of 65.35%, significantly higher than the 49.12% of SpanPtr [8].\n\nIn zero-shot settings, TRADE's ability to adapt to unseen domains without forgetting previously learned ones is highlighted. Image3 illustrates that TRADE achieves a remarkable joint accuracy of 60.58% in one of the zero-shot domains, showcasing its effectiveness in handling new domains [3]. This adaptability is crucial for practical applications where models need to generalize across diverse domains.\n\nFurthermore, image4 provides a visual representation of the model's performance across different slots, indicating its robustness in handling various types of information across domains.

For instance, [2] mentions that comparison questions often require multi-hop reasoning, which is not effectively handled by single-paragraph models like BERT, as shown in [8] where BERT achieves near chance accuracy on these types of questions. This is further supported by [9], which states that retraining on adversarial distractors improves accuracy from 46.84 F1 to 60.10 F1, indicating that adversarial training can enhance performance.\n\nImage 4 provides a table showing the impact of training data on F1 scores. When training on adversarial distractors, the F1 score improves from 46.84 to 60.10 on the adversarial data, demonstrating the effectiveness of adversarial training. However, when evaluated on original data, the F1 score drops to 59.12, suggesting that adversarial training may lead to overfitting on the adversarial data.\n\nImage 5 lists types of questions and their percentages, showing that multi-hop questions (27%) and weak distractors (35%) are significant challenges. This aligns with the text's emphasis on the need for improved distractor collection and retrieval methods, as mentioned in [4] and [5].\n\nImage 3 categorizes questions into multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop, with F1 scores of 54.46, 56.16, and 70.54 respectively. This indicates that single-hop questions are easier for the model, while multi-hop and context-dependent questions require more sophisticated reasoning.\n\nIn summary, the text and images collectively show that adversarial training can improve multi-hop performance but may lead to overfitting.

By negating claims and inverting labels, the authors eliminated statistical cues that models like BERT exploited, leading to a substantial drop in performance. Initially, BERT achieved a peak accuracy of 77% on the original ARCT dataset, which was just three points below the untrained human baseline. However, when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance plummeted to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median accuracy at 50%. This reduction indicates that BERT's initial success was largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuine comprehension of the arguments. The adversarial dataset, by mirroring distributions around both labels, provides a more robust evaluation, revealing that BERT has not truly learned argument comprehension. The results underscore the importance of controlling for spurious statistics in NLP tasks to ensure models are assessing meaningful understanding rather than superficial patterns. This finding highlights the need for future research to focus on eliminating such biases and developing models that can truly comprehend arguments.\n\n![BERT's performance on adversarial dataset](image4)\n\n**Conclusion:** BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset reveals that its initial success on ARCT was due to exploiting statistical cues, not genuine argument comprehension."}

This indicates that while greedy decoding produces high-quality inferences, it still has a 10% relative performance gap compared to human evaluation, as noted in text quote [7].\n\nRegarding the effect of training data percentages on the model's metrics, image3 provides insights. With only 10% of the training data, the model achieves a BLEU-2 score of 12.72 and N/T o of 58.34, which are significantly lower than the full training data results (BLEU-2: 14.34, N/T o: 50.05).

However, total customer relationships declined, as shown in image1, indicating a shift in customer base or service offerings. The Media segment's revenue growth was bolstered by Peacock's expansion and distribution revenue increases, while the Studios segment benefited from full production capacity. The Theme Parks segment saw a substantial recovery with the reopening of parks and the Beijing opening. Despite these gains, expenses decreased in 2021 due to cost savings from COVID-19 measures, as detailed in [5], and increased in 2022 due to new initiatives like Sky Glass and XClass TV. The financial performance was thus a mix of revenue growth and cost management, with strategic investments in content and technology shaping the future outlook.\n\n![Revenue and Customer Relationships Trends](image1) ![Average Revenue per Customer](image2)\n\nIn summary, NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2019 to 2021 was characterized by revenue growth driven by market recovery and strategic initiatives, offset by declines in customer relationships and increased expenses due to new investments."}

This increase is evident in image2, which shows a rise in credit risk RWA from $342,684 million in 2019 to $387,066 million in 2020 under the Standardized Approach and from $228,927 million to $284,930 million under the Advanced Approach. The increase in RWA reflects greater risk exposure, which typically requires more capital to maintain regulatory requirements.\n\nSecondly, **External TLAC** as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, as shown in image5. This reduction indicates a decrease in the proportion of TLAC relative to the institution's risk-weighted assets. The TLAC requirement is crucial for ensuring the institution has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity. The decrease might suggest a shift in capital allocation or changes in the composition of TLAC-eligible instruments, which could impact the institution's ability to absorb potential losses.\n\nThe interplay between these changes highlights the institution's need to manage its risk exposure and capital adequacy effectively. The increase in credit risk RWA necessitates higher capital buffers, while the decrease in TLAC as a percentage of RWA may require adjustments in capital management strategies to maintain compliance with regulatory standards.\n\n![Changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC](image2) and ![External TLAC as a % of RWA](image5) illustrate these changes, emphasizing the importance of monitoring both risk exposure and capital adequacy in maintaining a robust financial structure.\n\nIn conclusion, the financial institution's overall capital structure was affected by the need to increase capital to cover higher credit risk exposures and adjust TLAC composition to maintain regulatory compliance."}

This is evident in image1, which shows a significant drop in net interest income across various segments like Consumer Banking and Consumer Lending. The decrease was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, as well as the deployment of excess deposits into securities.\n\n- **Net Interest Expense Changes**: Image4 highlights the net change in interest income and expenses, showing a decrease in interest income due to lower rates and an increase in interest expenses, particularly in U.S. interest-bearing deposits and savings. This reflects the broader economic impact of lower rates on the bank's earnings.\n\n- **Organizational Segments**: Image2 provides a breakdown of Bank of America's segments, including Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other. The Consumer Banking segment, which saw a significant drop in net interest income, is a major part of the organizational structure, indicating its impact on overall financial performance.\n\n- **Efficiency and Capital Allocation**: Image5 shows the average yield and balance for various assets, indicating how the bank manages its interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The decrease in net interest income is also reflected in the lower net interest spread, impacting the bank's profitability.\n\n- **Strategic Adjustments**: The bank's strategic adjustments, such as deploying excess deposits into securities, are part of its response to lower interest rates, as mentioned in text quote [1].

This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates on the company's substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, as mentioned in text quote [6]. The image2 table provides a detailed breakdown of investment income components, showing a significant drop in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a decrease of 44.4%. Dividend income also decreased from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, a 3.5% increase, but this was not enough to offset the decline in interest income.

The increase in equity securities could be a response to seeking higher returns despite the volatility, while the decrease in fixed maturity securities suggests a reduced reliance on fixed-income investments.

In the upstream segment, the U.S. operations saw a recovery from a loss in 2020 to a profit of $7.3 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher crude oil realizations and asset sales gains. International upstream operations also improved, reporting a profit of $8.5 billion in 2021 after a loss in 2020. These improvements were driven by factors such as the absence of impairments and write-offs, higher sales volumes, and favorable foreign currency effects. However, the downstream segment faced challenges, with the U.S. downstream earnings increasing from a loss in 2020 to $2.4 billion in 2021, mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales and earnings from CPChem. International downstream operations, however, saw a decline from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021, primarily due to lower margins and higher operating expenses. The overall net income attributable to Chevron Corporation improved from a loss in 2019 to $15,625 million in 2021, reflecting the combined performance of both segments.

In contrast, the Global Business Services segment had an external gross profit of $4.655 billion and a pre-tax income of $1.623 billion, with a gross profit margin of 27.7% and a pre-tax margin of 9.5%. The decline in margins for Cloud & Cognitive Software was attributed to purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, ongoing investments in strategic areas, and lower income from IP partnership agreements. For Global Business Services, the flat revenue was driven by strong growth in consulting services, particularly in cognitive technology and data platform services, application modernization, and AI-driven enterprise applications. The decline in traditional application management engagements was offset by growth in cloud application development and modernization. Both segments showed improvements in adjusted for currency terms, highlighting the impact of currency fluctuations on reported figures.\n\n![Comparison of Financial Metrics](image2) ![Global Business Services Financials](image4)\n\nThe external gross profit and pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software were significantly higher than those for Global Business Services in 2019.

According to the provided text quotes and images, PMI's total shipment volume in Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.6% to 64.2 billion units in 2020, excluding the impact of the RBH deconsolidation. This decline is attributed to factors such as adult smoker down-trading to ultra-low-price brands, retail out-of-stock issues, and the pandemic's effect on consumption patterns. \n\nImage3 illustrates that PMI's shipment volumes for cigarettes decreased by 11.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, while heated tobacco units saw a substantial increase of 50.8%. The total shipment volume for Latin America & Canada also decreased by 11.6%, reflecting the broader market challenges faced by PMI in these regions.\n\nFinancially, the net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to unfavorable currency movements and higher working capital requirements.

This growth was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory fees, as well as lower provision for credit losses due to improved economic conditions. However, net interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and loan balances.\n\nThe selected balance sheet data shows that total loans decreased from $379,766 million in 2019 to $333,885 million in 2021, a reduction of $45,881 million or 12%. This decline was primarily due to paydowns exceeding originations and actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain mortgage originations. Total deposits increased from $48,000 million in 2019 to $834,739 million in 2021, a rise of $786,739 million or 1,633%, driven by higher consumer liquidity and savings from government stimulus programs and economic uncertainty.\n\n![Net income and balance sheet data evolution](image3) shows the detailed financial metrics over the years, highlighting the changes in revenue, expenses, and key financial ratios.

According to the provided text quotes, net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. The net interest expense also decreased, contributing to a narrower net interest spread. The main contributing factors include the decline in interest rates, which reduced net interest income, and the reduction in interest expenses, which helped mitigate the spread narrowing. Image 5 provides a detailed breakdown of the average balances and yields for various interest-earning assets and liabilities, illustrating the impact of these factors on the net interest spread.

According to the provided text quotes, in 2020, the company recognized $25 million in restructuring charges primarily for severance and benefit costs associated with the Embedded Processing business [5]. This is a notable increase from the $15 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2019 [1]. Additionally, the restructuring charges were recorded as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment [8].\n\nIn terms of operating profit, the restructuring charges directly affected the operating results. In 2020, the operating profit was $1,688 million, which included the $25 million in restructuring charges [3]. This is a decrease from the $1,735 million operating profit in 2019, where restructuring charges were not explicitly mentioned but were part of the $1,380 million operating profit [3]. The impact of these charges is further illustrated in the quarterly financial data, where the second quarter of 2020 saw a restructuring charge of $24 million, which was not present in the same quarter of 2019 [3].\n\nThe image quotes provide additional context.

According to the provided text quotes and images, the increase in RWA was primarily driven by an increase in Derivatives exposures and Investment securities, as well as Lending commitments and Equity investments. Specifically, the text mentions that credit risk RWA increased due to market volatility and the E*TRADE acquisition, while market risk RWA increased due to higher market volatility. Image 3 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes, showing that credit risk RWA increased from $342,684 million in 2019 to $51,493 million in 2020 under the Standardized Approach, and from $228,927 million to $51,597 million under the Advanced Approach. Market risk RWA remained relatively stable at $8,578 million in both years.\n\nThe image also shows that Total RWA increased from $453,106 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020. Despite the increase in RWA, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. This decrease is likely due to the increase in RWA outpacing the growth in TLAC.

This reflects the disparate impacts of the pandemic on different regions, with the U.S. showing resilience due to strategic marketing investments and growth in delivery, as noted in [4]. In contrast, the International Operated Markets faced more severe challenges, including temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly in countries like France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain, as highlighted in [3]. The company's support for marketing and incentives to franchisees, such as the free Thank You Meals, aimed to accelerate recovery but also contributed to higher costs and reduced margins, as seen in [1] and [2]. The overall revenue decline was further exacerbated by incremental COVID-19 expenses and lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses, as detailed in [5]. The pie charts in image4 illustrate the shift in revenue distribution, showing a slight decrease in the U.S. share from 54% in 2019 to 50% in 2020, while the International Operated Markets' share increased from 37% to 41%, indicating a shift in focus towards international markets.

This decline was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which offset the increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by $170.1 billion or 8.8%. The decrease in net interest income was further exacerbated by the reduction in interest income associated with the lower yield on AIEA and higher interest expenses.\n\nThe image quotes provide a detailed breakdown of these financial metrics. Image2 shows that net interest income for the year ended 2020 was $27,578 million, down from $30,462 million in 2019, reflecting the decrease in interest income. Image3 illustrates the changes in interest expenses, where the average interest expense on customer accounts increased from $14,178 million in 2019 to $14,978 million in 2020, contributing to the higher interest expenses. Image5 provides a summary of the consolidated income statement, showing that net operating income for 2020 was $50,429 million, down from $53,342 million in 2019, indicating a decline in profitability.\n\nThe decrease in net interest income, coupled with higher interest expenses, led to a reduction in net operating income, which in turn affected the overall profitability. The organization's profit for the year in 2020 was $2,756 million, a decrease from $3,898 million in 2019, as shown in image5. This decline highlights the adverse impact of the lower interest rates and increased expenses on the organization's financial performance.\n\n![Net operating income decline](image5)"}

According to the provided text quotes and images, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020. This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Reduction in Valuation Allowance**: The valuation allowance decreased by $1 million in 2020, as noted in text quote [8]. This reduction directly increased the net deferred tax asset.\n\n2. **Impact of Uncertain Tax Positions**: The impact of changes in uncertain tax positions was a $2.5 million tax benefit in 2020, as shown in image1.

For coal, the report highlights that lower prices and volumes led to a decrease in Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million, with controllable cash costs rising due to increased maintenance expenses and stripping volumes. Image2 provides a detailed breakdown of revenue and average realized prices for metallurgical and hard coking coal, showing a decline in prices from FY2020 to FY2021.

Image1 illustrates the impact of a US$1/lb increase in nickel prices on profit, showing a US$1 million increase in both Continuing operations and Underlying EBITDA. The key drivers behind these impacts include market price fluctuations, which affect cash flows and asset values, as well as operational factors like maintenance costs and volume changes. Additionally, the report mentions the uncertainty regarding coal imports into China, which affects medium-term guidance, and the rebound in nickel prices due to strong demand and supply disruptions.

According to the provided text quotes, retained earnings decreased from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021, indicating a reduction of $807 million. This decline suggests that the company's net income was not sufficient to fully offset dividends and other distributions. Additionally, other comprehensive income (loss) saw a significant decrease from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021, reflecting a loss of $50 million. This loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized gains/losses on debt securities and pension benefits. The image quotes provide a detailed breakdown of these components, showing that foreign currency translation adjustments alone contributed to a loss of $(2,392) million in 2021, compared to $(2,229) million in 2020. These adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and can impact the company's overall financial position by affecting its equity without directly impacting earnings. The combined effect of these changes resulted in a decrease in total shareholders' equity from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021, highlighting a reduction in the company's equity base.

This schedule is crucial for understanding the timeline and conditions under which shares vest. \n\nText quote [4] specifies that, except as provided under the Award Terms, the restricted share units vest in full on or prior to the 30th day of the third month after the end of the third full year (March 30, 2023), provided the employee remains continuously employed. This indicates a standard vesting period of three years, contingent on continued employment.\n\nAdditionally, [2] and [6] highlight that Activision Blizzard has the discretion to adjust performance objectives for unvested shares by substituting or prorating objectives across business units. This flexibility allows the company to adapt the vesting conditions based on performance criteria, ensuring alignment with company goals.\n\nImage3 provides a detailed breakdown of the vesting schedule, showing how the number of restricted share units vests each year based on performance factors.

Initially, in 1998, the majority of investments were concentrated in the early stage, as depicted in image1, where the early stage (orange) and mid-stage (blue) sections were substantial. However, by 2007, as shown in image1, there was a noticeable shift towards mid-stage investments, with the mid-stage section becoming the largest component, indicating a shift in focus towards more mature companies. This change is supported by the text quote [4], which mentions that the scarcity of VC money has led to lower entry valuations and higher capital efficiency, allowing investors to be more selective and focus on later-stage investments. The image2 further illustrates this trend by showing a decline in early-stage investments over time, with the 2007 fund having a much smaller early-stage component compared to the 1998 and 2000 funds. Additionally, image5 highlights the increasing trend in later-stage investments over the years, aligning with the shift towards more mature companies. This shift reflects the evolving dynamics in the European venture capital landscape, where investors are adapting to the scarcity of capital by targeting more established companies with higher potential returns. ![The distribution of investment stages shifted from a focus on early stages in 1998 to a greater emphasis on mid-stage investments by 2007, as shown in image1 and supported by the text quote [4].](image1)\n\n![The decline in early-stage investments and the rise in later-stage investments over time are illustrated in image2 and image5, reflecting the adaptation to capital scarcity and selective investment strategies in the European venture capital market.](image2)"}

In contrast, third or higher generation Hispanics show a notable decline, with only 30% saying the same. This trend is visually represented in image1, which illustrates that as generational distance from immigrant roots increases, the perception of a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood decreases. Additionally, image5 further highlights this trend by showing that 64% of self-identified Hispanics perceive their neighborhoods as predominantly Hispanic, while only 16% of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry do so. This suggests that closer ties to immigrant experiences are associated with a stronger sense of Hispanic neighborhood identity.

The chart shows a sharp drop in investment amounts from €2177 million in 2002 to €345 million in 2004, followed by further declines in subsequent years. This trend aligns with the text quote [7], which states that the supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004, leading to a major gap in the supply of venture capital compared to the availability of deals. The image highlights the contraction in funding, illustrating the reduced capital flow into early-stage ventures post-2004, which contributed to the scarcity of VC money in Europe as mentioned in text quote [3]. This scarcity not only led to lower entry valuations but also increased capital efficiency and yield due to the selective nature of investors in the limited funding environment.\n\n![Decline in Early-Stage VC Fundraising](image2)\n\nThe decline in funding after 2004 created a demand-supply imbalance, as shown in image1, where the immediate drop in venture deal flow by 50% and the exit boom starting in 2005 drove up demand, further exacerbating the supply gap. This period marked a critical phase in the European VC landscape, where the maturation of the ecosystem and the exit activity of top-tier funds began to improve performance, as evidenced by text quote [5] and the recent exits in German venture capital mentioned in text quote [1]. Despite the challenges, the European VC industry has shown resilience, with strong firms emerging from the post-bubble struggle, as noted in text quote [8]. The limited visibility and prejudiced industry statistics in Europe, as discussed in text quote [4], also contributed to the underrepresentation of European VC funds in global databases, affecting the perception and data availability.\n\nIn summary, the early-stage VC fundraising in Europe significantly decreased after 2004, leading to a supply-demand imbalance and increased capital efficiency, while the industry's performance improved over time, particularly in post-bubble vintages."}

By 2015, this concern had dramatically shifted, with 56% expressing greater concern that policies had not gone far enough to protect the country, compared to only 28% who were concerned about civil liberties being restricted too much. This change is evident in the Pew Research Center data, which shows a notable increase in the share of Americans worried about insufficient protection, particularly among Republicans, who saw a rise from 55% in 2004 to 71% in 2015. The graph in image3 illustrates this trend, highlighting the peak in concern about insufficient protection in 2015. Additionally, image4 shows that Republicans consistently had higher concerns about insufficient protection compared to Democrats and Independents, with a significant increase over the years. The shift is also reflected in image5, which compares the concerns across different political affiliations, showing a widening gap between Republicans and Democrats regarding the adequacy of anti-terror policies. This change in public opinion is likely influenced by events such as the revelations of NSA surveillance and the rise of ISIS, as indicated by the data from 2013 onwards.\n\n![Public concern about anti-terror policies](image3)\n\n**Answer:** Public opinion shifted from 49% concerned about policies going too far in 2004 to 56% concerned about insufficient protection by 2015, with Republicans showing the most significant increase."}

For high-resource languages like GL and PT, pre-training yields consistent gains of around 3 BLEU points. However, for extremely low-resource languages such as BE and RU, the gains are minimal or even negative, indicating that pre-training is more effective when the baseline system is already moderately effective. For instance, in the GL/PT pair, pre-training achieves a substantial 11 BLEU point increase, highlighting its utility in bootstrapping models near the threshold of producing reasonable translations. Image1 shows that aligning word embeddings can further enhance performance, especially for low-resource languages like RU, where the BLEU score increases from 21.1 to 21.4. Image4 illustrates that pre-training is particularly beneficial for distant language pairs, such as HE/PT, where it boosts the BLEU score from 3.0 to 11.9, underscoring its role in improving translations of less frequent concepts. Image2 demonstrates that pre-training's effectiveness diminishes as training data size increases, suggesting it is most impactful when data is scarce. Overall, pre-training is most effective for low-resource languages with a moderate baseline performance, aligning with the hypothesis that systems with more room for improvement benefit more from pre-training.\n\n![The table shows BLEU scores for aligned and unaligned datasets, highlighting that aligning word embeddings improves scores for low-resource languages like RU and HE.](image1)\n\n![The graph illustrates that pre-training's impact on BLEU scores decreases with larger training set sizes, emphasizing its utility in low-resource scenarios.](image2)\n\n![The table reveals significant BLEU score improvements for distant language pairs like HE/PT, demonstrating pre-training's effectiveness in handling less frequent concepts.](image3)\n\n![The table highlights that pre-training boosts BLEU scores more for distant language pairs, such as HE/PT, compared to similar language pairs like ES/PT.](image4)"}

The integration of external feedback enables more transparent and explainable corrections, addressing issues like hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxicity, as highlighted in [4] and [6]. The strategy is particularly effective in tasks requiring factual accuracy, as seen in summarization and open-ended generation, where external knowledge sources play a crucial role in ensuring output quality. This method is also supported by recent advancements in techniques like FACTOOL, which extends beyond text generation to include code and scientific literature reviews, as noted in [6]. Overall, the use of external feedback in post-hoc correction facilitates a more flexible and informative refinement process, improving the reliability and accuracy of the final outputs.\n\n![Enhancing Output Refinement with External Feedback](image1)\n\nThe 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances output refinement by leveraging external models or tools to provide detailed, natural language feedback, allowing for more transparent and explainable corrections."}

This method starts with a broad overview and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the tree layers. The process is detailed in [9], where adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and number of nodes \\(k\\) allows control over the specificity and breadth of retrieved information.\n\nIn contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval, as explained in [3] and [8], evaluates nodes collectively across all layers simultaneously. This approach flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, allowing all nodes to be compared at the same level. This method is depicted in image2, where the collapsed tree structure is shown, enabling the retrieval of information at the correct granularity for a given question.\n\nThe performance comparison in image5 illustrates that Collapsed Tree Retrieval consistently outperforms Tree Traversal Retrieval across different context lengths, indicating its superior ability to retrieve relevant information efficiently.\n\n**Answer:** Tree Traversal Retrieval selects nodes layer-by-layer, starting broad and focusing on details, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates nodes collectively across all layers, flattening the tree for simultaneous comparison.

The process starts with a query, retrieves relevant documents, generates a response, and then judges the response. If the response doesn't meet the criteria, the process iterates by retrieving more context and generating again. This method is suitable for scenarios where additional context is needed to refine the search.\n\n- **Recursive Retrieval** (also depicted in `image5`) breaks down complex problems into steps. It retrieves information, generates a response, and then decomposes the query further to retrieve additional information. This process continues until a maximum depth or threshold is reached. It is useful for handling intricate queries that require step-by-step refinement.\n\n- **Adaptive Retrieval** (illustrated in `image5`) offers flexible and active control over retrieval and generation. It retrieves information on demand, transforms or decomposes the query, generates a response, and judges it. If necessary, it retrieves more information or generates special tokens. This approach allows for dynamic adjustments based on the query's needs, making it adaptable to various scenarios.\n\nEach method addresses different aspects of information retrieval, with iterative providing context, recursive breaking down complexities, and adaptive offering flexibility.\n\n![{Conclusion}](image5)"}

However, when the model is tested in the open-domain setting without gold paragraphs, the F1 score drops to 38.40, as seen in [3] and [5].

As shown in Figure 4, without repetition control, the model achieves a 97.72% question-asking rate at z=10. However, when repetition control is introduced, this rate drops to 79.67%. To address this issue, an additional setting (z=10 with boost) was introduced, which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams by disabling the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`. This adjustment restores the question-asking rate to 99.54%, albeit at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition. This demonstrates that repetition control can hinder the model's ability to generate questions effectively, necessitating specific adjustments to maintain high engagingness.\n\n![Effect of Repetition Control on Question-Asking Rate](image4)\n\nThe graph in image4 illustrates the decline in question-asking rates when repetition control is applied, highlighting the need for the boost setting to counteract this effect."}

Initially, BERT achieves a peak performance of 77% on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT), which is surprisingly close to the average untrained human baseline. However, this performance is largely attributed to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset rather than genuine comprehension skills. \n\nText Quote [1] highlights that BERT's performance is entirely accounted for by these cues, and this is further supported by Table 3 in the text, which shows that by considering warrants alone (W), BERT achieves 71% accuracy. Adding reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) accounts for the remaining six points, leading to the peak performance of 77%. This analysis is crucial for understanding that BERT's performance is not indicative of true argument comprehension.\n\nImage1 provides a detailed table comparing BERT's performance with other models like BoV and BiLSTM. It shows that BERT's mean test accuracy is 0.671 ± 0.09, with a median of 0.712 and a maximum of 0.770. This indicates variability in performance across different runs, with some runs failing to train properly, as noted in Text Quote [8]. The median is a more reliable measure of BERT's average performance, which is 0.712, still below the peak performance of 77%.\n\nImage4 illustrates the impact of the adversarial dataset on BERT's performance. When models are trained and evaluated on this adversarial dataset, which eliminates the major source of spurious cues, BERT's performance drops significantly to a mean of 0.504 ± 0.01, a median of 0.505, and a maximum of 0.533. This reduction to essentially random accuracy confirms that the adversarial dataset successfully removes the exploitable cues, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension.\n\nText Quote [3] explains that by adding a copy of each data point with the claim negated and the label inverted, the distribution of statistical cues in the warrants is mirrored over both labels, eliminating the signal.

In the F1 generation, all plants exhibit the dominant trait (purple flowers) because they are heterozygous (Pp) for the flower color gene. When these F1 plants self-pollinate, the alleles segregate during gamete formation, resulting in a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation: three-quarters of the plants have purple flowers (PP and Pp), and one-quarter have white flowers (pp). The genotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with 1 homozygous dominant (PP), 2 heterozygous (Pp), and 1 homozygous recessive (pp) plants. This pattern arises because the dominant allele (P) masks the expression of the recessive allele (p) in heterozygous individuals, while only the homozygous recessive plants express the recessive trait. The inheritance of these alleles follows the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment, ensuring that each gamete receives one allele from each parent, leading to the observed ratios in the F2 generation. ![Mendelian inheritance](image4)"}

The F1 generation, resulting from this cross, all exhibit purple flowers (Pp). In the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower. This is due to the segregation of alleles during meiosis, as detailed in text quote [2], where homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis I, and sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, maintaining the chromosome number.\n\nImage Quote 4 illustrates the genetic makeup and gametes produced in this cross. The F2 generation shows a genotypic ratio of 1 PP (homozygous dominant), 2 Pp (heterozygous), and 1 pp (homozygous recessive). This is visually represented in the diagram, showing the combination of gametes leading to these genotypes.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio of 3:1 is a classic result of Mendelian inheritance, where the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p), resulting in the majority of offspring expressing the dominant trait. The genotypic ratio reflects the possible combinations of alleles in the F2 generation, demonstrating the segregation and independent assortment of alleles.\n\n![Phenotypic and Genotypic Ratios](image4) shows the visual representation of the F2 generation's genetic outcomes, confirming the expected ratios.\n\nIn conclusion, the F2 generation exhibits a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple flowers to 1 white flower and a genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp."}

This approach often overlooks the impact of earlier touchpoints in the customer journey, such as navigational searches or other advertising media that may have influenced the final conversion. As highlighted in text quote [2], this method can lead to an inaccurate assessment of campaign performance because it attributes the majority of credit to the last interaction, which is often not the initial source of interest or exposure. For instance, [8] mentions that 64% of Paid Search clicks are navigational, indicating that these clicks are from users already familiar with the brand, having been exposed to other marketing efforts beforehand. This oversight can result in a significant misallocation of budget and resources, as evidenced by [7], where only 30% of marketers use media mix modeling to understand the incremental impact of specific media and activities.

For instance, the lead-to-Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) conversion rate is 52.07%, MQL-to-Sales Accepted Lead (SAL) is 1.50%, SAL-to-Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) is 83.08%, and SQL-to-Sales Won Opportunity (SWO) is 6.67%. These rates reflect the efficiency of each step in converting leads into potential sales.\n\nIn image3, the marketing diagnostics provide benchmarks for these conversion rates. For example, the typical range for MQL conversion is 4% to 8%, SAL conversion is 45% to 75%, and SQL conversion is 45% to 60%. Comparing these benchmarks with the actual rates in image4, we see that the MQL conversion rate (52.07%) is within the higher end of the typical range, indicating strong performance at this stage. The SAL conversion rate (1.50%) is significantly lower than the typical range, suggesting a potential bottleneck or issue in the qualification process. The SQL conversion rate (83.08%) is at the higher end of the typical range, indicating effective qualification. The SWO conversion rate (6.67%) is also within the typical range, showing a reasonable progression to sales opportunities.\n\nBy analyzing these rates against the benchmarks, marketers can identify areas for improvement. For instance, the low MQL-to-SAL conversion rate may indicate that leads are not being properly qualified, which could be addressed through better lead nurturing or qualification criteria. Overall, the conversion rates in the lead funnel progression align with the average conversion rates provided in marketing diagnostics, offering insights into the effectiveness of each stage in the sales process.\n\n![Comparison of conversion rates](image4)"}

Reporting, as depicted in image1, serves as the foundational step, providing descriptive insights through reports, dashboards, and alerts. It focuses on what has happened, offering backward-looking data without context. This is essential for understanding historical trends and current states, which is crucial for making informed decisions. However, reporting alone does not drive action or impact.\n\nAnalysis, as shown in image4, builds upon reporting by transforming data into actionable insights. It involves forward-looking inquiries, raising questions about why something happened and what might happen next. Analysis moves beyond mere reporting by combining data and information to generate insights, recommendations, and storytelling. This step is critical for identifying patterns, predicting future trends, and suggesting actions that can lead to value creation.\n\nThe progression from business intelligence to business analytics, illustrated in image3, emphasizes the increasing complexity and strategic importance of these steps. Business intelligence relies on standard reports and ad-hoc queries to understand past performance, while business analytics incorporates predictive modeling and optimization to anticipate future outcomes. This progression highlights the shift from reactive to proactive decision-making, where analysis becomes a catalyst for strategic actions that drive business value.\n\nIn summary, reporting provides the necessary context and data to understand the past, while analysis transforms this data into insights that inform future actions. Together, they form a critical part of the analytics value chain, enabling organizations to move from understanding what happened to predicting and influencing what will happen, ultimately driving business success. ![Analytical Leaders](image2) emphasizes the leadership role in fostering a culture that values data-driven decision-making, further enhancing the impact of these processes."}
