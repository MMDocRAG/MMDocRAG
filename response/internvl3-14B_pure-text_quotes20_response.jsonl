However, the text does not provide a direct percentage for Democrats following news very closely. \n\nGiven the closest available data, we use the general finding from image4 that Liberals follow the subject the most closely at 62% NET.

Therefore, if half of Indians had debit cards, the number of debit card users would be 650 million. \n\nTo find the percentage of debit card users among internet users, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of debit card users among internet users} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of debit card users}}{\\text{Number of internet users}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\left( \\frac{650 \\text{ million}}{330 \\text{ million}} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 197\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, this percentage exceeds 100%, which is not possible. This discrepancy suggests that the 50% figure refers to the total population, not just internet users. Therefore, the percentage of debit card users among internet users would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of debit card users among internet users} = \\left( \\frac{650 \\text{ million}}{1.3 \\text{ billion}} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, in 2016, when there were 330 million internet users, approximately 50% of the total population were debit card users.\n\n![Internet Juggernaut](image1)\n\n**Answer:** In 2016, when there were 330 million internet users, approximately 50% of Indians were debit card users."}

In Europe, there is a noted scarcity of VC money, which has driven up capital efficiency and yield due to selective investors [1]. Additionally, the European venture capital industry is characterized by a lack of private investors, such as pension and endowment funds, which are more prevalent in the U.S. [4]. This scarcity and lack of institutional investors might influence the investment trends in Europe compared to the U.S.\n\nThe images provide specific data on investment trends. Image4 shows median European investments from 2004 to 2009, with the \"Later\" stage investments peaking around 2007-2008, while other stages show less variation. This suggests that later-stage investments in Europe experienced significant activity during this period. In contrast, image6 illustrates median U.S. investments from 2004 to 2009, showing a peak in investment activities around 2006-2007 across all stages, followed by a decline by 2009. This indicates a similar peak in later-stage investments but also highlights a more pronounced decline in later stages compared to Europe.\n\nComparing the two regions, both experienced peaks in later-stage investments around 2006-2007, but the U.S. saw a sharper decline post-peak. This could be attributed to the differences in market maturity and investor confidence between the two regions. The U.S. market, with more established funds and higher visibility, might have experienced more volatility in response to market conditions. Meanwhile, Europe's later-stage investments, despite the scarcity of funds, maintained a relatively stable trend, possibly due to the selective nature of available capital.\n\nIn summary, while both regions saw peaks in later-stage investments around 2006-2007, the U.S. experienced a more significant decline post-peak, likely influenced by its larger and more mature market dynamics. Europe's later-stage investments remained relatively stable, reflecting the selective and efficient use of scarce capital.\n\n![Comparison of median investments in Europe and the U.S. from 2004 to 2009](image4) ![Comparison of median investments in the U.S. from 20"}

This suggests a shift in Democratic views over time. Image4 shows trends in political affiliation from 2004 to 2015, indicating changes in approval ratings among Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, which could reflect evolving perceptions of government effectiveness [image4].\n\nThe line graph in image6 illustrates a shift in public opinion over time, with a growing concern that the government has not gone far enough to protect the country, rising from 49% in 2004 to 56% in 2015, while concern about restrictions on civil liberties has decreased from 29% to 28% [image6]. This trend aligns with the text quote that since the start of the year, there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough [2].\n\nImage7 provides a detailed breakdown of perceptions across different demographic groups, including age and education levels. It shows that younger adults (18-29) are more likely to rate the government's performance negatively, with 46% giving a negative rating, while 53% of those aged 50-64 and 65+ give a positive rating [image7]. This supports the text quote that among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat, contrasting with younger adults [4].\n\nIn summary, older individuals and those with less education are more critical of the government's efforts to reduce terrorism, while younger"}

Specifically, among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat, while 42% say it is doing well. In contrast, younger adults (18-29 years old) are more divided, with 46% giving the government a negative rating and 53% saying it is doing very or fairly well [6]. This suggests that older age groups are more skeptical of the government's effectiveness in this area.\n\nAdditionally, the text indicates that adults under 30 are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%) [7]. This contrasts with older age groups, where majorities are more concerned about security than civil liberties, with this concern being more pronounced among those 65 and older (71%) than those 30-49 (52%).\n\nThe image quotes provide further insights. Image5 shows survey results on opinions about the balance between civil liberties and national protection across different age groups. It reveals that 44% of those aged 18-29 believe that civil liberties are being overly restricted, while 44% feel that more measures are needed to protect the U.S. This indicates a near equal split in concerns among the youngest age group. In contrast, 71% of those aged 65+ feel that more measures are needed to protect the country, highlighting a significant shift towards prioritizing security over civil liberties as age increases.\n\nImage3, a line graph comparing perspectives over time, shows that by 2015, 56% of the total population think the country has gone too far in restricting civil liberties, while 28% think not far enough.

In contrast, only 30% of Democrats hold this view, a decrease from 42% in September 2014 [8]. This partisan gap is as wide as it has ever been, highlighting the deep divide in public opinion on this issue [7].\n\nThe image3 illustrates this trend over time, showing that the perception of Islam being more likely to encourage violence has fluctuated but remained closely divided, ending at 45% in 2015 [6]. The line graph indicates that while the perception of Islam encouraging violence has dropped four percentage points since a high of 50% in September 2014, the partisan divide remains stark [6].\n\nThese perceptions are closely tied to views on government handling of terrorism.

Specifically, 82% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe China has done a bad job, compared to 54% of Democrats and Democratic leaners [4]. This critical view is also reflected in the perception of China's role in the global spread of the virus, with 73% of Republicans believing China's early handling contributed a great deal to the spread, compared to 38% of Democrats [2].\n\nThese partisan differences are evident in the survey results, which show that Republicans are more likely to hold China responsible for the outbreak, even if it means worsening economic relations. For instance, 71% of Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP say the U.S. should hold China responsible, even if it means worsening economic relations, compared to 37% of Democrats [11]. This trend is visually represented in the survey data, where the majority of respondents lean toward holding China responsible, with 51% saying the U.S. should hold China responsible, even if relations worsen [12].\n\nOver time, these perceptions have become more pronounced. The line graph in image4 illustrates the increasing negativity towards China among both Republicans and Democrats. The Republican/Lean Republican group's unfavorable view of China rose from 39% in 2005 to 83% in 2020, while the Democrat/Lean Democrat group increased from 34% to 68% over the same period [4].

This shift is consistent with the survey findings that more than half of Americans now think China has done a bad job dealing with the outbreak, with 64% saying China has done a bad job overall [12].\n\nIn summary, Republicans are significantly more critical of China's handling of COVID-19 than Democrats"}

Half of Americans name the U.S., while about a third choose China. In contrast, roughly half of Germans name China as the leading economic power, with only 24% naming the U.S. [3] This divergence is highlighted in the comparative bar chart in image8, which shows that 50% of Americans and 24% of Germans see the U.S. as the leading economic power, while 32% of Americans and 53% of Germans see China in this role.

This perception is more prevalent among Republicans, with 60% of them expecting a decrease in China's influence, compared to 40% of Democrats [5]. The image7 chart illustrates this, with 50% of respondents expecting China to have \"Less influence\" in the future [7].\n\nPartisan differences are also evident in trust levels. Only 21% of conservative Republicans trust the WHO's coronavirus information, while 67% of liberal Democrats do [4]. The image5 chart underscores these differences, showing stark contrasts in perceptions between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats on various issues, including China's handling of the outbreak and the WHO's performance [5].\n\nOverall, the data and images indicate that Republicans are more critical of China's response and more likely to predict a decline in its global influence, while Democrats are more divided, with a smaller proportion expecting a decrease in China's influence [10]. The image1 and image6 charts further highlight these partisan divides, with Democrats more likely to agree \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" on various issues compared to Republicans [1][6].\n\nIn conclusion, Americans perceive China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak negatively, with significant partisan differences, and many expect its global influence to diminish, particularly among Republicans."}

In contrast, Democrats generally prefer building stronger ties with China, with 60% of Democrats supporting this option [2].\n\nThe image1 bar chart illustrates these differences vividly.

According to text quote [3], Republicans generally see tariffs on Chinese and other foreign goods as having a positive effect on the U.S., while Democrats disagree. This is further illustrated in image2, which shows that 51% of Republicans/Lean Republicans believe tariffs are \"Good for the U.S.,\" compared to only 14% of Democrats/Lean Democrats. Among Republicans, conservative individuals are even more likely to view tariffs positively, with 61% seeing them as good, whereas liberal Democrats are least likely, with only 11% holding this view. This partisan divide is also reflected in image4, where 44% of respondents believe the impact of tariffs on the U.S. is bad, but this sentiment is more pronounced among Democrats, aligning with their overall skepticism about tariffs.\n\n**International Students:**\n\nWhen it comes to international students, the partisan divide is also evident. Text quote [8] notes that a majority of Americans support limiting Chinese students studying in the U.S., but this support is more pronounced among Republicans. Image5 shows that 69% of Republicans/Lean Republicans support limiting Chinese students, compared to 42% of Democrats/Lean Democrats. Among Republicans, conservatives are particularly supportive, with 77% in favor, while liberal Democrats are least supportive, with only 35% in favor. This aligns with text quote [9], which highlights that those without a college degree are more in favor of limiting Chinese students, a demographic that leans more Republican.\n\n**Demographic Influences:**\n\nDemographic factors such as age and education level also play a role. Younger Americans, particularly those aged 18-29, are more likely to oppose limiting Chinese students, as seen in image5, where 31% oppose and 69% support. This contrasts with older age groups, who are more supportive of restrictions. Education level also influences views, with image5 showing that 52% of college graduates oppose limiting Chinese students, compared to 39% of those without a degree.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn summary, Republicans are more likely to view tariffs positively and support limiting Chinese students, while Democrats are more skeptical of tariffs and oppose restrictions on Chinese students.

Text quote [3] and image6 indicate that men and White adults are more likely to distrust Xi, with 50% of men and 53% of those aged 65+ having no confidence at all. This lack of confidence is more pronounced among older and Republican groups, who are also more supportive of limiting Chinese students, as seen in image4 and text quote [6].\n\nIn summary, older Americans and Republicans are more likely to support limiting Chinese students and distrust Chinese leadership, reflecting a broader skepticism towards China's influence. Younger Americans and Democrats are more divided or opposed to such limits, showing a more nuanced view of China's role in the U.S. educational system. This interplay between age, political affiliation, and confidence in Chinese leadership underscores the complex dynamics in public opinion on China-related issues."}

However, even among those with high awareness, substantial concerns persist, as they express just as much worry as those with lower levels of awareness [11]. This indicates that while awareness can increase enthusiasm, it does not diminish the underlying worry.\n\nThe survey also reveals that Americans generally expect more negative than positive outcomes from widespread automation. A significant 76% expect increased economic inequality, and 64% anticipate people having a hard time finding things to do with their lives [4][9]. Conversely, only 25% expect the economy to create many new, well-paying jobs for humans, with 75% believing this is unlikely [12]. These expectations are further detailed in the bar chart, which shows that 76% believe inequality will be much worse than today, and 64% think people will struggle to find meaningful activities [6].\n\nDespite these concerns, there is strong support for policies that limit robots and computers to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, with 85% in favor, highlighting a desire to mitigate the negative impacts of automation [2]. Other policies, such as a guaranteed income or national service programs, also receive majority support but are less strongly favored [3]. The chart illustrating support for these policies shows that limiting machines to dangerous jobs is the most favored option, with 47% strongly favoring it [5].\n\nIn summary, Americans' awareness of automation affects their enthusiasm and worry, with higher awareness increasing enthusiasm but not reducing worry.

This aligns with image6, which visually confirms these percentages, showing strong Democratic support for a guaranteed basic income and a national service program compared to Republicans.\n\nHowever, there is a notable consensus across party lines on limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs. Text quote [3] and image1 indicate that 85% of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, favor this policy, with 47% strongly favoring it. This widespread support is also reflected in image6, where both Democrats and Republicans show high levels of agreement (85% and 86%, respectively) on machines being limited to dangerous or unhealthy jobs.\n\nDespite these differences, text quote [2] and image6 reveal that partisan opinions are more aligned on the question of whether businesses should be limited in the number of human jobs they can replace with machines, with 54% of Republicans and 60% of Democrats supporting such limits. This suggests a shared concern about the extent of automation in the workforce.\n\nIn summary, while Democrats are more supportive of government interventions like a universal basic income and national service programs, there is broad agreement on limiting machines to dangerous jobs, highlighting a common concern about the ethical and practical implications of automation. This dual perspective underscores a complex interplay of policy preferences and ethical considerations in the automation debate.\n\n![Public opinion on limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs is widely supported](image1)"}

This is shown in image4, which illustrates that 6% of U.S. adults have lost a job or had their pay or hours reduced due to automation, with the highest percentages in the 18-24 age group (6% lost a job, 11% had pay or hours reduced). This aligns with text quote [3], which highlights that younger adults are among the groups most likely to have been impacted by workforce automation.\n\n**Education Levels:**\n\n- Workers with higher levels of education generally have more positive views of technology. Text quote [4] and image5 both indicate that college graduates are substantially more likely to say that technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38% for those with high school diplomas or less) and has increased their opportunities for career advancement (53% vs. 32%). This trend is consistent across various technologies, as shown in image3, where college-educated workers are more likely to perceive a positive impact from technologies like word processing software, smartphones, and email or social media.\n\n**Mixed Opinions on Technology:**\n\n- Despite the positive views among higher education levels, there is a mixed perception of technology's impact overall. Text quote [11] notes that workers express mixed opinions on how today’s technologies have impacted their jobs and careers. Image3 supports this by showing that while many technologies are perceived positively, some, like industrial robots, are seen negatively by 14% of workers.\n\n**Future Impact Concerns:**\n\n- Workers with lower education levels are more concerned about the future impact of automation.

The disparity between effectiveness and fairness for the personal finance score is the largest among the systems, with a 22-percentage-point difference [8].\n\nThe automated criminal risk score is viewed more favorably in terms of fairness, with 50% considering it fair to those up for parole, compared to just 32% for the personal finance score [4]. However, the effectiveness of both systems is seen similarly, with 54% and 49% respectively [8]. This suggests that while the criminal risk score is perceived as fairer, concerns about fairness still outweigh its perceived effectiveness.\n\nThe video job interview analysis is also seen as unfair, with 67% finding it unacceptable and only 33% finding it fair [2]. Despite this, 39% believe it would be effective at identifying successful hires [9]. The effectiveness-fairness difference is smaller here, at +6 percentage points [8].\n\nThe automated resume screening is viewed as somewhat fairer, with 41% finding it acceptable and 43% seeing it as fair [image2]. Its effectiveness is also high, with 47% believing it would be effective [9], resulting in a small effectiveness-fairness difference of +4 percentage points [8].\n\nThese differences imply that public trust in automated systems is heavily influenced by perceptions of fairness. Even if a system is seen as effective, if it is not considered fair, it is likely to be rejected. The personal finance score's large effectiveness-fairness gap underscores this, as does the criminal risk score's smaller gap, which still results in significant concerns about fairness [image8].\n\nThe age-related skepticism about the unbiased capability of programs, with older groups being more skeptical [image4], further suggests that generational differences may affect trust in these systems. Younger adults are more likely to believe programs can make decisions without bias, while older adults are more skeptical, which could influence their perceptions of fairness and effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, the public's trust in automated systems is largely contingent on"}

According to the Pew Research Center survey, a majority of Americans express concern that states have been too quick to lift COVID-19 restrictions, with 69% saying this is their greater concern [2]. This sentiment is reflected in the decline in positive evaluations of state and local government officials' responses to the coronavirus outbreak, which have dropped from 70% to 56% and 69% to 60%, respectively [8]. However, the public continues to have overwhelmingly positive views of the response of local hospital and medical centers, with 88% rating them as excellent or good [8].\n\nIn contrast, perceptions of Trump's response are more critical. Nearly half of Americans (48%) currently rate Trump's response to the outbreak as \"poor,\" up 16 points since March [9]. This aligns with the finding that the majority of Americans are critical of Trump's response to COVID-19, with nearly half saying he is doing a \"poor\" job [3]. The survey also shows that while more Republicans than Democrats offer positive assessments of the U.S. response, only 22% of Republicans say the U.S. has been more effective than other wealthy countries, while 34% say it has been less effective, and 42% say it has been about as effective. Democrats overwhelmingly view the U.S. response as less effective compared to other wealthy nations, with 87% saying this [5].\n\nThe partisan divide is evident in views of the reasons for the continued outbreak. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say most factors are major reasons the outbreak has continued, particularly the federal government's inadequate response (82% of Democrats vs. 21% of Republicans) and lifting restrictions too quickly (82% of Democrats vs. 31% of Republicans) [4]. This is further illustrated by the chart showing reasons for the spread of the issue, where 58% of respondents consider lifting restrictions too quickly in some places a major reason for the continued outbreak [6].\n\nThe bar chart comparing opinions about the speed of lifting coronavirus outbreak restrictions shows that 30% of respondents believe the restrictions are not being lifted quickly enough, while 69% think they are being lifted too quickly [image1].

In 2019, Latino registered voters identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin, a trend that has remained relatively stable, as seen in the survey results from 2022 [9]. This stability is reflected in image4, which shows that 53% of Latino registered voters favor a Democratic candidate, compared to 28% for a Republican candidate, with 18% unsure or favoring another candidate.\n\nThe importance of issues for Latino voters has also evolved significantly. In 2019, the economy was the top issue, but by 2022, abortion had risen in importance, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to end the federal guarantee of a right to legal abortion [2]. Image6 illustrates this shift, showing that the importance of abortion increased from 42% in March to 57% in August 2022, surpassing the economy as a key issue. This trend is consistent with the broader U.S. electorate, where abortion has become a more critical issue leading up to the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nDemographic factors play a crucial role in shaping these preferences. Among Latino voters who consider their Hispanic identity extremely or very important, 60% would vote for the Democratic candidate, compared to 45% of those for whom being Latino is less important [6]. Image4 highlights these differences, showing that Latino identity significantly influences voting preferences, with a higher Democratic lean among those who prioritize their Hispanic identity.\n\nPolitical affiliation further divides perceptions of party efforts to earn Latino votes. Image2 and image3 reveal that Democrats are perceived to work harder and care more about Latinos than Republicans, with higher net scores among both Democratic and Republican-leaning voters. For instance, 78% of Democrats/Lean Democrats believe the Democratic Party really cares about Latinos, while only 36% of Republicans/Lean Republicans hold the same view [3].\n\nReligious affiliation also impacts voting patterns. Catholics, who make up a significant portion of Latino voters, show a stronger preference for Democrats (59%) compared to Evangelical Protestants (32%) [4]. Image4 supports this, showing that Catholics favor Democrats by a larger margin than Evangelical Protestants.\n\nOverall, Latino voters' party affiliations have remained relatively stable,"}

According to the text, women in STEM jobs are much more likely than men to report experiencing discrimination and to consider it a major barrier to greater female representation [1][3]. This discrimination can manifest in various forms, including pay gaps and unequal treatment from coworkers due to gender stereotypes [3]. The image7 illustrates these differences vividly, showing that while both men and women value job flexibility to balance work and family obligations similarly, women place a much higher importance on jobs that help others (59% vs. 31% for men) and making a meaningful contribution to society (60% vs. 51% for men). These preferences align with the text's observation that women in STEM are more inclined to consider a job focusing on helping others as important (59%) compared to men (31%) [4][6][9].\n\nMoreover, the text notes that women are more likely to feel that their gender has made it harder for them to succeed at work, raising concerns about pay gaps and unequal treatment [3]. This sentiment is supported by the image6, which reveals that Black respondents, who may face similar systemic barriers, report higher levels of discrimination and perceive their race/ethnicity as a significant barrier to success. The image also underscores that Black respondents feel their workplaces pay insufficient attention to diversity, a sentiment that could resonate with women in STEM who feel similarly marginalized.\n\nThe text further emphasizes that many Americans attribute the limited diversity in STEM to a lack of early encouragement for girls and minorities to pursue these fields [5]. This lack of encouragement can exacerbate the challenges women face, as they may feel less supported in their career paths. The image1 supports this by showing that not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age is a major reason for the underrepresentation of women (39%) and blacks and Hispanics (41%).\n\nIn summary, the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM—such as the higher importance women place on helping others and making a meaningful contribution—reflect the broader challenges women face, including discrimination and lack of encouragement.

Additionally, women are less likely to be encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age, also at 39% [7][11]. Other significant factors include the difficulty of balancing work and family responsibilities in STEM jobs (33%) and the lack of female role models in the field (24%) [3][11]. These challenges highlight systemic barriers and societal expectations that disproportionately affect women.\n\nIn contrast, for **blacks and Hispanics**, the primary reason is the limited access to quality education to prepare them for STEM fields, with 42% of respondents identifying this as a major issue [4][5][10]. This is closely followed by not being encouraged to pursue STEM from an early age (41%) [7][11]. Discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion is also a significant factor, cited by 31% [3][10][11]. The lack of black and Hispanic role models in STEM is another contributing factor, noted by 27% [11].\n\nThe differences in these reasons reflect varying systemic challenges.

According to text quote [6], STEM workers tend to have relatively high levels of education compared to other workers. Specifically, about 65% of STEM workers have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, which is twice the rate of non-STEM workers (32%). Additionally, 29% of STEM workers have a master’s, doctorate, or professional degree, significantly higher than the 12% of non-STEM workers with advanced degrees. This indicates that STEM workers are generally more educated than their non-STEM counterparts.\n\nNow, let's examine the employment sectors. Text quote [7] states that most STEM workers work for a private, for-profit employer, with 66% of STEM workers employed in this sector, which is similar to the overall employed population. However, specific STEM fields like engineering and computer workers are even more likely to work in the private sector, with 82% and 77% respectively. In contrast, healthcare practitioners and technicians are less likely to work in the private sector, with only 58% employed there, and a higher percentage (23%) working in not-for-profit organizations.\n\nImage4 provides a detailed breakdown of employment sectors for different STEM fields. It shows that STEM workers are predominantly employed in the private, for-profit sector, with 66% of all STEM workers in this category. This is consistent with the text. However, fields like physical science and math have a higher percentage of workers in government and not-for-profit sectors, respectively. For example, 39% of math workers are in government, and 9% are self-employed/other.\n\nImage6 further supports the text by showing that STEM workers have higher education levels, with 36% holding a bachelor’s degree and 29% having a postgraduate degree, compared to 21% and 12% for non-STEM workers, respectively. This suggests that the higher education levels of STEM workers might influence their employment in sectors that value advanced qualifications, such as private, for-profit companies.\n\nImage3 compares education levels between STEM and all employed individuals. It shows that STEM workers are more likely to have some college education (59% vs. 50%) and a bachelor’s degree ("}

According to text quote [5], STEM workers are about twice as likely as those in non-STEM occupations to have earned at least a bachelor’s degree (65% vs. 32%). Additionally, STEM workers are far more likely to hold advanced degrees, with 29% having a master’s, doctorate, or professional degree, compared to only 12% of non-STEM workers. This trend is visually supported by image3, which shows that STEM workers have higher percentages in all education categories except for professional/doctoral degrees, where the overall employed population slightly surpasses STEM workers (42% vs. 41%).\n\nMoreover, STEM workers are more likely to have completed vocational or technical training, certificates, or apprenticeships, as noted in text quote [8]. This additional training is particularly relevant for middle-skills workers, as highlighted in text quote [3], where about 69% of STEM workers with some college experience or an associate degree have completed such training, compared to 49% of non-STEM workers.\n\nRegarding employment sectors, STEM workers predominantly work in the private, for-profit sector, similar to the overall employed population, as detailed in text quote [4]. Image2 confirms this, showing that 66% of STEM workers are employed in private, for-profit jobs, which is identical to the share of all employed adults. However, there are notable differences within specific STEM fields. For instance, engineers and computer workers are most likely to work in the private sector (82% and 77%, respectively), while healthcare practitioners and technicians are less likely, with 58% in private, for-profit jobs and 23% in not-for-profit sectors.\n\nThe trends in employment sectors over time, as depicted in image8, show a decline in the proportion of computer workers from 32 in 1990 to 25 in 2016, while engineering shows a slight increase from 12 to 14 over the same period. This suggests a shift in the composition of STEM fields, with potential implications for educational and employment strategies.\n\nIn summary, STEM workers generally have higher educational attainment and are more likely to work in the private, for-profit sector, with specific trends in employment sectors reflecting changes in the STEM workforce composition over time.\n\n![STEM workers have higher educational attainment compared to non-STEM workers](image"}

According to text [1], a notable percentage of individuals in STEM jobs report experiencing discrimination due to their race or ethnicity. Specifically, text [2] and [11] indicate that 62% of Black STEM employees have experienced discrimination at work, which is significantly higher than the 44% of Asians and 42% of Hispanics in STEM jobs. This is visually corroborated by image1, which shows that 62% of Black respondents reported experiencing discrimination, compared to 13% of Whites, 42% of Hispanics, and 44% of Asians. Additionally, text [3] and [6] reveal that Black STEM workers are more likely to perceive their race/ethnicity as a barrier to success and believe their workplace pays insufficient attention to diversity, with 40% and 57% respectively, as shown in image1.\n\nIn contrast, gender-based discrimination in STEM fields, as described in text [9] and [12], affects women more than men. Text [12] notes that 50% of women in STEM jobs have experienced gender discrimination, which is more than women in non-STEM jobs (41%) and far more than men in STEM occupations (19%). Image3 further illustrates that women in male-dominated STEM environments face more gender-related challenges, with 78% experiencing discrimination compared to 19% of men. The same image also shows that women in male-dominated workplaces are more likely to feel the need to prove themselves (79%) and perceive less fair treatment in recruitment and promotion (38% vs. 69% for men).\n\nImage8 provides a detailed comparison in computer jobs, where women report higher rates of gender-related discrimination (74%) and sexual harassment (30%) compared to men (16% and 7%, respectively). This aligns with text [10], which lists common forms of gender discrimination experienced by women in STEM, such as earning less than a man doing the same job (29%) and being treated as if they were not competent (29%).\n\nIn summary, while both racial and gender discrimination are prevalent in STEM fields, racial discrimination disproportionately affects Black individuals, with 62% reporting such experiences, as per text [2] and image1.

According to the text, about half of women in STEM jobs who work with mostly men report that their gender has made it harder to succeed on the job [1], [3], [7], [11]. This perception is supported by the image2, which shows that 78% of women in mostly male workplaces have experienced gender discrimination, compared to 43% in majority-female workplaces [7]. Additionally, 48% of women in male-dominated environments believe their gender has hindered their success, a stark contrast to the 12% of women in majority-female workplaces who feel the same [11].\n\nThe image2 also highlights that women in male-dominated STEM environments are more likely to experience specific forms of discrimination, such as earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent (29%), and receiving less support from senior leaders (18%) [4]. These experiences are more prevalent in male-dominated settings, as indicated by the image7, which shows that 78% of women in male-dominated workplaces have faced gender-related discrimination, compared to 44% in mixed-gender or majority-female workplaces [7].\n\nFurthermore, women in male-dominated STEM environments often feel the need to prove themselves to be respected by their coworkers, with 79% feeling this need, compared to 52% in mixed-gender or majority-female workplaces [6], [7]. The image7 confirms this, showing that 79% of women in male-dominated workplaces feel they need to prove themselves, compared to 52% in mixed-gender settings [7].\n\nThe image12 emphasizes that most women in STEM jobs who work in male-dominated workplaces, especially in computer jobs or with postgraduate degrees, have experienced gender discrimination [12]. This aligns with the text, which notes that women with postgraduate degrees in STEM are more likely to have experienced discrimination (62%) compared to those with some college education (41%) [8].\n\nIn summary, women in male-dominated STEM environments face more pronounced gender discrimination and inequities, including earning disparities, perceived incompetence, and lack of support, compared to their counterparts in more gender-balanced settings. These findings are consistently supported by both text and image evidence, highlighting the significant challenges women face in predominantly male STEM workplaces.\n\n"}

According to the text, adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic often cite reasons such as mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and lack of cultural links [1]. For instance, 27% of these individuals do not consider themselves Hispanic due to a mixed Hispanic and non-Hispanic background or distant Hispanic ancestry, while 16% attribute it to their upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives, and 15% mention not speaking Spanish or having no cultural link [1]. Additionally, 12% identify as another race or do not look Hispanic, and 9% were born in the U.S. and consider themselves American [1]. These reasons highlight the complexity of identity formation among those with Hispanic ancestry.\n\nGenerational status plays a significant role in self-identification. Among self-identified Hispanics, 36% of immigrants consider themselves typical Americans, a share that rises to 63% among the second generation and 73% among the third or higher generation, reflecting their U.S. birth and experiences [3]. This trend continues, with the share of U.S.-born Hispanics who self-identify as Hispanic falling to 77% by the third generation and just 50% by the fourth or higher generation [10]. This decline suggests that as generations progress, the connection to Hispanic identity diminishes, possibly due to assimilation and integration into American culture.\n\nLanguage proficiency is another factor. The image1 chart shows that while 71% of self-identified Hispanics overall do not speak Spanish, this percentage increases to 84% among the second generation and 92% among the third or higher generation [12]. Similarly, having a Spanish last name is less common, with 84% of self-identified Hispanics not having one, rising to 91% among the second generation and 92% among the third or higher generation [12]. This decline in language use and Spanish surnames across generations underscores the weakening of cultural ties.\n\nPersonal identity and self-perception also influence identification.

This aligns with text quote [3], which states that foreign-born and second-generation Hispanics feel more connected to their family's country of origin. Image8 further supports this, showing that 61% of foreign-born Hispanics are Spanish dominant, indicating a strong linguistic connection to their heritage.\n\n- **Second-Generation Hispanics:** Image6 shows that 69% of second-generation Hispanics feel connected to their heritage, slightly less than foreign-born Hispanics but still a majority. This decline in connection is consistent with text quote [8], which notes that connections with ancestral national origins decline as immigrant roots become more distant.\n\n- **Third or Higher Generation Hispanics:** Only 44% of third or higher generation Hispanics feel connected to their heritage, as per image6.

Among foreign-born Hispanics, 78% identify as Hispanic or Latino, while this drops to 66% for the second generation and further to 46% for the third or higher generation. This trend is evident in image2, which shows a clear decline in Hispanic or Latino identification as generations progress. Additionally, the share identifying as White increases from 11% among foreign-born Hispanics to 25% among the third or higher generation, reflecting assimilation and changing identities over time.\n\n- **Self-identified non-Hispanics** with Hispanic ancestry, on the other hand, identify more as White, with 59% choosing this option, as shown in image2. This indicates a significant shift away from Hispanic identity among those who do not self-identify as Hispanic.\n\n**Impact of Hispanic Heritage:**\n\n- The impact of Hispanic heritage on life experiences also varies by generation. According to text quote [10], second-generation Hispanics are most likely to perceive their heritage as an advantage, with 52% saying it has been beneficial. This contrasts with 28% of immigrant Hispanics and 24% of third or higher generation Hispanics who feel the same.

For instance, while 39% of self-identified Hispanics report feeling discriminated against because of their Hispanic or Latino background, this percentage decreases among higher generations. Specifically, 42% of self-identified Latino immigrants and second-generation Latinos report experiencing discrimination often or sometimes, but this drops to 29% among third or higher generation Latinos [2][4].\n\nRacial identification also varies across generations. The majority of self-identified Hispanics identify as Hispanic or Latino, with 70% overall, but this identification diminishes with each subsequent generation. Among foreign-born Hispanics, 85% identify as Hispanic or Latino, while this drops to 68% for the second generation and further to 26% for the third or higher generation [2][12]. This trend is illustrated in image2, which shows a clear decline in Hispanic identification as generations progress.\n\nMoreover, the perception of how many people in America share similar views among Hispanics changes with generational status. As seen in image1, 39% of self-identified Hispanics believe \"All/Most\" people share similar views, but this belief decreases to 30% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This suggests that as generations progress, the sense of a shared Hispanic identity and community diminishes.\n\nIn terms of racial identification, image3 reveals that while 69% of self-identified Hispanics overall identify as Hispanic or Latino, this drops to 46% among third or higher generation Hispanics. Concurrently, the percentage identifying as White increases from 14% among the overall Hispanic population to 25% among third or higher generation Hispanics. This shift indicates a growing tendency for higher generations to identify racially as White rather than Hispanic or Latino.\n\nThe connection to Hispanic heritage also weakens with each generation.

According to the data, 50% of self-identified Hispanics prefer terms related to their country of origin or heritage, while 23% identify as \"Hispanic/Latino\" and another 23% as \"American\" [1][12]. This trend is mirrored in the frequency of self-identification as Hispanic, with foreign-born individuals being more likely to often self-identify as Hispanic (57%) compared to second (50%) and third or higher generation (33%) individuals [2]. This suggests that immigrant roots and generational distance from them play a crucial role in identity.\n\nLanguage use also shows a clear generational pattern. Among self-identified Hispanics, 71% do not speak Spanish, with this percentage increasing to 84% among second-generation and 92% among third or higher generation Hispanics [4]. This decline in Spanish proficiency is further highlighted by the fact that only 6% of second-generation and essentially none of the third generation are Spanish dominant [11]. The importance of Spanish in defining Latino identity is underscored by the fact that 71% of Latinos believe speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Latino, with this view being even more prevalent among the second (84%) and third or higher generations (92%) [3][4].\n\nThe connection to ancestral national origins diminishes with each generation. While 82% of immigrant Hispanics feel connected to their country of origin, this drops to 69% among second-generation and 44% among third or higher generation Hispanics [9]. This generational shift is also reflected in the use of the term \"American,\" which rises from 7% among immigrants to 56% among the third or higher generation [7].\n\nThese trends indicate that as generations progress, there is a stronger identification with American identity and a weaker connection to Hispanic heritage, particularly in terms of language use. The data suggests that generational distance from immigrant roots leads to a more integrated national identity and a reduced emphasis on traditional Hispanic cultural markers like language and country of origin.\n\nIn summary, generational differences among Hispanics significantly impact self-identification preferences and language use, with immigrant generations maintaining stronger ties to their heritage and subsequent generations increasingly identifying as American and less reliant on Spanish as a marker of identity.

Image5 provides specific data on these concerns over the years 2011 to 2014. The rising cost of living shows a consistent increase in concern, peaking at 63% in 2014, while unemployment also rises, reaching 49% in 2014. This indicates a growing worry about both issues over time.\n\nWhen comparing GCC and Non-GCC countries, image3 shows that the concern levels for the rising cost of living are nearly identical, with GCC at 63% and Non-GCC at 62%.

China, with lower energy consumption per capita and lower motor vehicle ownership, has a smaller environmental impact from this sector. Germany, with moderate energy consumption and high ownership, falls in between.\n\nThe disparity in motor vehicle ownership and energy consumption per capita implies that the USA's environmental impact from transportation is likely higher than that of China and Germany. This could be due to higher vehicle usage and less stringent vehicle standards, as noted in the text [4][11]. China's lower impact may be due to its lower per capita energy consumption and vehicle ownership, while Germany's impact is moderate, reflecting its balance between energy use and vehicle ownership.\n\nIn conclusion, the USA's high energy consumption and motor vehicle ownership suggest a greater environmental impact from transportation compared to China and Germany, which have lower and moderate impacts, respectively. This implies that the USA may need stricter vehicle standards and more efficient energy use to reduce its environmental footprint.\n\n![USA has the highest energy consumption per capita and motor vehicle ownership, indicating a greater environmental impact from transportation compared to China and Germany](image6)"}

The x-axis represents the number of training steps, ranging from 0k to 600k, while the y-axis represents the training loss. The graph indicates a general trend of decreasing training loss as the number of training steps increases, suggesting that the models are learning and improving over time. The Chameleon-34B model appears to have a lower training loss throughout the training process compared to Chameleon-7B, indicating potentially better performance. This is shown in the line plot as the brown curve for Chameleon-34B starts at a lower loss and remains consistently lower than the yellow curve for Chameleon-7B.\n\nSecondly, **Figure 5b** presents a line plot comparing the training loss curves for Chameleon-7B with and without QK-Norm. The x-axis represents the training steps, and the y-axis represents the training loss. The plot shows that the training loss diverges after approximately 20% of a training epoch when QK-Norm is not applied, highlighting the importance of this normalization technique in stabilizing the training process.\n\nAdditionally, **Figure 6a** includes a line plot that depicts the training loss over the first 600k steps for both Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B. The x-axis represents the training steps, and the y-axis represents the training loss. The plot illustrates the training progress and loss divergence, showing how the models perform over the initial steps of training.\n\nLastly, **Figure 5c** features a line plot comparing the training loss for Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B with and without norm reordering. The x-axis represents the training steps, and the y-axis represents the training loss. The plot shows that using norm reordering helps stabilize the training process for Chameleon-34B, as indicated by the less severe spikes in the training loss compared to the line without norm reordering.\n\nThese line plots provide valuable insights into the training dynamics and performance of the Chameleon models, demonstrating the impact of various training strategies and techniques on model stability and effectiveness.\n\n![Chameleon-7B and Chameleon-34B training"}

For instance, quote [1] mentions that strategies like Entropy, Margin, VAAL, etc., are biased towards certain classes, resulting in poor class coverage. Quote [4] further highlights that these strategies often fail to select minority classes, leading to unbalanced class distributions. Quote [6] provides a specific example where VAAL prefers selecting data from the femur-right and platelet class in OrganAMNIST while largely ignoring other classes like lung and liver. Quote [7] and [10] emphasize that label diversity is crucial, and strategies lacking it perform poorly.\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence of this bias. Image7 shows that the VAAL strategy has a preference for the muscle class in PathMNIST, ignoring minority classes like mucus and mucosa. Image3 illustrates that VAAL performs poorly in selecting minority classes in both OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST. Image2 and image5 show that strategies like VAAL and Entropy have lower AUC scores without label diversity, indicating poor performance.\n\nCombining these insights, it is clear that strategies like VAAL and Entropy consistently show poor label diversity across datasets. However, VAAL is specifically highlighted in multiple instances for its bias towards certain classes, such as muscle in PathMNIST and femur-right in OrganAMNIST, while ignoring others.\n\nThus, the querying criteria that generally yield the worst label diversity across all datasets are those that exhibit significant class bias, such as VAAL and Entropy.

The process begins with the user input, which is encoded using a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) utterance encoder to create a continuous vector representation of the user's utterance [2]. This encoding, along with the embedding of the previous system dialogue act, is processed by an LSTM dialogue state to update the dialogue state, which tracks the user's goals and current context [3][10]. \n\nThe updated dialogue state is then used by the dialogue state tracker to identify relevant slots and their values, such as \"date\" and \"time\" [3][10]. This information is combined with query results from an external knowledge base, which are encoded and fed into the policy network [3][5]. The policy network, taking inputs from the dialogue state and slot value logits, determines the next system action, such as \"request(time)\" [3][4][11]. \n\nFinally, the natural language generator (NLG) uses the system action and the tracked goal values or knowledge base entities to produce a natural language response, like \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" [6]. This response is generated by replacing delexicalized tokens in a template with the appropriate values [6]. \n\n![System generates a response by processing user input through various components and producing a natural language output](image6)\n\nThis architecture ensures that the system can understand user requests, track dialogue states, and generate appropriate responses in a task-oriented manner, leveraging neural networks for encoding, tracking, and policy decision-making."}

For instance, training a single model like BERT on GPUs is estimated to emit carbon equivalent to a trans-American flight, which is 1,984 lbs of CO₂e [5][image5]. This comparison underscores the significant environmental impact of model training. \n\nWhen considering the full development process, including tuning and experimentation, the emissions can escalate dramatically. For example, training 4789 models requires 239,942 hours and incurs a cloud cost ranging from $103k to $350k, with an electric cost of $9,870 [3][image3].

The table in image2 shows that in countries like China, where coal accounts for 65% of energy consumption, and companies like Amazon-AWS, which uses 30% coal, the carbon footprint of training models is exacerbated. In contrast, Google, with 56% renewables, has a lower carbon impact, but even here, coal still contributes 15% to their energy mix.\n\nThe detailed analysis in the text [4][7][8][9] emphasizes that while individual model training might seem manageable, the cumulative effect of extensive tuning and experimentation, as seen in the case study of the LISA model, leads to significant financial and environmental costs.

Similarly, in the 3-hop scenario, ProgramFC peaks at 69.56, while FLAN-T5 reaches 66.89 [5]. For the 4-hop scenario, ProgramFC maintains a higher F1 score, with a peak of 68.18 compared to FLAN-T5's 63.39 [5]. This indicates that ProgramFC's program-guided reasoning is particularly effective, especially with smaller models, as it reduces the demand on subsequent sub-task solvers [6].\n\nIn terms of retrieval recall, ProgramFC significantly outperforms one-step retrieval across all datasets. For example, in the HOVER 4-hop task, ProgramFC achieves a recall of 49.93, compared to one-step retrieval's 36.43 [8].

This is further supported by the bar chart in image1, which shows that ProgramFC has higher retrieval recall than one-step retrieval methods in all categories, highlighting its iterative retrieval process guided by reasoning programs [12].\n\nHowever, ProgramFC also faces challenges. The error analysis in Table 7 [11] reveals that as the complexity of claims increases, the proportion of semantic errors, particularly structural errors, rises significantly. For example, in 4-hop claims, structural errors account for 57% of the errors, showing difficulties in generating appropriate reasoning strategies for long-chain reasoning [11]. Additionally, incorrect execution errors decrease with increasing complexity, suggesting that while the program structure may be flawed, the execution of correct programs still leads to errors [6].\n\nDespite these challenges, ProgramFC's performance is notably robust even with smaller model sizes.

PROGRAM FC consistently outperforms FLAN-T5 in all scenarios (2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop), with the highest F1 scores at the largest model size (11B). This supports the text quote [3], which states that PROGRAM FC effectively balances model capability, learning efficiency, and interpretability, and [4], which notes that PROGRAM FC becomes increasingly effective as the required reasoning depth increases.\n\n### Error Types\n\nThe error analysis in **image4** provides insights into the types of errors made by the models. For 2-hop claims, **71%** of errors are due to incorrect program execution, where the question answering or fact-checking modules fail to return the correct answer. This is consistent with the text quote [5], which identifies incorrect program execution as a major error source. As the complexity increases to 3-hop and 4-hop claims, the proportion of semantic errors, particularly structural errors, increases significantly. For 4-hop claims, structural errors account for **57%** of errors, highlighting the difficulty in generating appropriate reasoning strategies for complex claims, as noted in the text quote [11].\n\n### Interpretability and Performance\n\nPROGRAM FC improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning programs, as mentioned in the text quote [8]. The example in **image5** shows a logical flow of steps to evaluate a claim, demonstrating how the model breaks down the reasoning process. This explicit program aids human understanding and debugging, which is crucial for complex fact-checking tasks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, model performance improves with increased reasoning depth, as seen in the consistent"}

It shows that ChatGPT generally performs better as the number of demonstrations increases, which supports the study's observation that increasing the number of demos can benefit LLMs' performance, particularly in tasks like RE [11]. However, the performance plateau observed in NER and ED tasks suggests limitations in leveraging additional demos before reaching the maximum input length.\n\nThe right graph in image7 compares F1 scores for three demo selection strategies: random sampling, sentence embedding, and Efficient Prompt Retriever (EPR). The EPR strategy shows the highest performance, followed by embedding, with random sampling performing the least effectively. This aligns with the study's conclusion that the selection strategy of demonstration matters, and retrieval based on sentence embedding surpasses random sampling [2].\n\nComparing these findings with other models, as shown in image1, which compares F1 scores of different models on NER tasks across three datasets (CONLL03, OntoNotes, and FewNERD), we see that while ChatGPT and Codex perform well in low-resource settings, they are outperformed by fine-tuned models like UIE and FSLS as the number of shots increases.

According to the benchmarks shown in ![Performance Comparison](image6), LLaMA 2 demonstrates competitive performance in several areas but also highlights areas where it lags behind.\n\nIn terms of strengths, LLaMA 2 shows strong performance in TriviaQA (1-shot) with a score of 85.0, outperforming PaLM (81.4) and PaLM-2-L (86.1). It also performs well in MMLU (5-shot) with a score of 68.9, closely matching PaLM (69.3) and outperforming GPT-3.5 (70.0). Additionally, LLaMA 2 achieves a score of 51.2 in BIG-Bench Hard (3-shot), which is comparable to PaLM (52.3).\n\nHowever, LLaMA 2 has notable weaknesses in coding benchmarks. For instance, in HumanEval (0-shot), LLaMA 2 scores 29.9, significantly lower than GPT-4 (67.0) and PaLM (26.2). Similarly, in GSM8K (8-shot), LLaMA 2 scores 56.8, trailing behind GPT-4 (92.0) and PaLM (56.5).

According to the line graph titled \"Experiment Result on Conscious Incompetence\" ![The precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics as knowledge elements are removed](image1), precision (blue line) increases as more knowledge is removed, starting at around 14 and reaching about 26. In contrast, recall (orange line) remains relatively stable, starting around 14 and ending slightly below 15. The F1-Score (green line) shows a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18. This suggests that while the model's ability to filter out incorrect knowledge improves (increasing precision), its ability to identify and cite the necessary knowledge remains limited (stable recall).\n\nThe table in image2 further supports this observation. It shows that as the number of knowledge elements removed increases from 0 to 3, the precision decreases from 30.1 to 16.3, recall decreases from 57.1 to 20.4, and F1-Score decreases from 39.4 to 18.1. This indicates that the model's citation precision and recall are highly dependent on the availability of knowledge elements, with recall being more significantly affected.\n\nThe diagram in image3 explains how precision and recall are calculated based on model output and a minimum knowledge set. It highlights that precision is calculated as the number of correct citations divided by the total number of citations, while recall is the number of correct citations divided by the total number of required knowledge elements. The example shows that even with some correct citations, the model's recall is limited by the absence of necessary knowledge.\n\nThe ablation study described in text quote [7] simulates retrieval accuracy from 100 to 20, showing that as retrieval accuracy decreases, precision and recall drop drastically, as depicted in the line graph in image7. The graph shows that precision, recall, and F1-Score all decrease as retrieval accuracy decreases, with correctness showing a slight decrease. This underscores the crucial role of retrieval accuracy in generating high-quality attributed texts.\n\nText quote [10] notes that the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting becomes increasingly crucial as the coverage problem of the knowledge graph becomes more serious.

For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE achieves a 25.7% Micro-F1 score, surpassing the 24.5% score from 10 demonstrations without logical constraints [1]. This highlights the importance of balancing demonstrations and logical constraints to enhance model performance.\n\nThe image1 graph supports this by showing that both MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets benefit from logical constraints as the number of demonstration samples increases. The left graph demonstrates that models with logical constraints consistently outperform those without, particularly as the number of demonstrations grows. The right graph further illustrates that logical inconsistency decreases with more iterations, though Micro-F1 scores stabilize, indicating the challenge of overthinking in iterative retrieval processes [5].\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that pre-training models on a dataset like LLM-LR, which involves multi-hop reasoning, can significantly improve performance. For example, LlaMA2-13B-PT achieves a 26.4% Micro-F1 on MAVEN-ERE, surpassing larger models like ChatGPT [3, 12]. This is corroborated by image3, which shows that pre-training with logical constraints reduces logical inconsistency to 0% for Llama2-13B-PT on both datasets, indicating improved performance and consistency.\n\nThe image2 provides a visual representation of how logical constraints refine LLM outputs through generative, retrieval, and pre-training methods. The generative approach aligns outputs with logical constraints, while retrieval-based methods resolve conflicts, and pre-training embeds constraints into models, enhancing their reasoning abilities [7, 8].\n\nIn summary, logical constraints and demonstrations are crucial for improving model performance on reasoning tasks. Logical constraints enhance consistency and reasoning accuracy, while demonstrations provide context and guidance. Pre-training with logical constraints further refines these improvements, as evidenced by the enhanced Micro-F1 scores and reduced logical inconsistency in models like Llama2-13B-PT [3, 12].\n\nThus, the use of logical constraints and demonstrations, along with pre-training, is essential for optimizing model performance on complex reasoning tasks like those in MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets."}

Specifically, logical constraints help in maintaining consistency without severely affecting the quality of the generation, unlike post-processing, which may lead to semantic deviations from the ground truth [1]. The use of logical constraints is shown to be more effective than post-processing, as directly conveying constraints to LLMs is more beneficial than adding post-processing operations based on results [7].\n\nThe image quotes provide empirical evidence supporting these findings. For instance, image1 shows a comparison of model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets under different conditions: with all logical constraints, with retrieved logical constraints, and with post-processing. The table indicates that models with logical constraints generally achieve lower Logical Inconsistency (LI) percentages, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing inconsistency. For example, GPT-4 with all logical constraints shows a lower LI compared to post-processing, highlighting the advantage of logical constraints over post-processing in maintaining consistency.\n\nImage7 further illustrates this by showing the performance of Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank. It reveals that while post-processing achieves the lowest LI (0%), the best Micro-F1 scores are often obtained with logical constraints, such as CoT with logical constraints for Llama2-13B-PT on MAVEN-ERE. This suggests that logical constraints not only reduce inconsistency but also enhance performance metrics like Micro-F1.\n\nIn summary, logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models. Logical constraints improve both consistency and performance metrics, as evidenced by lower LI percentages and higher Micro-F1 scores in datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank, as shown in images1 and7.\n\n![Logical constraints are more effective than post-processing in reducing logical inconsistency across different LLM models.](image1)"}

The text mentions that for task fulfillment, annotators rarely disagree on simple, objective properties like the presence of objectionable content. However, for more subjective judgments, such as whether a response fulfills the task, there can be some disagreement. The majority vote is taken as the final answer, and the level of agreement is examined to ensure the quality of the evaluation process [4][5][6][7].\n\nThe image quotes provide specific data on inter-annotator agreement. Image 7 shows a table detailing the agreement levels among annotators for different comparisons involving Chameleon, Gemini, and GPT-4 models. The table categorizes the agreement into three levels: \"All 3 annotators agree,\" \"2 of 3 annotators agree,\" and \"No Agreement.\" For task fulfillment, the data indicates that:\n\n- **Chameleon vs. Gemini+**: 31.5% of the time all annotators agree, 58.1% agree on two of the three instances, and 10.3% have no agreement.\n- **Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+**: 35.4% of the time all annotators agree, 55.2% agree on two of the three instances, and 9.3% have no agreement.\n- **Chameleon vs. Gemini**: 30.2% of the time all annotators agree, 59.3% agree on two of the three instances, and 10.5% have no agreement.\n- **Chameleon vs. GPT-4V**: 28.6% of the time all annotators agree, 58.3% agree on two of the three instances, and 13.1% have no agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Image 6 shows a bar chart titled \"Figure 10: The inter-annotator agreement on the questions in the absolute evaluation.\" It highlights that \"All\" annotators generally have the highest counts across almost all categories, including \"Task fulfillment\" and \"Relevance,\" indicating a high level of agreement in these areas.\n\nCombining these"}

In absolute evaluations, the output of each model is judged separately by three annotators on various questions, including task fulfillment [3]. The levels of agreement on each question are shown in Figure 10, which indicates how often annotators agree on their judgments [8]. For relative evaluations, annotators compare responses from different models and choose their preferred response [10].

It shows that for Chameleon vs. Gemini+, 31.5% of instances had all three annotators agreeing, 58.1% had two annotators agreeing, and 10.3% had no agreement. For Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, the agreement was 35.4% for all three, 55.2% for two, and 9.3% for none.

The chart indicates that \"All\" annotators generally agree on most categories, with \"Two\" annotators agreeing in some cases and \"None\" in a few. This suggests that while there is a high level of agreement on some aspects, there is still room for variability, particularly in subjective areas like image quality and relevance.\n\nCombining these insights, we see that Chameleon's performance in terms of inter-annotator agreement is mixed. While there is a substantial level of agreement in absolute evaluations, especially on objective questions like safety and task fulfillment, relative evaluations show more variability, with significant disagreement in some cases. This variability is reflected in the win rates of Chameleon over other models, where it often wins but also loses in a notable percentage of comparisons [10].\n\nIn conclusion, Chameleon demonstrates competitive performance with varying levels of inter-annotator agreement, indicating its strength in fulfilling tasks and generating relevant responses, but also highlighting"}

As shown in image7, the process begins with **cropping** the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, followed by **resizing** these cropped regions to a fixed proportion. This ensures that each object is adequately represented for further analysis. Additionally, a **blurring** technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest, directing the model's focus toward the relevant objects and facilitating their identification.

These embeddings are then stored in an external memory, as depicted in image6. The memory serves as a repository for multimodal embeddings, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information. The retrieval process utilizes **k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)** to find the most similar embeddings, linking each bounding box to possible labels stored in the memory [6][11].\n\nFollowing retrieval, the system integrates the retrieved category labels alongside the image embeddings into a **ranking prompt** for the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The MLLMs, leveraging their extensive knowledge base and advanced linguistic and semantic analysis, rank the retrieved class names based on contextual appropriateness with the input image.

For instance, quote [5] mentions that both stacking methods outperform previous state-of-the-art results, but fine-tuning yields the most substantial gains. This is further supported by image5, which shows that \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieves the highest F1 scores on both development and test datasets, surpassing \"CNN Large + ELMo\" and \"ELMoBASE.\" This indicates that fine-tuning allows the model to adapt more effectively to the specific characteristics of the downstream tasks, leading to improved performance.\n\nAdditionally, stacking task-specific architectures on top of pre-trained representations also improves performance. Quote [11] discusses stacking approaches, and image6 illustrates that \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" outperforms other models, including BERT models, on both development and test datasets. This suggests that combining pre-trained models with task-specific architectures and fine-tuning is a powerful strategy for enhancing performance across various NLP tasks.\n\nThe text also emphasizes the importance of the cloze-driven training regime over predicting left and right tokens separately, as noted in quote [1]. This novel training approach likely contributes to the superior performance of models like \"cloze\" in image1, which achieves an average score of 80.9 across all tasks, compared to \"bilm\" with 79.7.\n\nMoreover, the amount of training data plays a crucial role. Quote [3] and image8 both indicate that more training data leads to higher GLUE scores, with the trend showing an upward progression as the number of tokens increases. This aligns with the findings in quote [10], which states that multi-sentence training examples are more effective for tasks involving sentence pairs, such as RTE, where there is a significant accuracy gap between News Crawl and Common Crawl data.\n\nIn summary, fine-tuning and stacking architectures, combined with sufficient training data, are critical factors in enhancing the performance of CNN models on NLP tasks. Fine-tuning allows for better adaptation to specific tasks, while stacking architectures leverages the strengths of pre-trained models.

According to [2], CNN Large generally performs better than CNN Base, especially on tasks like SST-2 and MRPC. However, BERT_LARGE, as shown in image2, demonstrates superior performance across most tasks, particularly on CoLA, QNLI, and RTE. This suggests that while CNN Large improves over its base version, BERT_LARGE outperforms both CNN models on a broader range of tasks.\n\nNext, considering the implications of increasing training data size on the average GLUE score, [5] and image7 provide insights. Image7 shows a line graph indicating a positive correlation between the amount of Common Crawl data used for pretraining and the average GLUE score. As the number of training tokens increases from 562M to 18B, the average GLUE score also rises, suggesting that more pretraining data typically leads to better performance. This aligns with [4], which states that pretraining continues to improve performance up to 18B tokens and likely would continue to do so with more data.\n\nFurthermore, [6] and image5 highlight that fine-tuning significantly enhances model performance. For instance, \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" achieves the highest F1 scores on both development and test datasets, surpassing both ELMo and BERT models. This indicates that fine-tuning is crucial for optimizing performance, as also noted in [9], where fine-tuning gives the biggest gain.\n\nIn summary, while CNN Large improves over CNN Base, BERT_LARGE outperforms both in most tasks. Increasing training data size positively impacts the average GLUE score, as shown in image7, and fine-tuning further enhances performance, as evidenced by the high scores of \"CNN Large + fine-tune\" in image5.\n\n![Fine-tuning significantly enhances model performance](image5)"}

As more Common Crawl data is used for pretraining, the average GLUE score increases, indicating a positive correlation between data volume and performance. This trend is consistent across different datasets, with models trained on larger amounts of data achieving higher scores. For instance, the table in image6 shows that models trained on 18 billion tokens of Common Crawl data outperform those trained on smaller datasets like News Crawl, which contains individual sentences. The CNN Base model, trained on 600K updates, demonstrates this effect, with performance improving as more data is added. The table in image7 further supports this by showing that BERT_LARGE, which benefits from extensive pretraining data, achieves the highest scores across multiple tasks. The detailed analysis in the text [3][4][8][10] confirms that more data for pretraining improves performance, especially when retaining paragraph structure, as seen in Common Crawl compared to News Crawl.

According to [1], using BooksCorpus and Wikipedia, with their varying sentence lengths, can lead to different performance outcomes on various tasks. The strategy of concatenating training examples into a single string and cropping blocks of 512 tokens (BWiki-blck) did not outperform using the data as is (BWiki-sent). This suggests that the structure and length of training examples are important. Image6 shows that models trained on Common Crawl data, which contains multi-sentence examples, perform better on tasks like RTE compared to News Crawl, which consists of individual sentences. This aligns with [3], indicating that multi-sentence training examples are more effective for tasks involving sentence pairs.\n\nSecondly, the modeling approach also affects performance. Image1 illustrates that the cloze modeling approach outperforms the bilm approach and that combining both does not improve results over cloze alone. This supports [4], which states that individual left and right context prediction tasks are not as effective as center word prediction. The cloze loss, which predicts the center word given all context, is more effective.\n\nImage7 shows a positive correlation between the amount of Common Crawl data used for pretraining and the average GLUE score, reinforcing [7] and [10]. More pretraining data generally leads to better performance, with the trend continuing up to 18B tokens.\n\nFinally, fine-tuning further enhances performance. Image4 and Image5 demonstrate that fine-tuning the CNN Large model leads to higher F1 scores on development and test datasets compared to using ELMo or BERT models. This aligns with [9], which shows that fine-tuning provides the biggest gain in performance when stacking task-specific architectures.\n\nIn summary, the combination of pretraining on multi-sentence data and using a cloze-driven modeling approach, along with fine-tuning, leads to improved performance on NLP tasks.

For instance, when using a single encoder for multiple source languages, aligning the embeddings helps the model learn more effectively by placing the word embeddings of the source languages in similar vector spaces, facilitating easier learning of correspondences between languages [2]. However, the results from Table 4 show that alignment was not universally beneficial, with gains or losses being insignificant across all languages [7]. This suggests that while alignment might be helpful in some cases, it is not always necessary, especially in bilingual scenarios [8].\n\nThe image data provides specific insights. Image 3 shows that for most language pairs, aligning embeddings resulted in minimal changes to BLEU scores, with some even showing slight decreases (e.g., GL → EN decreased by 1.3, PT → EN decreased by 0.2). However, for RU → EN, alignment led to a slight improvement (+0.3). This indicates that the impact of alignment can vary by language pair, with some benefiting more than others.\n\nImage 2 further supports this by showing that alignment consistently improved the evaluation metric scores across different training setups, but the extent of improvement varied. For example, alignment increased the score from 9.6 to 11.6 for BE + RU evaluated on BE, suggesting that alignment can be beneficial in certain bilingual setups.\n\nIn summary, while aligning word embeddings can improve BLEU scores in some bilingual scenarios, especially when using a single encoder for multiple languages, the overall impact is not consistently positive across all language pairs. The effectiveness of alignment seems to depend on the specific languages involved and the training setup. Thus, alignment may be more beneficial in multilingual training scenarios where a shared embedding space can facilitate learning across languages, but it may not be necessary or effective in all bilingual setups.\n\n![Alignment can be beneficial in bilingual scenarios with a single encoder but is not universally effective across all language pairs.](image3)"}

However, RU and HE, which are more linguistically distant from the target language, show larger gains. This is attributed to their lower baseline BLEU scores, indicating that systems with more room for improvement benefit more from pre-training [1]. The hypothesis is that pre-training makes the embedding space more consistent, with semantically similar words closer together, which is more beneficial for similar language pairs [3]. \n\nThe table in image1 shows translation datasets from various source languages to Portuguese, categorized by language family. The improvement in pre-processed metrics (pre) is highest for HE → PT (+8.9) and RU → PT (+6.2), which are less linguistically similar to Portuguese, supporting the idea that pre-training is more effective for distant language pairs [1][3][11].\n\nTraining set size also plays a crucial role. As seen in image2, pre-training results in higher BLEU scores, especially with limited training data. The gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes and decreases as the dataset size increases [4][12]. This suggests a sweet spot where pre-training is most effective, particularly in low-resource scenarios [12].\n\nLanguage similarity is another key factor. The hypothesis that pre-trained embeddings are more effective for more similar translation pairs is supported by Table 5 [11]. When applying pre-trained embeddings, the gains are in order of similarity, with GL/PT showing the largest gains and BE/RU showing a small decrease [11]. This aligns with the idea that similar languages have more similar semantic neighborhoods, enhancing the efficacy of pre-training [3].\n\nIn multilingual systems, aligning embedding spaces between source languages is beneficial. Image6 shows that aligning embeddings generally improves scores, especially for similar language pairs like GL/PT, where the gain is significant [11]. This is because a single encoder can learn more efficiently when embeddings are in similar vector spaces [11].\n\nOverall, pre-training is most effective in low-resource scenarios with moderately effective baseline systems and for more similar language pairs.

This alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the source languages are in similar vector spaces, facilitating easier learning of correspondences between languages. However, [6] notes that a priori alignment of embeddings was not beneficial in bilingual scenarios, suggesting that alignment may not always be necessary for simpler translation tasks.\n\nThe observed differences in F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency in the training corpus, as shown in image6, indicate that pre-training improves translation accuracy across the entire vocabulary, especially for low-frequency words.

For instance, removing R-GCN results in a drop of 8.0 points in accuracy on the unmasked validation set [4]. This highlights the importance of R-GCN in updating mention representations based on their relations to other mentions. The table in image4 further illustrates this, showing that the \"GloVe w/o R-GCN\" configuration has lower performance (51.2 for unmasked and 11.6 for masked) compared to the \"GloVe with R-GCN\" configuration (59.2 for unmasked and 11.1 for masked), confirming the critical role of R-GCN in improving performance.\n\nRegarding relation types, the text indicates that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections [7]. This is because most connections are within the same document, and removing these connections removes crucial information. The table in image4 supports this by showing that removing DOC-BASED connections (\"No DOC–BASED\") results in lower performance (62.9 for unmasked and 65.8 for masked) compared to the full model. However, removing MATCH (\"No MATCH\") or COREF (\"No COREF\") connections has a less significant impact, with performance drops of 0.8 and 0.5 points, respectively, in the unmasked condition.\n\nThe image7 table provides a broader context, showing that the \"Entity-GCN\" models, which utilize R-GCN and relation types, outperform other models, especially the ensemble model (Entity-GCN*), achieving the highest scores on both unmasked and masked sets.

This suggests that while coreference is beneficial, its absence does not drastically affect performance in this context [6].\n\nIn the masked setting, however, the coreference system leads to a performance degradation. The Entity-GCN with coreference model shows a masked development accuracy of 65.3%, which is lower than the 70.5% achieved without coreference. This indicates that the coreference system may struggle with the masked data, possibly due to the complexity of the test documents or the limitations of the coreference resolution system in handling masked entities [8].\n\nThe graph in image1 illustrates how coreference links (bold-red lines) connect mentions referring to the same entity, which is crucial for understanding entity relationships.

This highlights the complexity of managing multiple entities in a sentence, where the presence of more entities can introduce noise and reduce the model's ability to accurately extract relations.\n\nIn summary, iterative processes in CorefProp and RelProp improve F1 scores by refining entity and relation extraction through repeated information propagation, while the number of entities in a sentence poses a challenge that affects relation extraction performance, with DyGIE demonstrating better resilience compared to DyGIE-RelProp."}

The study explores the impact of pretraining (PRET) and multi-task learning (MULT) on aspect-level sentiment classification, comparing different model configurations.\n\nFirst, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through performance metrics on four datasets: D1, D2, D3, and D4. The table in image1 shows that the combined approach of PRET and MULT (Ours: PRET+MULT) frequently outperforms other methods, particularly in Macro-F1 scores, as indicated by the asterisks. This suggests that incorporating document-level knowledge significantly enhances model performance.\n\nThe datasets' characteristics, as shown in image2, reveal that D3 and D4 have a very small number of neutral examples, which can heavily affect precision and recall. This imbalance is crucial because even a small prediction difference can lead to significant changes in performance metrics, such as a 10% increase in recall with just 5 more correctly identified neutral examples.\n\nThe impact of varying the percentage of document-level training examples is illustrated in image3. The graphs show that increasing the percentage of document-level training examples consistently improves both accuracy and Macro-F1 scores across all datasets. Notably, Model D4 shows the most significant improvements, especially in Macro-F1 scores, highlighting its sensitivity to additional document-level data.\n\nFurther analysis in image4 examines the performance of different model settings, such as using only the LSTM, embeddings, or output layer. The key observations are:\n- Transfer is beneficial in all settings, with improvements even when only one layer is transferred.\n- Transfers of the LSTM and embedding layers are more effective than the output layer, aligning with expectations since the output layer is more task-specific.\n- The embedding layer transfer is particularly helpful for D3 and D4, possibly due to the unbalanced label distribution and the need for better sentiment capture in these datasets.\n\nThese findings indicate that document-level knowledge transfer, especially through pretraining and multi-task learning, enhances model performance by addressing the limitations of small aspect-level datasets.

This suggests that while TRADE can adapt to unseen domains, its performance is not as robust as in domains it has been trained on. The heatmap in image5 shows that certain slot embeddings, like \"destination\" and \"departure,\" have high similarity, which might contribute to TRADE's ability to transfer knowledge across domains, but this transfer is not perfect, as evidenced by the lower zero-shot accuracy.\n\nThe diagram in image1 illustrates the components of TRADE, including the utterance encoder, slot gate, and state generator, which are shared across domains. This architecture facilitates knowledge transfer, as described in text quote [2], allowing TRADE to handle unknown slot values and adapt to new domains. However, the error rates in image4 indicate that some slots, such as \"restaurant-name,\" still pose challenges, affecting zero-shot performance.\n\nOverall, TRADE excels in multi-domain settings but faces challenges in zero-shot scenarios, as seen in the error analysis in image2 and the performance comparison in image7.

This is particularly notable in the restaurant domain, where TRADE's joint accuracy is significantly higher than others, highlighting its effectiveness in handling complex dialogue states.\n\nIn domain adaptation scenarios, TRADE's performance is further enhanced through fine-tuning strategies. As shown in Table 5, fine-tuning TRADE with GEM maintains higher performance on the original four domains, with a joint accuracy drop of only 5.44% on the hotel domain compared to naive fine-tuning, which sees a 22.9% drop. This indicates that GEM effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, allowing TRADE to adapt to new domains while retaining knowledge from previous domains. The table also shows that fine-tuning from the base model generally outperforms training from scratch on new domains, with TRADE achieving 59.83% joint accuracy on a new domain using only 1% of the new domain data, compared to 44.24% when training from scratch.\n\nThe zero-shot performance of TRADE is also noteworthy, as seen in Table 6.

This highlights the challenge of accurately translating gender in languages with grammatical gender systems. The performance of machine translation systems is heavily influenced by gender stereotypes, as shown by the consistently higher accuracy in translating stereotypical gender roles compared to non-stereotypical ones [2]. For instance, Figure 2 illustrates that Google Translate's accuracy is higher for stereotypical roles (e.g., female nurse) than for anti-stereotypical roles (e.g., male receptionist) across all tested languages [2]. This trend is consistent across other systems as well [2].\n\nThe table in image1 provides a detailed breakdown of accuracy and error metrics for different translation services across various languages, showing significant variations in performance. For example, Google Translate has high accuracy in French (63.6) and Hebrew (53.7), but significant \"Δ_G\" variations, especially in Arabic (43.7), indicating issues with grammatical gender handling [image1].

According to text quote [1], training on adversarial distractors helps recover most of the original accuracy in single-hop tasks, increasing the F1 score from 40.73 to 58.42. This suggests that adversarial training is effective in enhancing model robustness against biased distractors. Similarly, text quote [4] shows that retraining on adversarial distractors improves the F1 score from 46.84 to 60.10 for single-paragraph BERT, indicating that adversarial training can significantly boost performance.\n\nIn multi-hop tasks, the F1 scores vary based on the type of questions. Image1 categorizes questions into multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop, with F1 scores of 54.46, 56.16, and 70.54, respectively. This indicates that single-hop questions are easier and achieve higher F1 scores compared to multi-hop questions. Text quote [3] explains that comparison questions are grouped into these categories based on reasoning requirements, with multi-hop questions being more challenging.\n\nThe evaluation settings also play a crucial role. Image7 shows that the F1 score for single-paragraph BERT drops from 67.08 in the \"Distractor\" setting to 38.40 in the \"Open-domain 10 Paragraphs\" setting, but improves to 53.12 when a \"Gold Paragraph\" is added in the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting.

Training on adversarial data and evaluating on adversarial data with type filtering results in an F1 score of 58.42, compared to 40.73 when evaluated on adversarial data without type filtering. This demonstrates that type-matching during evaluation can significantly affect performance.\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies, such as adversarial training, type-matching, and providing relevant evidence, can significantly influence F1 scores in both multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks.

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the original ARCT dataset, which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance was found to be entirely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset [2]. By constructing an adversarial dataset that mirrors the distribution of cues around both labels, the researchers aimed to eliminate these spurious cues [8]. \n\nWhen evaluated on this adversarial dataset, BERT's performance dropped dramatically. The peak performance reduced to 53%, with mean and median scores at 50%, indicating that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminated the cues and provided a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [6]. This result aligns with the researchers' conclusion that BERT's high performance on the original dataset was not indicative of genuine understanding but rather exploitation of statistical biases [10]. \n\nThe adversarial dataset, which includes negated claims and inverted labels, ensures that models are not overfitting to specific cues present in the original data [9]. This setup highlights the necessity of using such adversarial datasets to obtain a more accurate assessment of a model's true comprehension abilities [3]. The table in image3 shows that BERT models trained on the adversarial dataset achieve much lower performance metrics, with mean scores around 0.50, further supporting the conclusion that the adversarial setup is effective in mitigating the exploitation of spurious statistics [3].\n\nMoreover, the adversarial dataset's design, which negates claims and inverts labels, ensures that the distribution of cues is balanced across labels, thus eliminating the signal that models like BERT were previously exploiting [8]. This approach underscores the importance of robust evaluation methods in NLP research to avoid misleadingly high performance due to spurious correlations [12].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset was largely due to exploiting statistical cues rather than genuine argument comprehension.

A low sensitivity means fewer options for attackers, while a low WER indicates fewer errors in word recognition. However, as noted in [5], a low WER alone is insufficient for robustness, and low sensitivity is also necessary. The text also highlights that different backoff strategies, such as pass-through, background, and neutral, affect these metrics differently. The neutral backoff variant is noted for its low sensitivity, which contributes to higher robustness [3], [8].\n\nThe images provide specific insights:\n\n- **Image 6** shows a table comparing closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies. For closed vocabulary models (word-only), the WER and sensitivity values are generally lower compared to open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece). For instance, the Pass-Through strategy in closed vocabulary models has a Swap error rate of 17.6, while in open vocabulary models, it's 39.6.

The \"gold chain\" setup involves only using documents leading to the correct answer, which significantly improves performance for both models [1]. The masking technique is used to prevent models from exploiting spurious statistical correlations [4]. The text also highlights that BiDAF generally outperforms FastQA, especially in the \"gold chain\" setup, where it achieves near-perfect scores [1], [7], [10].\n\nThe image3 provides a detailed breakdown of the performance scores for both models under these conditions. In the \"standard\" setup, BiDAF outperforms FastQA in both datasets. For WIKIHOP, BiDAF achieves 42.9% and 49.7% in the \"test\" and \"test*\" conditions, respectively, while FastQA scores 25.7% and 27.2%. In MEDHOP, BiDAF scores 47.8% and 61.2%, compared to FastQA's 23.1% and 24.5%.

According to [8], Seq2Seq models tend to produce shorter sentences with more common words compared to human responses. This is supported by image4, which shows that Seq2Seq has the lowest rare word percentages (0.4% for words appearing less than 100 times and 5.8% for words appearing less than 1,000 times). In contrast, the RetNRef⁺⁺ model, which boosts the use of retrieval, has higher rare word percentages (2.3% for words appearing less than 100 times and 10.9% for words appearing less than 1,000 times), making its word statistics closer to human responses. This indicates that RetNRef⁺⁺ is better at incorporating rare words, which is a positive step towards more engaging conversations.\n\nNext, let's examine the performance metrics. Image3 provides a detailed comparison of methods based on Engagingness, Fluency, Consistency, and Persona. Seq2Seq has lower Engagingness scores (2.70 and 2.76) compared to RetNRef⁺⁺, which has the highest Engagingness score of 3.80. This aligns with [1], which states that RetNRef⁺⁺ provides more engaging conversations according to human judgments. Additionally, RetNRef⁺⁺ shows improvements in Fluency and Consistency, though it performs slightly worse in maintaining Persona compared to Seq2Seq.\n\nRegarding human-like conversational abilities, image1 illustrates how different systems respond in various conversational contexts. The RetNRef⁺ system often provides more relevant and coherent responses compared to Seq2Seq and MemNet, as seen in the table. This supports [6], which notes that RetNRef⁺ effectively learns when to choose the retrieval utterance and when to generate independently, leading to better performance.\n\nImage2 shows the performance distribution of different methods across percentage categories. RetNRef⁺⁺ has the highest percentage in the >80% category (53%), indicating it is the most effective method in this context. This aligns with [9], which states that RetNRef⁺⁺ has over 80% word overlap with the retriever output around half the time, demonstrating its ability to use the retriever while also generating novel content.\n\nFinally, image5 compares retrieval methods"}

The increase in comprehensive income is slightly less than the net income due to a net other comprehensive loss of $79 million in 2021, compared to a gain of $107 million in 2020 and a loss of $114 million in 2019.\n\nKey factors contributing to these changes include:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth**: Revenues increased by 43% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 64% increase in QCT revenues and a 26% increase in QTL revenues. This growth was primarily due to increased demand for 5G products and a recovery from COVID-19 impacts [9][10].\n\n2. **Acquisitions**: The acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion, net of cash acquired, and the pending acquisition of Veoneer for approximately $4.5 billion, which is expected to enhance the company's automotive technology offerings [7][10].\n\n3. **Cost Management**: While costs and expenses also increased, the growth in revenues outpaced the increase in expenses, leading to higher operating income [6][10].\n\n4. **Investment Gains**: QSI earnings before income taxes increased by $927 million, primarily due to higher net gains on investments [10].\n\n5. **Tax Considerations**: Cash amounts paid for income taxes were $1.5 billion in 2021, which is higher than the previous years but still lower than the revenue growth [5].\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the significant increase in net and comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous years.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income for fiscal year 2021 compared to previous years](image7)"}

The total liabilities increased from $422,393 million in 2020 to $443,854 million in 2021, a rise of $21,461 million [image1]. This increase was primarily driven by higher unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the \"Insurance and Other\" category, which grew from $79,854 million to $86,664 million, and unearned premiums, which rose from $21,395 million to $23,512 million. Additionally, the \"Railroad, Utilities, and Energy\" segment's liabilities remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from $98,072 million to $97,900 million [image1].\n\nShareholders' equity also saw significant growth, with consolidated shareholders' equity increasing from $506.2 billion in 2020 to $569.2 billion in 2021 [1]. This growth was bolstered by net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders of $89.8 billion, which included substantial after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [1]. The equity accounting treatment of Pilot, a significant investment, and the anticipated full consolidation of Pilot's financials in 2023, will further enhance shareholders' equity [3].\n\nThe changes in liabilities and equity were influenced by various factors, including the repayment and issuance of debt, with Berkshire repaying $2.2 billion of senior notes and issuing $2.2 billion of new notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.5% [5]. The reduction in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years' retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million also positively impacted pre-tax earnings [12]. Furthermore, the company's strong capital base and high levels of capital strength in its insurance subsidiaries, rated exceptionally by Standard & Poor’s and A.M.

In 2019, the company's capital expenditures were $1,276 million, while in 2020, this figure decreased to $1,087 million, indicating a reduction in spending [6][12]. This decrease in capital expenditures was part of a broader trend of cost reductions and strategic adjustments in response to lower global project spending and reduced growth projects in the Chemical segment [10][12]. The company also issued $23 billion in long-term debt in 2020 to strengthen liquidity, which contributed to a rise in gross debt to $68 billion by the end of the year [2].\n\nRegarding taxes, ExxonMobil's total taxes on the income statement dropped from $38.5 billion in 2019 to $22.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of $15.7 billion [8][9].

These assumptions include:\n\n- **Risk-free interest rates** based on U.S. Treasury yields at the time of grant.\n- **Expected volatilities** based on historical volatility of the company's common stock and implied volatility from exchange-traded options.\n- **Expected dividend yields** based on the per share cash dividend paid by the company.\n- **Forfeiture rates** and **expected lives of options** granted, which are estimated using historical data and exercise patterns.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, are provided in image6, which shows the breakdown of payments over the years:\n\n- **2021:** $865 million\n- **2022:** $775 million\n- **2023:** $646 million\n- **2024:** $538 million\n- **2025:** $441 million\n- **Thereafter:** $1,781 million\n\nThe total future minimum lease payments amount to $5,046 million, with an imputed interest of $599 million, resulting in a total of $4,447 million.\n\nComparing these two sets of data, we observe that the assumptions for stock option valuation are primarily related to the company's financial and market conditions, such as interest rates, volatility, and dividend yields, which are used to estimate the fair value of stock options. These assumptions are forward-looking and based on historical data and market conditions at the time of grant. In contrast, the future minimum lease payments are a fixed obligation based on contractual agreements and represent a known financial commitment over time.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption for stock options is particularly relevant here, as it is used in the valuation model to discount future cash flows.

In 2020, the company reported a net loss, which transitioned to a significant net income in 2021. This improvement was driven by various factors, including higher realizations, the absence of impairments and write-offs, and favorable foreign currency effects. Specifically, the U.S. upstream segment reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments [4]. Similarly, the international upstream segment saw earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $825 million in 2020, largely due to higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [7]. The U.S. downstream segment also improved, reporting earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020, driven by higher margins on refined product sales and higher sales volumes [12]. These improvements in earnings across segments contributed to a positive net income in 2021.\n\nRegarding return on stockholders' equity, the company's financial highlights indicate that this metric is included in the financial data, though specific figures are not detailed in the provided text quotes [3]. However, the overall improvement in net income suggests a positive impact on return on stockholders' equity, as this ratio is calculated by dividing net income by stockholders' equity. The increase in net income from a loss in 2020 to a substantial profit in 2021 would likely result in a higher return on stockholders' equity, assuming stockholders' equity remained relatively stable or increased.\n\nThe image3 provides a table with financial data over three years, including bold numbers for 2021, which likely highlight significant changes. The bold numbers for 2021, such as 1,814, 7,709, and 2,454, could represent key financial metrics, including net income or components contributing to it, showing a positive trend compared to previous years [3].

These measures exclude certain items such as the mark-to-market net impact, restructuring and impairment charges, inventory fair value adjustments, and merger and integration charges [4]. The table in image2 shows the financial data for various segments, including APAC, comparing reported GAAP measures to core, non-GAAP measures by accounting for these items [2].\n\nLooking at image2, the table presents the financial results for the APAC segment for both 2020 and 2019. The reported GAAP measure for APAC in 2020 is not explicitly provided, but we can infer that the core, non-GAAP measure for APAC in 2020 is part of the total non-GAAP measure of $10,531 million, which is slightly lower than the 2019 total of $10,602 million. This suggests a decrease in the core, non-GAAP measure for APAC in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nThe main factors affecting these changes are detailed in the table. The impact of foreign exchange translation had a negative effect on the APAC segment, with a 10% impact [4]. Additionally, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative impact of 10% on the APAC segment [4]. These adjustments are part of the items affecting comparability that are excluded in the non-GAAP measure, which aims to provide a clearer picture of operational performance by removing these one-time or non-recurring items.\n\nIn summary, the APAC segment's reported GAAP measure likely decreased in 2020 due to the negative impacts of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions/divestitures. The core, non-GAAP measure, which excludes these items, also showed a decrease, indicating that the underlying operational performance was affected by these factors.\n\n![The table provides a financial comparison between the years 2020 and 2019, focusing on three key metrics: Net Revenue, Operating Profit, and Operating Profit Margin.](image8)\n\nThe APAC segment's reported GAAP measure decreased in 202"}

This decline can be attributed to several factors, as detailed in the financial data provided.\n\nFirstly, the net income itself decreased from $6,025.4 million in 2019 to $4,730.5 million in 2020 [7]. This reduction in net income is a primary contributor to the overall decrease in comprehensive income. The operating income also decreased by 23% in constant currencies for 2020, excluding strategic gains and charges [8]. This indicates operational challenges that impacted the bottom line.\n\nSecondly, the other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, was negative $104.1 million in 2020, compared to a positive $126.8 million in 2019 and a negative $431.1 million in 2018 [7]. The negative value in 2020 was largely due to significant losses in cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans, which were $123.3 million and $43.9 million, respectively [7]. These losses offset the gains from foreign currency translation adjustments, which were $63.1 million in 2020 [7].\n\nAdditionally, the sale of McDonald's Japan stock contributed a net pre-tax strategic gain of $268 million in 2020, which positively impacted the financials but was not enough to offset the overall decline in net income [1]. This strategic gain is reflected in the increase in cash and equivalents, which rose from $898.5 million in 2019 to $3,449.1 million in 2020, primarily due to the sale of the stock [9].\n\nThe decrease in comprehensive income also reflects the broader economic impact of COVID-19, which affected the restaurant industry, including McDonald's. The heavily franchised business model, while designed to generate stable revenue, faced challenges due to government regulations and reduced sales [11].

This decline was primarily due to the lingering effects of the pandemic, which led to delays in cancer care and a weak flu season that dampened generics sales [2]. \n\nThe image data provides a detailed breakdown of these changes. Image2 shows that Sandoz's operating income dropped from $2,334 million in 2020 to $2,064 million in 2021, a 12% decrease in USD and 14% in constant currencies.

This indicates a decrease in the net value of solar energy systems specifically. However, when considering the broader PP&E category, the increase in gross values and the decrease in accumulated depreciation from 2019 to 2020 suggest an overall increase in the net value of PP&E.\n\nCombining these insights, the total net value of solar energy systems and PP&E likely increased from 2019 to 2020, despite the decrease in the net value of solar energy systems alone, due to the significant increase in PP&E values and the reduction in accumulated depreciation.\n\n![The table shows financial data related to solar energy systems for the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.

The distribution of these categories across different regions is crucial for understanding the financial performance. According to image6, the percentage split between Beverage and Food/Snack for each region remains relatively stable from 2018 to 2020, with slight variations in AMESA. For instance, in AMESA, the Beverage category decreased from 45% in 2018 to 30% in 2020, while the Food/Snack category increased from 55% to 70% over the same period. This shift might indicate a strategic focus on food/snack products in this region.\n\nLooking at the net revenue data in image1, we see that the total net revenue increased from $64,661 million in 2018 to $70,372 million in 2020. The United States, Mexico, and China show significant growth, while Russia and the United Kingdom show slight declines. This growth in net revenue is reflected in the operating profit changes as well. From the text quotes, operating profit increased by 24% in 2020, primarily due to net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring and impairment charges [6]. However, operating profit decreased by 2% in another period, driven by operating cost increases and net revenue growth [7].\n\nThe operating profit data for each division from image2 shows that PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) had the highest net revenue and operating profit in 2020, followed by FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) and QFNA (Quaker Foods North America). The operating profit for PBNA increased significantly, which aligns with its higher percentage of Beverage sales (45% of PepsiCo's total) as per image6. This suggests that the Beverage category, particularly in North America, contributed significantly to the operating profit growth.\n\nThe distribution of beverage and food/snack categories, as seen in image6, might influence the operating profit trends. For example, the consistent high percentage of Beverage sales in Europe (55%) could explain the stable operating profit in that"}

This dramatic shift was primarily due to the financing of the acquisition of Varian, which required substantial capital. The table in image3 highlights this change, showing a massive increase in cash flows from financing activities, reflecting the company's efforts to secure funding for the acquisition [5]. Additionally, Siemens Healthineers received €10 billion in borrowings and an additional €850 million from the Siemens Group to finance the Varian acquisition, contributing to the positive cash flow [9]. These inflows were partly offset by repayments of matured loans totaling €730 million and €300 million [9].\n\n**Investing Activities**:\nCash outflows from investing activities also saw a significant increase, rising from €-1,912 million in 2020 to €-14,140 million in 2021 [6]. The primary driver of this increase was the payout for the acquisition of Varian, which accounted for the bulk of the outflow [6]. The table in image4 confirms this, showing a substantial increase in additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, mainly for capacity expansions [6]. This aligns with the company's strategy to enhance competitiveness and innovation capability, as mentioned in the text [8].\n\n**Key Factors**:\nThe acquisition of Varian was the central factor influencing both financing and investing activities. The need to finance this acquisition led to increased borrowing and cash inflows from the Siemens Group, while the acquisition itself required substantial cash outflows for the purchase and subsequent investments in capacity and technology [5][6][8][9]. The table in image3 and image4 provide concrete figures that illustrate these changes, showing the significant impact of the acquisition on the company's financial flows.\n\nIn summary, Siemens Healthineers' cash flows from financing and investing activities were heavily influenced by the acquisition of Varian, resulting in increased cash inflows from financing to support the deal and substantial cash outflows for the acquisition and related investments.

This positive shift was driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Net Income Improvement**: The net income attributable to common stockholders transitioned from a loss of $1,063 million in 2018 to a gain of $862 million in 2020. This turnaround was primarily due to increased revenues and operational efficiencies, as seen in the revenue streams detailed in image1, which showed substantial growth across various categories such as automotive sales and energy generation and storage sales.\n\n2. **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**: There was a significant improvement in foreign currency translation adjustments, which contributed positively to comprehensive income. In 2020, these adjustments were $399 million, compared to losses of $42 million in 2018. This improvement reflects better management of foreign currency risks and possibly favorable exchange rate movements, as noted in image3.\n\n3. **Reduction in Losses from Noncontrolling Interests**: The comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries increased from a loss of $87 million in 2019 to a gain of $141 million in 2020. This reduction in losses also positively impacted the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders, as shown in image3.\n\n4. **Operational and Financial Management**: The company's focus on operational efficiencies and financial management, as mentioned in text quote [3], contributed to the overall improvement in financial performance. This included managing stock-based compensation expenses and reducing certain operating expenses, as detailed in text quote [1].\n\n5. **Cash Flow Management**: The strong net cash provided by operating activities, as seen in image8, which increased from $2,098 million in 2018 to $5,943 million in 2020, indicates improved cash generation and financial health, supporting the overall financial performance.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders improved dramatically from 2018 to 2020 due to a combination of increased net income, favorable foreign currency adjustments, and better management of noncontrolling interests, alongside robust cash flow management and operational efficiencies.\n\n![Comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders improved from a loss of $1,0"}

This indicates a slight decline in profitability relative to sales. The decrease can be attributed to various factors, including commodity inflation and COVID-19-related costs, as mentioned in the text quotes [5] and [6]. Despite these challenges, the zone managed to maintain a positive organic growth rate of 0.5%, driven by flat Real Internal Growth (RIG) and slight pricing adjustments [6].\n\nIn contrast, **Other businesses** reported an underlying trading operating profit margin of 19.6% in 2020, which was an increase of 90 basis points from the previous year.

The improvement in earnings is evident from the table in image6, which details the earnings for each segment and year.\n\n**Downstream Segment:**\n- **2021 Earnings:** $2,914 million\n- **2020 Earnings:** $47 million\n\nThe Downstream segment also improved its earnings from $47 million in 2020 to $2,914 million in 2021. However, the increase is not as dramatic as in the Upstream segment. The earnings are closely tied to refining margins, which can be volatile and influenced by crude oil prices and other factors [5].

This reduction is likely due to the classification of $768 million of net properties, plant, and equipment as \"Assets held for sale\" [7].

The fair value of these instruments is recognized in the income statement as financial income or expenses [8]. The image quotes provide specific data on derivative financial instruments:\n\n- **Image2** shows that derivative financial instruments increased significantly from DKK 188 million in 2019 to DKK 2,332 million in 2020.

[4] explains that depreciation commences when an asset is available for use and is reviewed annually. [9] mentions that if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. [10] indicates that in 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized, primarily related to patents and licenses, which were expensed in research and development costs. [6] and [12] highlight that intangible assets not yet in use are tested annually for impairment, and those with an indefinite useful life are not amortized.\n\nThe image quotes provide detailed financial data. Image4 shows that total amortisation and impairment losses increased from DKK 1,469 million in 2019 to DKK 1,446 million in 2020, with a significant decrease in impairment losses from DKK 982 million in 2019 to DKK 350 million in 2020. Image5 and image6 offer insights into specific asset categories, such as patents and licenses, land and buildings, and other equipment, detailing their costs, additions, disposals, depreciation, and impairment losses.\n\nIn 2020, the total impairment losses decreased significantly compared to 2019, primarily due to a reduction in impairment losses on patents and licenses. This reduction in impairment losses, combined with the depreciation of assets, affected the net carrying amounts. Image5 and image6 show that despite the decrease in impairment losses, the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment were still impacted by depreciation. For instance, the balance of land and buildings decreased from DKK 3,029 million at the beginning of 2020 to DKK 2,901 million at the end, after accounting for depreciation and exchange rate adjustments.\n\nThe reversal of write-downs on prelaunch inventory in 2020, as mentioned in [5], also positively affected the net carrying amounts, contributing to a net positive income statement effect of D"}

The U.S. market saw a slight decrease in revenues, but this was offset by strategic marketing initiatives aimed at accelerating recovery and growth, such as the free Thank You Meals program for first responders and healthcare workers [1][12]. The International Operated Markets faced more substantial declines, driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in countries like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3]. Additionally, the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment also saw a decline, contributing to the overall revenue decrease [2][3].\n\nRestaurant margins also decreased by 13% in 2020, reflecting the same sales declines in the International Operated Markets, although positive sales performance in the U.S. partially offset this decline [8]. Franchised margins in the U.S. were affected by higher depreciation costs related to investments in Experience of the Future (EOTF) and additional marketing support [11].

According to the provided text and image quotes, the VIEs are crucial to the company's operations, generating nearly all of its revenues. In 2020 and 2021, the revenues from the VIEs accounted for 99.8% and 99.1% of total net revenues, respectively [9]. This indicates a slight decrease in the proportion of revenues from VIEs in 2021 compared to 2020, suggesting a marginal shift in revenue sources or a slight increase in revenues from other sources.\n\nRegarding total assets, the text states that as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the total assets of the VIEs, excluding amounts due from other companies in the Group, equaled 26.5% and 26.9% of the consolidated total assets, respectively [9]. This shows a slight increase in the proportion of total assets held by the VIEs in 2021 compared to 2020, indicating a growth in the VIEs' asset base relative to the company's overall assets.\n\nThe image7 table provides detailed financial metrics for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, including revenues and total assets for the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries. The table shows that the revenues for the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries increased from 2020 to 2021, reflecting growth in the business segment. Similarly, the total assets for the VIEs also increased, aligning with the text's observation of a higher percentage of total assets in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries experienced a slight decrease in the proportion of total revenues in 2021 but a slight increase in the proportion of total assets compared to 2020. This suggests that while the VIEs remain the primary revenue generator, their asset base has grown relative to the company's total assets, indicating a strengthening position within the corporate structure.\n\n![The table shows the financial performance of a parent company and its subsidiaries over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, with revenues and total assets for the VIE and its"}

This reduction is significant as it suggests a potential scaling back or optimization of these programs, possibly in response to market conditions or internal strategic shifts. The expenses for stock options decreased from $249 million in 2020 to $271 million in 2022, while RSUs and PSUs expenses saw a more pronounced drop from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022 [5][11]. This trend aligns with the company's strategy to manage compensation costs effectively, as noted in the text [10].\n\n**Net Earnings Per Share**:\n- The net earnings per share (EPS) for both basic and diluted categories increased over the same period. Basic EPS rose from $5.13 in 2020 to $6.00 in 2022, and diluted EPS increased from $4.96 in 2020 to $5.81 in 2022 [7][7]. This growth in EPS is driven by an increase in net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding, and a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment [9]. The decrease in shares outstanding, as seen in the table, from 2,625.8 million in 2020 to 2,539.1 million in 2022, contributes to the higher EPS figures [7].\n\n**Interplay of Trends**:\n- The decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, while net earnings per share increased, suggests that Procter & Gamble is effectively managing its compensation costs without significantly impacting its profitability. The reduction in shares outstanding, as seen in the table, indicates a possible buyback or other share reduction strategies, which can enhance EPS [10][7]. The company's ability to maintain or increase EPS despite these cost reductions reflects strong financial management and operational efficiency.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nProcter"}

The image3 provides specific figures for the United States and Foreign regions for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. According to image3, the income before income taxes for the United States increased from $5,004 million in 2020 to $8,781 million in 2021, while the income before income taxes for Foreign regions increased from $715 million in 2020 to $1,493 million in 2021. The total income before income taxes also rose from $5,719 million in 2020 to $10,274 million in 2021.\n\nRegarding foreign currency translation adjustments, image2 shows the adjustments for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The foreign currency translation adjustments were $41 million in 2019, not specified for 2020, and $6 million in 2021. This indicates a decrease in foreign currency translation adjustments from 2019 to 2021.\n\nAdditionally, the text [4] mentions that in fiscal 2019, there were significant tax benefits and charges related to foreign subsidiaries, including a $570 million tax benefit due to check-the-box elections and a $2.5 billion charge related to the derecognition of a deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property. These events impacted the effective tax rate and the total tax provision, as shown in image1, where the total effective tax provision was $3,095 million in 2019, compared to $1,231 million in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the components of income before income taxes increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, both in the U.S. and Foreign regions, while the foreign currency translation adjustments decreased from 2019 to 2021.\n\n![The table displays financial data related to various tax provisions and benefits for the years"}

This growth in comprehensive income is primarily driven by the substantial increase in net income, as the other comprehensive items, while still negative, have decreased in magnitude.\n\nThe table in image4 provides insights into the components of shareholders' equity, showing:\n\n- **Retained Earnings** decreased from $11,881 million in 2020 to $11,495 million in 2021, reflecting dividends paid and other distributions.\n- **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)** worsened slightly from $(2,895) million in 2020 to $(2,945) million in 2021, indicating continued negative adjustments, primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefits.\n\nThe decrease in retained earnings and the worsening of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) suggest that while net income was strong, the company faced challenges in other areas affecting shareholders' equity. However, the overall comprehensive income still improved due to the significant rise in net income, which outweighed the negative impacts of other comprehensive items.\n\nIn summary, the changes in shareholders' equity, particularly the decrease in retained earnings and the worsening of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), were partially offset by the substantial increase in net income, leading to an overall improvement in comprehensive income from 2019 to 2021.\n\n![The table provides financial details related to Shareholders"}

This increase was primarily driven by the issuance of new shares in March 2021 to finance the acquisition of Varian, which boosted issued capital and capital reserves [3]. The table in image4 confirms this growth, showing a detailed breakdown of equity components, where issued capital rose from €1,075 million to €1,128 million, and capital reserves increased from €13,476 million to €15,818 million.

The Committee recognized the evolving nature of climate change risks and ensured that these were appropriately considered in key judgements and estimates, aligning with the Paris Agreement goals [1]. This included evaluating the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, climate change scenarios, and their impact on portfolio, demand for commodities, and associated price outlooks, as well as the costs of decarbonization and Scope 3 emissions [2]. The Board also routinely discussed climate change as a material governance and strategic issue, incorporating it into strategy discussions, portfolio reviews, and investment decisions [6]. The Sustainability Committee played a crucial role in overseeing climate change performance and governance responsibilities, while the Risk and Audit Committee assisted with climate-related risk management oversight [6].\n\nDirector training was emphasized to equip Board members with the necessary understanding of climate change implications. Briefings and development sessions focused on providing Directors with a deeper understanding of climate change issues, alongside other key areas such as HSEC (Health, Safety, Environment, and Community) and public policy considerations [5]. Site visits, where possible, were conducted to ensure practical insights into operations and relevant issues, enhancing Directors' ability to make informed decisions [5].\n\nThe governance framework also ensured that climate change financial disclosures were consistent with narrative reporting and accounting assumptions, highlighting the importance of transparency and alignment in reporting [4]. The Board's commitment to continuous learning and adaptation was evident in its ongoing training and development programs, which included updates on climate-related matters [11].\n\nIn summary, BHP's governance framework in FY2021 effectively addressed climate change risks through strategic integration and oversight, while director training focused on enhancing understanding and practical insights into climate-related issues, ensuring a robust and informed approach to governance.\n\n![BHP's governance framework addresses climate change risks and director training by integrating climate considerations into strategic discussions, utilizing specialized committees, and providing targeted training and development sessions.](image4)"}

This growth can be attributed to several key factors, as detailed in the provided financial statements and tables.\n\nIn 2015, the total stockholders’ equity was $10,741 million. By the end of 2016, it had increased to $13,384 million, and by the end of 2017, it reached $19,285 million. The primary contributors to this growth were:\n\n1. **Net Income**: The company's net income played a crucial role in increasing retained earnings, a component of stockholders’ equity. In 2015, net income was $596 million, which was added to retained earnings. This increased to $2,371 million in 2016 and further to $3,033 million in 2017. These substantial net income figures directly boosted retained earnings, thereby increasing total stockholders’ equity.\n\n2. **Stock-Based Compensation**: The exercise of common stock options and adjustments related to stock-based compensation also contributed to the increase in additional paid-in capital. For instance, in 2015, the exercise of 6 shares added $4 million to additional paid-in capital. This trend continued in subsequent years, with additional shares being issued and adjustments made, further enhancing the equity.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Income**: Changes in other comprehensive income (loss) affected the equity. In 2015, there was a loss of $212 million, which reduced the equity. However, in 2017, comprehensive income gains of $501 million were added, positively impacting the equity.\n\n4. **Issuance of Shares**: The issuance of additional shares through stock options and other means increased the common stock component of equity.

The revenue increased from $6,719 million in FY2020 to $9,470 million in FY2021, and the underlying EBITDA rose from $3,535 million to $6,483 million. This improvement was partly due to a decrease in unit costs to $1.00 per pound in FY2021 from $1.01 per pound in FY2020, despite challenges like a 4% decline in copper concentrate feed grade and lower cathode volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions [2].

Specifically, the company implemented restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019 to align profits with activities and took advantage of the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) deduction, which is set to increase in fiscal 2027 [1]. Additionally, the company has been involved in tax audits and settlements, which affect the unrecognized tax benefits and the effective tax rate [2], [3], [4], [7], [8].\n\nLooking at the financial data in image1, we see the breakdown of income before taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The foreign income before taxes increased from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, indicating a significant growth over the period. This growth is likely due to the company's restructuring efforts and possibly increased foreign operations or improved market conditions in foreign regions.\n\nThe foreign tax provision, as shown in image4, provides insight into the tax provisions for foreign jurisdictions. In 2019, the foreign tax provision was a benefit of $407 million, which turned into a provision of $518 million in 2021. This change from a benefit to a provision suggests that the company's foreign operations became more taxable, possibly due to increased income or changes in tax regulations affecting foreign earnings.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the company's financial strategy could be significant. The increase in foreign income before taxes suggests that the company is expanding its international presence or improving its foreign market performance. However, the shift from a tax benefit to a tax provision indicates that the company may face higher tax liabilities in foreign jurisdictions, which could affect cash flows and profitability. The company might need to adjust its strategies to manage these increased tax liabilities, possibly by optimizing its tax structure, exploring tax treaties, or investing in jurisdictions with more favorable tax environments.\n\nMoreover, the company's decision to assert that certain foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested, as mentioned"}

The sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, resulted in a major outflow of $587.1 billion, drastically reducing the assets under management to zero by the end of 2021. This aligns with the announcement in February 2021 to sell WFAM, which was completed in November 2021, as noted in the text [11]. The table in image4 highlights these financial movements, showing the impact of the sale on the overall assets managed.\n\nRegarding available-for-sale securities, the table in image3 indicates a decrease in the amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, from $215,533 million in 2020 to $175,463 million in 2021. Despite this decrease, the company continued to purchase these securities, which, along with transfers from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, helped manage the portfolio for capital purposes [4]. The net unrealized gains also decreased from $4,859 million to $1,781 million, driven by higher interest rates [1]. The fair value of available-for-sale securities dropped from $220,392 million to $177,244 million, reflecting market conditions and strategic portfolio adjustments.\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in managed assets, while available-for-sale securities saw a decrease in net unrealized gains and fair value, influenced by interest rate changes and strategic portfolio management.\n\n![WFAM assets under management changes due to sale](image4)  \n![Available-for-sale securities changes in amortized cost and fair value](image3)"}

This growth was primarily driven by increases in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as total loans, which rose from $887,637 million to $895,394 million, indicating a strategic focus on maintaining and expanding its loan portfolio [4][5][8]. The slight increase in total assets, despite the sale of WFAM, suggests a balanced approach to asset management, focusing on core banking activities while divesting non-core assets.\n\nRegarding WFAM, the sale of this business on November 1, 2021, marked a significant strategic shift. The table detailing WFAM assets under management shows that the balance at the beginning of 2021 was $603.0 billion, with inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $(96.8) billion, resulting in a net decrease. The market impact added $11.6 billion, but the sale itself reduced the balance by $(587.1) billion, leading to an end-of-period balance of $0 billion [8]. This sale, which generated net gains of $269 million, aligns with the company's strategy to streamline operations and focus on core banking services, reducing complexity and improving capital efficiency [5][7].\n\nThe sale of WFAM and the associated changes in assets under management highlight a strategic pivot towards core banking activities, with a focus on liquidity and interest rate risk management. The company's decision to rebalance its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios in response to changing economic conditions further underscores this focus, as seen in the increased amortized cost and net unrealized gains in these portfolios [2][6][8].

This growth was driven by significant increases in revenue from Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC), particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, which saw a 90% increase [image1]. However, Global Banking revenue decreased by $71 million, or 2%, due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions [7].

This upward trend is also evident in the comprehensive income, which rose from $482 million in 2018 to $544 million in 2019 and then to $555 million in 2020 [3]. \n\nThe main contributing factors to this growth can be attributed to several key financial activities and adjustments. Firstly, the increase in net income per unit applicable to common limited partner units, as noted in the financial statements, indicates improved profitability on a per-unit basis [5]. Additionally, the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, and the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020, significantly boosted income from equity method investments, contributing to the overall increase in net income [11]. These acquisitions not only enhanced the Partnership's operational scale but also diversified its revenue streams.\n\nFurthermore, the elimination of the general partner's incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and the conversion of the 2% economic general partner interest into a non-economic interest on April 1, 2020, streamlined the financial structure, potentially reducing overhead and aligning incentives more closely with the limited partners [8]. This restructuring likely contributed to the improved financial performance by reducing potential conflicts of interest and enhancing operational focus.\n\nThe cash flow statement provides additional insights, showing that net cash provided by operating activities increased from $507 million in 2018 to $650 million in 2020 [2]. This increase in operating cash flow, combined with strategic investments and financing activities, further supports the growth in net income and comprehensive income.\n\nIn summary, the consistent increase in net income and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 was driven by strategic acquisitions, improved operational efficiency, and financial restructuring, all of which enhanced the Partnership's financial health and profitability.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020](image3)"}

This improvement was largely driven by the strong margin development in the Diagnostics segment, which benefited from high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3% in 2021, a substantial increase from 1.9% in 2020 [9]. The Varian segment itself contributed an adjusted revenue of €1,300 million in the period from April 15 through September 30, 2021, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.0% [5][12]. This segment's performance was particularly notable, as it was not present in the 2020 data.\n\nThe acquisition also had a notable impact on net assets. Net debt increased by €10,416 million to €11,901 million in 2021, mainly due to finance transactions related to the acquisition of Varian [1]. The liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities significantly increased to €11,708 million in 2021, primarily due to the financing of the Varian acquisition, with the Siemens Group providing loans totaling €10.0 billion [11].

According to the financial data, the total Underlying EBITDA rose from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021. This substantial growth can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Net Price Impact**: The increase in sales prices played a crucial role, contributing an additional $16,965 million to the Underlying EBITDA. This was due to higher prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, and nickel, among others. The favorable commodity price environment, as noted in the text [2], significantly boosted revenue and profitability.\n\n2. **Change in Volumes**: Despite a slight decrease of $312 million due to factors like natural field declines and adverse weather events, the overall impact was offset by record volumes achieved at WAIO and the highest annual production at Olympic Dam since acquisition in 2005. This highlights the operational resilience and strategic positioning of BHP's assets.\n\n3. **Change in Controllable Cash Costs**: There was a slight decrease in operating cash costs by $34 million, primarily due to inventory drawdowns and increased volumes post-maintenance shutdowns. This strategic cost management further enhanced profitability.\n\n4. **Other Costs**: Negative impacts from exchange rates and inflation, totaling $1,491 million, were partially offset by strategic cost reductions and higher realized sales prices. The net effect of these adjustments still resulted in a significant overall increase in EBITDA.\n\nThe financial data from the table [7] and the detailed breakdown [3] illustrate how BHP leveraged favorable market conditions and operational efficiencies to enhance its financial performance. The image [7] provides a comprehensive view of these factors, showing the detailed contributions to the increase in Underlying EBITDA.\n\nIn conclusion, the significant increase in BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021 was primarily due to higher sales prices and effective management of operating cash costs, despite some negative impacts from exchange rates and inflation. ![BHP's financial performance improvement from FY2020 to FY2021](image2)"}

This is a stark contrast to 2019, where there were no impairment charges. The impact of these charges is evident in the statutory net profit after tax, which decreased by 69.7% to $11.2 million in 2020, compared to $37.043 million in 2019. The exclusion of these impairment charges would have resulted in a net profit after tax of $19.3 million for 2020, indicating that the impairment charges alone reduced the net profit by $7.1 million. This reduction is a direct consequence of strategic decisions to exit certain markets and write down assets, reflecting the financial strain and strategic realignment during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n![Impairment charges in 2020 and 2019](image2)\n\nThe table in image2 highlights the specific categories and amounts of impairment charges, showing a total of $6,117,000 for 2020, with no charges in 2019.

According to the table in image6, the net cash provided by operating activities rose by 10% from $9,649 million in 2019 to $10,613 million in 2020. This increase was partially offset by capital spending, which remained relatively stable at $(4,240) million in 2020 compared to $(4,232) million in 2019. As a result, free cash flow increased by 15% from $5,587 million in 2019 to $6,428 million in 2020. This growth in free cash flow is crucial for PepsiCo, as it allows the company to continue returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as mentioned in text quote [5].

The company allocates expenses associated with corporate activities to operating segments using specific methodologies. Additionally, the company does not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, and there is no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies are consistent across segments. The company's net income and other financial activities are detailed in the financial statements, including dividends, stock-based awards, stock repurchases, and other comprehensive income.\n\nThe image quotes provide tables with numerical data across three years: 2020, 2019, and 2018.

According to the data, the **UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual** segment saw a decrease, while the **Medicare & Retirement** and **Community & State** segments experienced growth, and the **Global** segment declined. \n\nIn the **UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual** segment, the number of individuals served decreased by 2% from 2019 to 2020, with revenues dropping by $1,073 million [2]. This decline is attributed to increased unemployment and related attrition, as well as employer actions in response to the pandemic [1][5]. The pandemic led to economic challenges, causing some employers to reduce or eliminate health coverage, which directly affected this segment.\n\nConversely, the **UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement** segment saw a 9% increase in the number of individuals served, with revenues rising by $7,512 million [2]. This growth was driven by an increase in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans and states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 [5]. The pandemic's impact on employment and healthcare access likely led more individuals to seek Medicare coverage.\n\nThe **UnitedHealthcare Community & State** segment also grew, with a 6% increase in the number of individuals served and revenues increasing by $2,697 million [2]. This growth can be linked to the expansion in Medicaid services, as states relaxed redetermination requirements to accommodate those affected by the pandemic [5].\n\nThe **UnitedHealthcare Global** segment experienced a significant 21% decrease in the number of individuals served, with revenues falling by $2,103 million [2]. This decline is primarily due to increased unemployment and underwriting discipline, reflecting the global economic downturn and the company's response to risk management [5].\n\nThese changes highlight the dynamic nature of healthcare demand during the pandemic, with shifts towards government-sponsored programs and away from employer-sponsored and global services. The data underscores the adaptability of UnitedHealthcare in responding to changing market conditions and the pandemic's multifaceted impact on healthcare utilization.\n\n![The table presents financial data for UnitedHealthcare, showing revenue in millions for different segments over the years 2018 to 2020, with changes from 2019 to 2020"}

This increase in the discount rate reduces the present value of future benefit obligations, potentially lowering the net amount recognized in liabilities. Additionally, the expected return on plan assets decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022 [image2]. A lower expected return on assets can increase the net periodic benefit cost, as the actual return may not meet the expected rate, leading to a higher net amount recognized in expenses.\n\nFor **Other Retiree Benefits**, the discount rate rose from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022 [image1]. Similar to Pension Benefits, this increase in the discount rate reduces the present value of future obligations, which could decrease the net amount recognized in liabilities. The expected return on plan assets remained constant at 8.4% for both years [image2], so the impact on the net amount recognized is less direct compared to the change in the discount rate.\n\nThe net amount recognized for Pension Benefits decreased from $(5,428) in 2021 to $(2,435) in 2022 [image8]. This reduction could be attributed to the combined effects of the increased discount rate and the decreased expected return on plan assets. For Other Retiree Benefits, the net amount recognized increased from $2,238 in 2021 to $3,819 in 2022 [image8], likely due to the significant increase in the discount rate, which more than offset any potential negative impact from the unchanged expected return on assets.\n\nIn summary, the changes in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets from 2021 to 2022 suggest that the net amount recognized for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits was influenced by these factors, with the discount rate playing a more significant role in altering the net amounts recognized.\n\n![The table provides financial information as of June 30 for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits for"}

In 2020, the net operating income increased by $434 million, or 3%, compared to 2019, as shown in the table [8]. This improvement was partly due to the reallocation of revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, funding costs, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses, which aimed to better reflect revenue and expense related to these activities [4]. \n\nThe adjusted revenue from Global Markets increased by $1,562 million, or 27%, in 2020 compared to 2019 [3]. This growth was driven by higher volatility levels and increased client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit, as well as strong performance in Rates due to increased trading activity in government bonds [7]. The table [3] highlights the substantial increase in revenue for FICC, with Foreign Exchange revenue rising by $702 million (26%) and Credit revenue increasing by $556 million (90%). \n\nThe geopolitical and economic landscape, dominated by the Covid-19 outbreak, contributed to an increasingly fragmented trade and regulatory environment, impacting business and investor sentiment [2]. Despite these challenges, HSBC managed to adapt its risk appetite and reallocate resources to support customers and strategic goals [6]. The table [3] also shows a decrease in revenue for Global Banking by $71 million (2%), reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions, but this was offset by growth in capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending.\n\nIn summary, HSBC's net operating income and adjusted revenue from Global Markets improved in 2020 due to strategic reallocations, increased client activity, and strong performance in specific sectors, despite the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.\n\n![HSBC's net operating income and adjusted revenue from Global Markets improved in 2020 due to strategic reallocations, increased client activity, and strong performance in specific sectors, despite the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.](image8)"}

According to the financial data, ExxonMobil's total equity decreased from $362,597 million in 2019 to $332,750 million in 2020. This decline can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Net Income/Loss**: The company reported a net loss of $22,415 million in 2020, compared to a net income of $22,304 million in 2019. This significant shift from profit to loss directly reduced the equity. ![Net income/loss shift from profit to loss](image4)\n\n2. **Dividends**: ExxonMobil distributed dividends totaling $14,900 million to shareholders in 2020, which further reduced equity. ![Dividends distributed to shareholders](image7)\n\n3. **Foreign Exchange Translation Effects**: The weaker U.S. dollar had a positive impact on equity, increasing it by $1,800 million. ![Positive impact of weaker U.S. dollar](image10)\n\n4. **Postretirement Benefits Reserves**: Changes in the funded status of these reserves reduced equity by $1,000 million. ![Impact of postretirement benefits reserves](image10)\n\n5. **Noncontrolling Interests**: The company's share of equity decreased by $34.5 billion, partly due to losses and distributions to shareholders. ![Decrease in equity due to losses and distributions](image10)\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the reduction in total equity from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn summary, ExxonMobil's total equity decreased from $362,597 million in 2019 to $332,750 million in 2020, primarily due to a significant net loss, substantial dividend payments, and adjustments in postretirement benefits reserves, despite a positive foreign exchange translation effect. ![Total equity decreased from 2019 to 2020](image5)"}

This recovery is reflected in the financial data, where NBCUniversal's total revenue increased by 26.1% to $34.3 billion in 2021 [10]. However, when excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to lower sports programming licensing revenue in Italy and Germany, partially offset by higher revenue from the distribution of Sky’s sports programming on third-party platforms [2]. This indicates that while there was a general market recovery, specific segments like sports programming faced challenges due to changes in licensing agreements and the lingering effects of COVID-19.\n\nCustomer relationships remained relatively consistent from 2020 to 2021, with decreases in Italy offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany [11]. However, the declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy were significant, primarily due to reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which had a substantial impact on revenue [11]. This is further illustrated by the net loss of 198 thousand customer relationships in 2021, compared to a net loss of 56 thousand in 2020 and a net addition of 394 thousand in 2019 [5].\n\nDespite these challenges, NBCUniversal managed to increase its Adjusted EBITDA by 6.0% to $5.7 billion in 2021, showing a positive trend in profitability [10]. This improvement can be attributed to cost savings initiatives implemented in 2020, such as severance charges related to the realignment of the operating structure, which were substantially complete by 2021 [3].

Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises from acquisitions and is recognized when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The text mentions that goodwill is adequately guaranteed through the profitability of acquired companies, whose future cash flows support the carrying amount of goodwill at year-end (see Note 2.2.f) [3]. This implies that the valuation of goodwill is closely tied to the financial performance and future cash flow projections of the acquired entities.\n\nThe image3 provides a detailed breakdown of the closing balances for various investees in 2021 and 2020. Notably, the \"Closing balance\" totals to 202 for 2021 and 201 for 2020, indicating a slight increase in the total goodwill value from 2020 to 2021. This increase could be attributed to the performance of the acquired companies, as mentioned in the text, or other factors such as foreign exchange translation differences or acquisitions.\n\nThe image6 shows the opening and closing balances for goodwill over the two years, with an opening balance of 201 in 2021 and 207 in 2020. The closing balance for 2021 is 202, and for 2020, it is 201. This suggests a minor increase in the goodwill value from 2020 to 2021. The foreign exchange translation differences are 1 for 2021 and (6) for 2020, indicating a positive adjustment in 2021, which could contribute to the slight increase in the goodwill value.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that the goodwill arising from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts corresponds to the amount of the intangible assets that did not meet the requirements established in IFRS 3 for separate recognition [9]. This implies that any changes in the recognition of intangible assets could also impact the goodwill value.\n\nIn summary, the key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 include a slight increase in the total goodwill value, primarily due to the performance of acquired companies and positive foreign exchange translation differences in 2021.

The total assets in the Downstream segment increased from $39,586 million in 2020 to $45,224 million in 2021, reflecting growth in this segment [12].\n\nThese changes highlight a recovery and growth in both segments, with the Upstream segment showing a dramatic turnaround in profitability and the Downstream segment demonstrating strong financial improvement.\n\n![Chevron Corporation's financial performance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019](image1)  \n![Asset data categorized by segments and regions for the years ending December 31, 2021, and 2020](image2)\n\nIn summary, Chevron Corporation's Upstream segment saw a significant improvement in net income and a slight decrease in total assets, while the Downstream segment experienced a substantial increase in both net income and total assets in 2021 compared to 2020."}

This growth was driven by various factors, including the increasing acceptance of their services internationally and the acquisition of Tableau [10]. The text also mentions that the cost of revenues increased by $784 million from 2019 to 2020, with a slight decrease in the percentage of total revenues from 26% to 25% [4].\n\nThe image2 provides specific revenue data for different cloud services, including 'Salesforce Platform and Other.' It shows that the revenue for this category increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, with a notable percentage increase in revenue. This indicates that the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category contributed significantly to the overall revenue growth.\n\nThe image4 and image7 provide detailed financial data, including the cost of revenues for 'Subscription and Support' and 'Professional Services and Other.' While these images do not directly specify the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, they show that the total cost of revenues increased by $784 million, which aligns with the text's information. The slight decrease in the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues suggests that the revenue growth outpaced the cost growth.\n\nThe impact of this change on the overall financial performance is positive. The increase in revenue for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, combined with the controlled growth in costs, likely contributed to the overall revenue growth and improved gross profit margins. The company's ability to manage costs while increasing revenue indicates effective operational strategies and investment in growth areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the revenue for the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category increased significantly from 2019 to 2020, contributing to the overall revenue growth.

This increase in Credit Risk RWA is reflected in the detailed breakdown of RWA components for 2020, showing a substantial rise from the initial balances in 2019 [4]. The Standardized Approach's Credit Risk RWA rose from $342,684 million to $387,066 million, while the Advanced Approach's increased from $228,927 million to $284,930 million [4]. This growth in RWA indicates a higher risk profile, necessitating more capital to meet regulatory requirements.\n\n**External TLAC as a percentage of RWA** also saw a notable change. The ratio decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 [7]. Despite this decrease, the institution still maintained a ratio well above the regulatory minimum of 18.0% and the required ratio of 21.5% [7]. This indicates that while the institution's TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased slightly, it remained robust and compliant with regulatory standards.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the capital structure is evident in the capital ratios.

Despite this decline, the segment saw a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter of 2020, with cloud revenue growing at a double-digit rate [11]. The gross profit margin for GBS increased by 2.0 points to 29.7 percent, driven by margin improvements across all areas of the business, reflecting a shift to higher-value offerings and improved productivity [8]. However, pre-tax income decreased by 16.8 percent, and the pre-tax margin declined by 1.2 points to 8.3 percent, partly due to higher workforce rebalancing charges [8]. The table in image8 shows these changes, with external gross profit increasing by 3.0 percent and the gross profit margin expanding by 2.0 points, while pre-tax income decreased by 16.8 percent and the pre-tax margin fell by 1.2 points.\n\nFor **Global Technology Services (GTS)**, the revenue decreased by 5.7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency in 2020 [4]. The decline was driven by lower client business volumes, particularly in industries more impacted by the macroeconomic environment, although cloud revenue grew [6]. The table in image3 provides detailed revenue figures, showing a 5.7 percent decrease in GTS external revenue and a 5.1 percent decrease in Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue. The external total gross profit for GTS decreased by 5.7 percent, with no change in the gross profit margin, but pre-tax income plummeted by 92.9 percent, and the pre-tax margin dropped significantly from 5.8 percent to 0.4 percent [6].

This trend is evident in the data provided in image2, which outlines the changes in interest income and interest expense over these periods. From 2019 to 2020, interest income decreased by $19,747 million, while interest expense decreased by $5,627 million, resulting in a net decrease in net interest income. In contrast, from 2018 to 2019, interest income increased by $4,452 million, and interest expense increased by $714 million, leading to a net increase in net interest income.\n\nThese changes reflect the organizational structure of Bank of America, as described in image1, which shows the bank's five main divisions: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, Global Markets, and All Other. The decrease in net interest income can be attributed to lower interest rates, as mentioned in text quote [5], which affected various segments, including Consumer Banking and Global Banking. The organizational structure allows for a detailed analysis of these impacts across different business segments, as noted in text quote [4], which reports results on an FTE basis. The decline in net interest income is particularly evident in the Consumer Banking segment, as shown in image5, where net interest income decreased from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020. This aligns with the broader economic context of lower interest rates and the impact of COVID-19, as discussed in text quotes [2] and [3].\n\nThe organizational structure also facilitates the management of risk-based capital models, as described in text quote [1], which considers regulatory and internal risk components.

This reduction was primarily due to a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a 44.4% decrease [7]. However, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, contributing to a smaller overall decline in net investment income [7].\n\nIn terms of asset composition, the insurance business saw notable changes from 2020 to 2021. Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million to $90,688 million, a 35.2% rise [3]. This increase reflects a strategic shift towards maintaining ample liquidity, even as short-term interest rates remained low [4]. Equity securities also grew significantly, from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, a 24.2% increase [3]. This growth indicates a shift towards higher-yielding investments, possibly to offset the lower returns from fixed income securities.\n\nThe asset composition changes suggest a focus on liquidity and potentially higher-risk, higher-return investments to counteract the impact of low interest rates on fixed income securities. The increase in equity securities, despite their volatility, may be aimed at improving overall investment returns, while the substantial cash holdings ensure the company can meet its obligations despite the economic uncertainties.\n\n![Net Investment Income Changes](image7)\n\n![Asset Composition Changes](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the insurance business experienced a slight decrease in net investment income from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to lower interest income, despite an increase in dividend income. The asset composition shifted towards higher liquidity and equity investments, indicating a strategy to balance risk and return in a low-interest-rate environment."}

In 2019, the upstream segment reported a loss of $2,576 million, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and impairments, while the downstream segment earned $2,481 million, benefiting from higher margins and sales volumes [3][7][9]. By 2020, the upstream segment's loss widened to $2,433 million, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil prices and impairments, while the downstream segment also faced challenges, resulting in a loss of $47 million [3][7][9]. However, in 2021, both segments rebounded strongly. The upstream segment reported earnings of $15,818 million, driven by higher realizations and the absence of impairments, while the downstream segment earned $2,914 million, boosted by higher margins and sales volumes [3][7]. This turnaround in performance significantly contributed to Chevron's overall net income, which improved from a loss of $5,543 million in 2020 to a profit of $15,625 million in 2021 [4].\n\nThe trends in upstream and downstream operations are closely tied to global commodity prices, as evidenced by the line graph showing the quarterly average spot prices of WTI Crude Oil, Brent Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021. The dip in 2020 and subsequent rise in 2021 align with the financial performance of Chevron's operations, highlighting the impact of market conditions on earnings [1][image1]. The financial data table further illustrates these trends, showing the significant improvement in both upstream and downstream earnings in 2021 compared to the previous years [image3].\n\nThese trends underscore Chevron's ability to adapt to market changes and capitalize on favorable conditions, ultimately leading to a substantial increase in net income. The company's focus on maintaining flexibility in its portfolio and investing in lower carbon businesses also supports its long-term strategy, as reflected in its planned capital spend through 2028 [6].

However, as of December 31, 2021, these risks are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures. The fair values of these liabilities are influenced by changes in interest rates, but the impact is minimal because the majority of the contracts have expired. The table in image7 shows the fair values of equity index put option contracts under different interest rate scenarios. For December 31, 2021, the fair value is $99 million, with slight changes under various interest rate increases, indicating that the impact of interest rate changes on these contracts is limited.\n\n### Differences in Non-U.S. Denominated Debt Effects on Net Earnings\n\nText quote [3] mentions that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses. The effects of these changes resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion in 2021 and pre-tax losses of $1.0 billion in 2020. Image1 provides a detailed comparison of financial data, showing that non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings was $955 million in 2021, compared to a loss of $764 million in 2020. This significant shift from a loss to a gain highlights the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net earnings in 2021.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChanges in interest rates have a minimal impact on the fair value of equity index put option contracts due to their short duration, as evidenced by the small changes in fair value under different interest rate scenarios in image7. The non-U.S. denominated debt had a substantial positive effect on net earnings in 2021, shifting from a loss of $764 million in 2020 to a gain of $955 million in 2021, as shown in image1.\n\nIn summary, the fair value of equity index put option contracts is minimally affected by interest rate changes, while non-U.S."}

This segment experienced a 3.4% increase in external gross profit from the previous year [4]. However, the pre-tax income for this segment was $7,811 million, marking a 12.4% decrease from 2018 [4]. The decline in pre-tax income was attributed to the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition, ongoing investments in key strategic areas, and lower income from IP partnership agreements [7]. Despite these challenges, the segment's focus on hybrid cloud and AI capabilities continued to drive its strategic priorities [1][2][5].\n\nIn contrast, **Global Business Services** reported an external gross profit of $4,655 million, with a gross profit margin of 27.7% [6]. This represented a 3.0% increase in external gross profit from 2018 [6]. The pre-tax income for GBS was $1,623 million, showing a slight 1.3% increase from the previous year [6]. The year-to-year improvements in margins and pre-tax income were driven by a mix shift to higher-value offerings, delivery productivity improvements, and currency benefits from leveraging the global delivery resource model [3]. Additionally, GBS invested in services offerings and skills to assist clients on their cloud journey, contributing to its financial performance [3].\n\nThe differences in financial results between these segments highlight IBM's strategic focus areas. Cloud & Cognitive Software's investments in hybrid cloud and AI, despite impacting short-term profitability, align with long-term growth opportunities [1][2][5].

The shipment volume for cigarettes decreased significantly, dropping by 11.8% from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020. This decline was primarily due to lower market share and the impact of the pandemic on consumption patterns, as noted in the text [12]. However, the shipment volume for Heated Tobacco Units saw a substantial increase of 50.8%, rising from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020, reflecting a shift towards smoke-free alternatives [3].\n\nThe overall shipment volume in the region decreased by 11.6%, from 72,592 million units in 2019 to 64,200 million units in 2020, as detailed in the image3. This decline in cigarette shipments, combined with the increase in Heated Tobacco Units, indicates a strategic shift in product focus and market dynamics.\n\nFinancially, PMI's net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion from 2019 to 2020, but this was partially offset by higher net earnings and adjustments for non-cash charges and currency movements [3]. The decrease in shipment volumes and the associated asset impairment and exit costs contributed to these financial changes. The image1 shows that net cash provided by operating activities was $9,812 million in 2020, down from $10,090 million in 2019, highlighting the impact of these operational adjustments.\n\nThe image5 provides a broader financial context, showing a decrease in net revenues by 22.9% from 2019 to 2020, but a significant increase in operating income by 100%. This suggests that despite the volume decline, cost management and strategic adjustments improved profitability. The variance analysis in image5 indicates that while volume/mix negatively impacted revenues, cost/other factors positively influenced operating income.\n\nIn summary, the changes in shipment volumes and financial activities in Latin America & Canada from 2019 to 2020 reflect a strategic pivot towards smoke-free products, which, despite a decline in cigarette shipments,"}

In 2021, the company reported a net income of $21.5 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2020, and a substantial increase from the negative net income of $11.6 billion in 2019 [8]. This improvement was attributed to higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, despite lower net interest income [8]. The revenue growth was broad-based across several business segments, including Home Lending, Consumer & Small Business Banking, credit cards, Auto lending, Commercial Real Estate, investment banking, and Wealth & Investment Management [6].\n\nLooking at the selected balance sheet data, total loans decreased over the three-year period. In 2021, total loans were $181,237 million, a decrease of $30,199 million or 14% from 2020, and a significant drop of $48,117 million or 21% from 2019 [5][8]. This decline was influenced by paydowns exceeding originations, actions taken in 2020 to curtail non-conforming residential mortgage originations, and a decline in PPP loans for Small Business [5]. Home Lending loan balances were also impacted by these actions, while Auto and Credit Card loans saw reductions due to lower balances and economic conditions [5].\n\nTotal deposits, however, increased during this period. In 2021, total deposits were higher due to increased liquidity and savings from government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, as well as economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic [11]. This trend is reflected in the balance sheet data, showing a consistent increase in deposits from 2019 to 2021 [image2].\n\nThe organizational structure of Consumer Banking and Lending includes Consumer and Small Business Banking, Home Lending, Credit Card, Auto, and Personal Lending, highlighting the diverse financial products and services offered [9][image5].

According to the data, the average Card Member loans decreased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $15.0 billion in 2021, indicating a slight recovery after a decline in 2020. This trend is consistent with the company's strategy of maintaining credit quality and managing risk, as evidenced by the decrease in net write-off rates and improvements in portfolio quality [4][6][10]. \n\n![Net interest income and average Card Member loans decreased from 2019 to 2021](image7)\n\nNet interest income, a key component of the company's revenue, also showed a decline from $866 million in 2019 to $1,011 million in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to lower average revolving loan balances, despite lower cost of funds [12]. The reduction in net interest income, however, was partially offset by significant growth in non-interest revenues, particularly discount revenue and net card fees, which increased by 26% and 9% respectively [1][6][9]. This shift underscores the company's success in diversifying its revenue streams and adapting to changing market conditions.\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The decrease in net interest income, while concerning, was mitigated by strong performance in non-interest revenues, contributing to an overall increase in total revenues net of interest expense by 14% from 2020 to 2021 [2]. Additionally, the company maintained strong credit performance, with key metrics near historical lows, and achieved record levels of Card Member spending, which further supported financial stability and growth [8][10].

According to the text, share-based compensation expenses increase both Restricted Share Units and Additional Paid-in Capital. Specifically, the expense increases Restricted Share Units by 1,118,284 and Additional Paid-in Capital by $79,522, totaling $1,197,806 [2]. This indicates that the company is using equity as a form of compensation, which directly affects shareholders' equity by increasing the number of shares and the capital contributed by shareholders.\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nCash flow from operating activities is crucial for understanding the company's cash position. The table in image4 shows that the company's net income for 2020 was $5,185,313. Adjustments for depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and other expenses, along with changes in assets and liabilities, contribute to the net cash provided by operating activities. The positive net income and adjustments from operating activities enhance the company's cash position, providing the necessary liquidity to support operations and investments.\n\n### Interleaved Analysis\n\nThe table in image2 highlights the impact of various financial activities on shareholders' equity. Notably, the share-based compensation expense increases equity by $1,197,806, which is a significant component of the changes in shareholders' equity. This increase in equity is balanced by the payment of dividends, which decrease equity by $2,112,457. However, the net effect of these transactions, along with other comprehensive income and net income, results in a positive change in total shareholders' equity.\n\nThe cash flow statement in image4 shows that the net income of $5,185,313 is a substantial contributor to the cash flow from operating activities. This cash flow is essential for maintaining liquidity and supporting the company's financial health. The positive cash flow from operating activities indicates that the company is generating sufficient cash to cover its expenses and invest in growth opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nShare-based compensation and cash flow from operating activities both play critical roles in Accenture plc's financial health. Share-based compensation increases shareholders' equity by adding to the capital structure, while cash flow from operating activities strengthens the company's"}

This increase was primarily due to higher profit adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, increased working capital requirements, particularly changes in inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset these gains [1][5].\n\nThe image2 provides a detailed breakdown of cash flow information, showing that the consolidated cash flow from operating activities was $7.20 billion in 2021, up $871 million from 2020. This aligns with the text's explanation of the factors contributing to the increase [5].\n\nRegarding total assets, the image1 presents a financial statement showing assets for the consolidated entity and its segments for 2021 and 2020. While the specific figures for total assets are not detailed in the text, the increase in cash flow from operating activities suggests that the consolidated segment likely had a positive impact on its asset base, potentially due to improved liquidity and retained earnings.\n\nThe implications of these changes on business operations are significant. The increased cash flow from operating activities indicates improved operational efficiency and profitability, which can enhance the company's ability to fund investments, pay down debt, and return value to shareholders. However, the increased working capital requirements suggest that the company may need to manage its inventory and receivables more effectively to maintain liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, the consolidated segment experienced a substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher profitability and better management of incentive compensation.

Additionally, there was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, from $32,965 million to $22,028 million, a reduction of $10,937 million [image1].

In terms of **total assets**, the company experienced a decrease, dropping from $29,568 million in 2019 to $25,075 million in 2020. This reduction is primarily attributed to a significant decline in client financing assets, which fell from $19,346 million in 2019 to $15,694 million in 2020, as shown in ![image6](image6). The decrease in client financing assets was driven by the sale of $2,562 million of client financing receivables, including $1,410 million in loan receivables and $1,152 million in lease receivables, as detailed in [6].\n\nRegarding **total equity**, it also decreased from $2,749 million in 2019 to $2,352 million in 2020. This decline was mainly due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, primarily from foreign currency translation adjustments, as explained in [1]. However, these decreases were partially offset by net income of $5,590 million and an increase in common stock of $661 million.\n\nIn terms of **total company debt**, IBM managed to reduce its total debt from $62,899 million in 2019 to $61,538 million in 2020, a decrease of $1,361 million. This reduction is evident in ![image1](image1), which shows a decrease in both Global Financing segment debt and debt to support external clients, while non-Global Financing debt increased slightly. The company achieved this by completing bond issuances totaling $8,117 million with favorable interest rates and consistently generating strong cash flow from operations, as mentioned in [9].\n\nOverall, IBM's financial position in 2020 reflected a strategic shift towards reducing debt and optimizing its asset portfolio, while maintaining a strong balance sheet to support its operations and invest in long-term opportunities.\n\n**Answer:** IBM's total assets decreased, total equity decreased, and total company debt decreased from 2019 to 2020."}

This increase is evident in the operating lease liabilities, with current liabilities rising from $158 million to $189 million and long-term liabilities increasing from $639 million to $785 million. The weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020, indicating a shift in the company's financing strategy or market conditions affecting lease agreements. ![Operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020](image2)\n\n**Inventory Totals:**\n- The total inventory increased significantly from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. This growth is driven by increases in all inventory categories: finished goods rose from $833 million to $1,232 million, work in process increased from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials grew from $510 million to $691 million. This expansion suggests higher production levels or increased stockpiling in response to market demands or supply chain considerations. ![Inventory totals increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020](image5)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe company experienced a notable increase in both operating lease liabilities and inventory totals from 2019 to 2020, reflecting broader financial and operational adjustments. The rise in lease liabilities may indicate expanded leasing activities or changes in lease accounting, while the inventory growth points to increased production or strategic stockpiling. These changes are significant indicators of the company's financial and operational strategies during this period.\n\nIn summary, operating lease liabilities and inventory totals both increased from 2019 to 2020, with operating lease liabilities rising from $797 million to $974 million and inventory totals increasing from $1,628 million to $2,292 million."}

According to the text, net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual [6]. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 53 basis points (bps) to 1.90 percent for 2020 [6].

The decrease in interest income outpaced the decrease in interest expenses, contributing to the reduction in net interest spread [1].\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes include:\n\n1. **Lower Interest Rates**: The decrease in interest rates led to lower interest income from various financial instruments, as seen in the image1 data, which shows significant decreases in interest income from interest-bearing deposits, time deposits, and federal funds [1].\n\n2. **Deployment of Excess Deposits**: The deployment of excess deposits into securities helped mitigate some of the impact on net interest income, but the overall effect was still negative due to the broader decrease in interest rates [6].\n\n3. **Reduced Deposit and Funding Costs**: While interest expenses decreased due to reduced deposit and funding costs, the reduction was not sufficient to offset the decline in interest income [6].\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: The economic environment and interest rate policies influenced the overall interest income and expenses, as indicated by the text's reference to the forward interest rate curve and the impact of regulatory capital requirements [2][6].\n\nIn summary, the net interest spread decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to a significant drop in interest income outpacing the decrease in interest expenses, primarily driven by"}

This shareholding remained unchanged by the end of the year, indicating stability in the promoter group's ownership. The promoter group includes entities like Tata Industries Limited, Tata Investment Corporation Limited, Tata Steel Limited, and The Tata Power Company Limited, as noted in the text [1]. The image1 and image2 tables confirm that promoters and their associated entities maintained their significant shareholding throughout the year, with no changes in the number of shares or percentage ownership.\n\n**Public Institutions:**\n- Public institutions, as detailed in image8, include various categories such as Mutual Funds / UTI, Financial Institutions / Banks, Central Government / State Governments, Insurance Companies, Foreign Institutional Investors, and Foreign Portfolio Investors (Corporate).

This increase was primarily due to higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, which favorably impacted cash flow. However, increased working capital requirements, particularly changes in accounts receivable and inventory, unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\n### ME&T Operating Profit\n\nThe image4 provides detailed financial data for ME&T for the years 2021 and 2020. It shows that the net cash provided by operating activities for ME&T was $7,177 million in 2021, compared to $4,054 million in 2020. This significant increase in operating cash flow for ME&T aligns with the consolidated figures, indicating strong performance in this segment.\n\n### Consolidated Operating Profit Margin\n\nThe text indicates that Energy & Transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 [2]. This suggests a slight decrease in profitability relative to sales, but the overall operating profit increased due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, despite higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses [11].\n\n### ME&T Operating Profit\n\nThe image2 shows that the fourth-quarter operating profit for ME&T increased from $1,380 million in 2020 to $1,611 million in 2021.

This increase was primarily due to current year tax positions, with $416 million added in 2020, and prior year tax positions, with $120 million added. However, there were also gross decreases from prior year tax positions, amounting to $(130) million, and settlements, which were $0 million in 2020. The net result was a substantial rise in unrecognized tax benefits, indicating potential future tax liabilities. This increase could impact cash flows if the company is required to pay these liabilities in the future, and it also affects the effective tax rate, as noted in the image5, which shows that if recognized, the $1.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate.\n\n**Common Share Repurchases:**\nThe company's common share repurchases decreased in both the number of shares and the aggregate cost between 2019 and 2020.

In 2020, the repurchases were reduced to 14 million shares at an average price of $300.58 per share, with an aggregate cost of $4,250 million. This reduction in repurchases, as shown in image1, reflects a strategic shift or a response to market conditions, possibly to conserve cash or reallocate resources to other areas. The remaining authorized shares for repurchase also decreased from 72 million in 2019 to 58 million in 2020, indicating a more cautious approach to share repurchases.\n\n**Implications for Financial Position:**\nThe increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits suggests potential future cash outflows and could affect the company's liquidity if these liabilities are settled. The decrease in share repurchases indicates a more conservative approach to capital allocation, which might be aimed at maintaining financial flexibility.

This is reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet, which shows a reduction in retained earnings due to dividends paid out to shareholders. The table in image5 details the changes in equity components, including cash dividends, which are a key factor in reducing retained earnings. The table indicates that cash dividends were paid out, which directly affects the company's equity by decreasing the retained earnings component of stockholders' equity. This reduction in retained earnings is a direct withdrawal of cash from the company's equity, impacting the overall equity structure by diminishing the retained earnings balance.\n\n### Treasury Stock Transactions\n\nThe table in image5 also shows movements in treasury stock, which represent shares repurchased by the company. The purchase of treasury shares reduces both cash and stockholders' equity. The table indicates that Chevron repurchased shares, which is a cash outflow and reduces the number of outstanding shares, thereby impacting the equity structure. Treasury stock is recorded at cost, and the repurchase of shares decreases the total equity as it is a contra-equity account. This transaction affects the cash flow as it is a cash outflow under financing activities, as detailed in image6. The table in image6 shows that net cash used for financing activities includes the impact of treasury stock transactions, indicating a significant cash outflow related to share repurchases.\n\n### Impact on Cash Flow\n\nThe cash flow statement in image6 provides a detailed breakdown of the company's cash movements. Under financing activities, the table shows that net cash used for financing activities was $23,113 million in 2021. This includes the impact of treasury stock transactions, which are a cash outflow. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends is also a cash outflow under financing activities. The table indicates that these transactions significantly affected the company's cash flow, leading to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn 2021, both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions had a notable impact on Chevron's equity structure and cash flow. Cash dividends reduced retained earnings, thereby decreasing stockholders' equity. Treasury stock transactions, involving the repurchase of shares, further reduced equity and resulted in a significant cash outflow.

The goal is to increase this to 35% by 2025. This aligns with the commitment to build more gender-balanced leadership teams [3][10][12].\n\nThe image4 provides a visual representation of this data. The Senior Leaders chart shows that 30% of senior leaders are female, while 70% are male. This contrasts with the overall workforce, where the gender distribution is nearly equal, with 48% males and 52% females [4][image4]. This indicates a significant disparity between the gender distribution in senior leadership and the overall employee base.\n\nThe text also mentions that the company aims to double the number of Black employees in senior leadership roles by 2025, recognizing the need for action to address underrepresentation [2][5][9][10]. This focus on increasing diversity in senior roles is part of broader efforts to enhance representation and engagement across the organization.\n\nIn summary, the gender distribution among senior leadership is 30% female and 70% male, which is significantly less balanced compared to the overall workforce, where the distribution is nearly equal.

This indicates that WPB was a major contributor to the group's financial performance despite the overall decline in profits.\n\nThe financial performance data reveals a challenging year for HSBC in 2020, as detailed in the text quotes and image1. The group's adjusted profit before tax was $12.1 billion, down 45% from 2019, primarily due to lower revenue and higher expected credit loss charges linked to the Covid-19 pandemic [9]. The net operating income decreased by $3,552 million (14%) from 2019 to 2020, and the profit before tax dropped by $4,743 million (53%) [1][2][10]. The impact of lower interest rates and reduced customer activity, particularly in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, contributed to the decline in revenue [7][10]. However, the resilience of the Asia business, which includes WPB, helped mitigate some of the losses, as it delivered more than 146% of group profits [8].\n\nThe detailed breakdown in image4 shows that WPB's total revenue in 2020 was $12,938 million, a decrease from $15,655 million in 2019, with net interest income down by 16% and non-interest income down by 26% [4]. Despite these declines, the performance in Asia was resilient, reflecting the region's strategic importance and consistent contribution to the group's performance [6]. The pie chart in image5 further illustrates that WPB's contribution to the group's adjusted profit before tax was $1.9 billion, or 15% of the total, indicating its continued importance despite the overall financial challenges faced by the group.\n\nIn summary, while HSBC faced significant financial challenges in 2020, the contribution of WPB to the group's adjusted profit before tax was substantial, highlighting its role as a key driver of the group's performance. The resilience of the Asia business, including WPB, was crucial in maintaining profitability amidst the global economic downturn.\n\n![WP"}

The company's focus on international expansion, as detailed in the business strategy table [image2], involved leveraging existing international territories and targeting large markets such as the USA, France, and the UK. This strategy aimed to roll out stores in these regions and explore franchise options, with the goal of opening one new trial territory annually. The table outlines specific achievements, including the opening of 47 stores outside of Australia, with notable counts for new stores in the UK, France, and the USA, as well as franchise stores in various countries.\n\nThe table in image8 provides a clear illustration of this growth, showing the number of stores across different countries and regions from 2016 to 2020. The total store count increased from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, reflecting a steady expansion. This growth is particularly evident in regions like the USA, where the number of stores increased from 0 in 2016 to 20 in 2020, and in the UK, where the count rose from 0 in 2016 to 20 in 2020. Similarly, France saw an increase from 0 in 2016 to 10 in 2020. These figures demonstrate the success of Lovisa's strategy to enter and establish a presence in new international markets.\n\nMoreover, the company's ability to identify and secure quality retail sites in high-traffic locations, as mentioned in the text [4], has facilitated quick and cost-effective store roll-outs. The global store model, with a target of 50 square meters and a homogenized layout, allowed for efficient store openings, typically taking about 14 days to fit out a new store. This efficiency, combined with strategic market entry and expansion, has been crucial in increasing the store count in new territories.\n\nThe financial summary in image3 also supports this expansion, showing an increase in Property, Plant & Equipment from $38,418,000 in 2019 to $46,099,000 in 2020, indicating investment in physical assets, likely including new store openings.

As shown in image1, the lease liability balance at 1 July 2019 was $0, but after recognizing the liability on the initial application of AASB 16, it increased to $143,621. This amount was adjusted to $143,621, and during the period, additional liabilities of $50,245 were recognized, with a re-measurement of $1,559. Lease payments of $(31,886) and interest of $4,707 were accounted for, along with an effect of $(1,092) due to exchange rate movements. By the end of 2020, the total lease liability balance was $167,154, with $36,019 classified as current and $131,135 as non-current. This reflects the Group's obligation to make lease payments and the recognition of lease liabilities on-balance sheet as per AASB 16 [4][6][7][8][9][11].\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, the Group's obligations for wages, salaries, and annual leave were calculated at undiscounted amounts based on expected remuneration rates, including related on-costs [1].

This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, despite higher net earnings [6]. However, excluding unfavorable currency movements, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.2 billion [6].\n\n**Investing Activities** showed a decrease in net cash used in investing activities from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $0.6 billion in 2020, a reduction of $0.6 billion [2]. This decrease was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH, partially offset by higher cash collateral for derivatives [2].\n\n**Financing Activities** resulted in a net cash used of $8.5 billion in 2020, an increase of $0.4 billion from 2019 [3].

This dual focus ensures that remuneration is not only tied to financial performance but also to market perception and stability.\n\n**Consolidated Operating Income** is evaluated based on the degree of attainment of the required income set for sustainable growth, with a reference value of 1 trillion yen. The evaluation result for the current fiscal year shows a 150% attainment, indicating strong performance and contributing significantly to the remuneration structure. This aligns with text quote [1], which states that the Annual Total Remuneration is set based on consolidated operating income, reflecting the company's financial health and operational success.\n\n**Volatility of Toyota’s Share Price** is assessed by comparing Toyota's share price to the Nikkei stock average, as shown in image7. This metric, with a reference value of 6,501 yen for Toyota's share price and 18,917 yen for the Nikkei average, evaluates the company's market stability and investor confidence.

The decrease in amortisation charges suggests a reduction in the financial burden related to lease liabilities, possibly due to renegotiated terms or changes in lease agreements.\n\nIn summary, the amortisation charge for the Right of Use decreased by 78 million euros, and the Lease finance cost decreased by 28 million euros from 2020 to 2021.\n\n![The amortisation charge for the Right of Use decreased from 1,532 in 2020 to 1,454 in 2021, and the Lease finance cost decreased from 120 in 2020 to 92 in 2021](image2)"}

According to the text, sales volume increased by $7,563 million and price realization by $932 million, contributing to the total revenue growth of $9,223 million from 2020 to 2021 [9]. The segments that showed the most significant improvements were Construction Industries and Resource Industries, with sales volume increases of $5,188 million and $2,057 million, respectively [3][6]. These increases were driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, as well as favorable currency impacts [3][6]. The Energy & Transportation segment also saw a substantial increase of $2,817 million in sales volume [4][11]. The consolidated sales and revenues comparison chart highlights these increases, showing the substantial growth in each segment [5][8]. The line graph and table data further illustrate Caterpillar's strong performance, with the company's indexed performance outpacing both the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Machinery indices from 2016 to 2021 [2][3].

MLGWM's revenue decreased by 5% from $16,112 million in 2019 to $15,292 million in 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates, but was partially offset by higher market valuations and positive asset under management (AUM) flows [7]. Bank of America Private Bank's revenue decreased by 4% from $3,426 million in 2019 to $3,292 million in 2020, also due to lower interest rates [12].

These assumptions are crucial in determining the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and the fair value of plan assets. Changes in these assumptions can significantly affect the financial metrics related to pension plans.\n\nThe image1 provides a detailed table of financial data for defined benefit plans across different fiscal years, including the defined benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and effects of the asset ceiling. This table helps in understanding the overall impact of actuarial assumptions on the net defined benefit balance. According to image1, the table breaks down these components by region, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other countries, for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. This detailed breakdown allows us to see how changes in assumptions might have affected each region differently.\n\nImage2 shows the discount rates for different currencies as of September 30 for 2021 and 2020. The discount rate increased for all currencies from 2020 to 2021. For example, the discount rate for the euro increased from 0.9% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021. Higher discount rates generally reduce the present value of future liabilities, which can decrease the defined benefit obligation. However, this also means that the fair value of plan assets must perform better to maintain the funded status of the pension plans.\n\nImage3 provides compensation increases and pension progression rates for specific countries. For instance, the compensation increase in the United Kingdom rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 3.0% in 2021, and the pension progression rate in the United Kingdom also increased from 2.6% to 3.0%.

According to the data, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020. This decline can be attributed to several factors affecting the RWA components:\n\n1. **Credit Risk RWA**: The Credit Risk RWA increased significantly under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to market volatility and acquisitions. The Standardized approach saw a total change of $44,382 million, while the Advanced approach saw a change of $56,003 million. This increase in Credit Risk RWA would naturally reduce the TLAC percentage if the TLAC amount remained constant or grew at a slower rate.\n\n2. **Market Risk RWA**: Market Risk RWA also increased under both approaches, mainly due to higher Regulatory VaR. The Standardized approach saw a total change of $14,547 million, and the Advanced approach saw a change of $14,443 million. This increase further contributed to the overall rise in RWA, thereby reducing the TLAC percentage.\n\n3. **Operational Risk RWA**: Under the Advanced Approach, Operational Risk RWA decreased by $7,791 million. This reduction would have a positive effect on the TLAC percentage, as it lowers the denominator in the TLAC/RWA ratio.\n\nDespite the decrease in Operational Risk RWA, the significant increases in Credit and Market Risk RWAs led to an overall reduction in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% to 47.7%.

It is divided into categories: Conventional franchised, Developmental licensed, Foreign affiliated, Total Franchised, Company-operated, and Total Systemwide restaurants. The data shows an increase in the total number of systemwide restaurants from 38,695 in 2019 to 39,198 in 2020.](image4)\n\nThe increase in systemwide restaurants indicates a strategic expansion, which could be aimed at long-term growth and market penetration. However, the decrease in cash provided by operations highlights challenges in maintaining cash flow during the pandemic, possibly due to reduced sales or increased costs. This juxtaposition suggests that while the company is investing in growth, it is also facing operational challenges that affect its immediate financial health.\n\nIn summary, the company's operational activities in 2020 reflect a strategic expansion of its restaurant network despite a significant reduction in cash flow, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations. This could indicate a focus on long-term growth and market presence, even at the expense of short-term financial performance."}

The sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, resulted in a substantial decrease in assets under management, as shown in the table in image5. The balance of WFAM assets under management at the beginning of 2021 was $603.0 billion, with inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $(96.8) billion. The market impact added $11.6 billion, but the sale of WFAM reduced the balance by $(587.1) billion, leading to an end-of-period balance of $37.6 billion. This drastic reduction in AUM directly affected the company's financial position, as evidenced by the changes in total assets and deposits.\n\nThe sale of WFAM and the Corporate Trust Services business, as mentioned in text quotes [1], [6], and [7], moved these businesses from their respective operating segments to Corporate. This restructuring did not impact the previously reported consolidated financial results, but it did lead to a decrease in total deposits, as noted in text quote [2]. The table in image1 shows that total deposits decreased modestly in 2021, reflecting actions taken to manage under the asset cap. The decrease in loans, as seen in image3, was partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to the affiliated venture capital business, as described in text quote [12].\n\nThe transition services agreement for Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets, detailed in text quote [3], added assets under management and administration to Corporate, but these were managed at the direction of the buyer.

Initially, the company expanded its footprint across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, with a notable increase in store numbers from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, as shown in the table in image1. This growth was driven by a deliberate approach to secure high-pedestrian traffic locations, often in AA, A, or B grade shopping centers, ensuring quick and cost-effective store rollouts, typically taking about 14 days to fit out a new store [8]. The company's strategy, detailed in image2, emphasizes international expansion, aiming to capitalize on large international markets and explore franchise options, with specific achievements including the opening of 47 stores outside Australia, with notable counts in the UK, France, and the USA [12].\n\nKey achievements in this period include the successful establishment of a profitable international presence, with the company operating in multiple countries and supporting franchised stores in the Middle East and Vietnam. Lovisa's ability to identify and secure quality retail sites in prime locations has been crucial, as highlighted in image2, where the strategy section outlines the importance of securing leases in premium locations [12]. The company's focus on international expansion is further supported by its efforts to remain nimble and opportunistic, accelerating plans when opportunities arise and deferring entry if conditions are not favorable [12].\n\nChallenges faced include competition, retail environment and economic conditions, and the risk of failure to implement strategies effectively. The strategy section in image2 also mentions the risk of lack of suitable locations, which underscores the difficulty in finding optimal store sites in new regions [12]. Despite these challenges, Lovisa has managed to maintain a strong international presence, with a focus on enhancing existing store performance and streamlining its global supply chain to support its expansion efforts [2, 10].\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy from 2016 to 2020 has been characterized by a strategic approach to market entry, leveraging existing territories, and securing prime locations, with key achievements in opening new stores and supporting franchised operations. Challenges include competition and economic conditions, but the company's focus on quality locations and efficient operations has facilitated its growth. ![Lovisa's international"}

This decrease was partly offset by interest income from the increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by $170.1 billion or 8.8% [9]. The table in image1 shows that the NII for the year ended 31 Dec 2020 was $27,578 million, down from $30,477 million in 2019, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates [1].\n\n**Interest Expense** also decreased by $2.9 billion year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by lower market interest rates and reduced funding costs on customer deposits and debt issuances [11]. The table in image1 indicates that interest expense for the year ended 31 Dec 2020 was $(14,178) million, down from $(17,156) million in 2019, showing a reduction in costs [1].\n\nDespite the decrease in interest expense, the overall reduction in net interest income led to a decline in net operating income. The table in image5 provides a detailed view of the organization's financial performance, showing that the net operating income before credit provisions decreased due to higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges [1]. The decrease in net interest income, combined with these additional costs, negatively affected the organization's profitability.\n\nThe table in image7 shows that the return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was 3.1%, significantly lower than the 8.4% in 2019 [7].

This decline is attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, influenced by low short-term interest rates. The image quote [6] confirms this trend, showing a decrease in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a 44.4% drop. However, dividend income increased by 3.5% from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021. Despite the decline in interest income, the overall net investment income decreased by 5.0% from $5,039 million in 2020 to $4,807 million in 2021. This decrease is primarily due to the significant drop in interest income, which outweighed the slight increase in dividend income.\n\n### Railroad Operating Earnings\n\nThe text quote [5] indicates that railroad operating revenues increased by 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher volumes and average revenue per car/unit, despite the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain. The image quote [8] shows that railroad operating revenues rose from $20,181 million in 2020 to $22,513 million in 2021, a 11.6% increase. Pre-tax earnings for the railroad business increased by 15.7% from 2020 to 2021, reaching $7.9 billion. This improvement is attributed to higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit, and improved productivity, partially offset by higher fuel prices and volume-related costs.\n\n### Factors Contributing to Changes\n\n- **Net Investment Income**: The decline in net investment income is mainly due to lower interest rates, which reduced income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.

This increase indicates a higher investment in leased assets, likely due to the Cytiva Acquisition, which expanded the company's operational capacity and asset base [4][5][8]. The increase in lease assets is reflected in the balance sheet as an increase in non-current assets, impacting the company's asset valuation and financial leverage.\n\n- **Lease Liabilities:** The total operating lease liabilities rose from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020. This increase in liabilities is a direct result of the higher lease assets, as the company took on more lease obligations to support its expanded operations. The increase in lease liabilities affects the company's debt-to-equity ratio and overall financial risk profile [4][8].\n\n**Inventories:**\n\n- **Finished Goods:** The value of finished goods inventory increased from $833 million in 2019 to $1,232 million in 2020.

According to the financial data, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020, a substantial rise of $134 million. This increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Reductions for Tax Positions of Prior Years**: In 2020, there was a significant reduction of $249 million for tax positions of prior years, which is notably higher than the $41 million reduction in 2019. This reduction likely stemmed from the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, as mentioned in the text [1]. This settlement not only reduced the liabilities but also reversed accrued interest of $46 million, which was included in Other Income, Expense, and Net (OI&E) [1].\n\n2. **Valuation Allowance Adjustments**: The valuation allowance decreased by $1 million in 2020, compared to increases of $8 million and $7 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively [9]. Although these changes did not impact net income, they contributed to the overall increase in the net deferred tax asset by reducing the offset against deferred tax assets.\n\n3. **Deferred Tax Liabilities**: The total deferred tax liabilities decreased from $(363) million in 2019 to $(213) million in 2020. This reduction is evident in the decrease in liabilities related to property, plant, and equipment, international earnings, and acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments [4].\n\n4. **Deferred Tax Assets**: The total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020. However, after accounting for the valuation allowance, the deferred tax assets increased from $482 million to $466 million, indicating a more favorable assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets [4].\n\n5. **Interest Income and Expense**: The interest income recognized in 2020 was $39 million, significantly higher than the $9 million in 2019, which positively affected the net deferred tax asset [1].\n\nThese changes collectively contributed to the substantial increase in the net deferred tax asset from 2019 to "}

In 2020, the total restructuring costs were $782 million, primarily categorized under Corporate, as shown in the table [8]. By 2021, these costs reduced to $330 million, and further decreased to $253 million in 2022 [8]. This trend indicates a successful implementation of the company's restructuring program, which has historically aimed to maintain a competitive cost structure through manufacturing and workforce optimization [6].\n\nThe main components of these costs include separations, asset-related costs, and other costs. The table [5] provides detailed insights into these components:\n\n- **Separations**: Costs related to severance packages for voluntary employee separations, calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. These costs are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: Include asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs are based on the new fair value for assets held-for-sale or disposal, while accelerated depreciation applies to assets taken out of service before their normal period.\n- **Other Costs**: Primarily involve asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.\n\nIn 2022, the costs were distributed as follows:\n- **Separations**: $67 million\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: $182 million\n- **Other**: $4 million\n\nIn 2021, the distribution was:\n- **Separations**: $176 million\n- **Asset-Related Costs**: $134 million\n- **Other**: $20 million\n\nThe decrease in total restructuring costs from 2020 to 2022 suggests that the company has effectively managed its restructuring activities, with a notable reduction in separations and asset-related costs over the years.

This decline contrasts with the 9% increase in 2019 compared to 2018, indicating a slowdown in growth. The decrease aligns with the overall global trend of XGEVA® sales, which also saw a 2% decline in total sales from 2019 to 2020. This suggests that while XGEVA® had been growing steadily, market saturation or competition may have impacted its performance in 2020.\n\nIn contrast, **Aranesp®** experienced a significant decline in U.S. sales, decreasing by 17% from 2019 to 2020. The sales fell from $758 million in 2019 to $629 million in 2020. This sharp drop is consistent with the broader trend of declining Aranesp® sales due to competition from both long-acting ESAs and biosimilars, as noted in the text. The text highlights that Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting ESA and a biosimilar version of EPOGEN®, contributing to the expected continued decline in sales for 2021.\n\nFor **KYPROLIS®**, the U.S. sales saw a modest 9% increase from 2019 to 2020, rising from $654 million to $710 million.

At the beginning of the period (1 July 2019), S Fallscheer held 4,140,000 shares. By the end of the period (28 June 2020), they had purchased an additional 1,687,764 shares, bringing their total to 5,827,764 shares. This indicates an increase in their shareholding, which could enhance their financial position due to potential capital gains if the share price rises.\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides details on Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) for S Fallscheer. For FY18 LTIP, all 1,308,901 rights were forfeited, and for FY19 LTIP, 2,564,103 rights were held at both the beginning and end of the period.

This increase was largely due to higher agency fees and payment channel fees, as noted in the text [2]. The percentage of service costs in total cost of revenues slightly decreased from 89.3% in 2019 to 87.0% in 2021, indicating a relative increase in other costs of revenues, which include employee benefits and advertising agency fees [7].

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020, a rise of $3,039 million. This increase in noncurrent assets is significant and suggests that IBM invested more in long-term investments or acquired additional assets that are not expected to be converted into cash within a year. This could indicate a strategic expansion or an increase in long-term investments, which might be part of IBM's growth strategy.\n\n![Noncurrent assets and long-term debt changes](image8)\n\nLong-term debt, on the other hand, remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020. This minimal increase in long-term debt suggests that IBM did not take on substantial new borrowing during this period, which could be a sign of prudent financial management or a reflection of the company's existing debt levels being sufficient to support its operations and investments.\n\nNext, let's consider the impact on cash flows. The cash flow statement shows that financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, compared to a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. This change indicates that IBM used more cash in financing activities in 2020, which could be due to various factors such as dividend payments, share repurchases, or debt repayments. The net use of cash in financing activities suggests that IBM might have been returning capital to shareholders or managing its debt levels.\n\n![Cash flow changes](image5)\n\nThe total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million.

New accounts dropped from 4,320 thousand in 2019 to 2,505 thousand in 2020, a substantial decline of 42%, which could be attributed to reduced consumer spending and cautious financial behavior during the pandemic. Purchase volumes also fell from $277,852 million in 2019 to $251,599 million in 2020, a decrease of 9.4%. However, debit card purchase volumes increased from $360,672 million in 2019 to $384,503 million in 2020, indicating a shift towards debit card usage, possibly due to increased savings or reduced credit card reliance. These changes suggest consumers were more conservative with credit and preferred debit transactions, likely due to economic uncertainty and stimulus measures.\n\nIn home equity, the portfolio in Consumer Banking decreased from $9,755 million in 2019 to $6,930 million in 2020, a decline of 29%. This reduction was primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines, as noted in the text [1]. The total home equity portfolio also decreased, with first-lien positions accounting for 40% in 2020 compared to 37% in 2019, indicating a slight increase in secured home equity loans. The decrease in home equity production in Consumer Banking by $2.8 billion in 2020 [2] further supports the notion of reduced consumer borrowing activity.\n\nThese metrics collectively indicate a shift towards more conservative financial behavior among consumers, with a preference for debit over credit and a reduction in borrowing for home equity, possibly due to economic uncertainty and the impact of COVID-19.\n\n![Credit Card and Home Equity Metrics](image7)  \n!["}

This drop in prices led to a decrease in revenue and underlying EBITDA for coal, with Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreasing by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021, primarily due to lower price impacts and reduced volumes. ![The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.

The average realized sales price for nickel increased from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021, driven by positive investor sentiment and strong demand, particularly for nickel in the battery supply chain. This price increase contributed to a US\\$296 million increase in Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West to US\\$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes. However, this was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs due to the stronger nickel price.\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market price volatility, which is influenced by global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, supply and demand dynamics, and technological changes.

According to the data, net cash from operating activities increased from $14.8 billion in 2019 to $18.2 billion in 2020, reflecting a strong operational performance. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in financing receivables due to sales of receivables, as noted in the text [2] and [7]. The year-to-year increase of $3.4 billion in cash provided by operating activities highlights improved cash generation capabilities [7].\n\nIn terms of cash reserves, IBM's cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities at the end of 2020 were $14.3 billion, a substantial increase from $9.0 billion at the end of 2019 [6]. This growth in liquidity was supported by strategic actions such as winding down the OEM Commercial Financing business and entering into agreements to sell IBM commercial financing receivables [6]. The company also reduced its total debt by $1.4 billion from the previous year, enhancing its balance sheet strength [6].\n\nThe table in image4 provides a clear summary of these changes, showing the increase in net cash from operating activities and the rise in cash reserves over the two years. This improved financial position allowed IBM to focus on debt repayment and invest in areas with attractive long-term opportunities [2].\n\nIn conclusion, IBM's net cash from operating activities increased from $14.8 billion in 2019 to $18.2 billion in 2020, and its cash reserves grew from $9.0 billion to $14.3 billion, demonstrating enhanced liquidity and financial stability.\n\n![IBM's net cash from operating activities and cash reserves increased from 2019 to 2020](image4)"}

This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates, lower loan balances, elevated prepayments, refinancing activity, and the sale of the student loan portfolio, among other factors [7]. Despite this decrease, the noninterest income saw a substantial increase, rising to $10,036 million in 2021 from $4,916 million in 2020, a change of $5,120 million, or 104% [image2]. This increase was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income [12].\n\nThe combined effect of these changes on total revenue was positive. Total revenue increased to $8,495 million in 2021 from $5,357 million in 2020, a change of $3,138 million, or 59% [image2]. This growth was largely due to the significant rise in noninterest income, which more than offset the decline in net interest income. The improved noninterest income, driven by gains in equity securities and other income streams, played a crucial role in boosting the overall financial performance for the year.\n\nIn summary, the net interest income decreased significantly, while noninterest income more than doubled, leading to a substantial increase in total revenue from 2020 to 2021.

This trend can be further understood by examining the cash flow activities, particularly the financing activities, as shown in image4.\n\nIn image4, the cash flow statement reveals:\n- **Net cash used in financing activities**:\n  - 2018: $6,701 million\n  - This includes:\n    - **Purchases of treasury stock**: $4,870 million\n    - **Dividends paid to stockholders**: $3,139 million\n\nThe substantial outflow in financing activities, primarily due to stock repurchases and dividends, directly impacts the equity section of the balance sheet. The repurchase of treasury stock reduces both cash and equity, while dividends reduce retained earnings, a component of equity. The increase in liabilities is relatively modest compared to the equity decrease, indicating that the company's financing activities had a more pronounced effect on equity than on liabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend shows a significant decrease in total equity from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, which is much larger than the increase in total liabilities over the same period. This is primarily due to the company's substantial cash outflows related to stock repurchases and dividend payments, as reflected in the financing activities.\n\n![The table shows the financing activities for a company over three years, ending December 31 for the years 201"}

This growth can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Brokerage Sweep Deposits**: There was a significant increase in brokerage sweep deposits, which grew from $121,077 million in 2019 to $232,071 million in 2020. This represents a more than doubling in value, contributing significantly to the overall increase in deposits. ![Brokerage sweep deposits increased from $121,077 million in 2019 to $232,071 million in 2020](image2).\n\n2. **Savings and Other Deposits**: Savings and other deposits also saw an increase, from $28,388 million in 2019 to $47,150 million in 2020.

However, by 2020, Tesla achieved a net income of $862 million, marking a substantial turnaround and indicating successful operational adjustments and increased profitability. This progression from losses to a profit highlights Tesla's ability to enhance its financial performance over the three-year span.\n\n![Net income trend from 2018 to 2020](image8)\n\nThe improvement in net income can be attributed to several factors. For instance, the company's restructuring efforts in 2018, which included employee termination expenses and losses from sub-leasing, aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency [2]. These actions, along with the acceleration of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses due to increased market capitalization and business outlook updates in 2020 [3], contributed to better financial health. Additionally, the growth in automotive sales, particularly the introduction of new models like the Model 3 and Model Y, significantly boosted revenue [5]. The increase in services and other revenue, driven by growing fleet maintenance and retail merchandise sales, also played a crucial role [5]. Furthermore, the company's ability to manage foreign currency translation adjustments and reduce accumulated impairment losses [1], [8] helped stabilize and improve its financial position.\n\nOverall, Tesla's transition from net losses to a profit in 2020 demonstrates a clear trend of financial recovery and growth, driven by strategic operational improvements and increased revenue streams.\n\n**Answer:** Tesla's net income improved significantly from 2018 to 2020, transitioning from a loss of $1,063 million in 2018 to a profit of $862 million in 2020, reflecting a trend of financial recovery and growth."}

This improvement can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Increase in Operating Income**: The operating income rose from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021, indicating stronger core business performance. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues across various segments, such as broadband, wireless, and advertising, as noted in [10] and [2]. The Media segment, for instance, saw a 20.3% increase in revenue to $22.8 billion, despite a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, partly due to the Tokyo Olympics broadcast [2].\n\n2. **Decrease in Income Tax Payments**: The decrease in income tax payments from $3,183 million in 2020 to $2,628 million in 2021, as mentioned in [4], contributed positively to the cash flow. This reduction was mainly due to tax deductions from the senior notes exchange, which offset higher taxable income from operations.\n\n3. **Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities**: The decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities from a net outflow of $178 million in 2020 to $1,499 million in 2021, as seen in [6], also positively impacted cash flow. This change was influenced by increased production spending and the timing of payments for film and television costs, as well as the impact of sporting events like the Tokyo Olympics [9].\n\n4. **Increased Cash Distributions from Investments**: The increase in proceeds from investments and other activities, primarily due to higher cash distributions from equity method investments, rose from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021 [3]. This substantial increase further boosted the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n5. **Lower Depreciation and Amortization**: Although depreciation and amortization increased slightly from $13,100 million in 2020 to $13,804 million in 2021, the overall impact on cash flow was mitigated by the significant increases in operating income and tax payments [6"}

Additionally, earnings from a 50 percent-owned entity, CPChem, added $1.0 billion to the segment's performance. Increased sales volumes of $470 million also played a role in boosting earnings. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million, which slightly reduced the overall improvement.\n\nThe favorable swing in foreign currency effects, as shown in the table [6], contributed $185 million to the earnings in 2021, further enhancing the positive shift from the previous year's negative impact of $152 million.

According to the text [3], the Board has set specific EBIT target growth hurdles for the performance period. The image3 illustrates this structure, showing that if EBIT growth is \"Less than threshold,\" no percentage of incentives is exercisable. However, as EBIT growth increases, the percentage of incentives that can be exercised also increases. For instance, at 17.5% compound growth, 40% of incentives are awarded, and at 20% compound growth, 60% are awarded. This tiered structure continues, with 80% of incentives awarded at 22.5% growth and 100% at 25% growth. This indicates a direct correlation between achieving higher EBIT growth targets and the ability to exercise a greater percentage of performance-based incentives.\n\n![EBIT Growth and Exercisable Incentives](image3)\n\nThis structure aligns with the company's strategy to align executive compensation with performance, ensuring that incentives are only realized when specific financial targets are met. The image7 further supports this by showing a similar tiered structure for EBIT growth, where 10% of incentives are exercisable at 25% growth, 20% at 26% growth, and 100% at 26% growth. This reinforces the idea that higher EBIT growth leads to a higher percentage of incentives being exercisable, incentivizing executives to strive for better financial performance.\n\nIn summary, EBIT growth directly affects the exercisable percentage of incentives, with higher growth rates unlocking greater portions of the performance-based rewards. This approach ensures that executives are motivated to achieve and exceed financial targets, ultimately benefiting the company's performance and shareholder value.\n\n**Answer:** EBIT growth directly affects the exercisable percentage of incentives, with higher growth rates unlocking greater portions of performance-based rewards, incentivizing executives to achieve financial targets."}

According to the data in image5, a total of 21,746 female employees and 98,347 male employees are entitled to parental leave. This indicates a significant disparity in entitlement, with male employees outnumbering female employees by a large margin. However, when it comes to availing parental leave, only 1,025 female employees and 2,023 male employees have taken advantage of this benefit. This suggests that while more male employees are entitled, a higher proportion of female employees actually use the leave compared to their male counterparts (1,025 out of 21,746 females vs. 2,023 out of 98,347 males).\n\nThe data also shows that after availing parental leave, 967 female employees (94%) and 1,941 male employees (96%) returned to work, indicating a high retention rate post-leave. Furthermore, 66 female employees (6%) and 75 male employees (4%) were still employed 12 months after returning to work, highlighting a slight edge in long-term retention for male employees.\n\nThese statistics reflect on HDFC Bank's gender diversity policies. The bank has initiatives aimed at supporting women, such as the Careers 2.0 program to help women return to work after breaks and the Shrishti program to create a level-playing field for women employees [5][11]. Despite these efforts, the disparity in parental leave entitlement and usage suggests that there may be underlying challenges or cultural factors affecting female employees' ability to take and utilize parental leave. The bank's commitment to gender diversity is evident in its targets and programs, but the data indicates room for improvement in ensuring equitable access and utilization of parental leave for all genders.\n\nIn conclusion, while HDFC Bank has policies and programs to support gender diversity, the differences in parental leave entitlement and usage between male and female employees highlight areas where further efforts may be needed to ensure equal opportunities and support for all employees, particularly women, in balancing work and family responsibilities.\n\n![HDFC Bank's commitment to fostering a culture of inclusion and diversity](7)"}

The net increase in capitalized software reflects the company's continued investment in software development and the management of its amortization expenses.\n\n![Net value of capitalized software increased from 2019 to 2020](image2)"}

The company recognized total net tax benefits of $81, $163, and $130 in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively [9]. These figures suggest a fluctuation in tax benefits over the years, with a peak in 2021.\n\nThe image6 table provides specific financial data for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. For each year, the table shows three values, which likely represent different financial metrics. For 2022, the values are $724, $154, and $570. For 2021, they are $665, $140, and $525. For 2020, they are $619, $128, and $491. The third value in each year, which is $570 in 2022, $525 in 2021, and $491 in 2020, could represent the stock-based compensation expense or related tax benefits, given the context of the text.\n\nThe increase in the third value from $491 in 2020 to $570 in 2022 indicates a rise in stock-based compensation expense or related tax benefits over these years. This trend might suggest that the company is increasing its use of stock-based compensation as part of its financial strategy, possibly to align employee interests with shareholder value or to manage cash flow by deferring compensation costs. The fluctuation in tax benefits, as seen in the text, could be due to changes in tax laws, company performance, or strategic adjustments in compensation practices.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits increased from 2020 to 2022, indicating a strategic shift towards more stock-based compensation, which may reflect efforts to align employee incentives with company performance and manage financial outcomes.\n\n![The table presents financial data"}

This growth reflects the company's strong performance across its businesses, particularly in OptumHealth, driven by organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery, despite reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements due to COVID-19 [4]. Comprehensive income also rose from $10,865 million in 2018 to $14,821 million in 2019 and $15,533 million in 2020. However, the comprehensive income attributable to UnitedHealth Group Common Shareholders decreased slightly from $10,469 million in 2018 to $14,421 million in 2019 and then to $15,167 million in 2020, mainly due to foreign currency translation losses and other comprehensive (loss) income adjustments [12].\n\nThe main factors influencing these changes include:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth**: Premium revenues, a significant source of income, increased from $178,087 million in 2018 to $201,478 million in 2020, driven by risk-based health insurance arrangements and organic growth [5][6][10].

In 2019, the net income was $4,029 million, which decreased to $2,539 million in 2020, likely due to the impact of COVID-19 on business operations. However, in 2021, the net income rebounded to $5,727 million, reflecting a strong recovery and improved business performance. This recovery is supported by increased cash flow from operations, driven by strong consumer demand and reduced inventory levels, as well as higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 [3]. The increase in net income also aligns with the company's strategic investments in digital capabilities and infrastructure, which likely contributed to operational efficiencies and revenue growth [12].\n\n![Net income trend from 2019 to 2021](image8)\n\nThe detailed financial statements and notes provide further insights into the factors influencing these changes. For instance, the company's cash flow from operations improved significantly in 2021, with an inflow of $6,657 million compared to $2,485 million in 2020, primarily due to the recovery from COVID-19 impacts [3]. Additionally, the company's investments in technology and supply chain improvements are expected to support future growth, contributing to the higher net income in 2021 [12].\n\nIn summary, the net income of the company increased from $4,029 million in 2019 to $5,727 million in 2021, after a dip in 2020, indicating a strong recovery and growth trajectory.\n\n**Answer:** The net income of the company increased from $4,029 million in 2019 to $5,727 million in 2021, after a decrease in 2020."}

This increase is primarily driven by the addition of $34 million in expected credit losses, as noted in text quote [12]. The provision for expected credit losses reflects the company's strategy to enhance its balance sheet strength and liquidity by accounting for potential future losses, which aligns with the company's focus on risk management and financial stability.\n\n- **Long-term debt** remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $54,102 million in 2019 to $54,355 million in 2020. This stability is significant as it indicates that the company managed to maintain its debt levels despite the overall decrease in total debt, as seen in text quote [3], which mentions a decrease of $1,361 million in total debt from 2019 to 2020. The slight increase in long-term debt suggests that the company is strategically managing its debt to support its operations and investments without over-leveraging.\n\n- **Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt)** also increased from $39,398 million in 2019 to $41,020 million in 2020, a rise of $1,621 million. This increase, as detailed in text quote [1], was primarily driven by changes in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. This reflects the company's ongoing efforts to optimize its financing structure and manage its liabilities efficiently.\n\nThese changes have several implications for the company's financial strategy:\n\n1. **Enhanced Liquidity and Financial Flexibility**: The increase in noncurrent assets and the stability in long-term debt suggest that the company is maintaining a strong liquidity position, as mentioned in text quote [5]. This allows the company to operate at a single A credit rating and provides the flexibility to continue deleveraging, as planned for 2021.\n\n2. **Risk Management**: The increase in noncurrent"}

This decline is attributed to lower unit demand and net selling price, compounded by the impact of COVID-19 on the rheumatology market and increased competition from biosimilars [4][9].

However, when the impact of the Tokyo Olympics is excluded, the advertising revenue still increased by 9.1% to $9,054 million in 2021 from $8,296 million in 2020.

The total distribution revenue in 2021 was $10,449 million, up from $8,795 million in 2020, representing an 18.8% increase. Excluding the Tokyo Olympics, the distribution revenue still grew by 12.9% to $9,928 million in 2021 from $8,795 million in 2020. This growth was driven by contractual rate increases, increased distribution revenue at Peacock, and credits from fewer games played in 2020 due to COVID-19, which were offset by declines in the number of subscribers [5][image1].\n\nOverall, the Tokyo Olympics played a crucial role in enhancing both advertising and distribution revenues, but the underlying trends also showed positive growth in these areas, reflecting recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 and strategic adjustments in pricing and distribution agreements.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Tokyo Olympics significantly boosted NBCUniversal's advertising and distribution revenues in 2021, with both areas showing strong growth even when the impact of the Olympics is excluded, indicating underlying positive trends."}

According to the financial data, the increase in sales prices contributed positively to the Underlying EBITDA, with a net price impact of $16,095 million due to higher prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, and nickel [8]. This was a substantial factor in the overall increase in Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in 2020 to $37,379 million in 2021 [8]. \n\nHowever, the impact of changes in volumes was less favorable. Despite record volumes achieved at WAIO and the highest annual production at Olympic Dam since acquisition in 2005, these gains were offset by expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence, natural field declines in Petroleum, and adverse weather events [9]. The change in volumes resulted in a decrease of $312 million in Underlying EBITDA [8]. \n\nDespite these challenges, the overall increase in sales prices more than compensated for the negative impact of volume changes, leading to a significant rise in Underlying EBITDA. This is further illustrated by the bar chart showing the growth in Underlying EBITDA from $19.4 billion in FY2017 to $37.4 billion in FY2021, highlighting the strong performance driven by higher commodity prices [6].\n\n![Underlying EBITDA increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, driven by higher sales prices and strategic cost management, despite negative impacts from exchange rates and inflation.](image8)\n\nIn summary, the increase in sales prices was the primary driver of the Underlying EBITDA growth, while changes in volumes had a more modest negative effect, which was outweighed by the positive price impacts.

The high and low prices for GPI stock fluctuated between 390.00 and 286.00 Rupees, while the BSE Sensex ranged between 98 and 84. The table shows that both indices experienced volatility, with GPI stock generally showing higher price ranges compared to the BSE Sensex. This suggests that GPI stock had a more significant price movement, potentially indicating higher market sensitivity or specific company performance factors affecting its stock price.\n\n### Normalized Index Performance\n\nThe line graph in ![GPI vs. BSE Sensex Performance](image4) illustrates the normalized performance of GPI against the BSE Sensex from April 2002 to March 2003. The graph shows that GPI's performance, represented by diamond markers, fluctuated between a high of 106 and a low of 84. In contrast, the BSE Sensex, represented by square markers, varied between 98 and 84. This indicates that GPI's stock outperformed the broader market index during this period, as its normalized index values were consistently higher than those of the BSE Sensex. The graph highlights periods where GPI's stock showed resilience or growth compared to the overall market, suggesting that GPI might have had better financial performance or market perception during these months.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe comparison of GPI stock prices with the BSE Sensex reveals that GPI stock experienced greater price volatility and outperformed the market index in normalized terms. This suggests that GPI's stock was more responsive to market conditions or company-specific factors, leading to its higher performance relative to the broader market. The data and graph together provide a comprehensive view of GPI's stock behavior in relation to the market during the specified period.\n\nIn summary, GPI stock prices showed greater volatility and outperformed the BSE Sensex from April 2002 to March 2003, indicating stronger performance relative to the broader market."}

In 2013, the R&D tax credit was $13,841 thousand, which reduced the provision for income taxes. By 2014, the credit increased to $18,655 thousand, further decreasing the provision. In 2015, the credit reached $29,363 thousand, the largest reduction in the three-year period. This trend shows a growing impact of the R&D tax credit on the company's tax obligations.\n\nThe increase in the R&D tax credit from 2013 to 2015 is also reflected in the deferred tax assets, particularly in the R&D credits component. In 2014, the deferred tax assets for R&D credits were $21,014 thousand, and by 2015, they had surged to $74,091 thousand. This substantial increase indicates that the company benefited significantly from the R&D tax credit, which not only reduced current tax liabilities but also increased deferred tax assets, reflecting future tax benefits.\n\nThe legislative changes, such as the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, retroactively extended the Federal R&D credit, allowing the company to recognize these benefits in the respective years. In 2014, the company recognized a $10.7 million benefit, and in 2015, a $16.5 million benefit, both as discrete items in the fourth quarter of their enactment years. These legislative extensions and the resulting tax credits contributed to the decreasing effective tax rates and the overall reduction in the provision for income taxes.\n\nIn summary, the R&D tax credit played a crucial role in reducing the company's tax provisions from 2013 to 2015, with legislative extensions enhancing its impact each year.

This indicates a significant investment in addressing the immediate needs arising from the pandemic across multiple states.\n  - Other projects like Maternal Healthcare and Solar Lamps have much lower expenditures, with the lowest being ₹0.04 crore [image1].\n\n- **Rural Development Projects**:\n  - The expenditures are generally lower, ranging from ₹0.14 crore to ₹2.09 crore per project [image3]. This suggests a more localized and possibly smaller-scale investment in rural areas compared to the broader COVID relief efforts.\n\n### Implementation Methods\n\n- **COVID Relief Projects**:\n  - These projects are implemented through various agencies such as Setu Charitable Trust, National Health and Education Society, Solace, Development Innovation Foundation, AHEAD, Mumbai Police Foundation, Yuva Unstoppable, Peoples Action for National Integration, and State Disaster Development Authority [image1]. This indicates a collaborative approach involving multiple organizations to address diverse needs across different regions.\n\n- **Rural Development Projects**:\n  - All projects are implemented indirectly through agencies like Sanjeevani Institute for Empowerment & Development, BAIF Development Research Foundation, and others [image3]. This method suggests a reliance on specialized organizations to execute projects in rural areas, ensuring expertise and local knowledge are utilized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key differences between COVID Relief and Rural Development projects lie in their financial scale and implementation strategies. COVID Relief projects involve larger financial commitments and a broader range of implementing agencies to tackle widespread issues, while Rural Development projects focus on smaller, localized investments managed through specialized agencies to address specific rural needs.\n\n![COVID Relief and Rural Development projects differ in financial scale and implementation strategies](image1)"}

By 2021, the trend shifted back to gains, with a notable amount of $955 million, reflecting a significant positive outcome compared to the previous year's losses.\n\nThis pattern can be seen in the detailed financial data provided in image6, which shows the specific figures for each year:\n\n- **2019**: $58 million gain\n- **2020**: $(764) million loss\n- **2021**: $955 million gain\n\nThese fluctuations highlight the volatility and sensitivity of these financial metrics to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as also noted in text quote [3], which mentions the impact of foreign exchange rate gains and losses on non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC). The changes underscore the importance of monitoring and managing foreign currency risks in multinational financial operations.\n\nIn summary, the foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes changed from a gain of $58 million in 2019 to a loss of $764 million in 2020, and then to a gain of $955 million in 2021, demonstrating significant volatility over the three-year period."}

In 2018, the comprehensive income was $10,865 million, which increased to $14,821 million in 2019, and further rose to $15,533 million in 2020. This growth can be attributed to several key elements:\n\n1. **Earnings from Operations**: The company's earnings from operations increased by 14% in 2020, with notable growth in both United Healthcare and Optum segments. This operational success directly contributed to higher net earnings, which are a primary component of comprehensive income [1].\n\n2. **Other Comprehensive Income**: The comprehensive income also includes other comprehensive income, which fluctuated due to factors like unrealized gains or losses on investment securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2020, the company reported a comprehensive loss of $236 million, primarily due to significant foreign currency translation losses of $983 million, which offset gains from investment securities [7].\n\n3. **Net Earnings**: The net earnings themselves grew from $12,382 million in 2018 to $15,769 million in 2020, reflecting strong operational performance and cost management [5].\n\n4. **Investment and Other Income**: Although this income decreased from $1,886 million in 2019 to $1,502 million in 2020, it still contributed positively to the overall financial health of the company [5].\n\n5. **Risk Management and Market Conditions**: The company's ability to manage medical costs and adapt to market conditions, such as the impact of COVID-19, also played a role in shaping its financial outcomes. The management's confidence in the adequacy of medical costs payable estimates, despite potential variances, indicates prudent risk management practices [4].\n\n6. **Financial Statements**: The detailed financial statements, including the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Cash Flows, provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial activities and their impact on comprehensive income [8][6].\n\nIn summary, UnitedHealth Group's comprehensive income increased from 2018 to 2020, driven by strong operational earnings, effective cost management, and strategic financial adjustments, despite challenges like foreign currency translation losses.\n\n"}

First, the company's outsourcing business experienced strong revenue growth in local currency across all geographic markets, driven by demand for digital-related services and cloud enablement [1]. Additionally, the consulting business saw growth in local currency, particularly in Growth Markets and North America, despite a decline in reimbursable travel costs [9].

Specifically, the comprehensive income attributable to Comcast Corporation decreased from $11,371 million in 2020 to $13,755 million in 2021. The decrease in currency translation adjustments contributed to this overall reduction in comprehensive income, as seen in the detailed financial data provided in the tables.\n\n![Currency translation adjustments decreased from $1,213 million in 2020 to $(664) million in 2021, negatively impacting comprehensive income.](image2)\n\nThis change reflects the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company's financial results, as noted in the analysis of foreign currency exposure and hedging strategies. Despite the decrease in currency translation adjustments, the comprehensive income still increased from 2020 to 2021, highlighting the company's overall financial performance improvements in other areas.\n\nIn summary, the currency translation adjustments decreased from $1,213 million in 2020 to $(664) million in 2021, negatively affecting comprehensive income, which decreased from $11,371 million to $13,755 million."}

This is reflected in the impairment losses of $405 million in 2020, a substantial increase from $135 million in 2019 [1][2]. However, in fiscal 2021, there were no significant impairment losses or adjustments recorded, indicating a stabilization or recovery in the value of these investments [1]. This trend is also supported by the image7, which shows impairment losses decreasing to $33 million in 2021, a significant drop from the previous year's $405 million.\n\nConversely, 'Net Gains on Other Investments' saw a dramatic increase from $68 million in 2019 to $470 million in 2021.

This divestment led to a dramatic increase in income from associated companies from USD 673 million in 2020 to USD 15.3 billion in 2021 [2]. The divestment also resulted in a one-time gain that was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings, further enhancing the net income [6].\n\n2. **Net Income Growth**: The core net income increased from USD 13,158 million in 2020 to USD 14,094 million in 2021, a 7% increase [12]. This growth in net income directly impacts the EPS, as it represents the profit available to shareholders.\n\n3. **Share Repurchases**: Novartis repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares in 2021, reducing the total number of shares outstanding by 21.9 million. This reduction in shares outstanding increases the EPS, as the same amount of net income is distributed over fewer shares [10].\n\n4. **Lower Legal Settlements and Impairments**: Operating income was positively affected by lower legal settlements and impairments, contributing to a 53% increase in operating income from continuing operations [7]. This improvement in operating income also supports higher EPS.\n\n5. **Currency Impact**: Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 0.2 percentage points on the operating income margin, contributing to the overall increase in EPS [7].\n\nThe table in image7 shows the financial data, highlighting the significant increase in net income from USD 8,071 million in 2020 to USD 24,018 million in 2021, and the corresponding increase in total basic earnings per share from USD 3.55 to USD 10.71, a 202% increase.

The positive cash flow from operating activities helped sustain and grow the retained earnings, which in turn bolstered the total equity of the company.\n\n![The table shows the equity attributable to the equity holders of a company over the period from July 2, 2018, to June 28, 2020.

This indicates a strong emphasis on early-stage funding at the time. By 2007, there was a notable shift in focus, with Early Stage investments increasing to 74% of the total, and Seed investments dropping to just 10% ![2007 Fund Distribution](image2). This shift reflects a maturation in the venture capital landscape, where there was a greater demand for funding at the Early Stage, possibly due to improved market conditions and the need for more developed business models.\n\nThe scarcity of VC money in Europe, as mentioned in the text, likely contributed to this shift. With fewer investors and higher capital efficiency, funds were more selective and focused on supporting companies that had already demonstrated some traction, aligning with the increased proportion of Early Stage investments ![3]. The lack of pension and endowment funds in Europe, which are common in the US, also meant that the available funds were more concentrated on later stages where they could see higher returns ![4].\n\nThe post-bubble vintages, starting around 2004/2005, were characterized by better performance and higher capital efficiency, which may have encouraged a focus on more mature investment stages ![1]. The improved market fundamentals and the entrepreneurial boom in Europe further supported this trend, as companies were scaling faster and achieving higher valuations sooner ![6][8][9].\n\nIn summary, the distribution of investment stages changed from a heavy focus on Seed investments in 1998 to a significant increase in Early Stage investments by 2007, reflecting a maturing venture capital market and a strategic shift towards supporting more developed business models.\n\n**Answer:** The distribution of investment stages shifted from a focus on Seed investments in 1998 to a significant increase in Early Stage investments by 2007, reflecting a maturing venture capital market and strategic focus on more developed business models."}

This trend has remained relatively stable over the past few years, indicating a strong alignment with the Democratic Party [7]. The image1 bar chart supports this by showing that 53% of Latino registered voters favor the Democratic candidate, compared to 28% for the Republican candidate, with 18% unsure or supporting another candidate [10]. This preference is particularly strong among those who identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, with 81% favoring the Democratic candidate, while only 4% of those who identify as Republicans or lean Republican favor the Democratic candidate [12].\n\nDespite this alignment, Latino voters' party affiliation remains somewhat fluid, with a significant portion having soft ties to the parties [4]. This uncertainty is reflected in the image4 survey results, where a majority of Latino voters believe the Democratic Party cares about Latinos and works hard to earn their votes, while the Republican Party is seen as less caring and less effective in this regard [4].

In the Non-GCC, the preference remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from 46% in 2012 to 43% in 2014.\n\nThe decline in the GCC is more pronounced, suggesting a significant shift in young Arabs' attitudes towards government employment over these years. This could be influenced by various factors, including economic changes, the rise of the private sector, or evolving perceptions of job security and career opportunities.\n\nIn summary, the preference for working in the government sector decreased in both GCC and Non-GCC regions from 2012 to 2014, with a more significant drop in the GCC. This trend reflects broader changes in the job market and young Arabs' career aspirations.\n\n![Preferences for working in the government sector decreased in both GCC and Non-GCC regions from 2012 to 2014, with a more significant drop in the GCC.](image8)"}

According to the data, Donald Trump received historically low grades for his campaign conduct, with only 30% of voters giving him an A or B, which is the lowest for any victorious candidate in 28 years [3]. This is notably lower than the grades received by Hillary Clinton, who, despite losing, received higher grades than Trump, marking the first time a losing candidate has received more positive grades than the winner [9]. Clinton received an A or B from 43% of voters, which is comparable to the share giving Mitt Romney top letter grades in 2012 [11]. \n\nThe image3 illustrates this trend by showing that Trump received only 30% A or B grades, while Clinton received 43% A or B grades, highlighting the unusual situation where the losing candidate received higher grades than the winner. This is further emphasized by image7, which shows that Clinton's grades are better than Trump's, with 43% A or B compared to Trump's 30% A or B.\n\nMoreover, Trump's own supporters were not overwhelmingly positive about his conduct, with only 17% giving him an A, despite 58% giving him an A or B [10]. This indicates a lack of strong support from his base in terms of his campaign conduct. In contrast, image7 also shows that Clinton's grades are comparable to those of losing candidates in the past, with 43% A or B, similar to Romney in 2012.\n\nThe public's grading of the Republican and Democratic parties also reflects this trend. In 2016, 49% of Clinton voters gave the GOP a failing grade, while 46% of Trump voters gave the Democratic Party a failing grade [1]. This is a significant increase from previous years, as seen in image4 and image5, which show a rise in failing grades for both parties in 2016 compared to earlier years.\n\nIn summary, the public graded the conduct of the winning candidate, Donald Trump, significantly lower than the losing candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election, marking a historical anomaly where the losing candidate received higher grades than the winner.\n\n![The public graded the conduct of the winning candidate, Donald Trump, significantly lower than the losing candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the "}

In contrast, Democrats are less supportive, with only 61% in favor and 30% strongly favoring it [3]. This disparity highlights a clear partisan divide on this issue.\n\nThe survey data also shows that while a majority of Democrats support requiring photo ID to vote, the intensity of their support is notably lower compared to Republicans. This is reflected in the strong favorability percentages, where Republicans are more than twice as likely to strongly support this measure [4]. The data underscores the differing priorities and concerns between the two parties regarding voting policies.\n\n![Republicans overwhelmingly support requiring photo ID to vote, with 93% in favor, while Democrats are less supportive, with only 61% in favor.](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the data indicates that there is a broader public support for requiring photo ID to vote, with 76% of the total population in favor.

This disparity is also reflected in the industry context, where 50% of men and 55% of women in STEM jobs consider sexual harassment a problem, with women in non-STEM jobs having a similar perception at 47%. \n\n![Sexual harassment perception in STEM jobs](image3)\n\nThese findings align with the broader context where women in STEM jobs are more likely to report experiences with and concerns about gender inequities compared to men in these jobs. Women in STEM, particularly those in majority-male workplaces and those in computer jobs, are especially likely to view sexual harassment as a problem. For instance, nearly half (48%) of female STEM workers in majority-male workplaces say that sexual harassment is a problem where they work, compared to 30% of men in computer jobs who hold this view. \n\n![Gender distribution in STEM fields](image4)\n\nThe data underscores that while women in STEM face similar rates of sexual harassment as women in non-STEM jobs, the perception of it being a problem is more pronounced among women in STEM, especially in environments where men outnumber women. This highlights the unique challenges women in STEM encounter, despite shared experiences of harassment across job types.\n\nIn summary, women in STEM jobs are more likely than men to perceive sexual harassment as a problem in their workplace and industry, with significant differences in perception based on workplace gender composition and job type."}

According to text quote [2], the fundamentals for a breakout venture decade in Europe began improving continuously starting in 2004, despite venture capital fund commitments remaining down for the last six years. This suggests a period of adjustment and potential growth in the venture capital landscape. The text also highlights that the supply of venture capital started to dry out only after 2004 [5], indicating a shift in the availability of funds.\n\nThe image2, a line graph, further supports this by showing the relationship between the supply and demand of venture capital from 2000 to 2010. It notes that around 2004-2005, the market was still saturated with pre-bubble VC funds, but by 2005, an exit boom started to drive up demand. This boom is crucial as it indicates a shift from a surplus of funds to a more balanced market, potentially leading to increased efficiency and performance in post-bubble vintages [1]. The graph also highlights a \"Current supply gap\" by 2009-2010, suggesting a scarcity of VC money, which, as per text quote [10], has driven up capital efficiency and yield.\n\nAdditionally, image6 shows a significant decline in the number of venture capital funds in Europe from 1,600 in 1999 to 711 in 2011, a 63% reduction. This reduction aligns with the text's mention of the scarcity of VC money and the resulting higher capital efficiency in Europe compared to the US [3][10]. The scarcity of funds likely led to more selective investments and better performance, as evidenced by the strong fundamentals of European VC [3].\n\nIn summary, early-stage VC fundraising in Europe after 2004 was marked by a shift from a saturated market to a more efficient and selective environment, driven by an exit boom and a reduction in the number of funds, leading to improved performance and higher capital efficiency.\n\n![Early-stage VC fundraising in Europe improved after 2004 due to a shift from a saturated market to a more efficient and selective environment, driven by an exit boom and a reduction in the number of funds, leading to improved performance and higher capital efficiency.](image2)"}

According to text quote [9], nearly three-quarters of Americans choose human rights over economic relations, even if it harms economic relations with China. This preference is consistent across age groups, as indicated by text quote [10], where younger and older Americans alike prioritize human rights over economic relations. However, there are notable differences in the intensity of these views.\n\nText quote [11] highlights that Americans ages 50 and older are substantially more negative toward China (81%) compared to those ages 30 to 49 (71%) or under 30 (56%). This suggests that older Americans are more critical of China, which aligns with their preference for human rights over economic relations. Image5 supports this by showing that 71% of those ages 50+ advocate for promoting human rights, while only 24% prioritize economic relations. In contrast, younger age groups, such as those ages 18-29, have a slightly higher percentage (76%) advocating for human rights, with 21% prioritizing economic relations.\n\nImage2 further illustrates these differences, showing that 73% of those ages 50+ perceive China as \"Bad,\" compared to 54% of those ages 18-29 and 59% of those ages 30-49. This negative perception among older Americans likely contributes to their stronger stance on human rights.\n\nIn summary, while all age groups prioritize human rights over economic relations, older Americans are more negative toward China and thus more likely to emphasize human rights.

In 1870, the population was a mere 130, but by 1890, it had surged to 14,096, reflecting a dramatic increase due to the influx of settlers from various regions, including Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, New England, and later, immigrants from Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia. This growth was fueled by the expansion of the railroad and the Homestead Act, which provided land opportunities and transformed the area into a booming agricultural region. The population peaked in 1890 and then began a gradual decline, with fluctuations over the next century. By 2000, the population was 9,403, showing a long-term trend of decline after the peak. The decline can be attributed to factors such as farm consolidation, mechanization, and the movement of businesses and populations to areas with better rail connections, as seen in the relocation of the town of Hamilton to Aurora. The image2 table illustrates these population trends over the years, highlighting the peak and subsequent decline. The image3 map of Hamilton County shows the geographical context of these changes, with key communities like Aurora and Kronborg, which were influenced by ethnic settlement patterns and the development of rural infrastructure.

This indicates a pervasive perception among Black STEM workers that racial discrimination affects their career advancement.\n\nRegarding fairness in workplace processes, text quote [6] states that 43% of Black STEM workers believe blacks are usually treated fairly during recruitment, while 37% believe this during promotion and advancement. In contrast, 78% of White STEM workers believe blacks are treated fairly in hiring, and 75% in advancement. Image5 supports this, showing that 78% of Whites feel the recruitment process is fair, while only 43% of Blacks agree. This disparity underscores the perception of racial bias in these processes.\n\nImage5 also reveals that 57% of Black respondents feel their workplace pays insufficient attention to diversity, compared to 15% of Whites. This suggests a significant gap in the perceived prioritization of diversity efforts, with Black workers feeling their concerns are overlooked.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of workplace discrimination and fairness among racial/ethnic groups in STEM jobs show that Black workers experience and perceive significantly more discrimination and unfairness compared to other groups. This is reflected in higher reported experiences of discrimination, a greater belief that race/ethnicity hinders success, and a perception that workplaces do not adequately address diversity issues. The data from both text and image sources consistently highlight these disparities, indicating systemic challenges faced by Black individuals in STEM fields.\n\n**Answer:** Perceptions of workplace discrimination and fairness among racial/ethnic groups in STEM jobs show that Black workers experience significantly more discrimination and perceive less fairness compared to other groups, with higher reported experiences of discrimination and a greater belief that race/ethnicity hinders success."}

This is a baseline scenario. \n\nThe image4 table provides a detailed breakdown of various scenarios and their corresponding peak service and peak hour train cars. The scenarios include:\n\n- **Today**: Current service level with a peak service of 5x5, requiring 25 train cars during peak hours.\n- **Metrolink used cars**: A scenario using Metrolink's used cars, with a peak service of 6x5, requiring 30 train cars.\n- **Electrification**: Electrifying the trains, leading to a peak service of 6x6, necessitating 36 train cars.\n- **Longer platforms**: Extending platforms to accommodate more cars, with a peak service of 6x8, requiring 48 train cars.\n- **Increase frequency (w/HSR)**: Increasing frequency, potentially with High-Speed Rail (HSR), resulting in a peak service of 8x8 and necessitating 64 train cars during peak hours.\n\nThese scenarios illustrate a clear trend: as the service level increases, the number of train cars required during peak hours also increases. For instance, moving from the current service to the Metrolink used cars scenario increases the requirement from 25 to 30 train cars [4]. Electrification further increases this to 36 train cars [8]. Extending platforms to accommodate more cars significantly boosts the requirement to 48 train cars [2]. The most ambitious scenario, increasing frequency with HSR, requires 64 train cars [8].\n\nThis progression highlights the direct relationship between service improvements and the increased capacity needed to handle higher passenger volumes during peak hours. Each improvement, whether through increased frequency, electrification, or platform extension, necessitates more train cars to maintain or enhance service quality.\n\nIn conclusion, the peak hour train car requirement for Caltrain increases with each service improvement scenario, from 25 cars in the current setup to 64 cars in the most ambitious scenario involving increased frequency and potential HSR integration. This underscores the need for substantial infrastructure and operational adjustments to meet growing demand and improve service efficiency.\n\n![Peak hour train car requirements increase with service improvements](image4)"}

The image emphasizes that mobile websites account for only 16% of ad impressions, further highlighting the dominance of mobile apps in the ad market.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that Vietnam's mobile content distribution platform, App ota, plays a crucial role in this ecosystem, serving as the number-one platform for developers and publishers to reach a large user base, including 18 million users in Vietnam [7]. This platform's influence likely contributes to the high percentage of ad impressions on mobile apps.\n\nIn summary, the data and visual representations confirm that 84% of ad impressions in Vietnam occur on mobile apps, reflecting their central role in the country's mobile advertising landscape.\n\n**Answer:** The percentage of ad impressions on mobile apps in Vietnam is 84%."}

The survey data indicates that the sample distribution by rural and urban settlement reflects the actual national figure of the 2011 census, with 83% of respondents from rural areas and 17% from urban areas [2][11]. This demographic breakdown is crucial for understanding the listening habits in different regions.\n\nThe image quotes provide specific insights into radio listening habits. Image4 shows that 77% of rural respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, while 39% use a mobile phone. In contrast, urban respondents are more inclined to use mobile phones, with 70% listening via mobile and 49% via radio. This suggests a significant difference in the devices used for radio listening between rural and urban areas. In rural areas, traditional radio sets are more prevalent, whereas urban areas show a higher reliance on mobile phones for radio consumption.\n\nAdditionally, the overall data from the survey indicates that 76% of all respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, and 40% use a mobile phone. This overall figure aligns with the rural and urban breakdown, reinforcing the trend that rural areas prefer traditional radio sets, while urban areas show a higher mobile phone usage for radio listening.\n\nIn summary, the data indicates that rural areas predominantly use radio sets for listening, while urban areas show a higher preference for mobile phones. This difference highlights varying technological adoption and accessibility between rural and urban regions.\n\n![Radio listening habits differ significantly between rural and urban areas, with rural areas relying more on radio sets and urban areas on mobile phones.](image4)"}

According to the survey, women in computer jobs are more likely to report experiences with and concerns about gender inequities in the workplace compared to men in these jobs. Specifically, women in computer jobs are more likely to say they have experienced discrimination (74% vs. 16% of men) and report pay inequities (46% vs. 29% of all women in STEM). This suggests that computer jobs, which are a subset of STEM, have a notable gender gap in employment experiences and perceptions of fairness.\n\n![Women in computer jobs experience higher rates of discrimination and pay inequities compared to men](image5)\n\nThe survey data also indicates that women in computer jobs face more challenges related to gender impacting their career success and lower workplace focus on gender diversity. For instance, 78% of women in male-dominated STEM workplaces report experiencing gender-related discrimination, compared to only 19% of men. Additionally, 48% of women in these environments believe their gender makes it harder to succeed in their job, while only 6% of men feel the same.\n\n![Women in male-dominated STEM workplaces report higher incidences of discrimination and challenges related to gender](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the survey found that women in computer jobs are more likely to perceive sexual harassment as a significant workplace issue, with 42% of women seeing it as a problem compared to 30% of men.

This trend is visually represented in image2, which shows a vertical bar chart displaying survey results over several years, highlighting the growing concern about media influence. The chart indicates a significant rise in the belief that the press had too much influence, particularly in 2016, where 57% of voters felt this way, compared to just 46% in 1992. This increase reflects broader societal changes and possibly heightened political polarization, as noted in text quote [3], where 79% of Americans felt the country was more politically divided than in the past. The data underscores a growing distrust in media, with majorities across different voter groups, including Trump and Clinton voters, expressing this sentiment [4][7][11].

According to the Pew Research Center survey, women in computer jobs are more likely than men to consider gender discrimination a major problem in the tech industry, with 43% of women compared to 31% of men perceiving it as such [1]. This perception is supported by the fact that roughly three-quarters (74%) of women in computer jobs report experiencing gender-related workplace discrimination, while only 16% of men in these jobs do so [4][5]. Women in computer jobs are also more likely to report specific forms of discrimination, such as earning less than a man doing the same job (29%), being treated as if they were not competent (29%), experiencing repeated small slights (20%), and receiving less support from senior leaders (18%) [3]. These experiences are compounded by the belief that gender has made it harder for women to succeed in their jobs, with 31% of women in computer jobs holding this view compared to only 6% of men [12]. Additionally, women in computer jobs are less likely than men to believe that women are usually given a fair shake in opportunities for promotion and advancement (43% vs. 77%) [7][11]. \n\nThe chart in image7 further illustrates these disparities, showing that 74% of women in computer jobs have experienced gender-related discrimination, compared to 16% of men, a difference of 58 percentage points. Women are also more likely to report experiencing sexual harassment (30% vs. 7%), difficulty succeeding due to gender (31% vs. 6%), and believe their workplace pays too little attention to increasing gender diversity (31% vs. 13%) [12]. These statistics underscore the significant gender disparities in the experiences of discrimination in computer jobs.\n\nIn summary, women in computer jobs face substantially higher rates of gender-related discrimination compared to men, with significant differences in perceptions of fairness, opportunities, and workplace support.

For instance, women are more likely to be represented in health professions, where 81% of college-educated workers are female, compared to just 16% in engineering [2]. This trend is further supported by the image1, which shows that the percentage of women in STEM jobs increases with higher educational attainment, particularly among those with advanced degrees. In 1990, 27% of women with professional or doctoral degrees were in STEM jobs, rising to 41% by 2016 [11]. This indicates that while women's representation in STEM jobs is lower overall, it increases with higher education levels.\n\nThe text also highlights that women with advanced degrees in STEM fields are more likely to experience gender discrimination and find it harder to succeed at work [7]. This is reflected in the image4, which shows that women with professional or doctoral degrees make up 41% of the STEM workforce, compared to 42% of the overall employed population, indicating a slight underrepresentation at this educational level [11].\n\nMoreover, the image3 illustrates that STEM jobs offer higher average salaries across all education levels compared to non-STEM jobs, suggesting that despite the challenges, pursuing STEM education can lead to better financial outcomes [3]. However, the text notes that women's representation in STEM occupations varies substantially by subgroup, with engineering having the lowest share of women at 14% and computer occupations at 25% [3].\n\nIn summary, while women's representation in STEM jobs increases with higher education levels, they remain underrepresented in certain fields like engineering and computer science, despite the potential for higher earnings.

One of these approaches is an anchor re-weighting method, which employs a learnable vector to adjust the significance of different label words in demonstrations, leading to a significant performance boost. Specifically, the anchor re-weighting method results in a 16.7% average accuracy improvement compared to standard ICL baselines [1]. This improvement is particularly notable on datasets like SST-2 and AGNews, as shown in Table 3 [3].

In the single-task model [11], there is a straightforward architecture where a single decoder attends to the states of the encoder. This setup is depicted in Figure 1a, where the input sequence is encoded into hidden states, and the decoder uses an attention mechanism to produce context vectors that inform its predictions [6].\n\nIn contrast, the multitask model in Figure 1b introduces a dual-decoder structure. Both decoders in this model attend to the states of the same encoder, but each has its own attention mechanism and context vectors, allowing them to generate separate outputs [12]. This means that while the single-task model focuses on a single task with one decoder, the multitask model handles two tasks simultaneously, with each decoder potentially attending to different aspects of the encoder's output [12].

This approach involves several key steps and benefits:\n\n1. **External Feedback Sources**: As illustrated in image3, this strategy utilizes a variety of external feedback sources such as knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines. These sources provide additional context and information that the language model might not have access to during the initial generation phase. For example, a knowledge base can verify facts, while a code interpreter can check the correctness of generated code.\n\n2. **Iterative Refinement**: The process involves cycles of generation, review, feedback, and refinement. The language model generates outputs, which are then reviewed by a critic model. Based on the feedback from external sources, the outputs are refined iteratively until they meet the desired quality standards. This iterative process allows for continuous improvement and ensures that the final output is more accurate and reliable.\n\n3. **Enhanced Accuracy**: By incorporating external feedback, the strategy addresses issues such as hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxicity, which are common problems in language model outputs. External knowledge sources can help correct factual inaccuracies, while trained models can provide domain-specific insights, leading to more precise and trustworthy outputs.\n\n4. **Flexibility and Transparency**: Unlike training-time correction methods, post-hoc correction does not require updating the model parameters. This makes the process more flexible and transparent, as it allows for the incorporation of diverse natural language feedback without altering the underlying model architecture. As described in image1, this flexibility is particularly useful for refining outputs after they have been generated, without the need for retraining.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Feedback**: The strategy allows for a wide range of feedback formats, including natural language and scalar values, which can provide detailed and nuanced feedback. This comprehensive feedback helps in identifying specific areas for improvement and guides the refinement process more effectively.\n\nIn summary, the 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' strategy enhances output refinement by utilizing external resources to provide accurate and detailed feedback, enabling iterative improvements and addressing common language model flaws effectively. This approach is particularly beneficial for ensuring the factual accuracy and reliability of generated content across various applications.\n\n![Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback enhances output refinement by utilizing external resources to provide accurate and detailed feedback, enabling iterative improvements and addressing common language model flaws effectively.](image3)"}

The templates for converting candidate labels to question options are crucial for this process.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we know that templates for different datasets are provided in Tables 19, 20, and 21.

The tree structure is then traversed layer by layer, beginning from the root. At each level, the method retrieves the top nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process continues down the tree, progressively focusing on finer details as it descends through the lower layers. Finally, the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context, which is then combined with the query to generate an answer using a language model (LLM). This method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved by adjusting the depth \\( d \\) and the number of nodes \\( k \\) selected at each layer [8][9].\n\n**Collapsed Tree Retrieval**, on the other hand, offers a simpler approach by collapsing the multi-layered tree into a single layer. This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones. Instead of traversing the tree layer-by-layer, it flattens the tree, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. Nodes are retrieved based on cosine similarity until reaching a threshold number of tokens. The retrieved context is then combined with the query to produce an answer using an LLM. This approach provides greater flexibility, as it retrieves information at the correct level of granularity for a given question by searching through all nodes simultaneously [3][10][11].\n\nThe image3 illustrates these two mechanisms, showing how Tree Traversal Retrieval starts from the root and moves down the tree, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval considers all nodes at once. The image4 further highlights the performance differences, showing that the Collapsed Tree method peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, slightly decreasing as the context length increases, whereas Tree Traversal shows a steady increase in F1 score but performs lower overall. This suggests that Collapsed Tree Retrieval is more effective in retrieving relevant information across different levels of abstraction, making it particularly advantageous for tasks requiring comprehensive understanding of lengthy documents.\n\nIn summary, Tree Traversal Retrieval is more controlled and focused, allowing for adjustments in specificity and breadth, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval offers greater flexibility and holistic retrieval, making it more effective for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\n![RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval mechanisms offer distinct approaches"}

For instance, it achieves a 21.2% and 24.1% improvement on PathMNIST and CIFAR-10-LT, respectively, when querying 20% and 30% of the dataset.

The dataset is divided into six categories: Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety, each with a specific number of samples and tokens, as detailed in the table [image5](image5). This categorization ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of data types, enhancing its ability to handle diverse tasks during inference.\n\nFor instance, the **Text** category, with 1.6 million samples and 940 million tokens, provides a robust foundation for text-based tasks, while the **Image Generation** category, with 64.3 thousand images and 68.0 million tokens, focuses on high-quality image generation.

According to the text, the DETR architecture is designed to predict all objects at once using a set-based global loss and a transformer encoder-decoder structure [2]. The object queries are a set of learned positional embeddings that are input to the decoder [5]. These queries are crucial because they allow the model to reason about the relations between objects and the global image context in parallel, rather than sequentially as in traditional auto-regressive models [5]. \n\nThe decoder in DETR transforms these object queries through multi-headed self- and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms, enabling the model to globally process all objects together and use the entire image as context [5]. This parallel processing is a significant departure from previous methods, which often required hand-designed components like non-maximum suppression or anchor generation [2]. The object queries are transformed into output embeddings by the decoder, which are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed-forward network, resulting in the final set of predictions [5].\n\nThe image descriptions provide visual insights into how DETR operates. For instance, image1 shows attention scores highlighting specific parts of detected animals, such as extremities, which are integral for accurate classification and localization [1]. This visualization aligns with the text's explanation of how the model uses attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of objects [5]. Similarly, image4 illustrates the DETR architecture, where the transformer decoder outputs box predictions based on the processed image features and object queries [4]. This image reinforces the text's description of the decoder's role in refining predictions using object queries [5].\n\nIn summary, the DETR model uses object queries to enable parallel processing of object relations and global context, simplifying the detection pipeline and improving performance on tasks like object detection and segmentation [2][7].

The graph shows that both \"DyGIE\" and \"DyGIE-RelProp\" systems experience a decline in performance as the number of entities increases. However, \"DyGIE\" consistently outperforms \"DyGIE-RelProp\" across all entity groupings, indicating that relation propagation, while attempting to mitigate the performance drop, is less effective than the base model without propagation [7]. This suggests that while relation propagation is beneficial, it does not fully compensate for the complexity introduced by a higher number of entities in a sentence.\n\nThe implications of utilizing relation propagation are highlighted in the graph [7], where \"DyGIE-RelProp\" shows a slight improvement over \"DyGIE\" in sentences with more entities, but the overall performance remains lower compared to \"DyGIE\" without propagation. This indicates that relation propagation is a useful technique but may not be sufficient to handle the increased complexity of sentences with multiple entities. The graph underscores the importance of optimizing relation propagation methods to better manage the interactions between entities in complex sentences, potentially by refining the relation graph or adjusting the propagation mechanism to focus on the most relevant relations [6].\n\nIn summary, while relation propagation enhances relation extraction performance, especially in sentences with more entities, it is crucial to further refine these techniques to achieve optimal results.

According to the findings, when repetition control is introduced, the frequency of question-asking decreases compared to models without such control. This is illustrated in the image4, which shows the impact of different control methods on question-asking frequency.

This indicates that repetition control introduces constraints that limit the model's ability to ask questions as freely as it would without such constraints. The primary issue is the **extrep bigram** feature in weighted decoding, which discourages bigrams commonly found in questions, thus reducing the question-asking rate. To address this, a **boost** setting (z = 10) is introduced, which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams without using the **extrep bigram** feature during beam search, resulting in a 99.54% question-asking rate but slightly increased external bigram repetition [10].\n\n![Repetition control reduces question-asking frequency](image4)\n\nAdditionally, the text quotes highlight that controlling for repetition is crucial for improving conversational engagingness, as seen in the comparison of models in image1.

According to the text, adversarial training involves selecting distractor paragraphs that the model finds least likely to contain the answer, aiming to improve multi-hop reasoning capabilities. However, the results show that while adversarial training can initially degrade performance (as seen in the drop from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 when evaluated on adversarial distractors [3]), the model can recover much of its original accuracy when re-trained on these adversarial distractors, increasing the F1 score to 60.10 [3]. This indicates that adversarial training can enhance the model's robustness and adaptability to different distractor distributions.\n\nThe images provide further insights into these findings. Image2 illustrates the performance metrics for different training and evaluation data types. It shows that when the model is trained on adversarial data and evaluated on adversarial data, the F1 score improves to 60.10, demonstrating the model's ability to adapt to adversarial distractors. Conversely, when trained on original data and evaluated on adversarial data, the score drops to 46.84, highlighting the initial challenge posed by adversarial distractors. Additionally, filtering by entity type during evaluation further reduces performance to 40.73, but adversarial training still allows recovery to 58.42 F1, indicating the effectiveness of adversarial training in mitigating entity type bias [2].\n\nImage3 supports these findings by showing that even with a large number of distractors (500 paragraphs), the model's performance is significantly lower (39.12 F1) compared to the \"Distractor\" setting (67.08 F1), suggesting that adversarial distractors are more effective than a large, indiscriminate set of paragraphs. The inclusion of a \"Gold Paragraph\" in the open-domain setting boosts performance to 53.12 F1, reinforcing the importance of relevant distractors in improving model accuracy.\n\nIn summary, adversarial training enhances model performance by improving its ability to handle challenging distractors, though it requires re-training to fully recover original accuracy. This approach is crucial for developing models that can perform well in multi-hop reasoning tasks, as it addresses the limitations of standard retrieval methods and entity type biases.\n\n![Adversarial training improves model performance when re-trained on adversarial distractors]("}

However, when the model is tested in the open-domain setting with 500 paragraphs, the F1 score drops to 39.12, highlighting the challenge of retrieving relevant information from a larger pool of distractors [5]. Adding a gold paragraph to this setting boosts the F1 score to 53.12, demonstrating the critical role of accurate retrieval in model performance [5]. This is further supported by image4, which shows that the inclusion of a gold paragraph in the open-domain setting significantly improves the F1 score from 39.12 to 53.12.\n\nAdversarial training, where the model is re-trained on distractors selected to challenge its performance, can help recover some of the original accuracy. For instance, the F1 score increases from 46.84 to 60.10 when evaluated on adversarial data after adversarial training [2]. Image2 illustrates this improvement, showing that adversarial training enhances performance on adversarial evaluation data, though it still lags behind the original training data's performance on original evaluation data.\n\nThe type of distractors also matters. Filtering distractors by entity type can degrade performance, but adversarial re-training can mitigate this, as seen in image2 where the F1 score improves from 40.73 to 58.42 with adversarial training [8].

Sentiment prediction often relies on key phrases or words, and their order can significantly alter the sentiment conveyed. For example, \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" have different negative intensities due to word order [7]. LSTM models, which capture sequential information, perform better than SWEM models in sentiment analysis because they can utilize this word-order information [7]. However, when word-order features are removed by shuffling the training set, the performance of LSTM models on sentiment analysis tasks drops, indicating that word-order is indeed important [9][11][12].\n\nThe image evidence further supports this. Image4 shows performance metrics for the Yelp dataset under \"Original\" and \"Shuffled\" conditions. The accuracy drops from 95.11% to 93.49% when the training set is shuffled, highlighting the impact of word-order on sentiment analysis [4]. This drop is consistent with the text's findings that word-order is vital for sentiment tasks [7][11][12].\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models. The ability of LSTMs to capture sequential patterns enhances their performance, but this advantage diminishes when word-order is disrupted, as evidenced by the performance drop in the Yelp dataset when the training set is shuffled.\n\n![Word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as evidenced by the performance drop in the Yelp dataset when the training set is shuffled.](image4)"}

The model receives a tuple \\(\\chi = (s, h^{+}, h^{-}, r)\\), where \\(h^{+}\\) is a hypothesis ranked higher than \\(h^{-}\\). This input is then passed through a pre-trained cross-lingual encoder and a pooling layer to generate sentence embeddings for each segment in \\(\\chi\\). The embeddings for the source \\(s\\), the better hypothesis \\(h^{+}\\), the worse hypothesis \\(h^{-}\\), and the reference \\(r\\) are used to compute the triplet margin loss, which helps optimize the embedding space to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and the anchors (source and reference).\n\n![Translation Ranking model architecture](image4) shows the architecture of the Translation Ranking model. It highlights the independent encoding of the source, reference, a \"better\" hypothesis, and a \"worse\" one using a pre-trained cross-lingual encoder. The pooling layer then condenses these encoded features into embeddings, which are used to apply the triplet margin loss. This loss function ensures that the embeddings of the better hypothesis are closer to those of the source and reference, while the worse hypothesis is pushed farther away, effectively ranking the hypotheses based on their quality relative to the source and reference.\n\nIn summary, the Translation Ranking model processes its inputs by encoding each segment independently, pooling the embeddings, and optimizing the embedding space using triplet margin loss to rank hypotheses effectively. This approach leverages the cross-lingual encoder and pooling layer to focus on relevant information, as noted in the decision to exclude the raw source embedding due to its minimal added value, allowing the model to concentrate on the reference embedding and other combination features for improved performance."}

According to the text, DSGAN introduces an adversarial learning framework that generates true positive samples and trains a discriminator to classify positive and negative data, thereby improving the robustness of distant supervision relation extraction [1][2]. This method is model-agnostic and can be applied to any distant supervision model, leading to performance improvements across different configurations [1][4][11].\n\n![DSGAN improves model performance by enhancing the generator's ability to recognize true positives from noisy datasets](image8)\n\nThe empirical evaluation shows that DSGAN consistently improves the performance of CNN-based models and PCNN-based models.

The table in image8 further quantifies these improvements, showing that all models benefit from DSGAN, with statistically significant p-values indicating the enhancements are not due to chance [8].\n\nThe flowchart in image7 illustrates the adversarial process, where the generator produces probabilities for samples, and the discriminator evaluates them, creating a feedback loop that refines the generator's ability to identify true positives.

According to the text, when repetition control is introduced, the question-asking rate is reduced from the expected 100% to 79.67% [6]. This reduction is primarily due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, preventing the model from producing common question bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is\" [6]. To address this issue, an additional setting `z=10 (boost)` is introduced, where the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during beam search but is applied afterward to rerank candidates. This adjustment allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams, achieving a 99.54% question-asking rate, albeit with slightly increased external bigram repetition [6].\n\n![Question-asking rate modulation with different control methods](image2)\n\nThe graph in image2 illustrates how different methods control the frequency of question-asking.

Similarly, \"Nintendo\" is identified as the publisher, and \"Game Boy\" as the platform, both linked to their respective Wikidata entries [3][4][5][10].\n\nThe annotation table (image4) provides a structured representation of this process. It lists tokens, their mention types, associated entities, relations, and parent entities. For example, \"1989\" is linked to the publication date \"04-21-1989\" via the relation \"pub date,\" with \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity. The entity \"Nintendo\" is linked through the \"publisher\" relation, and \"Game Boy\" is connected via the \"platform\" relation. This table uses color-coding to distinguish different types of entities and their connections, enhancing clarity [4].\n\nThe annotation also highlights the dynamic nature of the knowledge graph language model (KGLM), which maintains a local knowledge graph that grows as new entities are encountered and their relations are established [3]. This allows the model to render tokens from both the standard vocabulary and the expanded vocabulary from the knowledge graph, supporting the inclusion of dates, quantities, and other rare tokens [1][3].\n\nIn summary, entities and their relationships are represented through a systematic annotation process that links tokens to Wikidata entities, identifies their relations, and updates a local knowledge graph to facilitate context-driven generation. This approach ensures that factual information is accurately captured and utilized in the text generation process.\n\n![Entities and their relationships are represented through a systematic annotation process that links tokens to Wikidata entities, identifies their relations, and updates a local knowledge graph to facilitate context-driven generation.](image4)"}

The distribution of data across these slots is detailed in the table described in image1. \n\nFor each domain, specific slots are listed along with the number of instances available in the training, validation, and test datasets. For example, the **Hotel** domain includes slots like price, type, parking, stay, day, people, area, stars, internet, and name, with 3,381 instances in the training set, 416 in validation, and 394 in testing. Similarly, the **Restaurant** domain has slots such as food, price, area, name, time, day, and people, with 3,813 instances in training, 438 in validation, and 437 in testing. This structured distribution ensures a comprehensive coverage of various slots and their values across different domains, facilitating the training and evaluation of DST models.\n\nThe dataset's multi-domain nature requires models to handle both single-turn and multi-turn mapping, as mentioned in [1]. For instance, the (area, centre) pair from the attraction domain can be inferred from the area information in the restaurant domain, as shown in image7, which illustrates a dialogue involving multiple domains. This complexity necessitates models to share tracking knowledge across domains, as emphasized in [3], to effectively manage the large number of combinations in the ontology.\n\nIn summary, the data distribution in MultiWOZ is meticulously organized to reflect real-world multi-domain interactions, providing a robust framework for developing and evaluating DST models.

This is illustrated in [image1], which shows the distribution of 11.5K multimodal questions across these disciplines. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on daily knowledge and common sense, MMMU delves into more specialized, college-level knowledge, as highlighted in [image4]. This extensive coverage ensures that models are tested on a diverse array of topics, making it a more rigorous benchmark for evaluating general multimodal understanding.\n\nRegarding **depth**, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge to solve its problems. For instance, tasks may involve applying concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory,\" as noted in [2]. This is a significant step up from benchmarks that typically require only commonsense knowledge or simple reasoning. [image4] further emphasizes MMMU's superiority in depth, showing its unique inclusion of complex reasoning tasks compared to other datasets like VQA and GQA.\n\nThe implications of these characteristics are profound. MMMU's comprehensive nature ensures that models are pushed beyond basic perception and reasoning, necessitating advanced multimodal analysis integrated with domain-specific knowledge. This is crucial for assessing the capabilities of models aiming for Expert AGI, as discussed in [3]. The benchmark's challenges, such as handling diverse image formats and interleaved text-image inputs, are vividly illustrated in [image8], which outlines the dataset's key features, including heterogeneous image types and expert-level skills testing.\n\nThe performance of models on MMMU, as shown in [image6], underscores its rigor. Even advanced models like GPT-4V achieve only 55.7% accuracy, indicating substantial room for improvement, particularly in domains with complex visual inputs and heavy reasoning. This highlights MMMU's role in identifying current limitations and guiding future research towards more robust multimodal understanding and reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, MMMU's extensive breadth and depth make it a pivotal tool for evaluating the true capabilities of LMMs and LLMs, pushing the boundaries of what models can achieve in expert-level multimodal tasks. ![MMMU excels in depth and breadth compared to"}

According to the text, the model first splits the input document into sentences and processes each sentence through a Sentence-level BiLSTM to obtain token representations [4]. This step is foundational as it provides the initial contextualized vector space representation for each token in the sentence. The BiLSTM, which is bidirectional, captures both forward and backward context, enhancing the understanding of each token within its local context [4]. \n\n![The image illustrates the DYGIE model's process, starting with an input document split into sentences, each processed through a Sentence-level BiLSTM to obtain token representations.](image1)\n\nThis initial processing is essential for the subsequent steps in the DYGIE framework, where span enumeration identifies possible spans of interest within these token representations. The BiLSTM's output forms the basis for constructing the dynamic span graph, where spans are treated as nodes, and their representations are refined through iterative propagation of coreference and relation links [9]. This initial contextualization is vital for the model's ability to perform entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution effectively, leveraging the rich contextual information provided by the BiLSTM.\n\nIn summary, the sentence-level BiLSTM in the DYGIE model is used to obtain token representations that capture local context, which are then used to identify and refine spans for further processing in the dynamic span graph.

This variation can be attributed to differences in the volume and accessibility of Wikipedia content in these languages.\n\n![Number of Articles by Language](image8)\n\nThe dataset aims to cover a broad range of topics and cultures, but the availability of source material in each language influences the number of articles included. English, being a widely used language with extensive online resources, naturally has more articles. In contrast, languages with less online content or different annotation protocols may have fewer articles. This distribution ensures a diverse yet balanced dataset, allowing for cross-lingual evaluation and comparison across languages with varying levels of data availability.\n\nIn summary, the dataset contains 5,530 English articles, 2,682 Vietnamese articles, and fewer articles for other languages, highlighting the challenges and considerations in assembling a multilingual QA dataset."}

This is particularly notable in rare classes, where RAR surpasses CLIP by up to 19.6 percentage points [1]. This advantage is attributed to the RAR's ability to effectively pool relevant information from an external memory, providing a richer context for rare class identification and ensuring adequate attention to lesser-represented classes during classification [1].\n\nIn the context of fine-grained recognition, RAR models consistently outperform CLIP models. For instance, on the V3Det dataset, which presents a challenging array of 13,204 distinct classes, RAR achieves a commendable improvement in performance, surpassing the CLIP baseline by 1.5 percentage points in overall average precision (AP_all) with InternLM-XC2 [2]. This improvement is significant given the complexity of the dataset, highlighting RAR's robust performance in navigating extensive and fine-grained category landscapes [2].\n\nThe RAR method also shows robust enhancements in few-shot and zero-shot recognition settings. On 11 datasets, including 4 fine-grained datasets, RAR boosts top-1 accuracy from 57.0 to 63.2% on the 4-shot setting and from 63.0 to 69.8% on the 8-shot setting, illustrating the effectiveness of the ranking process in aligning predictions with ground truth [10].

The LLM identifies key entities, facts, and rules from the problem statement and formulates it in a symbolic language. This is crucial for ensuring that the problem is accurately represented in a format that can be processed by symbolic solvers. For example, in the Netflix show problem depicted in image3, the textual conditions are translated into symbolic logic predicates and premises.\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**: Once the problem is formulated symbolically, a deterministic symbolic solver performs logical inference on the representation. This solver, such as a logic programming engine or a first-order logic prover, executes precise reasoning steps to derive an answer. The symbolic solver's role is to ensure the reasoning process is faithful and transparent, as seen in image6, where different types of reasoning problems are mapped to specific solvers like Pyke for logical programming or Prover9 for first-order logic.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**: The final stage involves translating the symbolic answer back into natural language. This is done by either an LLM or a rule-based interpreter, ensuring the output is comprehensible to users. This step is essential for bridging the gap between symbolic logic and human-understandable answers, as illustrated in image5, where the model's structure is shown with distinct modules for each stage.\n\nBy integrating LLMs with symbolic solvers, LOGIC-LM leverages the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs while benefiting from the logical precision of symbolic reasoning, as highlighted in image7, which shows improved performance over chain-of-thought methods through iterative self-refinement.\n\nIn summary, LOGIC-LM effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and symbolic solvers to enhance logical reasoning, as demonstrated by its performance improvements on various datasets, as shown in image1 and image8. This approach ensures that the reasoning process is both flexible and reliable, addressing the limitations of pure LLMs in handling complex logical tasks."}

These improvements are attributed to the fact that their values are categorical and can be predicted directly from candidate-value lists, unlike span-based slots. However, [4] notes that `time`-related slots, such as `taxi-leave at` and `train-arrive by`, do not perform well with span matching due to the lack of direct span matching in the dialog context.

In the context of knowledge graphs, leaf nodes typically represent specific instances or entities, while non-leaf nodes might represent more general concepts or categories.\n\nConsidering the process described in the text, where specificity and coherence scores are used to select appropriate knowledge, it is likely that relations pointing to non-specific or general entities (e.g., categories rather than specific instances) would not point to leaf nodes. For example, if a relation points to a general concept like \"painter\" without specifying a particular painter, it would not point to a leaf node.\n\n![The table presents a comparison of different models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Alpaca-7B, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, and Vicuna-13B.

This indicates that while Microsoft is more reliant on renewable energy, both companies still heavily depend on coal, which is a significant source of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe implications of this distribution on CO2 emissions are significant. Coal is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, and its high usage in both companies' energy sources suggests that their operations contribute substantially to greenhouse gas emissions. The higher reliance on coal compared to renewables means that both companies have a larger carbon footprint. However, Microsoft's higher use of renewables could potentially offset some of the emissions from coal, though the impact might be limited given the close coal percentages.\n\n![Energy consumption distribution comparison between Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, while Microsoft uses more renewable energy than Amazon-AWS, both companies have similar coal usage, leading to substantial CO2 emissions.

Specifically, when GloVe embeddings are used without R-GCN, there is a substantial drop in performance, losing 8.0 points in accuracy on the unmasked validation set [3]. This indicates that the R-GCN is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to perform multi-hop reasoning and updating mention representations based on their relations to other entities. Without R-GCN, the model's performance drops significantly, as seen in the GloVe w/o R-GCN configuration, which shows a marked decrease in accuracy compared to configurations with R-GCN [4].\n\nThe image4 table provides a clear comparison of different model configurations.

This further illustrates that removing R-GCN results in a performance decline, especially in the unmasked setting, where the model's accuracy drops from 65.1 to 62.4. In the masked setting, the performance remains relatively stable, but the \"GloVe with R-GCN\" configuration's poor masked performance (11.1) highlights the importance of R-GCN in handling masked data effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the \"No R-GCN\" configuration's performance is also compared to \"No relation types,\" which shows similar accuracy in the unmasked setting (62.7 vs. 62.4) but slightly better in the masked setting (63.9 vs. 63.2). This suggests that while R-GCN is vital for leveraging relational information, the absence of relation types also impacts performance, though not as drastically as removing R-GCN itself.\n\nIn summary, removing R-GCN leads to a noticeable decrease in model performance in both unmasked and masked settings, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities and handling of relational data.\n\n![Removing R-GCN results in a significant drop in"}

Specifically, the adaptive filter-then-rerank approach, which uses SLMs as filters and LLMs as rerankers, achieves an average F1 gain of 2.4% across multiple few-shot IE tasks [6][7]. This improvement is achieved by selectively reranking hard samples, which constitute a minor fraction (0.5% to 10%) of the total samples, yet significantly boost performance [11].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image1 provides a detailed comparison of performance metrics for different models on the TACREV dataset.

Word-level embeddings provide semantic representations of words, capturing their meanings and contexts, which are essential for understanding the overall meaning of sentences. Character-level embeddings, on the other hand, allow the model to capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which are important for handling words with complex structures or those not present in the training data.\n\nBy combining these two types of embeddings, the model can leverage the strengths of both approaches. Word embeddings help in understanding the general context and semantics, while character embeddings provide detailed information about word forms, improving the model's ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words and morphological variations. This dual approach is particularly beneficial in low-resource languages where word embeddings might not cover all possible word forms, and character-level information can fill in the gaps.\n\nFor instance, in the architecture depicted in ![Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model](image3), the Char Bi-LSTM processes character-level information to create character embeddings for each word, which are then concatenated with word embeddings in the Word Bi-LSTM layer. This integration allows the model to consider both the semantic meaning of words and their structural details, enhancing its performance in tasks like NER.\n\nMoreover, as mentioned in the text, during training, word embeddings are not normalized to retain frequency information conveyed by vector length, which is an important signal for NER, especially since named entities appear less frequently in monolingual corpora. This approach ensures that the model benefits from both the semantic richness of word embeddings and the structural nuances captured by character embeddings, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in identifying named entities across different languages.\n\nIn summary, using both word-level and character-level embeddings allows the model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the input text, improving its performance in cross-lingual NER tasks, especially in low-resource settings."}

This approach laid the groundwork for quantitatively comparing word meanings across different time periods. The timeline shows that in 2011, researchers began exploring the use of the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" [12], which played a crucial role in the development of the field by providing a large-scale dataset for analyzing word usage and meaning changes across decades.\n\nBy 2012, the focus shifted towards \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" addressing the challenge of identifying the specific time span a word's meaning belongs to [3]. This was further advanced in 2013 with the development of \"Prediction-based models,\" such as Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), which became a cornerstone in semantic shift analysis [10]. The use of \"word2vec\" as an example of \"Word embeddings\" in 2014 demonstrated the power of dense word representations in capturing semantic nuances over time [10].\n\nIn 2015, the development of \"Models alignment\" allowed for comparing word vectors across different time periods, enhancing the ability to detect semantic shifts [2]. The following year, 2016, saw the utilization of the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" for more detailed analysis [8], expanding the range of datasets available for studying semantic changes.\n\nThe year 2017 was particularly significant, with insights into \"Laws of semantic change\" and the realization that \"Local measures better for cultural shifts\" [6]. Researchers also employed the \"Gigaword corpus\" and explored \"Diachronic relations\" [8], providing deeper understanding of how word meanings evolve in response to cultural and historical events.

According to the text, removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance [8]. This highlights the importance of the abstract in capturing document-level relatedness. Additionally, adding authors as an input, along with the title and abstract, actually hurts performance, possibly due to the sparsity of author names in the corpus and suboptimal tokenization using Wordpieces, which can lead to noisy correlations [8]. Conversely, adding venue information slightly decreases performance except in document classification, where it makes sense as venues are expected to have high correlation [8].\n\nThe table in image1 provides further insights. It shows that the base SPECTER model performs best overall, with bolded scores indicating the highest performance in each category. Removing the abstract (\"− abstract\") leads to lower scores across all metrics, confirming its importance. Adding venue information (\"+ venue\") improves performance in classification (CLS) but not in other tasks. Adding author information (\"+ author\") generally decreases performance, aligning with the text's explanation. Variations in training approaches, such as \"No hard negatives\" and \"Start w/ BERT-Large,\" also impact performance, with the base SPECTER model consistently outperforming these variations.\n\nThe ablation study results in the text and image1 demonstrate that the base SPECTER model, which includes the abstract and excludes author information, achieves the best balance of features for optimal performance across tasks.

This bias can lead to poor label diversity in selected queries. The use of pseudo-labels is proposed as a solution to mitigate this issue by enforcing label diversity without requiring manual annotations [2, 5, 10]. Pseudo-labels are generated using clustering methods like $K$-means, which helps in identifying typical data points that are harder to contrast, thereby improving diversity [5, 10].\n\nThe image descriptions provide further insights. Image6 shows a comparison between data maps based on ground truth and pseudo-labels for PathMNIST. The data map by ground truth (image6b) requires manual annotations and may lead to poor label diversity due to selection bias. In contrast, the data map by pseudo-labels (image6c) identifies easy-to-contrast and hard-to-contrast data, which are more diverse and do not require manual labels, thus alleviating the cold start problem [10].\n\nThe text also mentions that hard-to-contrast data, identified using pseudo-labels, are more typical and possess common visual patterns, while easy-to-contrast data may act as outliers, potentially undermining the purpose of clustering [10, 11]. This suggests that the pseudo-label strategy aims to reduce variance by selecting more representative data points.\n\nConsidering these points, the map by ground truth likely has a larger confidence variance because it relies on manual annotations and may not effectively address the bias towards certain classes, leading to less diverse selections. In contrast, the pseudo-label strategy aims to reduce variance by selecting data that better represents the overall distribution, thus having a smaller confidence variance.\n\n![Pseudo-labels strategy helps reduce variance by selecting more representative data points](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the map by pseudo-labels has a smaller confidence variance compared to the map by ground truth on the PathMNIST dataset."}

Initially, BERT achieves a peak performance of 77% on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, this performance is largely attributed to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset [5]. When evaluated on the adversarial dataset, which aims to eliminate these cues, BERT's performance drops to a maximum of 53% with a mean and median of 50% [9]. This indicates that the adversarial dataset provides a more robust assessment of argument comprehension, as it reduces the model's reliance on spurious statistics [12].\n\nThe architecture of the BERT classifier, as depicted in image2, involves joining the claim and reason to form the first text segment, which is paired with each warrant and processed independently. The final layer CLS vector is passed to a linear layer to obtain logits, and the whole architecture is fine-tuned with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a maximum of 20 training epochs [2]. This setup is used to analyze the model's performance across different configurations.\n\nTable 4 in the text [3] and image4 show the results for BERT Large on the adversarial test set.

Additionally, the text quality evaluation shows that OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and ChatGPT, generally have better text quality compared to LLaMA family models [4]. However, there is a limitation in text quality evaluation where ChatGPT scores higher than GPT-4 due to potential bias [6].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image6 provides a detailed comparison of GPT-4 and ChatGPT under general and specific settings. In the general setting, GPT-4 has higher alignment and correctness scores, but lower precision and recall compared to ChatGPT.

This is supported by the qualitative analysis using a 1500-word Cinderella fairytale, where RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval outperformed Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) by selecting nodes from different tree layers, matching the question's detail level [2]. The collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers, allowing it to retrieve information that is at the correct level of granularity, unlike tree traversal, which maintains a constant ratio of thematic information to granular details regardless of the question [6].\n\nThe image8 illustrates this comparison graphically. The graph shows the F1 score for both methods across varying context lengths. The collapsed tree method (green line) peaks at 2000 tokens, achieving the highest F1 score, and slightly decreases as the context length increases to 2500. In contrast, the tree traversal method (blue line) shows a steady increase in F1 score with context length but performs lower than the collapsed tree method overall. This visual evidence aligns with the study's conclusion that the collapsed tree approach is more effective due to its ability to search through all nodes simultaneously, providing greater flexibility [4][6].\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree method outperforms tree traversal in terms of F1 score, particularly at a context length of 2000 tokens, as it offers greater flexibility in retrieving information at the appropriate granularity for the question.\n\n![The graph comparing different querying methods based on the F1 score shows that the collapsed tree method peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, slightly decreasing as the context length increases to 2500, while the tree traversal method shows a steady increase in F1 score but overall performs lower than the collapsed tree method.](image8)"}

This is significantly larger than many existing benchmarks, which often focus on more limited datasets [4]. The MMMU dataset is meticulously designed to cover a wide range of **30 diverse image types**, including diagrams, tables, plots, charts, photographs, chemical structures, medical images, and more [1, 4, 12]. This diversity is crucial for testing the visual perception capabilities of multimodal models, as highlighted in the dataset overview [4].\n\nIn contrast, other benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz are often limited to common sense knowledge and simpler image formats [6]. MMMU's inclusion of complex image types such as DNA sequences, geometric shapes, and music sheets pushes models to generalize beyond typical training data, as seen in the performance disparities across image types [7]. The benchmark's emphasis on **expert-level reasoning** is another distinguishing factor. MMMU requires models to apply advanced subject knowledge, such as Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory, to solve problems, going beyond basic visual perception [9, 12]. This depth of reasoning is absent in many existing benchmarks, which typically require only commonsense knowledge or simple reasoning [4].\n\nThe MMMU benchmark's unique challenges are vividly illustrated in its design, which includes interleaved text and image inputs, demanding models to jointly understand both modalities and recall deep subject knowledge [12]. This is a significant step up from benchmarks that do not require such integrated understanding [4]. The table in image6 further emphasizes MMMU's superiority in breadth and depth, showing its extensive coverage of image formats and its focus on complex reasoning tasks [6].\n\nIn summary, the MMMU benchmark excels in providing a rigorous and diverse testing ground for multimodal models, with its large dataset size, extensive image types, and requirement for expert-level reasoning, setting it apart from other benchmarks in the field.\n\n![MMMU excels in depth (reasoning) and breadth (knowledge) compared to other benchmarks](image6)"}

According to the text, the model's performance metrics are reported for different training conditions, including the exclusion of crowd-sourced data, head word data, and entity linking data. \n\nFrom the text [3], we know that the model's performance is evaluated using macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1, as well as the average mean reciprocal rank (MRR). The exclusion of different data sources is shown to affect these metrics, particularly in the Ultra-Fine category, which is more challenging to predict due to its specificity.\n\nThe table in image3 provides detailed metrics on the impact of excluding parts of the data on the training performance. When the crowd-sourced data is excluded (– Crowd), the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category is notably affected, as indicated by the changes in precision, recall, and F1-score. Similarly, excluding the head word data (– Head) and entity linking data (– EL) also impacts the Ultra-Fine category performance, with varying degrees of effect.\n\nThe table shows that the Ultra-Fine category is particularly sensitive to the exclusion of head word data, which is crucial for predicting ultra-fine labels [10]. This is because head words provide context that helps in distinguishing between similar types, which is essential for ultra-fine granularity.\n\nIn summary, the exclusion of different data sources, especially head word data, significantly affects the model's performance on the Ultra-Fine category, as evidenced by the changes in precision, recall, and F1-score in image3.

Assurance focuses on robust policies and procedures to ensure compliance and sound decision-making [1], while Consulting involves working closely with clients to drive innovation and growth, offering deep industry and functional expertise [7]. The image quotes provide specific metrics about PwC's operations.\n\nThe images show business metrics such as the number of offices, countries, and employees. Image7 highlights the different services offered by PwC, including Assurance and Consulting, each represented by distinct icons and colors. Image5 and image6 provide details about the company's presence, indicating 20 offices, 1914 employees, and operations in 12 countries. Image1 and image2 also show similar metrics, with 12 offices, 9 countries, and 1816 employees, but these might represent different time periods or specific segments.\n\nThe Assurance sector, represented by the orange section with a computer and lock icon in image7, likely focuses on compliance and risk management, which are critical in a regulated environment. Consulting, shown in the pink section with an eye and globe icon, emphasizes strategic and operational expertise across various industries. The geographical distribution and personnel numbers suggest that both sectors are integral to PwC's Middle East operations, but their specific roles and client interactions might differ.\n\nGiven the metrics in the images, Assurance and Consulting both operate across the same 12 countries with 1914 employees, indicating a similar geographical reach. However, the nature of their work and the specific services they provide might lead to different distributions of personnel within these countries. Assurance might have a stronger presence in regions with higher regulatory requirements, while Consulting could be more focused on areas with significant growth and innovation opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, while Assurance and Consulting at PwC Middle East share similar geographical and personnel metrics, their roles and client engagements differ, with Assurance focusing on compliance and Consulting on strategic growth and innovation. This distinction is crucial for understanding their unique contributions to the organization's overall strategy and client support.\n\n![PwC's services including Assurance and Consulting](image7)"}

According to the analytics value chain, data is first collected and stored, then used for reporting, followed by analysis to gain insights, and finally, these insights are translated into actions that drive value. This progression is crucial because, as emphasized in the quote [4], \"Analytics is about impact...In our company [Zynga], if you have brilliant insight and you did great research and no one changes, you get zero credit.\" This highlights the importance of not just generating insights but also ensuring they lead to actionable decisions and ultimately, business impact.\n\nThe levels of analytics, as depicted in image8, further elaborate on this progression. Starting with standard reports that answer \"What happened?\" and ad-hoc reports that address \"How many, how often, where?\", the process moves through query drilldowns and alerts to statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and finally, optimization. Each stage builds on the previous one, increasing both the business value and the degree of intelligence. For instance, statistical analysis seeks to understand \"Why is this happening?\" while predictive modeling forecasts \"What will happen next?\" and optimization evaluates \"What's the best that can happen?\" This structured approach ensures that data is not just analyzed but also used to drive strategic decisions and maximize business value.\n\nMoreover, the analytics value chain, as described in quote [3], emphasizes that value is only realized when data moves through the entire chain—from collection to action and finally to impact. This aligns with the idea that partial progress along the chain does not suffice; the full transformation from data to value is necessary for true impact.\n\nIn summary, transforming data into business value involves a comprehensive process that starts with data collection and storage, progresses through reporting and analysis, and culminates in actionable insights and strategic decisions. This progression is essential for achieving the ultimate goal of data-driven decision-making and maximizing business impact. As quote [6] suggests, strong data leadership supports this process by ensuring that the analytics organization is equipped to perform at its best, driving insights and actions that lead to significant business value.\n\n![Data-driven process transforming data into value](image1)"}

This alignment is facilitated by the mitotic spindle, composed of microtubules, which attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes [6]. The spindle fibers ensure that each homologous pair is positioned correctly for subsequent separation [12]. This alignment is essential for the proper distribution of genetic material during meiosis.\n\nSecondly, the chromosomes are highly condensed, making them visible under a microscope. This condensation is part of the preparation for division, where chromatin becomes compact, and each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids joined at the centromere [9]. The centromere is a critical structure that holds the sister chromatids together until they are ready to separate.\n\nThirdly, the process of crossing over, which involves the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, has already occurred during Prophase I. This exchange, known as recombination, increases genetic variation by shuffling alleles between chromosomes [1]. Although crossing over is completed before Metaphase I, its effects are evident in the genetic diversity of the aligned chromosomes.\n\nLastly, the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate ensures that during Anaphase I, homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, reducing the chromosome number by half [5]. This separation is a defining feature of meiosis I, leading to the formation of haploid cells in the subsequent stages of meiosis.\n\n![Metaphase I: Homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate](image2)\n\nIn summary, Metaphase I is characterized by the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, the presence of a condensed chromatin structure, and the preparation for the separation of chromosomes in Anaphase I, all of which are essential for the reduction of chromosome number and the generation of genetic diversity."}

These systems simplify the erection and stripping process, allowing contractors to work on various types of construction projects [7]. Prefabricated formwork is also noted for its ability to be reused either as large sections or individual units, reducing on-site labor needs [7]. The development of gang forming, which involves grouping and moving multiple forms as a single unit, is a significant advancement in prefab forming [3], [12].

This image directly illustrates the concept of assembling large concrete form panels as a single unit, a key feature of prefabricated formwork systems [3], [12].\n- **Image7** shows a 3D model of a construction formwork setup for a concrete column, including scaffolding and stabilizing braces. This setup is indicative of the precision and efficiency offered by prefabricated formwork systems [7].\n\nThese images and text quotes together demonstrate that prefabricated formwork systems are used in various construction scenarios, from large-scale projects involving cranes and gang forming to detailed setups for specific structural elements like columns. The modular and reusable nature of these systems is evident in both the text and visual examples provided.\n\nIn conclusion, the structures shown as examples of prefabricated formwork include metal formwork or mold boxes, large concrete form panels being hoisted by cranes, and detailed setups for concrete columns with scaffolding and braces.

Two examples of reflecting surfaces can be understood through the provided text and image quotes.\n\nFirst, **mirrors** are a classic example of reflecting surfaces. Mirrors are designed to reflect light efficiently, following the law of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This principle is illustrated in image1, which shows light rays reflecting off a surface with the angle of incidence (\\(i^\\circ\\)) equal to the angle of reflection (\\(r^\\circ\\)). This behavior is crucial for applications like mirrors in homes and telescopes, where precise reflection is necessary.\n\nSecond, **fiber optics** also utilize reflecting surfaces. In fiber optics, light is guided through a medium by reflecting off the inner walls of a cable. This is achieved through a process called Total Internal Reflection (TIR), as suggested by image2, which references TIR and fiber optics. The thin cables, made of a denser material than the surrounding air, ensure that light reflects internally, allowing it to travel long distances with minimal loss, as depicted in image7.\n\nThese examples highlight how different materials and technologies use reflection to control and utilize light effectively.\n\n**Answer:** Two examples of reflecting surfaces are mirrors and the inner walls of fiber optic cables."}

This stage involves generating reports, dashboards, and alerts, transforming data into information [7]. However, it lacks context and storytelling, limiting its ability to provide deep insights.\n\nAs we move to business analytics, the process becomes more forward-looking and prescriptive. The analysis phase involves in-depth examination of data to gain insights, answering questions like \"Why?\" and \"What will happen next?\" [7]. This phase uses data and information to derive insights, which are then used to make informed decisions or take actions, ultimately leading to increased value [3][5][7]. The flowchart in image3 illustrates this progression, showing how data is transformed into value through reporting, analysis, action, and finally, value creation.\n\nThe diagram in image8 further highlights this progression, showing an increase in both business value and intelligence as one moves from standard reports to predictive modeling and optimization. Each stage builds on the previous one, enhancing the depth and impact of insights. For instance, statistical analysis explores \"Why is this happening?\" while predictive modeling forecasts \"What will happen next?\" [8]. This transition allows organizations to not only understand past events but also anticipate future trends and optimize outcomes.\n\nMoreover, strong data leadership and a data-driven culture, as mentioned in the text quotes [1][3][6][8][9][10][11][12], play a crucial role in this transition. They ensure that business units have necessary data access and analytical skills, actively manage data quality, and embed data and analytics into organizational processes [5][6][8][11][12]. This support enables analysts to perform at their best, maximizing their impact and driving strategic objectives [6][7].\n\nIn summary, the transition from business intelligence to business analytics enhances data handling and insights generation by shifting from descriptive reporting to prescriptive analysis, supported by strong data leadership and a data-driven culture, ultimately leading to increased business value and intelligence. ![Transition from business intelligence to business analytics enhances data handling and insights generation](image8)"}

The image3 provides a detailed breakdown of the 'Needs Exploration' phase, highlighting several components:\n\n1. **Active stakeholder participation**: Engaging stakeholders directly to gather and validate requirements ensures that the project meets their needs and expectations. This is crucial for aligning the development process with the actual requirements of the end-users and stakeholders.\n\n2. **High-level requirements specification**: This involves defining the broad requirements that the solution must meet. It sets the foundation for more detailed specifications and ensures that the project has a clear direction.\n\n3. **Split (A/B) testing**: This technique involves testing different versions of a feature or requirement to determine which one performs better. It helps in making data-driven decisions about which requirements to prioritize and implement.\n\n4. **Detailed requirements specification**: After high-level requirements are defined, detailed specifications are created to provide a comprehensive understanding of each requirement. This ensures that the development team has a clear and precise guide to follow.\n\n5. **Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)**: This approach involves writing acceptance tests before writing the code. It ensures that the solution meets the acceptance criteria defined by the stakeholders, aligning the development process with the expected outcomes.\n\n6. **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming**: This practice involves creating models and diagrams as needed during the development process. It allows for flexibility and adaptability, ensuring that the models are always up-to-date and relevant.\n\n7. **Look-ahead modeling**: This involves creating models that anticipate future needs and changes. It helps in planning and preparing for potential changes in requirements, ensuring that the solution remains adaptable and scalable.\n\nThese components work together to ensure that the 'Needs Exploration' phase is thorough and effective, leading to a solution that meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations. The image3 illustrates these components, emphasizing their importance in the overall process of producing a potentially consumable solution.\n\n![The Needs Exploration phase involves active stakeholder participation, high-level and detailed requirements specification, split testing, acceptance test-driven development, just-in-time model storm"}

In telophase, the nuclear membrane re-forms around the separated sets of chromosomes, which have moved to opposite ends of the cell. This process is crucial for the re-establishment of the nucleus in each daughter cell. The chromosomes begin to decondense, and nucleoli reform, indicating the end of mitosis [8]. This is visually represented in image8, where chromosomes are shown in blue, and the reformation of nucleoli is marked, highlighting the transition from mitosis to the next phase [8].\n\nCytokinesis, which often overlaps with telophase, involves the division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms, which is a contractile ring of microfilaments that pinches the cell in two, as depicted in image2 [2]. This process is essential for the physical separation of the two daughter cells. In plant cells, cytokinesis is different; a cell plate forms in the middle from vesicles containing cell wall material, as shown in image10, and grows outward to divide the contents into two cells [10]. This image illustrates the formation of a cell plate, a critical step in the division of plant cells.\n\nThe process of cytokinesis is also depicted in image6, where a contracting ring of microfilaments is shown, indicating the cell's division into two separate but identical cells [6]. This image emphasizes the role of microfilaments in the physical separation of the cell.\n\nIn summary, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear membrane reforms, nucleoli reappear, and the cytoplasm divides, either through a cleavage furrow in animal cells or a cell plate in plant cells, leading to the formation of two daughter cells.\n\n**Answer:** During telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear membrane reforms around chromosomes, nucleoli reappear, and the cytoplasm divides, either through a cleavage furrow in animal cells or a cell plate in plant cells, resulting in two daughter cells."}

According to Mendel's experiments, the parental generation consists of homozygous plants, one with purple flowers (PP) and the other with white flowers (pp). When these plants are crossed, all F₁ generation offspring are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype due to the presence of the dominant allele P. This is illustrated in the genetic cross diagram ![Mendelian inheritance of traits in plants](image1), where the parental generation (P Plants) produces gametes with only the P allele from the purple-flowered plant and only the p allele from the white-flowered plant, resulting in all F₁ hybrids being Pp.\n\nIn the F₂ generation, the F₁ hybrids (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles. When these gametes combine, the F₂ offspring exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers, corresponding to the genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp. This segregation of alleles is a direct result of Mendel's law of segregation, which states that each parent passes on only one allele for each trait to its offspring. The image ![Mendelian inheritance in pea plants](image4) further illustrates this, showing the F₂ generation with ¾ purple-flowered and ¼ white-flowered plants, demonstrating the segregation of alleles.\n\nThe dominance of the purple allele (P) over the white allele (p) is a key factor in this ratio. The presence of at least one P allele in the genotype results in the purple phenotype, while the white phenotype only appears when both alleles are p.

When these plants are crossed, all the F1 generation offspring are heterozygous (Pp) and display the dominant purple phenotype because the presence of the dominant allele (P) masks the recessive allele (p) [3].\n\nMoving to the F2 generation, the F1 hybrids (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles [3]. When these gametes combine, the possible genotypes for the F2 offspring are PP, Pp, and pp. The phenotypic ratio of these genotypes is 3 purple to 1 white, as the dominant allele (P) is expressed in the presence of either another dominant or recessive allele, while the recessive allele (p) is only expressed when two recessive alleles are present [3].\n\nThe image3 provides a visual representation of this process, showing the F2 generation with a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white flowers and a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp [3]. This image illustrates the classical Mendelian inheritance pattern, where the dominant trait (purple flowers) is more frequently observed due to the presence of the dominant allele in the heterozygous state.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation is 3:1 (purple:white), and the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (PP:Pp:pp).\n\n![Phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation](image3)"}

In the context of the graph, this means that data points and lines that are visually close in time are likely to be grouped together, helping us identify patterns and trends over the specified period.\n\nThe graph depicts data trends across six months: June, July, August, October, and December. Each colored line represents a different dataset or category, and the values on the vertical axis range from 0 to 70. By observing the proximity of data points on each line, we can discern fluctuations and changes in the data over time. For instance, if a line shows a consistent upward trend, it indicates growth or improvement in that category. Conversely, a downward trend would suggest a decline.\n\nThe image of the multi-line graph [4] provides a visual interpretation of these changes, allowing us to see how each category evolves over the months. The proximity of data points on each line helps in identifying whether the trends are steady, fluctuating, or showing significant changes. This visual grouping aids in understanding the overall behavior of each dataset, making it easier to compare and contrast the performance of different categories over the six-month period.\n\nIn summary, the trends observed in the multi-line graph chart over the six months can be analyzed by looking at the proximity of data points on each line, which helps in identifying patterns such as growth, decline, or stability in the respective datasets. This approach aligns with the Gestalt principle of proximity, enhancing our ability to interpret the data effectively.\n\n![Trends in the multi-line graph chart over six months](image4)"}

This involves several activities aimed at gathering and refining requirements to ensure they align with stakeholder needs. According to text quote [6], product owners dealing with complex domains may need support, especially when stakeholders are geographically distributed, suggesting the importance of active stakeholder participation. Image2 illustrates this by showing 'Needs Exploration' as a component that includes active stakeholder participation, high-level requirements specification, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). These activities ensure that stakeholders are involved throughout the process, helping to clarify and validate requirements.\n\n**Elicitation Methods**, on the other hand, are techniques used to gather information from stakeholders. Image4 highlights various elicitation methods such as Just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, all-hands demos, and iteration demos. These methods are designed to engage stakeholders directly or indirectly, ensuring that their needs are captured effectively. For instance, JIT model storming allows for quick, iterative modeling sessions that can adapt to changing requirements, while all-hands demos provide a platform for stakeholders to see and provide feedback on the evolving solution.\n\nBoth strategies are crucial in agile management but serve slightly different purposes. 'Needs Exploration' is more about the process of defining and refining requirements, while 'Elicitation Methods' are the tools used to gather and validate those requirements. They complement each other by ensuring that stakeholders are actively involved and that their needs are accurately captured and addressed.\n\nIn summary, 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods' are interconnected strategies in agile management. 'Needs Exploration' sets the stage for understanding stakeholder requirements, while 'Elicitation Methods' provide the mechanisms to gather and validate these requirements. Together, they ensure that stakeholder needs are met effectively throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n![Active stakeholder participation is crucial in both strategies](image4)"}

This smooth flow or pathway suggests a seamless connection, emphasizing the idea that elements tend to be grouped based on their alignment and direction [3][12].\n\nThe principle of **Similarity** is showcased in the letters \"T\" and \"A,\" which share a similar striped pattern. This visual similarity leads us to group them together, reinforcing the concept that objects with similar shapes or colors are perceived as part of a group [10][12].\n\nThe principle of **Closure** is illustrated by the \"G\" and \"E\" together, where part of the shape is missing, yet our perception fills in the visual gap to create a closed form. This demonstrates how we tend to perceive objects as whole even when they are incomplete [11][12].\n\nLastly, the principle of **Pregnancy (Prägnanz)** is reflected in the simplicity and clarity of the \"A.\" This principle suggests that our perception tends towards seeing the simplest form, highlighting the preference for conciseness and regularity in visual perception [4][12].\n\nThese principles collectively demonstrate how Gestalt psychology influences our interpretation of visual elements, creating a cohesive and meaningful perception of the word \"GESTALT\" as a unified whole.\n\n![Gestalt principles in the word \"GESTALT\" are demonstrated through segregation, closure, proximity, continuity, similarity, pregnancy, and unity.](image2)"}

This module emphasizes understanding the steps to visualize geographic data directly from Wikidata, as illustrated in the workshop slide [1] and the instructional graphic [image1]. The slide highlights the use of SPARQL queries to extract and map data points, such as the colored dots on the map of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany [image1]. This foundational knowledge is crucial for manipulating and visualizing data effectively.\n\n**Module 2** builds on this by introducing intermediate techniques for embedding maps within Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons. Participants learn to integrate maps into these platforms using tools like OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the Mediawiki Kartographer extension. The learning objectives for this module are summarized in the workshop's instructional graphic [image2], which outlines the transition from basic to embedded maps. The graphic also includes a map of the Netherlands with a data pop-up for \"Schoorl public library,\" demonstrating how maps can be embedded with interactive data points [image2]. This module bridges the gap between data visualization and practical application within Wikimedia projects.\n\n**Module 3** advances to creating interactive, layered maps that can be used outside of Wikimedia platforms. This involves using additional tools and techniques, including basic Python and Jupyter notebooks, as described in the workshop's detailed module description [9]. The Jupyter notebook example [image2] shows how to create off-Wiki maps, emphasizing the use of Python for more complex map configurations. The workshop's GitHub repository [image4] provides resources and code snippets to support this advanced learning, reinforcing the hands-on approach to off-Wiki map creation.\n\nEach module progressively increases in complexity, starting from basic map creation, moving to embedding within Wikimedia, and finally to advanced off-Wiki map development, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of map-making using Wikidata.\n\nIn summary, the key learning objectives differ by module, with Module 1 focusing on basic map creation, Module 2 on embedding maps in Wikimedia projects, and Module 3 on advanced off-Wiki map development, each building on the previous skills to provide a thorough education in Wikidata-driven mapping."}

Initially, consuming hot dogs yields positive utility, indicating enjoyment and satisfaction. For instance, the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, and the second offers +4, suggesting that the first few hot dogs are enjoyable and satisfying [4]. However, as more hot dogs are consumed, the utility decreases, reflecting diminishing marginal utility. The third hot dog yields zero utility, and the fourth and fifth hot dogs result in negative utility of -1 and -4, respectively [4]. This trend continues with the sixth hot dog, which provides a utility of -10, indicating that consuming additional hot dogs beyond a certain point leads to discomfort or dissatisfaction [4].\n\nThis pattern of diminishing marginal utility implies that variety is crucial in consumption behavior. As enjoyment from consuming a particular item, such as hot dogs, decreases, it becomes beneficial to switch to another choice to maintain overall satisfaction [6]. This aligns with the concept that in standard consumption economics, focusing on a single item for too long can be detrimental, and variety helps in managing preferences and maintaining enjoyment [5].\n\nThe image2 illustrates this concept vividly, showing that utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, eventually turning negative. The dramatic jump in utility at 64 hot dogs, from -50 to +5000, highlights the importance of switching choices to avoid negative outcomes and to find new sources of enjoyment [2]. This aligns with the idea that intentional focus on a single activity can lead to diminishing returns, and diversifying activities can enhance overall utility and satisfaction [11].\n\nIn summary, the utility from consuming hot dogs decreases with each additional hot dog, demonstrating the principle of diminishing marginal utility. This implies that consumption behavior should incorporate variety to maintain enjoyment and avoid negative outcomes, supporting the idea that switching choices is essential for sustained satisfaction [6].\n\n![Diminishing Marginal Utility and Differential Outcome related to hot dog consumption](image2)"}

This is depicted in image5, which shows the stages of meiosis I, including **PROPHASE I**, **METAPHASE I**, and **ANAPHASE I**. During **ANAPHASE I**, homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell, as shown in image4, where the **Sister Chromatids and Homologous Chromosomes** are seen starting to separate. This separation reduces the chromosome number by half, as described in text quote [11], and is a critical step in reducing the chromosome number from diploid to haploid.\n\nIn contrast, **meiosis II** focuses on the separation of sister chromatids. Image6 illustrates this process, showing **Anaphase II** where chromatids are separating and moving to opposite poles, and **Telophase II** where the cell is finishing division, forming two new nuclei. This separation does not change the chromosome number, as the cells remain haploid, as mentioned in text quote [11].\n\nThe diagrams in image4 and image5 highlight these differences, with image4 showing the alignment and separation of **Sister Chromatids and Tetrad Formation** in meiosis I, and image5 detailing the stages of meiosis I and II. Image6 further emphasizes the final stages of meiosis II, where haploid daughter cells are formed, each with half the number of chromosomes, as described in image2.\n\nThus, the key difference lies in the type of chromosome separation: meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids, leading to the formation of genetically distinct haploid cells.\n\n![Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes](image5)  \n![Meiosis II separates sister chromatids](image6)  \n![Homologous chromosomes separating in meiosis I](image4)  \n![Sister chromatids separating in meiosis II](image6)  \n\nIn summary, meiosis I involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half, while meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids, maintaining the haploid state.

The fuel supply system is responsible for drawing fuel from the tank and ensuring it is delivered to the injectors at the correct pressure. The electrical fuel pump plays a crucial role in this process by drawing fuel from the tank and forcing it into the regulator [10]. The fuel is then distributed through the fuel rail, which supplies multiple fuel injectors with high-pressure fuel [2]. This setup is common in modern gasoline injection systems, where the fuel is sprayed into the engine intake manifold or directly into the combustion chambers [8].\n\nLooking at the images, image5 provides a detailed diagram of a fuel injection system, highlighting the components involved in the fuel supply process. The fuel supply starts at the fuel tank and moves through the fuel filter to remove impurities. The high-pressure fuel pump then pumps the fuel to the fuel rail, which distributes it to the individual fuel injectors [5]. The fuel pressure regulator maintains the correct pressure in the fuel rail and returns excess fuel back to the fuel supply through the return line [5].\n\nImage6 further illustrates a common rail fuel injection system, where the high-pressure pump increases fuel pressure before it is distributed to the injectors through the common rail [6]. The common rail ensures that all injectors are supplied with high-pressure fuel, which is essential for efficient combustion [2].\n\nImage8 shows a block diagram of a fuel injection system, where the \"FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM\" is connected to both the \"COLD START SYSTEM\" and the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM,\" which then supply the engine [8]. This diagram emphasizes the interconnectedness of the fuel supply system with other subsystems, ensuring that fuel is delivered appropriately to the engine.\n\nIn summary, the fuel supply system is connected to the fuel filter, high-pressure fuel pump, fuel rail, fuel injectors, and the fuel pressure regulator. These components work together to ensure that fuel is delivered efficiently and at the correct pressure to the engine.\n\n**Answer**: The fuel supply is connected to the fuel filter, high-pressure fuel pump, fuel rail, fuel injectors, and fuel pressure regulator."}

However, thicker plywood may be used when the weight of the concrete causes a standard thickness to bow out, distorting the concrete face [5]. This suggests that using thicker sheeting can provide additional support and stability.\n\nThe image quotes provide specific dimensions for construction materials. Image3 lists sheeting thicknesses for slabs, beam sides, and column sides ranging from 25mm to 40mm [3]. This indicates that 25mm sheeting is indeed a common and recommended thickness for certain applications, aligning with the text's suggestion that thicker plywood can be beneficial in certain scenarios.\n\nConsidering these points, both 20mm and 25mm sheeting could be appropriate, but 25mm sheeting is more likely to provide the necessary support and stability, especially in situations where the concrete weight might cause distortion.

It receives data from multiple sensors, such as the Engine Temperature Sensor, Intake Air Temperature Sensor, Mass Air Flow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, HEGO Sensor, Crankshaft Sensor, and Camshaft Sensor, which provide critical information about the engine's operating conditions [1][12]. This information is used to determine the appropriate fuel injection quantity, ignition timing, and idle speed adjustments [3][5][6][11]. \n\nThe ECU processes these inputs to calculate the necessary fuel and air mixture for efficient combustion. For instance, if the throttle pedal is pressed further down, the ECU adjusts the fuel injection to match the increased air intake, ensuring the engine receives the right amount of fuel [4]. Similarly, if the engine is cold, the ECU injects more fuel to help it warm up quickly [4]. The ECU also controls the timing of the spark to optimize power and economy [5]. \n\nIn the depicted engine management system, the ECU is connected to various injectors, including Injector 1 through Injector 6 and the Cold Start Injector, directing fuel delivery based on the calculated requirements [1][12]. This ensures that the engine operates efficiently under different conditions, from cold starts to full throttle [3][4][5][6][11]. \n\nThe ECU's role is further illustrated in the block diagram of the fuel injection system, where it acts as the \"CONTROL SYSTEM,\" receiving inputs from the \"DETECTING SYSTEM\" and sending control signals to the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM\" to regulate fuel flow [12]. This integration of control signals and fuel flow is essential for maintaining the engine's performance and efficiency [12].\n\nIn summary, the ECU is the brain of the engine management system, coordinating the flow of information and control to ensure the engine operates smoothly and efficiently by managing fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed based on real-time sensor data.\n\n![The image is a diagram depicting the flow of information and control in an engine management system.

The three main steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Duplication of Chromosomal Material**: The first step involves the duplication of the single circular chromosome within the prokaryotic cell. This process ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical copy of the genetic material. As described in the text, \"A single circular chromosome duplicates, and the copies begin to separate from each other\" [11]. This duplication is crucial for maintaining genetic consistency across generations. The image4 illustrates a prokaryotic cell with a tangled mass inside, likely representing the bacterial DNA or nucleoid, emphasizing the presence of genetic material ready for duplication.\n\n2. **Cell Elongation and Separation of Chromosomal Copies**: After duplication, the cell begins to elongate. This elongation facilitates the movement of the chromosomal copies further apart, ensuring they are positioned at opposite ends of the cell. The text explains, \"The cell elongates, and the chromosomal copies separate further\" [11]. This step is visually represented in image8, which shows a bacterial cell dividing into two daughter cells, highlighting the elongation and the even distribution of genetic material.\n\n3. **Formation of Two Daughter Cells**: The final step involves the formation of two separate daughter cells. The plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the elongated cell, effectively dividing it into two distinct cells. Each daughter cell receives one copy of the duplicated chromosome. This process is depicted in image8, where the image illustrates the division of a single bacterial cell into two, with genetic material being evenly distributed.\n\nThese steps ensure that prokaryotic cells can reproduce rapidly and efficiently, maintaining genetic stability and continuity.\n\n**Conclusion**: The three steps of binary fission in prokaryotic cells are the duplication of chromosomal material, cell elongation and separation of chromosomal copies, and the formation of two daughter cells. ![Binary fission involves DNA replication and cell division into two cells](image8)"}

In standard consumption contexts, this is evident as shown in image1, where the utility from consuming hot dogs decreases significantly with each additional hot dog consumed. For instance, the utility from the first hot dog is +6, but by the 66th, it drops to -50, highlighting the point at which the enjoyment turns negative. This aligns with text quote [2], which emphasizes that diminishing marginal utility leads to a change in preferences, suggesting that one should switch to another choice when enjoyment drops.\n\nIn competitive contexts, however, the application of diminishing marginal utility can differ. As seen in image7, focused practice, even in activities like sports, can lead to increased enjoyment and improved outcomes. The text quote [9] notes that in competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be beneficial, suggesting that while repetition alone may not lead to improvement (text quote [10]), focused practice can enhance both the experience and outcomes. This is supported by image6, which shows that violinists who accumulate more practice hours, particularly from a young age, achieve higher levels of mastery. The graph illustrates that early divergence in practice hours leads to significant differences in skill development, indicating that focused practice can counteract the diminishing returns seen in standard consumption.\n\nThe image8 table further illustrates diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption, showing that utility becomes negative after the fourth hot dog. However, in competitive settings, such as the hot dog eating championship depicted in image1, the focus on achieving a specific goal (e.g., tying for a championship) can alter the perception of utility. The dramatic jump in utility at 64 hot dogs, from -50 to +5000, suggests that in competitive contexts, the achievement of a goal can provide immense satisfaction, even if the marginal utility of each additional unit is negative in a standard consumption sense.\n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption contexts suggests that variety is important to maintain enjoyment (text quote [2]), in competitive contexts, focused practice and goal-oriented behavior can lead to increased utility and improved outcomes, as illustrated by the hot dog consumption example and the violin practice graph. This highlights the importance of intentional focus and the potential for competitive mastery resulting from focus, as mentioned in text quote [12].\n\n![Diminishing Marginal Utility and Differential Outcome in Hot Dog Consumption](image1)  \n"}

This mode is particularly useful when the scene has varying light sources, providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall lighting. On the other hand, **Center Metering Mode** focuses on light near the center of the screen, making it perfect for portraits [5]. This ensures that the subject's face is well-lit and in focus, which is crucial for capturing detailed facial features. Lastly, **Spot Metering Mode** is best for specific focus areas, such as a subject's eyes, allowing for precise exposure adjustments in a particular region [5]. This mode is essential when the subject is backlit or when you want to highlight a specific detail.\n\nRegarding focus modes, **AF-S (single autofocus)** is suitable for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus on objects that do not move [4]. This mode is ideal for still life photography or when capturing a static scene. **AF-C (continuous autofocus)** is designed for moving subjects, continuously adjusting focus to keep up with motion, making it perfect for action shots or sports photography [4]. Lastly, **MF (manual focus)** allows you to touch the subject of interest to focus on them, such as the subject's face, providing precise control over which part of the image is in focus [4]. This mode is beneficial when the camera's autofocus system struggles or when you need to focus on a specific detail.\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, photographers can achieve optimal results in various scenarios, from landscapes to portraits and action shots.
