Specifically, the share dropped from a high of 50% in September 2014 to about 46% currently [7]. This indicates a slight reduction in the overall perception of Islam being more prone to violence among the general public over recent years.\n\nIn terms of political divides, the data shows a stark polarization. A substantial 68% of Republicans consistently believe Islam encourages violence more than other religions, reaching a high point that is nearly unchanged from previous measurements [11]. Conversely, only 30% of Democrats hold this view, a decrease from 42% in September 2014, indicating a significant decline among Democrats in perceiving Islam as more violent [11].\n\nThe graphs further elucidate this division:\n\n- **Graph 2** illustrates the broad partisan gap, with Republicans showing a consistently higher tendency (around 68%) to believe Islam encourages violence, while Democrats hover around 30%. The gap has widened over time, making these perceptions more polarized than ever.\n\n- **Graph 3** reveals ideological boundaries within parties. Conservative Republicans see the highest percentage (around 77%) supporting the view that Islam encourages violence.

For example, seed investments stayed relatively low but steady, while later-stage investments peaked around 2007 before declining slightly. The data suggests a mature and balanced progression across stages with a slight upward trend in later-stage investments approaching 2009.\n\nConversely, in Europe, **image6** illustrates that early-stage investments (Seed, First, Second, Later) experienced more fluctuation with a notable overall decline from 2004 to 2009. The early stages (Seed and First) started at higher levels in 2004 but saw significant decreases by 2009, indicating a contraction in early-stage funding. Meanwhile, later-stage investments, after peaking around 2007, also declined sharply, reflecting a tightening of capital in all stages.\n\nThe quotes support this interpretation by highlighting that European venture capital remains cautious, with a \"long non-contributing tail\" of inactive funds [3], and that funding remains conservative and limited compared to the US, where market stability and publication requirements foster more consistent investment activity [1], [3].\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- **U.S. median investments** across stages from 2004 to 2009 show relative stability with slight upward trends in later stages, indicating a mature and consistent funding environment.\n- **European median investments** generally decline across all stages over the same period, reflecting reduced activity, especially at early stages, consistent with the cautious investment climate and limited private investor capacity in Europe.\n\n**Therefore, the trend demonstrates that the U.S.'s investments in various stages are more stable or gradually increasing, while Europe's investments tend to decline across stages from 2004 to 2009.**"}

However, among independents, a significant portion (around 34%) say neither party possesses high ethical standards [5], indicating a more skepticism towards all parties.\n- Education influences perceptions: among those with a college degree, only 31% say “high ethical standards” describe either party, with a larger group (43%) believing only one party fits that description [10], contrasting with higher confidence among college-educated Democrats (53%) and some college-educated Republicans [10].\n\n**Perceptions of Extremism:**\n- Public views on extremism show that 48% see the Republican Party as “too extreme,” higher than the 42% who see this about the Democratic Party [8].\n- Partisanship heavily influences these perceptions: most Republicans (about 80%) regard their own party as not too extreme [11], while roughly 75% of Democrats share this view for their party. Conversely, a large majority of members from both parties see the opposing party as “too extreme” (about 75%) [11].\n- Ideology within the GOP is notable: among Republican and lean-Republican respondents, views diverge significantly.

When considering those with higher education, about 43% see ethical standards as describing one, but not both parties, and only 17% believe it describes both [3], indicating a nuanced view among educated individuals.\n- Partisans tend to view their own party more favorably on ethics: 66% of Republicans and 64% of Democrats describe their party as having high ethical standards [8]. Conversely, independents and those with lower education levels are more skeptical, with roughly 34–36% of independents stating neither party has high standards, and only about 20% of those with high school or less education share this skepticism [5], [6], [12].\n\n**Perceptions of Extremism:**\n- Democrats are generally viewed as less extreme than Republicans: 48% see the GOP as “too extreme,” compared to 42% for Democrats [7]. Nevertheless, the perception that the Republican Party is “too extreme” has declined since last year (from 54%), while views on Democrats are relatively stable.\n- Among partisan groups, a large majority of each side see the other as “too extreme”: over 75% in both parties describe the opposition this way [11].\n\n**Influence of Education:**\n- Higher education correlates with more critical views: among those with some college or a high school education, fewer perceive high ethical standards to describe either party [3], [12]. Conversely, college-educated individuals are more likely to recognize that only one party may be described by high ethical standards, showing increased nuance.\n- Education also affects perceptions of extremism, with those with less than a college degree more likely to see their own party as less extreme but also more skeptical of the opposition.\n\n**Influence of Political Affiliation:**\n- Partisans generally have a favorable view of their own party’s ethics, with majorities describing their party as having high ethical standards [8].

When examining education's impact, a significant educational divide emerges: among college graduates, only 40% believe that one party alone has high ethical standards, with 31% thinking neither do, and 17% attributing high standards to both parties [10]. Furthermore, among those with postgraduate degrees, only 30% think neither party has high ethical standards, and 40% believe only one does [10].\n\nPartisanship influences perceptions markedly. Majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their own party as having high ethical standards [6], but independents are less optimistic: about 34% believe neither party has high standards, and around 33% think only one does [9]. Notably, independents tend to view both parties more critically than partisans.\n\nThe data also reveal significant racial and educational disparities in perceptions. For example, Black respondents are much more likely to disapprove of Trump's job performance and hold critical views on ethical standards, with 85% rating Trump negatively and 59% assessing the ethical standards of parties or candidates as low [11]. Education amplifies these differences: those with less than a college degree are more prone to believe neither party has high standards (20% HS or less vs. 30% among college graduates and 30% among postgraduates) [12].\n\nRegarding political preferences, education plays a strong role. Those with postgraduate degrees overwhelmingly favor Democrats (62%) over Republicans (30%) [8], whereas voters without a college degree are more divided but lean toward the Republican side or are more undecided [8]. Similarly, racial groups show divergent preferences: Blacks tend to favor Democratic candidates heavily (e.g., 85% view Democrats positively [3]), while White voters tend to lean Republican [3].\n\nIn summary, higher education levels correlate with more critical perceptions of party ethics and stronger support for Democratic candidates, while lower education levels and certain racial groups tend to have different views and voting behaviors, often viewing parties more negatively or favoring Republican candidates.

As indicated in [3] and [10], about half (49%) now support a more liberal stance, up from 38% two years after Obama's victories, signaling a rise in liberal support within the party. Simultaneously, support for moderates has decreased slightly from 47% in 2014 to 36% in 2016, showing a move toward more progressive positions. Notably, the percentage of Democratic voters who favor a more liberal route has grown significantly over recent years, especially since Obama's election, contrasting with earlier periods when fewer favored such shifts.\n\n**Republican voters**, on the other hand, continue to lean toward conservatism. The data in [9] and [6] show about 60% desire their party to move in a more conservative direction, practically unchanged from previous years, indicating a strong and consistent conservative orientation.

Similarly, concerns about the government's effectiveness are higher in this group, with a significant portion expressing doubts about its performance.\n  \n- **Younger Adults:** In contrast, younger adults (18-29) are more optimistic, with 53% rating the government's efforts positively [4]. They are also more likely to believe that Islam encourages violence less than other faiths and support less scrutiny of Muslim communities [5], reflecting differing perceptions and priorities across age groups.\n\n**Political Ideology:**\n\n- **Republicans:** Markedly, Republicans are much more critical of the government's counter-terrorism efforts, with only 27% rating the efforts positively [7], and 93% express concern that U.S. policies do not go far enough to protect the country [2]. They also tend to support increased scrutiny of Muslim communities more than other groups [10].\n\n- **Democrats:** Conversely, Democrats show more positive perceptions, with 64% perceiving the government as doing fairly or very well in fighting terror [7], and only 28% concerned that policies are insufficient [2]. Their support for civil liberties remains higher, with about 80% opposing U.S. scrutiny of Muslims solely based on religion [9].\n\n- **Independents:** Their perceptions are intermediate but have become more negative over time; positivity has dropped from 69% to 44% [3], and their approval ratings for government efforts have declined [3].\n\n**Changes Over Time:**\n\n- **General Trends:** Overall, assessments of government efforts have become more negative across the political spectrum. In January, 85% of Democrats approved; now, only 64% do [3]. Independents’ approval has decreased from 69% to 44%, and Republican approval has fallen from about 63% to 27% [3].\n\n- **Public Concern:** The concern that U.S. policies have not gone far enough to protect against terrorism has increased, with 56% now emphasizing this over civil liberties restrictions [2]. Moreover, among older adults, a majority (57%) think the government is not doing a good job [4].\n\n- **Perception of Civil Liberties:** Concerns about civil liberties restrictions have declined sharply since 2013, with only 28% now worrying policies restrict freedoms too much, down from 47% then [8]. Younger adults are more evenly split on whether policies go too far or not far enough, whereas older adults tend to prioritize security more, showing greater concern about terrorism threat [9].\n\n**Visual Evidence:**\n\n- **Figure 1** reflects how different age groups perceive whether policies restrict civil liberties or not [6], aligning with their level of concern.\n- **Figures 2 and 3** show approval ratings and perceptions declining over time across political groups [7, 3].\n- **Figure 4** documents evolving concerns about terrorism and civil liberties over time, illustrating increasing skepticism about government efforts [8].\n\n---\n\n**In summary**, older age and Republican ideology correlate with more negative perceptions of government efforts to reduce terrorism and higher concern about insufficient protection.

Conversely, younger adults (18–29) are split almost evenly, with 44% worried policies don't go far enough, and 43% concerned about excessive restrictions [8]. The overall trend shows that older populations prioritize security more heavily than civil liberties.\n\n**Temporal Changes:**\n- In **image7**, concern about civil liberties restrictions has decreased dramatically since July 2013, when 47% feared policies had gone too far, dropping to 15% among 65+ age group, indicating increased acceptance of surveillance or anti-terror policies post-leak disclosures.

The **trend** indicates Democrats are slightly more cautious about civil liberties, but overall, both parties now prioritize security more than in previous years.\n\n**Comparison Across Political Lines:**\n- The difference between **Republicans** and **Democrats** is stark, with Republicans overwhelmingly concerned about insufficient security and Democrats more balanced, with some still cautious about civil liberties restrictions. **Images 2 and 6** reinforce this division, with Republicans showing a strong, consistent concern that policies do not go far enough, whereas Democrats display a broader view, balancing security with civil liberties.\n\nIn summary, older adults generally favor increased security over civil liberties, and their concern about insufficient anti-terror efforts has grown over time. Politically, Republicans increasingly believe policies need to be more aggressive to ensure protection, while Democrats lean towards balancing security with civil liberties but are also increasingly concerned that protections are insufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Brief answer:**  \nPublic opinion on government anti-terrorism efforts has shifted over time, with older adults increasingly concerned about insufficient protection, and political affiliations diverging: Republicans favor stronger security measures, while Democrats are more cautious about civil liberties, though both groups now prioritize security more than in the past."}

Germans show a clear preference for a stronger relationship with the U.S. (50%) over China, especially in the older cohort, with 53% favoring the U.S. [8], indicating a more cautious or skeptical stance towards China.\n\n**Impact of political party affiliations:**\n\n- **In the U.S.:** Democrats are more favorable towards cooperation with Germany—about 66% prefer close ties—while Republicans are less so, with 57% favoring close ties, and Republicans are more inclined to seek increased cooperation with Russia (31%) compared to Democrats (21%) [4].\n\n- **In Germany:** Support for cooperation varies by political support. CDU/CSU supporters show a greater willingness to cooperate with the U.S. (57%) than Greens and SPD supporters [9]. Ideologically, Germans on the right tend to view Russia and the U.S. more favorably, while left-leaning Germans are more cautious towards Russia and China.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Germans generally prefer stronger cooperation with Russia than Americans, especially in the East, while Americans are more divided on cooperation with China, with younger Americans favoring closer ties.\n- Political partisanship influences these attitudes: U.S. Democrats favor stronger ties with Germany and are less supportive of cooperation with Russia, whereas Republicans are more favorable towards Russia.\n- In Germany, conservative supporters are more open to U.S. cooperation, while left-leaning support is more cautious, especially toward Russia and China.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Visuals:**\n\n![Preferences for cooperation with Russia and China showing Germans favor Russia more, Americans are divided on China](image6)\n\n![Partisan differences in the U.S. and German support for alliances, influencing cooperation attitudes](image2)\n\n**In conclusion, preferences for international cooperation are shaped by national and political identities, with Germans generally favoring Russia more than Americans, and political parties significantly influencing attitudes toward these nations.**"}

According to [1], about 90% of American conservatives see military force as necessary, while only 65% of liberals agree. Conversely, in Germany, nearly 60% of those on the right view military force as necessary, compared to about one-third on the left, indicating both countries lean more towards militarism on the right but differ in overall levels, with Americans generally more supportive.\n\nIn terms of readiness to use force to maintain global order, about 80% of Americans believe it is sometimes necessary, whereas only approximately 50% of Germans share this view ([3]). This shows Americans are more skeptical of hesitation in deploying military power.\n\nOn defense spending, Americans tend to favor maintaining or increasing military spending, but their opinions have shifted over time. While there was enthusiasm for increased spending in 2017, by 2019, around 50% believed European allies should keep their defense budgets the same, with only 35% favoring an increase ([12], [5]).

According to [4], those with a positive view of their current finances are more likely to anticipate family financial improvement in the next year. This optimism is reflected in the high percentage (81%) of Latinos expecting their family’s financial situation to improve in the coming year, as shown in [6].

Their larger decline in wealth and persistent higher poverty rate highlight ongoing economic disparities.\n\n**Summary**:\nWhile Hispanic employment rates have improved and perceptions about their financial situation have become more positive, these gains do not fully translate into income and wealth recovery. Persistent higher poverty and wealth declines indicate structural disparities, despite optimism and job growth. Non-Hispanic populations, with generally lower unemployment and more stable income levels historically, experience less disparity, but the gap remains significant.\n\n**In essence:**\n> Improvements in unemployment and positive perceptions among Hispanics contribute to optimism but have not yet closed the substantial income and wealth gaps compared to non-Hispanic populations."}

Text[10] states that men are more likely to see people being bullying and deceptive, and Text[2] confirms that a larger share of men (29%) report seeing more bullying content compared to 19% of women. Similarly, the images support this: in **Image 4**, men (29%) are more likely than women (19%) to see mean or bullying behavior.  \n\nSecondly, in terms of **deception and correcting misinformation**, men are nearly twice as likely as women to more frequently see people being deceptive (24% vs. 13%) as per Text[12] and Text[11], and the images corroborate this trend. Alongside, both genders predominantly see an equal mix of deception and correction, with 58% of men and 67% of women perceiving such a balance, but men are more attuned to deception cues.\n\nThirdly, in perceptions related to **supportive versus kind behaviors**, women tend to see more kindness and support than men. Texts[2], [11], and [9] highlight that women are slightly more likely to observe supportive behaviors, with 24% of women seeing kindness more often compared to 17% of men. Yet, both genders commonly experience an equal mixture of kindness and negativity.  \n\nLastly, the perception of **dramatic or exaggerated posts** is consistent across the board, with roughly 58% of users seeing these posts frequently (from Text[1] and Image 2). Men and women encounter such content at similar rates, with no significant gender difference in the frequency of experiencing overly dramatic posts. These exaggerated posts likely contribute to the distinct perceptions of negativity and deception, especially among men who report higher exposure to bullying and deception.\n\n**In summary**, men tend to perceive and encounter more bullying, deception, and negative behaviors online than women, who are slightly more inclined to see kindness and support. Both genders regularly see a mix of positive and negative behaviors, and high exposure to dramatic or exaggerated posts is common across all users, contributing to these perceptions.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved summary with images:**\n\nMen are more likely than women to encounter **bullying and deception** on social media, as shown in **Image 4**, where 29% of men versus 19% of women see bullying behavior frequently and more often see deception (24% vs. 13%).  \n![People being mean or bullying](image4)  \n\nDespite these differences, both genders see a **significant amount of exaggerated or dramatic posts**, with around 58% of all social media users encountering such content frequently, contributing to perceptions of negativity and conflict online (Text[1], Image 2).  \n![Posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated](image2)  \n\nWomen, on the other hand, tend to perceive more **supportive and kind behaviors** than men, with 24% of women more often seeing kindness compared to 17% of men, highlighting slightly contrasting perceptions of online interactions.  \n![People being kind or supportive](image4)  \n\nThese disparities in perceptions are closely linked to their experiences: men’s higher encounters with bullying and deception likely influence their view of social media as more hostile, whereas women’s experiences align more with kindness and support, although both perceive a balanced mixture overall.\n\n**In conclusion**, men's perceptions tend to skew toward noticing negative behaviors such as bullying and deception more frequently, while women perceive more kindness, and both groups regularly encounter exaggerated posts, shaping their overall online experience."}

As illustrated in images 2 and 8, Democrats have consistently rated public health officials more favorably—around 72-84% approving—which remained relatively stable from March through August [2, 10]. Conversely, Republicans' approval has drastically declined: from roughly 84% in March to about 53% by August [10], with the latest data showing only about half of Republicans give positive ratings. This decline is visually confirmed in images 2 and 8, where the gap between partisan groups widens significantly, reflecting declining trust among Republicans.\n\nRegarding perceptions of Donald Trump’s response, the surveys depict an even steeper partisan divide. Image 8 shows that while only 6% of Democrats approved of Trump's response, about 73% of Republicans approved of his response in the latest surveys, a swing of over 60 percentage points. Furthermore, approval of Trump’s response has been declining among Republicans since March, but remains high relative to Democrats' consistent low approval [5, 8, 11].\n\nThe surveys also reveal that these perceptions affect evaluations across different contexts, such as local, state, and federal officials. Figures 2, 4, and 8 depict a consistent pattern: Democrats tend to have more favorable views of public health officials and government responses, whereas Republicans’ assessments have deteriorated since March. For example, the approval of local officials and public health officials has dropped sharply among Republicans, while Democrats’ ratings have remained stable or high [6, 11].\n\nOverall, the evidence demonstrates that partisan affiliation strongly influences public perception, with Democrats generally viewing public health responses more positively and being more supportive of health officials, while Republicans' views have become markedly more negative over time. For Trump, approval remains high among Republicans, while Democrats consistently disapprove.\n\n**In summary:** Partisan differences have led to a widening gap in perceptions of COVID-19 response efficacy, with Democrats favorably viewing public health officials and disapproving of Trump, while Republicans have increasingly distrusted health officials and strongly supported Trump’s response."}

For instance, only 31% of Republicans believe restrictions were lifted too quickly, and only 21% cite federal response as a major reason for ongoing cases [4, 11].\n\n2. **Partisan Differences on Cause and Policy Views**:  \n   - Democrats tend to link increased cases to real infections and support the view that restrictions should be maintained to control the pandemic [2, 8, 11], reflecting their higher concern that restrictions are lifted too fast.  \n   - Republicans are more inclined to believe that increased testing accounts for the rise in cases and are less concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly [9, 11], which corresponds with their comparatively lower level of concern about the pace of lifting restrictions.\n\n3. **Perception of Risks and Motivations**:  \n   - Among racial groups, Blacks (84%) and Hispanics (72%) also mostly believe restrictions were lifted too quickly and are concerned more than whites (65%) [10]. Their views on the cause of case increases likely influence this concern, aligning with Democratic views that increased infections are driving the rise.\n\n**In summary**, Democrats’ belief that increased COVID-19 case counts are mainly due to more infections correlates with a higher concern that restrictions may have been eased too quickly, supporting cautious policies. Conversely, many Republicans attribute case increases primarily to increased testing, which correlates with less concern about rapid lifting of restrictions. These perspectives exemplify how beliefs about the causes of COVID-19 case increases directly influence opinions on policy measures across political groups."}

For example, the support for making early, in-person voting available at least two weeks prior to Election Day is notably higher among Black (87%), Hispanic (86%), and Asian (86%) adults than among White adults (78%) [Image 2].\n\nRegarding voter ID requirements, a larger share of Black (65%), Hispanic (72%), and Asian (71%) adults support requiring government-issued photo identification compared to White adults (54%) [5][8]. Black adults are also more likely than other groups to support policies like allowing convicted felons to vote after serving their sentences (85%) [8].\n\nSupport for strict policies like requiring photo ID is generally lower among Black adults (65%) compared to White adults (86%) [Image 8]. Conversely, Black adults show the strongest support for policies that expand voting access, such as automatic registration and allowing felons to vote, indicating a preference for more inclusive voting policies [8][10].\n\nPartisan differences further shape this dynamic. While White Republicans tend to oppose policies that ease voting, Democratic groups across racial and ethnic lines generally show higher support [1][3][6][7]. For instance, a significant majority of Black, Hispanic, and Asian Democrats favor making voting easier, whereas Republican support varies greatly based on ideological orientation with conservatives being more restrictive [7][11].\n\nIn summary, racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. tend to support more expansive voting policies like early voting and voting by felons, while support for restrictive policies such as requiring government-issued photo ID is also higher among racial minorities. These differences are further influenced by partisan ideologies, creating a complex landscape of voting policy support shaped heavily by race, ethnicity, and political affiliation.\n\n![Racial and ethnic support for various voting policies, highlighting higher support among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults for making voting easier and stronger support among Black adults for expansive policies](image2)"}

The survey data also shows that fewer than half of Hispanics agree that there is a \"great deal\" of difference, indicating a persistent perception that the parties may not be very distinct in their policies or values [6].\n\nWhen examining how these perceptions might influence party affiliation, the data suggests that party identification among Latinos remains largely stable over recent years. Specifically, roughly two-thirds of Latino voters identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party (around 64%) [4], and their party affiliation has shifted little in recent years [7]. Furthermore, the survey shows that most Latino voters still believe that the Democratic Party \"really cares about Latinos\" and work hard to earn their votes, despite some perceiving only minor differences between parties [10].\n\nThe impact of this perception on party affiliation appears limited; while about half of Latino voters see few significant differences between the parties, their primary party identification remains quite stable, favoring the Democrats.

For first-generation immigrants, a higher percentage strongly identify as Hispanic (~70-85%), but this drops with subsequent generations, reaching only about 50% among the fourth or higher generations, as displayed in images1 and4 [10].  \n- As shown in images4 and8, second- and third-generation Hispanics are more likely to see their identity as more American and less tied to Hispanic roots.\n\n**Perceptions of identity and social factors:**  \n- Many second- and third-generation Hispanics see themselves as \"American\" or consider cultural markers like language less defining, which affects their self-identification.  \n- The variability in how Hispanics describe what makes someone Hispanic (per image8) indicates that personal and social perceptions, as well as the degree of cultural assimilation, play significant roles.\n\n### Comparison:\n- **First-generation Hispanics** tend to strongly identify with Hispanic heritage, driven by cultural and linguistic ties.  \n- **Second and higher generations** increasingly view their identity through an American lens, influenced by upbringing, assimilation, and changing perceptions of what it means to be Hispanic. They are more likely to identify as American rather than Hispanic, as supported by the statistics in images4 and8.\n\n**In summary:**  \nGenerational status is a key factor influencing Hispanic self-identification, with cultural ties, language, ancestry, and personal perceptions varying across generations.

Conversely, **computers and internet usage are much lower**, with only about 4-11% engaging regularly outside the home (images 4 and 5). This indicates that mobile devices are the primary means of media access in daily life, especially for activities like listening to radio programs.\n\n**Outside the household**, the data suggest that **radio remains the primary device for listening** among rural and urban populations. From image 4, **rural respondents** rely on **radio (77%)** and **mobile phones (39%)**, indicating that mobile phones complement traditional radio use in these areas. In urban settings, **radio (70%)** and **mobile phones (46%)** also dominate, but with higher access to computers and internet, as shown in images 5 and 6.\n\n**Demographic differences** are evident:\n- **Rural residents** have high radio (77%) and mobile (39%) usage but lower internet and computer use.\n- **Urban residents** have nearly equal reliance on radio and mobile phones, with higher access to internet and computers, yet radio still remains significant.\n- **Gender differences** (from image 5): Females tend to listen more through radio (77%) and have slightly higher mobile usage (36%) than males, who favor radio but have lower mobile phone usage (43%).\n\n**Radio listening habits** correlate with technology access:\n- In **rural areas**, radio is vital due to limited access to digital devices.\n- In **urban areas**, increased internet and computer use offers alternative media consumption channels, but radio remains a common source, especially for news and folk music (images 7 and 8).\n- The **frequency of listening** (images 6 and 5) shows that many respondents listen to the radio regularly, but a notable portion, especially in urban settings, also utilize digital devices like mobile phones for media access.\n\n**In summary**, portable mobile devices have become the main outside-household technology, working alongside traditional radio, particularly in rural areas. While urban residents have higher access to computers and the internet, radio remains an essential medium across demographics, underpinning its continued importance for news, folk music, and community information.\n\n**Concise answer:**  \nTechnology usage within households predominantly involves mobile phones, but outside, radio remains a key medium, especially in rural areas, with demographic differences showing higher digital access in urban populations; these variations influence radio listening habits, with many relying on radios for news and community info, while digital devices supplement or replace traditional media depending on access levels."}

This growth is supported by data indicating Indonesia's overall mobile subscriber growth and market expansion during that period [8], along with the increasing use of data-based communication methods like instant messaging, which enhanced user engagement [9][10].\n\nRegarding ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), the data shows a slight decrease from 38 units in 2008 to 36 units in 2009, and further down to 35 units in 2010 [5], but the specific ARPU for 2013 and 2014 is not directly provided in the textual quotes. However, considering the broader context, the decline in ARPU starting from 2008–2010 was likely driven by intense price competition, including government-initiated price wars that aimed to reduce tariffs [7][6]. This pressure on tariffs, combined with the shift of customers towards more affordable smartphones and the increasing use of free IM services instead of voice and SMS, contributed to decreased ARPU levels [2][5][9].\n\nIn conclusion, from 2013 to 2014, Telkomsel’s subscriber numbers continued to grow, influenced by Indonesia's expanding mobile market and increasing smartphone adoption, while the ARPU likely continued to decline due to the prevalence of data-driven communication and intensified price competition.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Subscriber base:** Increased from approximately 132.7 million in 2013 to 139.3 million in 2014.  \n- **ARPU:** Decreased during this period, mainly due to price wars, shift to data and IM apps, and decline in voice and SMS revenue [2][5].\n\n![Subscriber growth and ARPU decline, 2013-2014](image6)"}

However, **data ARPU is expected to grow later**, as increased smartphone penetration encourages more internet usage and higher data plan adoption. \n\nSeveral factors influenced these trends:\n\n- **Massive price wars initiated by the government** lowered tariffs (text [11]), making smartphones more affordable for consumers.\n- **Strategic partnerships with major smartphone vendors**, especially Android devices (as noted in text [3]), facilitated wider access to affordable smartphones.\n- The **rise of mobile internet usage**, e-commerce, and social media (images [9] and [12]) increased demand for data services, prompting users to shift from traditional voice/SMS to data-intensive applications.\n\n**In summary**, smartphone user numbers for Telkomsel and XL soared between 2013 and 2014, driven by lowered device costs and data-driven service offerings, which caused a decline in voice and SMS ARPU, while data ARPU was expected to increase as users demanded more data plans.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved images and text**:\n\n![voice, SMS, and data ARPU trends from 2013 to 2017](image1)  \n*ARPU for voice and SMS declined, while data ARPU was expected to rise again after short-term falls.*\n\n![smartphone and user growth for Telkomsel and XL in 2013-2014](image3)  \n*Smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased sharply, facilitating more internet usage and impacting ARPU trends.*\n\n**In conclusion**, the surge in smartphone adoption from 2013 to 2014, supported by tariff reductions and device partnerships, influenced the shifting ARPU trends—declining for voice and SMS but eventually rising in data usage."}

Specifically, ProgramFC with FLAN-T5-small achieves performance similar to FLAN-T5-XXL in 4-hop claims, indicating a **performance efficiency gain**.\n- Regarding task complexity, **ProgramFC's strength increases with reasoning depth**.

For instance, in the 4-hop FEVEROUS dataset, ProgramFC scores *59.66*, surpassing several baseline models like InstructGPT (which scores *61.05*) and FLAN-T5 across different configurations (Figures 4 and 8).  \n  - Notably, ProgramFC's modular, reasoning-program approach helps mitigate performance drops seen in smaller models, maintaining better accuracy than end-to-end neural models when reasoning complexity increases (Figure 4).  \n  - Compared to chain-of-thought prompting, ProgramFC is near or above the performance of some large models (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL), especially in scenarios with limited model capacity, achieving similar results with significantly fewer parameters (Section 7).\n\n- **Retrieval enhancement:**  \n  ProgramFC improves retrieval accuracy over simple one-step retrieval, especially on complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning, with improvements up to *37.1%* on HOVER 4-hop (Figure 5), by iteratively guiding evidence retrieval during reasoning.\n\n**Error trends in predictions:**\n\n- The error analysis reveals that as claim complexity increases, **semantic errors** become more prevalent, accounting for 38% and 77% of errors at 3-hop and 4-hop levels, respectively (Section 11).  \n- **Structural errors** also become particularly frequent in longer reasoning chains—indicating difficulties in parsing and generating correct step-by-step instructions for complex claims (Section 11, Figure 6).  \n- **Error classification:**  \n  - **Syntactic errors** are minimal (0%), indicating correct grammar adherence in generated programs [7].  \n  - **Semantic errors** involve incorrect or missing arguments, structure, or sub-task calls, increasing with task complexity, which impacts accuracy.  \n  - **Incorrect execution** errors—where programs are structurally correct but yield wrong results—are fewer but still notable, especially in more complex claims.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nProgramFC outperforms or matches many baselines in multi-hop fact-checking tasks, particularly benefitting from its explicit reasoning structures and iterative retrieval strategies.

It achieves higher accuracy in 4-hop scenarios (52.88%) compared to 2-hop (54.18%) and 3-hop (52.88%) on HOVER, showing increased effectiveness with more complex reasoning requirements. In FEVEROUS, the performance remains comparatively high, with an accuracy of 59.66% for 4-hop instances.\n- The trend indicates that models tend to perform better as the reasoning depth increases, especially with models like Chain-of-Thought prompting improving by 2.7 points on average over direct prompting as per the textual data [7].\n\n**Error Types and Their Distribution:**\n- As detailed in images 4 and 6, semantic errors notably increase with reasoning complexity: \n  - Semantic errors account for 29%, 38%, and 77% of the errors on 2-hop, 3-hop, and 4-hop claims, respectively, suggesting that as the reasoning chain lengthens, semantic issues such as incorrect or missing arguments become more prevalent.\n  - Structural errors, which involve incorrect program grammar or parsing issues, also rise, especially for longer chains, with a significant 57% observed in 4-hop claims [4], [11].\n\n**Types of Errors:**\n- The errors are primarily categorized into semantic errors, token errors (incorrect arguments), structure errors (parsing issues), and incorrect execution (missteps in program run). \n- For 2-hop claims, incorrect program execution is dominant (71%), indicating that most errors here stem from the execution phase rather than the quality of the reasoning program itself [5], [8].\n\n**Implications:**\n- The increasing error rates, particularly semantic and structural errors, underscore the difficulty in generating accurate reasoning programs as claim complexity and reasoning depth increase.\n- Model performance generally improves with reasoning depth, possibly due to models leveraging more evidence at higher hops, but the rising error rate suggests advanced methods are needed to better handle implicit reasoning and complex claim structures.\n\n### Summary:\n| **Scenario** | **Performance** | **Main Error Types** | **Error Rate** (Semantic) | **Error Rate** (Structure) | **Error Rate** (Execution) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2-hop (HOVER) | Higher | Program execution (~71%) | 29% | 19% | N/A |\n| 3-hop (HOVER) | Slightly lower or similar | More semantic errors (~38%) | 38% | 13% | N/A |\n| 4-hop (HOVER) | Lowest among three | Highest semantic errors (~77%) | 77% | 57% | N/A |\n\nIn conclusion, as the number of reasoning steps increases, model performance tends to improve slightly in some cases but is hindered by a rise in semantic and structural errors, especially for longer chains like 4-hop claims.

It significantly surpasses strategies such as random, entropy, margin, BALD, and coreset, with improvements of up to 5.2% on PathMNIST and 24.1% on CIFAR-10-LT when querying small dataset portions [2][3][6].\n\n- In natural imaging datasets like CIFAR-10-LT depicted in images 4 and 7, the 'hard-to-contrast' approach achieves higher performance at low label budgets, maintaining near-perfect coverage of all classes with just 0.1% labeled data (Figure 4) and demonstrating rapid gains in accuracy over other strategies (Figures 7 & 9). Notably, it covers all classes within the low label budget, addressing class coverage issues common in active learning [4][9][10].\n\n- The visualization data maps (images 6 & 7) show that 'hard-to-contrast' effectively identifies data points at the boundary of class distributions, improving label diversity and the quality of initial queries, which bolsters subsequent active learning cycles.\n\n**Influence on Initial Query Selection:**\n\n- The 'hard-to-contrast' strategy's label-free approach enables selection of informative, challenging data points without ground-truth labels, directly addressing the cold start problem. As highlighted in Figures 5 and 14, initial queries based on hard-to-contrast data have a strong correlation between early and later performance (correlation coefficients r = 0.79–0.92), indicating that a good initial selection fosters sustained performance gains [5][6].\n\n- This strategy consistently outperforms other initial query strategies, such as random or entropy-based selection, particularly in early active learning cycles. By focusing on contrastive difficulty rather than label diversity alone, it ensures that the initial labeled set is representative of boundary cases, which is crucial for model robustness.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe 'hard-to-contrast' querying strategy demonstrates superior performance across diverse datasets by effectively selecting challenging and boundary data points without relying on ground truth labels.

While these categories are more relevant to program-guided reasoning, the grounding and ambiguity errors are likely more prevalent in GPT-4 and InstructGPT due to their difficulty in correctly referencing data and handling ambiguous claims.\n- The tendency of GPT-4 to overconfidently classify NEI claims as supported or refuted suggests a bias toward overconfidence, which can result in higher false positives/negatives if not properly calibrated.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n- GPT-4's higher accuracy indicates it is better suited for complex scientific reasoning, but its overconfidence and misclassification of NEI demonstrate a risk of overstatement or false convictions.\n- InstructGPT’s \"less confident\" approach might reduce incorrect overcommitments but at the cost of lower overall accuracy, especially in distinguishing inherently ambiguous or unsupported claims.\n- The differences suggest that while GPT-4 is more accurate, its tendency toward overconfidence could be problematic, emphasizing the need for calibration or supplementary disambiguation techniques in practice.\n\n**In summary**, GPT-4 exhibits substantially higher accuracy than InstructGPT in zero-shot 3-class classification, but both models exhibit errors related to grounding, ambiguity, and overconfidence. These tendencies highlight the importance of calibration and deeper reasoning capabilities to improve reliable classification.\n\n![Performance and error tendencies of GPT models](image7)"}

According to the analysis, both models struggle with differentiating NEI claims from supported or refuted claims, but their errors manifest differently:\n\n- **InstructGPT** tends to be \"less confident\", often classifying NEI and supported/refuted claims as ‘less confident’ or supporting/refuting claims erroneously, as seen in the pattern of misclassification [5]. This indicates difficulty in reliably identifying when the claim lacks enough evidence.\n  \n- **GPT-4**, on the other hand, exhibits overconfidence, frequently misclassifying NEI claims as supported or refuted, leading it to be overly certain in its incorrect assignments [5]. This overconfidence hampers its ability to recognize claims that truly lack sufficient evidence.\n\nThe difference in their challenges lies in **InstructGPT's** hesitation and lack of confidence when unsure, which can result in ambiguous classifications, while **GPT-4**'s overconfidence leads it to make overly definitive but incorrect classifications. This dichotomy underscores the difficulty both models have with the inherently challenging task of distinguishing NEI claims, especially when the evidence is incomplete or ambiguous [6].\n\nIn summary, InstructGPT struggles with confidence calibration, often being too hesitant to classify claims definitively, whereas GPT-4 tends to overtrust its inferences, leading to overconfidence and misclassification of NEI claims."}

Notably, its performance on SST-2 (51.90%) is lower compared to GPT-J, which achieves a higher accuracy of 56.82% on SST-2 and even better results on TREC, with 56.82%. GPT-J demonstrates superior accuracy overall, especially on datasets like AGNews (55.59%) and SST-2 (not explicitly provided, but inferred to be higher than GPT2-XL based on the context).\n\nThe confusion matrices [5] reinforce these insights by illustrating how attention distribution and label anchor similarities impact classification accuracy. For example, the matrix shows high confusability between categories like Abbreviation and Entity and between Description and Entity, indicating these classes are more prone to misclassification, especially when the labels' anchors are similar. This aligns with the observation that models tend to confuse categories with similar label representations, impacting their accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis suggests that deep layers are crucial for final predictions (as illustrated in images 1 and 3), with deep-layer attention on label words strongly correlating with model outputs. The stronger the attention on relevant label anchors, the better the classification performance, which explains the higher accuracies observed for models like GPT-J that effectively leverage deep-layer representations.\n\n**In summary:**\n- GPT-J consistently outperforms GPT2-XL across multiple datasets, likely due to more effective utilization of label-anchored information.\n- Classification errors tend to occur between categories with similar label anchors, as shown in confusion matrices, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing closely related classes.\n- Performance is dataset-dependent, with factors such as label similarity and layer-wise attention architecture influencing the models' accuracy.\n\n![confusion matrix showing high similarity within related classes, indicating potential sources of classification errors](image5)"}

Specifically, when knowledge removal reaches 80%, recall declines sharply to around 20%, indicating a limited capacity to recognize absent knowledge effectively. Conversely, precision remains relatively less affected initially but eventually decreases as the knowledge coverage diminishes, illustrating that models become less accurate in their citations when knowledge is sparse [9][11].\n\nThe F1-Score also diminishes with increased knowledge removal, pointing to a combined decline in precision and recall. This trend underscores the models’ decreasing ability to generate accurate and thorough citations under knowledge gaps [5][8].  \n\nThese changes suggest that current models have a constrained ability to handle absent knowledge and are heavily reliant on retrieval accuracy.

Specifically, Table 3 shows that models trained with all logical constraints outperform those without, e.g., Vicuna-13B's Micro-F1 jumps from 16.3% (without constraints) to 20.2% (with constraints), and Llama2-13B improves from 21.5% to 27.8%. Similarly, integrating retrieved logical constraints yields further gains, evidencing that relevant logic input helps.  \n\n**Demonstration samples contribute but with diminishing returns:**  \nFrom Figure 6 (image1), increasing demonstrations from 1 to 5 markedly improves performance, but additional demonstrations beyond that (e.g., ≥10) contribute limited gains, indicating a saturation point. Also, using fewer demonstrations combined with logical constraints can surpass models with more demonstrations but no logical constraints, exemplified by a model with 5 demonstrations and constraints outperforming one with 10 demonstrations without constraints (performance of 5 demos with constraints on MAVEN-ERE at 25.7% surpasses 10 demos without at 24.5%).\n\n**Interaction with logical constraints and demonstrations:**  \nFigures and textual insights suggest that logical constraints and demonstrations are complementary strategies: constraints serve to tell the model \"how\" to reason, while demonstrations indicate \"what\" reasoning examples to follow.

The dominant errors in TimeQA are **reasoning errors (45%)** and **retrieval failures (approximately 40%)**, indicating a significant challenge in complex reasoning, even with abstraction and retrieval augmentation [3][10].\n\n- **In StrategyQA** (Figure 7), **Step-Back + RAG** turns about **15.4%** of wrong predictions into correct ones, fixing **12.7%** of errors originating from RAG, and introducing roughly **6.1%** new errors. Here, errors are more often tied to **factual inaccuracies** or **simple reasoning errors** related to **context understanding** rather than complex multi-step reasoning [11].\n\n### Differences in Dataset Characteristics and Task Types\n- **TimeQA** involves **temporal reasoning**, **date calculations**, and multi-step deductions, leading to a higher proportion of **reasoning errors** that are difficult despite abstraction. The lower error-fixing ratio (>39%) suggests inherent complexity and data variability, making error correction more challenging.\n  \n- **StrategyQA** centers around **question quick reasoning** about **logic and facts**, with errors being more straightforwardly addressed through retrieval and minimal reasoning. The higher success rate in fixing errors (~15.4%) indicates that **retrieval-based augmentation combined with step-back prompting** is more effective for this dataset’s question style.\n\n### Significance of Differences\nThe contrasting results highlight how **dataset nature influences the effectiveness of error correction approaches**:\n- For **TimeQA**, the high complexity demands more sophisticated reasoning and retrieval robustness, indicating that **errors often stem from reasoning failures**. This underscores the need for improved reasoning strategies and more comprehensive information retrieval.\n- For **StrategyQA**, the relatively lower complexity and fact-based reasoning lead to easier error correction with the current methods, emphasizing that **retrieval augmentation is particularly effective** for datasets with fewer multi-step reasoning demands.\n\n### Summary\n| Aspect | TimeQA | StrategyQA |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Error Fix Rate | ~39.9% | ~15.4% |\n| Errors Fixed from RAG | ~21.6% | ~12.7% |\n| Dominant Error Type | Reasoning (~45%) | Factual/Logic (~most errors are factual) |\n| Effectiveness of Step-Back+RAG | Higher in fixing complex reasoning errors | More effective in correcting factual errors |\n\n**In conclusion**, the variations highlight the importance of aligning error correction methods with the dataset’s **task complexity** and **question nature**.

The models here struggle more; human performance yields an SD of 1.34 and 100% manipulation accuracy [10]. The models perform poorly on manipulation (MA), with recent approaches like ours showing strong improvements in navigation metrics but still lagging behind humans on tasks requiring complex manipulation.\n\n**Linguistic Categories:**\n- **LANI** instructions mainly focus on spatial relations and simple goal-directed navigation, as evidenced by the count of 123 examples in spatial relations and 36 in conjunctions of multiple locations [3][11].\n- **CHAI** instructions incorporate more complex and varied language, including constraints on task shape, co-reference, temporal coordination, and comparisons (52 to 68 instances across categories) reflecting its more intricate demands [3][11].

The combination of large, structurally rich data sources (paragraphs rather than single sentences, as noted in [1] and [10]) and advanced training methods enhances NLP task performance.\n\nIn summary, **more extensive, well-structured data combined with sophisticated models and fine-tuning leads to substantial gains in NLP performance** [2], [3], [11].\n\n![Study of the impact of data size and modeling approaches on NLP tasks](image7)"}

However, the experimental results shown in the images suggest a nuanced picture:\n\n- In the data presented in **Image 4**, where the \"unrelated\" alignment results are shown, alignment does not significantly improve BLEU scores. The values in the \"aligned\" column are quite similar to the \"unrelated\" ones, with negligible differences, indicating that pre-emptively aligning embeddings might not always impact translation quality profoundly [7].\n\n- Conversely, **Image 6** demonstrates that pre-training (**pre**) generally yields higher BLEU scores than standard training, especially in low-resource or distant language pairs (e.g., RU→EN and HE→PT). The dashed blue line shows that pre-trained embeddings lead to larger gains in BLEU scores with increasing training data size, further confirmed by the data from **Image 5**, which notes that languages with greater linguistic divergence (like Russian and Hebrew) tend to see larger improvements [5], and **Image 2**, which shows that pre-trained embeddings contribute more when the source language is better encoded [10].\n\n- The paragraph analysis notes that \"a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios but is helpful in multi-lingual training scenarios\" [8, 9], emphasizing that the utility of alignment may depend on the specific context.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nAligning word embeddings **does not always significantly enhance** BLEU scores in translation tasks—its effect appears modest or variable across different language pairs.

This suggests pre-training is particularly beneficial when the baseline performance is low due to linguistic differences.\n   - The analysis in [3] hypothesizes that similar languages share semantic neighborhoods, allowing pre-trained embeddings to produce larger gains when source and target languages are closely related.\n\n2. **Impact of Training Set Size:**\n   - The observation in [4] indicates that pre-training yields the most benefit when the baseline system has moderate effectiveness (BLEU scores around 3-4). Once a certain amount of basic language characteristics are captured, pre-training can substantially boost performance.\n   - Figures from [2] demonstrate that pre-training enhances BLEU scores more markedly as the training set size increases, especially for low-resource pairs like RU→EN, where the initial data is limited.\n\n3. **Role of Embedding Space Alignment and Multilingual Settings:**\n   - Results in [11] highlight that aligning embedding spaces across languages further enhances BLEU scores, especially in multilingual systems sharing encoders, by reducing the complexity of the input transformation.\n   - In low-resource or dissimilar languages (e.g., B E→RU), pre-training may have less impact or even small decreases if embeddings are not well-aligned, emphasizing the importance of embedding space consistency.\n\n**Summary:**\nPre-training improves translation accuracy more notably for linguistically dissimilar pairs and when the training set is not too small but not yet sufficient to learn language characteristics fully. The effectiveness grows with the similarity between languages and is further amplified when embedding spaces are aligned, especially in multilingual models [12].\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion,** pre-training boosts translation accuracy by providing better initial representations, with the degree of benefit depending on how similar the languages are and the size of the training data.

According to the evidence, when embeddings are aligned, BLEU scores tend to increase (as shown in [4]), because alignment puts source language embeddings into a common space, facilitating shared processing in the neural model. Specifically, the text notes that \"aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks,\" especially because a shared space simplifies learning for a single encoder handling multiple languages ([4]). However, interestingly, Table 4 indicates that in some cases, unaligned embeddings did not significantly benefit training, suggesting that alignment might not always be crucial ([6]).\n\nRegarding the variations in F-measure scores based on word frequency, the analysis from Figures 2 and 7 reveals that pre-training improves translation accuracy for the entire vocabulary, with a pronounced effect on low-frequency words. Specifically, Figure 2 illustrates that low-frequency words gain the most from pre-training, as evidenced by higher F-measure scores in those buckets. Similarly, Figure 7 shows that models with pre-trained embeddings consistently outperform models without pre-training across frequency ranges, especially for rarer words, emphasizing the importance of pre-trained embeddings in translating infrequent vocabulary ([10]).\n\nIn summary, embedding alignment generally enhances translation quality across different language pairs, with the most notable improvements in scenarios involving similar languages. Additionally, translating low-frequency words benefits significantly from pre-trained embeddings, as they provide better representations for rare or unseen tokens, leading to higher F-measure scores for these words in the training corpus.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary:\n![Alignment improves BLEU scores across language pairs, especially for similar languages, but may not always be necessary](image4)\n\n![Pre-trained embeddings significantly improve translation of low-frequency words, as shown by higher F-measure scores](image6)"}

This underscores the importance of R-GCN in enhancing the model’s ability to update mention representations based on relation information.\n- In [12], using only self-loops (no R-GCN) results in the poorest performance, indicating that multihop inference enabled by R-GCN significantly boosts accuracy, especially in the unmasked setting.\n\n**Impact of Removing Relation Types**:\n- According to [6], ablations where different relation types are excluded reveal that models benefit most from DOC-BASED relations (mentions within the same document). Removing these connections causes a performance reduction because the model loses vital local contextual information.\n- As detailed in [7], independent removal of relation types like MATCH or COREF shows that:\n  - Removing DOC-BASED connections significantly impacts performance, as these connections are the most frequent and informative.\n  - Omitting MATCH or COREF edges results in only marginal performance drops, and sometimes even degradation when combined with other ablations, especially in the test set where coreference links may be less reliable.\n  \n**Specific Relation Types (MATCH, COREF)**:\n- [7] notes that MATCH edges already capture many coreference relations, so the additional coreference edges (COREF) contribute less, and their removal marginally affects performance.\n- Interestingly, including coreference links can sometimes degrade the model’s performance on the test set, possibly because of erroneous or domain-specific inaccuracies ([7]).\n\n**Influence in Unmasked vs. Masked Conditions**:\n- The overall trend in [4] and [12] indicates that removing R-GCN and relation information degrades accuracy more in the unmasked setting since the models rely heavily on structural, multi-hop reasoning to resolve coreferences and questions.\n- In masked settings, the impact is often less pronounced because predictions depend more on direct mention-matching heuristics, and the absence of structural relations might have a muted effect ([3], [4]).\n\n### Summary:\nRemoving R-GCN reduces model accuracy substantially, especially under unmasked conditions, highlighting its role in multi-hop reasoning. Excluding relation types like DOC-BASED edges causes the most performance loss, as they encode fundamental local information, while removing MATCH or COREF edges results in smaller, sometimes marginal, decreases and can sometimes even harm performance depending on the domain and data conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Visual Evidence:**\n\n![Model performance with and without different relation components](image4)  \n*Performance drops significantly when R-GCN is removed, especially in unmasked settings, confirming its critical role in multi-hop reasoning.*\n\n![A graph illustrating the importance of relation types like DOC-BASED, MATCH, and COREF](image8)  \n*Removing DOC-BASED connections impacts the model most, whereas excluding MATCH and COREF edges results in marginal performance changes, with some degradation observed in test conditions.*"}

However, the overall improvements are small, implying that coreference relations are more beneficial when mention identities are masked and standardized, making coreference links more reliable and consistent. \n\nImagewise, the graphs and summaries support that incorporating relation types, including coreference, can enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, but their effects depend heavily on the data masking and the context.

Notably, transferring the **LSTM** and **embedding layers** yields the most considerable improvements, especially on datasets with unbalanced label distributions like D3 (Restaurant15) and D4 (Restaurant16). For example, the full transfer approach (\"Ours: PRET+MULT\") achieves macro-F1 scores of 69.76 on D4, outperforming approaches with only one layer transferred, highlighting the importance of capturing semantic and sequential information (see [8]).\n\n- **Component-specific Trends:**  \n  The **output layer transfer** contributes less to performance gains, reaffirming its task-specific nature. Transferring the **embedding layer** helps to better capture true semantics for sentiment words, especially when labeled data is scarce, as in D3 and D4.  \n  ![Transfer layer impact](image1)\n\n**Impact of Varying Document-Level Training Examples:**\n\n- **Performance Trends with Increased Document Data:**  \n  As shown in the line plot (Figure 1, top), increasing the percentage of document-level examples from 0 to 1 enhances accuracy steadily across all datasets, with gains being most pronounced in **D3 and D4**. For macro-F1 scores ([4]), a sharp increase occurs when the proportion rises from 0 to 0.4, particularly in datasets with smaller labeled data, indicating that document-level knowledge transfer helps to bootstrap effective models where aspect-level labeled data is limited.\n\n- **Datasets with Smaller Training Data Benefit More:**  \n  The improvements are more marked in datasets D3 and D4, which have fewer training samples and unbalanced label distributions, underscoring the utility of document-level knowledge transfer in low-resource settings. The trend suggests that larger document-level datasets, when used for training or pretraining, lead to better generalization in aspect-level sentiment classification.\n\nIn summary, **transferring specific layers (particularly embedding and LSTM) from document-level models** enhances performance, especially for datasets with scarce or unbalanced labeled data. Additionally, **increasing the proportion of document-level training examples consistently improves accuracy and macro-F1 scores**, mainly in datasets with limited aspect-level annotations, highlighting the effectiveness of knowledge transfer strategies in building robust sentiment classifiers.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\n- Layer transfer, especially embedding and LSTM layers, boosts model performance across datasets.\n- Incorporating more document-level data improves both accuracy and macro-F1, with notable benefits in datasets with limited labeled examples."}

For instance, in the data from [4], Google Translate shows a high accuracy of 59.4% for Ukrainian, but overall the accuracy varies considerably between systems and languages.\n\n- **Gender Bias (Bias in Translation):** All tested commercial and academic MT systems tend to exhibit gender bias, often translating professions stereotypically (e.g., nurse as female, programmer as male). This is supported by the data in [2], [4], and [6], with metrics indicating that performance deteriorates for anti-stereotypical roles. For example, the bias metrics in [11] show that systems perform better on stereotypical gender assignments (e.g., female nurse) than on anti-stereotypical ones (e.g., male nurse).\n\n**Comparison Across Languages:**\n\n- **Spanish (ES):** Moderate bias with about 67–76% accuracy ([3], [4], [10]) and significant stereotypical bias ([11], [12]). The gender prediction accuracy improves slightly (+10.4%) when stereotypical adjectives are added ([6]).\n\n- **French (FR):** Higher accuracy (~80%), but still with notable gender bias. The bias metrics ([11]) show performance differences between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical roles.\n\n- **Italian (IT), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK), Hebrew (HE), Arabic (AR), German (DE):** Variability exists, but the trend remains that systems tend to perform better with stereotypical roles, indicating bias ([4], [6], [10], [11]). For instance, German exhibits a high accuracy of 74.1% with low bias difference (Δ_G = 0), possibly due to language similarity.\n\n**Comparison Across MT Systems:**\n\n- **Google Translate:** Generally exhibits high accuracy (~59%) but displays bias, especially between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical roles ([11], [12]).\n\n- **Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, SYSTRAN:** Show comparable patterns with bias metrics indicating systemic gender bias and lower accuracy in gender preservation.\n\n**Visual Data Highlights:**\n\n- The bar chart in [1] illustrates that **stereotypical translations** tend to be **more accurate and consistent** than **non-stereotypical ones**, with gaps in accuracy (e.g., French at 80% stereotyping vs. 54% non-stereotyping). \n- The table in [4] emphasizes that **performance and bias vary per language and system**, with some systems like Amazon Translate performing better in certain languages ([10]).\n\nIn summary, while MT systems demonstrate decent overall performance in some languages like German, they consistently exhibit gender bias, influenced by language-specific features and societal stereotypes. Bias tends to be stronger when roles or descriptors align with stereotypical gender norms, as evidenced across the multiple evaluation metrics and datasets.\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nTranslation accuracy varies across languages and systems, with systems performing better in languages like German, but all tend to exhibit gender bias, especially favoring stereotypical roles, as shown by both quantitative metrics and visual data."}

For example, [2] notes that systems have a \"significant and consistently better performance when presented with pro-stereotypical assignments,\" which suggests that societal biases are embedded in the translation models.\n\nFurthermore, the experimental intervention described in [9] involved adding stereotypical adjectives (\"handsome\" or \"pretty\") to entities, attempting to \"correct\" biases by mixing signals. The results, as shown in **Image 4**, reveal that this adjustment **significantly improved** gender bias accuracy in languages like Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, indicating that bias can be mitigated through such stereotype-related modifications. However, the practicality and broader applicability of this method are limited because it depends on perfect coreference resolution, which is often unreliable.\n\nThe images also support this conclusion: **Image 3** displays a disparity in bias, with a higher total bias count in WinoBias and WinoMT datasets, illustrating the prevalence of stereotypical associations in different systems. Moreover, as per **Image 4**, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is higher than for non-stereotypical ones, underscoring how biases influence model performance.\n\nAnalyzing **Image 1**, we see that German translations tend to perform better across systems, likely because of linguistic similarity to English, which simplifies gender translation, whereas other languages like Russian and Arabic exhibit larger biases due to more complex grammatical gender mechanisms.\n\nIn languages that grammaticalize gender (e.g., Romance, Germanic, Slavic), implicit gender identification via morphological markers can both reveal biases and facilitate more accurate, less stereotyped translations when models incorporate context successfully [8]. When biases are present, as seen in **Image 5** (examples of stereotypical translation errors), the translation system may stereotype based on societal expectations, thus impacting accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments, such as adding gender cues, can **reduce bias** and improve gender accuracy, especially in languages with grammatical gender, but they are not a comprehensive solution. The impact varies across languages, improving accuracy in some (e.g., Spanish, Ukrainian) as shown in the data, but the underlying societal biases embedded in models remain a significant challenge.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nStereotype-based adjustments can **enhance gender bias accuracy** by reducing stereotyping in machine translation, particularly in languages with grammatical gender, but overall, biases persist across languages, affected by linguistic structures and societal stereotypes."}

Table 4 and the related text [4] show that single-paragraph models trained on adversarial distractors attain higher F1 scores (e.g., 60.10 after retraining) compared to models trained on original data, which suffer from accuracy drops, indicating that adversarial training improves the model's ability to handle challenging distractors.\n\nThirdly, ***evaluation strategies***—such as providing additional context or gold paragraphs—substantially boost F1 scores. For example, the F1 increases from 39.12 to 53.12 when gold paragraphs are supplied [7], emphasizing that evidence availability during evaluation strongly impacts performance.\n\nFurthermore, ***question complexity and reasoning type*** influence the effectiveness of models. Single-hop models perform well on straightforward questions (e.g., 70.54 F1 on single-hop questions in [7]), but underperform on multi-hop or context-dependent questions where BERT reaches near chance accuracy [7, 8]. The evaluations on datasets like Hotpot QA [6, 11] demonstrate that models trained solely on single-hop reasoning are less effective for multi-hop questions unless trained on targeted multi-hop data [6].\n\nLastly, ***distractor collection techniques and retrieval quality*** matter. As per [8] and [12], improving retrieval methods to include more relevant distractors and gold paragraphs enhances F1 scores, indicating that better evidence retrieval strategies during training and testing are crucial for multi-hop QA.\n\n**Summarized effect in simple terms:**\n\n| Strategy | Impact on F1 scores in multi-hop | Impact on F1 scores in single-hop |\n|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Entity/type filtering and adversarial training | Improves robustness and increases scores (e.g., from 40.73 to 58.42) | Enhances accuracy (e.g., from 46.84 to over 60) |\n| Providing gold paragraphs or context during evaluation | Significantly raises F1 (e.g., from 39.12 to 53.12) | Increases performance, showing importance of evidence |  \n| Better evidence-retrieval methods | Higher recall of relevant paragraphs, boosting F1 | Improves answer quality, especially in open-domain settings |\n\n**In conclusion,** strategic training on adversarial and context-rich data coupled with comprehensive evidence during evaluation markedly improves F1 scores in both multi-hop and single-hop tasks, but the gains are more pronounced for complex, multi-hop questions requiring deeper reasoning and retrieval.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved visual summary:**\n\n![Impact of different training and evaluation strategies on F1 scores](image8)  \n*Training with adversarial distractors and providing gold evidence notably improves accuracy, especially in complex, multi-hop questions.*"}

According to the textual evidence, initial results showed BERT reaching around 77% accuracy, just below untrained human baseline, but analysis revealed that this result was largely due to exploiting dataset-specific cues, especially words like \"not\" in warrants [1][2]. To address this, an adversarial dataset was created by negating claims and inverting labels, which balanced cue distributions across classes, thus removing these misleading signals [8][9].\n\nIn practice, evaluation on this adversarial dataset reveals a stark decline in BERT’s performance—dropping from near 77% to around 53%, with the best results actually near random chance [6][10]. The results indicate that, once cues are eliminated, BERT fails to demonstrate genuine argument comprehension, suggesting previous high performances were artifacts of dataset biases rather than true understanding [10]. Visual data further supports this, showing that models trained directly on original data overfit on cues, whereas training on adversarial data yields more robust assessment metrics with performance hovering around chance levels [4][6].\n\nFrom these results, the key conclusions are:  \n- The previous high performance figures were predominantly due to exploiting dataset biases.  \n- Proper adversarial training can effectively eliminate these cues, providing a more honest measure of a model’s argument comprehension ability.  \n- Models like BERT, without cues, do not perform meaningfully better than chance, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks in NLP research [3][10].\n\nThus, the adversarial setup crucially reveals the true limits of current models, highlighting the need for bias-aware datasets in future argument comprehension research."}

Although human evaluators still outperform the model, the gap is relatively modest, especially considering that greedy decoding relies solely on selecting the most probable candidate tuples. This suggests that models with greedy decoding can generate commonsense inferences with a quality approaching human judgment, but humans still maintain a higher standard.\n\nOther decoding strategies, like beam search with larger beam sizes, tend to produce more candidates but can slightly decrease the average quality scores, as indicated by the performance metrics, highlighting a trade-off: more candidates might increase diversity but can reduce average confidence. This aligns with findings in the text that greedy decoding produces knowledge approaching human performance, but generating more total candidates (via beam search or sampling) may necessitate human or further validation to confirm correctness.\n\n### Impact of Training Data Percentages\n**Figure 4 (image4)** illustrates that:\n- Using only **1%** of training data results in significantly lower metrics (e.g., **BLEU-2** of **5.08**, **N/T scores** around **58.34**), indicating diminished generation quality and novelty.\n- At **10%** of training data, the model improves substantially (**BLEU-2** of **12.72**, **N/T** scores around **58.34**), demonstrating better coherence, adequacy, and novelty.\n- With **50%** or full training data, metrics further improve, reaching **BLEU-2** scores of **13.97** and **14.34**, respectively, and higher N/T scores, indicating enhanced overall performance, including the correctness and diversity of generated knowledge.\n\nIn summary, **decoding strategies** like greedy decoding bring the model’s output closer in quality to human validation, but larger candidate sets can still benefit from human verification. Meanwhile, **training data volume** has a pronounced impact: more data enhances metrics such as BLEU-2, N/T scores, and the overall quality and novelty of generated commonsense inferences.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:**\n\n- **Greedy decoding** yields performance close to human validation (~77.5% vs. ~86%), but the gap remains.\n- Larger candidate generation methods (beam search) produce more candidates but may lower average quality.\n- Increasing **training data** from 1% to 50% improves metrics like BLEU-2, N/T scores, and knowledge diversity, showing a clear performance boost with more data.\n\n![Performance comparison and effect of training data](image5)"}

In contrast, **RetNRef ++** makes significant improvements—its word count rises to about 12.7, and the usage of rare words (less than 1k frequency) increases to approximately 10.9%, getting closer to human responses (average word count ~13.0, rare words ~11.5%). This indicates that **RetNRef ++** generates more elaborate and lexically diverse responses, akin to human utterances [4].\n\nIn terms of **performance metrics**, the models are evaluated across multiple dimensions:\n- **Engagement and fluency**: As per the scores in Table 3, **RetNRef++** scores highest in engagement (3.80), fluency (3.74), and persona consistency (0.65), closely approaching human levels (engagement ~3.9, fluency ~3.8). While no model perfectly matches human performance, **RetNRef++** demonstrates significant progress [4].\n- **Significance in win rates**: From Table 6, **RetNRef++** outperforms Memory Network and Seq2Seq in statistically significant win rates (~54% vs. ~51-52%), effectively learning when to copy retrieved utterances versus generating novel content [6].\n\nFinally, in **human-like conversational abilities**, **RetNRef ++** excels at producing longer, contextually nuanced sentences with more diverse vocabulary, contributing to more engaging dialogues. Human dialogues in the dataset have longer responses with rich vocabulary (word count ~13), which the **RetNRef++** approaches more closely than Seq2Seq or Memory Networks [8]. Human evaluations and pairwise comparisons confirm this; **RetNRef++** shows higher win rates in direct human vs. model tests and paired model evaluations [10,11].\n\n**In summary**, the **RetNRef++** method enhances word diversity and engagement, performs better on key metrics, and produces responses that are more human-like compared to other models, primarily by balancing copying retrieved information with generating novel content.\n\n---\n\n**Illustrative images:**\n\n- **Word statistics** show **RetNRef++** approaches human-level diversity in word usage:\n  ![Comparison of word statistics between models and humans](image4)\n\n- **Performance metrics** highlight **RetNRef++**'s superior engagement and win rates:\n  ![Performance comparison showing win rates and evaluation scores](image6)\n\n- **Sample dialogues** illustrate more nuanced and contextually relevant responses from **RetNRef++**, akin to human dialogues:\n  ![Example dialogue with RetNRef++ producing longer, more engaging replies](image1)\n\n*In essence*, **RetNRef++** bridges the gap toward human-like conversation better than traditional retrieval or sequence models, thanks to its ability to combine retrieval, copying, and generation effectively."}

According to the data, a **5% immediate increase or decrease** in currencies like USD, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP versus EUR and DKK would have impacted operating profit, with the most notable sensitivities seen in USD, CNY, and JPY (Quote [6]). Specifically, the **average exchange rates** showed a **decrease in USD (from 667 to 654)** and **a decline in JPY (from 6.12 to 6.13)**, while the **year-end changes** reflected a depreciation in USD and JPY (Quote [3] and [7]), which likely contributed to the negative impact on profit due to currency fluctuations.\n\n**Regarding financial risks**, particularly the **foreign exchange risk**, the company actively uses derivatives such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets, and liabilities (Quotes [5], [11], and [12]). These hedging activities are designed to reduce short-term earnings volatility caused by exchange rate movements, as the company aims to improve financial predictability.\n\nIn terms of **comprehensive income**, the **derivative financial instruments** positioned as cash flow hedges are expected to impact income within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses transferred to either financial income or expenses (Quotes [7], and [12]). For 2020, the total derivative financial instrument value was **DKK 15,089 million**, with **cash flow hedges** accounting for **DKK 2,332 million** (Quotes [5], [8], and [11]). Changes in exchange rates contributed to fluctuations in hedge outcomes, impacting net gains/losses recognized on these derivatives.\n\nAnalyzing the **impact on cash flow hedges** specifically, the **derivative instruments** serve to offset currency fluctuations, aiming to stabilize cash flows despite adverse exchange rate movements. The data shows around **DKK 2,027 million** in cash flow hedge derivatives at the start of 2020, with some transfer of cash flow hedge reserves during the year (Quote [7]).\n\nFinally, **the comprehensive income** was affected by other comprehensive income components associated with derivative instruments, with a total of **DKK -1,811 million in 2019**, implying some hedging inefficiencies or adjustments in 2020, although precise 2020 figures are not explicitly detailed here.\n\n### In summary:\n\n- **Exchange rate fluctuations** in 2020 caused a decline in certain currencies, impacting Novo Nordisk’s operational profits.\n- **Hedging derivatives** largely mitigated short-term earnings volatility due to currency risks, as reflected in the movement of cash flow hedge reserves.\n- The **comprehensive income** was affected by both realized and unrealized gains/losses on derivatives used for hedging, with a total derivative value of DKK 15,089 million, indicating active management of currency risk.\n\n**In conclusion**, Novo Nordisk’s strategic use of derivative instruments and hedging activities helped buffer the adverse impacts of exchange rate changes on its comprehensive income and cash flows in 2020, although some residual effects remained evident through fluctuations in hedge reserves and income statement impacts."}

Significant Increase in Shareholders’ Equity:\n- **Net earnings** surged from **$43.3 billion in 2020** to **$90.8 billion in 2021**, reflecting an almost **doubling** in net income, as seen in the income statement and noted in the detailed returns [6], [8], [12].\n- The **accumulated other comprehensive income** and unrealized gains on securities contributed positively, as indicated by the overall rise in retained earnings and comprehensive income [6], [8], [12], [14].\n\n#### 2. Rise in Liabilities, Particularly Insurance-Related Liabilities:\n- The key contributor to liability growth was the **increase in insurance liabilities**, especially **unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses**, which increased from **$79.9 billion in 2020** to **$86.7 billion in 2021**. This was partly due to ongoing claims and reserving adjustments [1], [2], [9], and the detailed figures in images 1 and 2].\n- **Liabilities from retroactive reinsurance** also contributed, with reductions in estimated liabilities for prior years’ reinsurance contracts, but overall liabilities still increased notably in 2021 [9], [12].\n\n#### 3. Expansion of Infrastructure Assets and Capital:\n- The **domestic infrastructure assets** owned by Berkshire increased from approximately **$151.2 billion in 2020** to **$155.5 billion in 2021**, reflecting ongoing investments that bolster asset value and equity [10], [14].\n\n#### 4. Change in Debt and Borrowings:\n- While the **total debt decreased slightly** (from roughly **$24.7 billion in 2020** to **$21.4 billion in 2021**), the company issued long-term Euro and Yen-denominated debt with low interest rates, which contributed to the overall liability profile but did not negatively impact equity growth [5].\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nOverall, Berkshire Hathaway's **liabilities increased primarily due to higher insurance-related liabilities and reinsurance reserves**, driven by claims and changes in reserve estimates. Meanwhile, **shareholders’ equity grew significantly owing to robust net earnings, increased comprehensive income, and asset appreciation**, especially in infrastructure investments.\n\n**In simple terms**, from 2020 to 2021, Berkshire Hathaway’s liabilities rose substantially mainly because of insurance claim reserves and liabilities related to reinsurance contracts, while its shareholders’ equity increased sharply due to higher earnings and valuation gains, reflecting strong financial performance and asset growth."}

The relatively moderate decline is partly due to:\n  - The $268 million net strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock in 2020, which offset some operating income reductions (text [1], [10]).\n  - Reduced share repurchases in 2020, with only 4.3 million shares bought back versus 25 million in 2019, affecting earnings per share calculations.\n- **Non-GAAP EPS saw a decline of 20% as well, from $7.88 in 2019 to $6.31 in 2020** (image 5). The non-GAAP figure excludes strategic gains and charges, reflecting operational performance more directly impacted by revenue declines.\n- The operational impact of decreased revenues, especially within international markets, along with increased expenses for franchisee support, marketing, and restaurant closures, contributed to lower operating income, which in turn led to reduced earnings per share.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The decline in **company-operated and franchised revenues** across markets, driven mainly by COVID-19's impact on international operations and store closures, led to a **decrease in operating income** and subsequently lowered both **GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS**.\n- The strategic sale gains somewhat cushioned the overall impact on EPS, but the overall trend was a noticeable reduction in earnings attributable to decreased revenues and increased expenses related to recovery efforts.\n\n**In conclusion:**\nMarket-specific revenue declines in both company-operated and franchised markets directly contributed to the 20% drop in both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share from 2019 to 2020, with COVID-19-related store closures and operational disruptions being primary factors."}

This decline indicates a decrease in the company's overall income after accounting for other comprehensive income (loss), such as foreign currency translation adjustments, gains or losses on investments, and pension plan adjustments [12].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decrease:\n\n1. **Foreign currency translation adjustments:** In 2020, there was a substantial foreign currency translation loss of $104.1 million, compared to gains in previous years (e.g., $126.8 million in 2019) [12].

Despite this growth, the rate was lower than prior years, indicating a moderate recovery possibly due to improved macroeconomic conditions.\n- **Reserve for Credit Losses:** The reserve for credit losses decreased in 2021, largely driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook and better portfolio quality, which contributed to a reserve release.\n- **Growth Drivers:** The 21% increase was weaker than billed business growth, partly because of higher paydown rates driven by the customer base's liquidity and strength (Quote [7]).\n\n### Card Member Receivables:\n- **Increase in Receivables:** Receivables increased by about 23% from $43.7 billion in 2020 to $53.6 billion in 2021 (Image 3), reflecting a broader growth in outstanding balances.\n- **Reserve for Credit Losses:** The reserve for receivables increased due to macroeconomic deterioration in 2020, but improved in 2021 with a decrease driven by better economic outlook and portfolio quality.\n\n### Network Volumes:\n- **Network Volumes Growth:** Network volumes increased by 24% overall (Image 2), with U.S. volumes growing by 27% and outside the U.S. by 17%. This indicates higher transaction activity across both domestic and international markets.\n\n### Card Member Spending:\n- **Billed Business:** Billed business grew by approximately 25% in 2021, reaching $1.09 trillion (Image 2 and 4). Growth was driven by increased consumer spending on goods and services globally.\n- **Spending Levels:** The increase in spending and billed business surpasses the growth seen in loans and receivables, suggesting improved spend per card or increased card usage.\n\n### Comparison:\n- Both **card member loans** and **receivables** expanded significantly (~21% and 23% respectively), reflecting a recovery from pandemic-related declines.\n- **Network volumes** increased slightly faster at 24%, indicating higher transaction activity, which aligns with elevated spending levels.\n- **Card member spending** surged by about 25%, outpacing the growth in loans and receivables, highlighting a more robust engagement and utilization of credit cards in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, card member loans and receivables experienced substantial growth, consistent with the rise in transaction volumes and consumer spending, signaling a recovery and increased activity in the credit card ecosystem after pandemic impacts.\n\n---\n\n**Visual Summary:**\n\n![Key Changes in Card Member Loans and Receivables](image3)  \n*Card member loans and receivables increased by about 21% and 23%, compared to a 24% increase in network volumes and a 25% rise in billed business in 2021.*"}

The comprehensive income for 2020 was approximately $5,493.2 million, which is lower than the $6,152.2 million reported in 2019, reflecting decreased net income along with other factors such as currency translation adjustments and gains or losses from strategic asset sales [4][7][11].\n\nSeveral key factors contributed to these changes:\n- **Operating Margin and Operating Income:** Operating margin decreased from about 42.8% in 2019 to roughly 36.7% in 2020, mainly due to reduced operating earnings owing to the pandemic's disruption [1][9].\n- **Net Income Drivers:** The net income decline was influenced by lower revenue and operating earnings, as well as strategic gains recognized in 2019, including gains from stock sales which reduced in 2020 [2][7][11].\n- **Comprehensive Income:** The decrease was driven by currency translation impacts, foreign exchange adjustments, and strategic asset sales, notably the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which contributed to the recorded gains in 2019 but was offset by impairments and losses in 2020 [6][7][12].\n- **Currency Translation and Market Conditions:** Currency translation adjustments and market conditions also played a role, with positive impacts in some areas in 2020 but overall contributing to the decline in comprehensive income [6].\n\nIn summary, net income and comprehensive income both declined from 2019 to 2020 due to pandemic-related operational challenges, lower operating earnings, strategic asset sales, and currency translation effects, all of which are reflected in the detailed financial statements and disclosures."}

The most notable growth is in divisions like **PBNA (beverages)**, which rose from **$21,072 million in 2018** to **$22,559 million in 2020**.  \n- **Regional contributions:** The U.S. remains the largest contributor, but revenue in **Russia** declined from **$3,191 million in 2018** to **$3,009 million in 2020**, while **Mexico** decreased from **$3,878 million to $3,924 million**, indicating some regional fluctuations.  \n- **Category distribution impact:**  \n  - According to the category data, **beverages** generally account for a larger share in **Europe** (55%), **AMESA** (30%), and **APAC** (25%) regions, which likely supports growth in those divisions.  \n  - Conversely, divisions with a higher **food/snack** proportion, such as **Europe (45%)** and **AMESA (70%)**, may experience different demand dynamics, possibly affected differently by pandemic-related disruptions.\n\n### Operating Profit Analysis:\n- **Growth and decline:**  \n  - **FLNA** saw a **moderate increase** from **$5,258 million in 2018** to **$5,340 million in 2020** (~1.5%).  \n  - **PBNA (beverages)** experienced substantial growth in operating profit from **$2,276 million in 2018** to **$1,937 million in 2020**, a slight decline, but overall resilient.  \n  - **QFNA**'s operating profit increased from **$637 million to $669 million**.  \n  - **Europe**'s operating profit grew from **$319 million to $1,353 million**, partly driven by reorganization, volume shifts, and category effects.\n\n- **Impact of COVID-19:**  \n  - Operating profit growth in 2020 was impacted by pandemic-related charges, reducing the growth by around **3-4 percentage points**, as detailed in the notes (quotes [5], [7], [9], [11]).  \n  - Segments with higher beverage content, especially in regions like **Europe**, showed resilience, possibly due to the higher consumer demand for beverages during the pandemic, which is consistent with the category distribution where beverage dominance in regions like Europe (55%) influences overall profit stability.\n\n### Relationship to Beverage/Food- Snack Distribution:\n- **Beverage emphasis** (as shown in images [6] and [8]):  \n  - Regions like **Europe (55%)**, **APAC (25%)**, and **LATAM (10%)** have a higher **beverage share**, possibly contributing to more stable or increasing revenues and profits during volatile periods such as 2020.  \n  - Since beverage categories tend to be more resilient during economic downturns, their larger category share in these regions supports the sustained growth in operating profit.\n\n- **Food/Snack segments** in the **AMESA (70%)** and **APAC (75%)** regions:\n  - Higher food/snack proportions could influence revenue patterns and margins differently, especially during pandemic disruptions that may either increase or decrease demand based on consumer behavior shifts.\n  - The **food/snack** segment’s contribution to revenue (see image [6]) suggests that increases in demand in regions with higher **food/snack** category shares might mitigate some declines caused by external shocks.\n\n### Summary:\n- From 2018 to 2020, net revenue generally increased across divisions, with beverages and regions with higher beverage shares (notably Europe and LATAM) contributing significantly to stability.\n- Operating profit growth was affected by COVID-19, but divisions with a higher beverage category share showed greater resilience, aligning with their proportional distribution.\n- Regions with higher **food/snack** shares experienced varied impacts, but overall category distribution helped buffer some of the pandemic's adverse effects.\n\n**In conclusion**, the shifts in net revenue and operating profit from 2018 to 2020 are closely linked to the distribution of beverage versus food/snack categories across divisions and regions. The higher beverage content in many regions likely contributed to relative stability and growth amid challenging external conditions."}

This increase indicates a higher level of hedging activity or derivative positions, which helps manage exposure to currency, interest rate, or commodity risks. The fair value measurement hierarchy shows these derivatives are valued based on active market data and observable market inputs, providing transparency and reliability [6], [11].\n\nSpecifically, **total derivative financial instruments** recognized in the income statement also increased from DKK 50,455 million in 2019 to DKK 63,390 million in 2020, reflecting expanded or revalued derivatives. The gains or losses from these derivatives impact the income statement as financial income or expenses, affecting the company's profitability. For instance, net gains from changes in fair value are recognized directly in the income statement when derivatives are settled or when hedge accounting criteria are no longer met [8], [9], [10], [11].\n\n---\n\n### Cash Flow Changes:\nThe cash flow statements for 2020 and 2019 highlight how these derivatives and other financial activities influence liquidity:\n\n- **Total cash flows from operating activities** increased in 2020 to DKK 4,037 million from DKK 4,145 million in 2019, after reversing non-cash items and adjusting working capital. These adjustments often reflect derivatives' impact, especially deferred gains or losses tied to hedge accounting, which are non-cash initially but affect future cash flows [7].\n\n- **Cash from investing activities** shows payments related to purchases and sales of long-term investments, including financial assets. In 2020, cash flows related to financial assets such as trade receivables and other receivables/prepayments were DKK 16,091 million at fair value OCI, increasing from DKK 12,709 million in 2019, showing more activity in managing receivables and other financial assets [5], [8].\n\n- **Changes in working capital** show a decrease of DKK 2,624 million in 2020 compared to DKK 3,564 million in 2019, indicating adjustments to liquidity tied up in short-term assets and liabilities, including derivatives and hedging instruments.\n\n**Impact on Financial Statements**:\n- **Balance Sheet:** The increased fair value of derivatives (from DKK 50,455 million to DKK 63,390 million) results in higher recognized assets and liabilities, affecting the company's total assets and liabilities, especially under fair value measurement.\n- **Income Statement:** Gains or losses from derivatives impact net income directly, affecting profitability. The recognition of deferred gains or losses related to hedges impacts future periods when the forecasted transactions occur.\n- **Cash Flow Statement:** Non-cash changes in derivatives and other financial assets/liabilities are adjusted to reflect actual cash movements, providing insight into the company's liquidity position.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary:\n\n![Comparison of derivative instruments and cash flows in 2020 and 2019](image7)\n*This table summarizes the increase in derivative financial instruments and cash flow movements, illustrating the company's active risk management.*\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe increase in derivatives in 2020 indicates more extensive hedging activities. These derivatives influence the financial statements through recognition of fair value changes on the balance sheet, gains/losses in the income statement, and adjustments in cash flows. The company's strategic use of derivatives helps mitigate risks, but also requires careful accounting as reflected in the increases from 2019 to 2020."}

This substantial rise reflects heightened liabilities, likely driven by increased insurance claim liabilities, as detailed in the insurance and reinsurance liabilities data [9], which grew to approximately $125 billion at end-2021. Such liabilities are common in insurance operations, especially with rising estimated ultimate liabilities for claims, and are a normal part of Berkshire’s insurance business cycle.\n\n- **Shareholders’ equity rose** modestly from **$451.3 billion in 2020** to **$514.9 billion in 2021**, an increase of roughly **$63.6 billion**. The rise in net worth stems from the company's net earnings and comprehensive income, which together totaled approximately **$89.8 billion** in net earnings, with $61.6 billion attributed to gains on investments [10], supporting shareholder value. Notably, comprehensive income was significantly higher, totaling approximately **$91.04 billion** in 2021, driven primarily by unrealized gains on equity securities and other comprehensive income components [10].\n\n**Relation to net earnings and comprehensive income:**\n\n- The **net earnings of $89.8 billion** contributed directly to the increase in shareholders' equity. Since net earnings are a component of comprehensive income, they provide a baseline for equity growth, but comprehensive income also includes unrealized gains (positive in 2021), which further boosted total equity.\n\n- The **increase in liabilities**, especially in insurance liabilities, is a normal consequence of recorded claims and loss estimates, which naturally fluctuate with claims experience and legal/environmental factors. Despite the increased liabilities, the company's **equity growth indicates strong profitability and asset appreciation**, as the company's high investment gains and operational revenues (notably $69.5 billion in insurance premiums earned [3]) contributed to overall growth.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect | 2020 | 2021 | Change | Remarks |\n|---------|-------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Total liabilities | ~$451.3B | ~$958.8B | + ~$507.5B | Driven by increased insurance liabilities and claim reserves [9].|\n| Shareholders’ equity | ~$451.3B | ~$514.9B | + ~$63.6B | Reflects net earnings and unrealized gains [10].|\n| Net earnings + comprehensive income | ~$89.8B | ~$91.04B | + ~$1.2B | Contributed primarily to the equity increase.|\n| Investment gains (unrealized) | Included | Significant (approx. $61.6B) | | Major component of comprehensive income, boosting equity.|\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe large rise in liabilities is consistent with increased insurance reserves and claim liabilities, while the growth in shareholders’ equity reflects solid net earnings and unrealized gains. These changes indicate that Berkshire’s strong operational performance and investment gains in 2021 offset liabilities increases, leading to overall expansion of net worth despite higher liabilities."}

The consistent upward trend in EPS reflects improved profitability and effective management of share issuance, considering stock-based compensation costs.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nOverall, the slight stabilization or minor decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, coupled with the significant and steady increase in net earnings and EPS, suggests that P&G has successfully managed its employee incentive programs while simultaneously driving profitability. This balance indicates a positive financial trend with sustained growth in earnings and effective costs control in stock-based compensation over the years 2020 to 2022.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:**\n\nThe modest changes in stock-based compensation expenses alongside consistent growth in net earnings and EPS reflect P&G's effective management of employee incentives and strong profitability growth from 2020 to 2022."}

The *accumulated other comprehensive income* (OCI) reflects gains or losses not included in net income, influenced by foreign currency translation, unrealized debt securities gains/losses, and other factors.\n\n- **Change in OCI (from Note 17):**  \n  The *accumulated other comprehensive income* increased from a loss of **$2,895 million** in 2020 to a gain of **$2,945 million** in 2021. Also, in 2019, there was an OCI of **$2,895 million** (loss), indicating fluctuations.\n\n**Impact analysis:**\n\n- The **increase in OCI** from 2020 to 2021 (around **$5.84 billion** net change, from a loss of ~$2.9 billion to a gain of ~$2.9 billion) substantially contributed to the overall *comprehensive income* rise in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n- In 2019, despite a positive net income, the *comprehensive income* was relatively lower (~$6.6 billion), partly due to the OCI components, which fluctuated significantly due to foreign currency translation and unrealized securities gains/losses.\n\n- The **net income** more than doubled from 2020 to 2021 (from approximately **$3.14 billion** to **$8.06 billion**), contributing dramatically to increased shareholders’ equity.\n\n- The **combination** of higher net income and the favorable swing in OCI (from a loss to a gain) drove the overall increases in shareholders’ equity during 2019-2021.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe changes in shareholders’ equity between 2019 and 2021 were heavily influenced by fluctuations in comprehensive income, with notable increases in net income and a significant improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income (from a loss to a gain). The large positive change in OCI in 2021, particularly, contributed substantially to the higher total comprehensive income, and consequently, to the overall growth in shareholders' equity during these years.\n\n---\n\n**In simple terms:**  \nThe company's shareholders’ equity increased mainly due to higher net income and a significant improvement in other comprehensive income, especially in 2021, which together expanded overall shareholders’ equity from 2019 to 2021."}

Correspondingly, the foreign tax provision also changed: in 2019, it was $2,472 million as per the detailed tax data (image7, line “Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate”), but by 2021, the effective tax rate related to foreign earnings was reduced to 12% (image7). \n\nFurthermore, the effective tax rate decreased from 41% in 2019 to 12% in 2021 (image7), largely driven by tax incentives, credits, and regulatory changes, such as the benefit from FDII deductions and adjustments due to the new regulations (quotes [1], [5], and [11]).\n\n**Implications**: \n- The increase in foreign income suggests a strategic focus on international markets, possibly to diversify income sources and optimize tax advantages.\n- The reduction in the effective foreign tax rate reflects leveraging tax credits, incentives, and reforms, which can reduce overall tax liabilities and improve after-tax profitability.\n- These changes might lead the company to prioritize establishing or maintaining favorable tax positions abroad, possibly influencing decisions on repatriation, investment, and operational structuring to sustain or enhance these benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, the company’s strategies are likely shifting towards maximizing international earnings while minimizing tax burdens through effective use of incentives, tax planning, and regulatory compliance.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBetween 2019 and 2021, the company's foreign income before taxes increased markedly from $439 million to $1,493 million, and its effective foreign tax rate fell from 41% to 12%. These shifts suggest a focus on international growth and strategic tax planning to optimize after-tax income, influencing future financial and operational decisions."}

This growth reflects active asset management and strategic asset accumulation, supported by continued purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities (evidence from images 1 and 8). The increase indicates a deliberate focus on bolstering the balance sheet to meet liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives, as well as to enhance yield through diversified assets.\n\nSecondly, **WFAM assets under management (AUM)** rose markedly from about **$508.8 billion** in 2020 to **$603 billion** in 2021 (see images 8 and 12). This jump of roughly **$94 billion** signifies an aggressive expansion of managed assets, potentially driven by strategic acquisitions or increased client inflows, like the sale of the WFAM business noted in the quotes (see quotes [4], [5], [7], and image 12). The rise in AUM enhances fee-based income, reinforcing a strategy focused on expanding revenue streams from management fees rather than purely lending activities.\n\nIn response, Wells Fargo's strategies appear to have been oriented toward:  \n- **Rebalancing the asset portfolio** to optimize yield and manage interest rate risk effectively (supported by the portfolio rebalancing activities outlined in quotes [1], [8], and images 1 and 4).  \n- **Maximizing fee income** through growth in AUM, especially with the sale of its asset management business, which netted gains (see quotes [5], [11], and images 8 and 12).  \n- **Enhancing balance sheet strength** and liquidity positioning by increasing assets, even amid market stress, to support ongoing lending and investment initiatives.\n\nOverall, the increase in total assets and AUM indicates a strategic shift toward asset accumulation and management fee growth, aiming for sustainable revenue and risk management amid evolving market conditions.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe growth in total assets and WFAM AUM from 2020 to 2021 prompted Wells Fargo to refine its balance sheet, emphasizing asset diversification, risk management, and fee-based income expansion as key components of its financial strategy."}

This significant decrease was mainly due to reduced income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, aligning with the broader context of declining interest rates, as evidenced by the decrease in interest rates in 2021 (approx. 3.9%) compared to previous years [3].\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes in interest income. The investment portfolio focuses heavily on equities and fixed maturity securities, with equity securities valued at $334,907 million at the end of 2021, and fixed maturity securities totaling $16,386 million [6]. The relatively large holding of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills ($90,688 million), combined with low interest rates, means that the portfolio's income-generating ability from fixed income is limited in a low-rate environment [6, 7]. This asset allocation prioritizes safety and liquidity over yield, consistent with the organization's emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity over higher-yield investments when interest rates are low, as explained in the commentary on their investment strategy [7].\n\nIn summary, the drop in investment income was caused by a decline in interest income due to persistently low interest rates, and the asset allocation, skewed towards cash and low-yield securities, reflects a conservative approach to preserve liquidity amidst challenging market conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Evidence:\n![Asset allocation reflects the low-yield environment, emphasizing liquidity and safety over higher income from fixed income securities](image8)"}

This growth is consistent with increased demand for Medicare plans, possibly due to aging populations and acceleration of enrollment processes under pandemic-related policies.\n\n- **Medicaid:** There was also a significant increase in Medicaid enrollees, mainly due to states easing redetermination requirements amid COVID-19 and growth in Dual Special Needs Plans [5][10]. This indicates that policy adjustments during the pandemic made it easier for more individuals to qualify or retain Medicaid coverage.\n\n- **Commercial and Global segments:** Contrarily, these segments experienced a decline in individuals served. The decrease is attributed to increased unemployment and subsequent attrition, as many individuals lost employer-sponsored coverage and fewer people enrolled in Global programs due to economic and pandemic-related challenges [5].\n\n- **Overall trend:** As reported, UnitedHealthcare served approximately 98 million people at the end of 2020 compared to 96 million at the end of 2019, reflecting net growth despite segment-specific declines [4].\n\n**Main causes of these changes include:**\n\n- The **growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid** populations was driven by demographic trends and pandemic-related policy flexibilities—such as states easing redetermination activity—and increased private enrollment in Medicare [5][10].\n\n- The **decreases in commercial and global segments** stem from **economic downturns**, particularly rising unemployment, which led to attrition of employer-sponsored coverage and reduced international/global enrollment [5].\n\n- Additionally, **care deferrals and economic impacts of COVID-19** impacted enrollment dynamics and the affordability/accessibility of different coverage segments.\n\nIn summary, while Medicare and Medicaid segments exhibited growth mainly due to COVID-19 policy adaptations and demographic factors, commercial and global segments contracted primarily due to economic hardships and employment loss."}

In 2020, the company’s total revenue was approximately \\$30.83 billion, with a substantial decline compared to 2019, largely due to COVID-19's impact on content licensing and event postponements. However, in 2021, revenue increased sharply to about \\$34.3 billion, representing a 6.7% rise compared to 2020 [10]. Excluding foreign currency effects, this increase was driven by higher revenue per customer, stemming from the resumption of sporting events and rate hikes in key markets, compensating somewhat for decreased broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy.\n\nCustomer relationships also saw notable shifts. In 2020, the total customer base was approximately 23.2 million, slightly down from 23.3 million in 2019, due to reduced broadcast rights and decreased activity in certain regions [11], leading to a reduction in revenue per customer in Italy. In 2021, despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, customer relationships remained relatively steady at around 23 million, with some regional improvements due to sales of wireless handsets and increased rates, which helped boost revenue per relationship [11].\n\nThe combination of stable customer relationships and increased rate per customer in 2021 led to higher revenue, positively impacting the company’s profitability. Nevertheless, expenses also increased due to higher costs associated with sales of wireless services, which somewhat offset the gains in revenue. Overall, the revenue growth driven by improved revenue per customer relationships and strategic content licensing contributed to a better financial position in 2021 despite ongoing global challenges.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Revenue decreased in 2020 due to COVID-19 impacts but rebounded in 2021 with an increase driven by higher revenue per customer and strategic licensing.\n- Customer relationships remained relatively stable, but improvements in revenue per relationship and higher rates contributed to positive revenue trends.\n- These dynamics collectively enhanced NBCUniversal's financial performance between 2019 and 2021."}

This suggests that there was an evaluation of goodwill's recoverability, possibly indicating changes in perceived value or impairment considerations.\n\nLooking at the images, particularly the tables, we observe the following:\n\n- In the consolidated balance sheets, there is a notable decrease in balances from 2020 to 2021:\n  - For example, in the balance at 31/01/2021, the balance was 380, while at 31/01/2022, it decreased to 340 (images 1 & 2). Similarly, the balance at 01/02/2020 was 456, reducing to 380 at 31/01/2021, indicating a reduction in goodwill or related intangible assets over the year.\n  \n- The detailed components, such as acquisition costs or other intangible items, appear in other tables (images 3–8) but aren't explicitly labeled as goodwill components. However, the consistent note across the reports on the goodwill arising from acquisition or franchise contracts (similar to [9]) points out that certain intangible assets did not meet the requirements for separate recognition, affecting the total goodwill value.\n\n- Changes in goodwill are also influenced by the impairment assessments mentioned in [3], which confirmed that the recoverability was guaranteed by the future cash flows, possibly preventing impairments but still resulting in a reduction of recorded goodwill.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reduction in goodwill balance from 2020 to 2021 indicates that the component of goodwill related to acquisitions or franchise contracts has decreased, likely due to impairment adjustments or amortization aligned with realized recoveries.\n- The detailed balance sheet figures illustrate a clear decline in goodwill balances, supported by positive future cash flow guarantees in 2021.\n- Overall, the key difference is that goodwill in 2021 was reaffirmed to be recoverable, with some balances potentially written down or adjusted, compared to a higher balance in 2020.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe key differences are a reduction in goodwill balances from 2020 to 2021, driven by impairment assessments and positive cash flow guarantees ensuring the recoverability of goodwill components."}

This is a rise of approximately **13%** ($44,382 million increase).\n  \n- The **percentage of Credit Risk RWA as a share of total RWA decreased slightly from 16.9% in 2019 to 16.0% in 2020** (as per images 6 and 8). This suggests that, despite an absolute increase in credit risk exposure, it constitutes a slightly smaller part of the total risk, possibly due to increases in other risk types such as market or operational risks.\n\n**External TLAC as a Percentage of RWA:**\n\n- From the data in images 7 and 8, **External TLAC increased from 18.0% of RWA (~2019) to 21.5% (~2020)**.

These figures demonstrate the company's expanding export footprint, supported by pioneering new brands and increasing market share, over 11%, in a mature and challenging environment [10].\n\nThe potential for tobacco export earnings is quite substantial, with the current share of global trade at only 0.7% and a high potential for growth, as illustrated by the possibility of increasing export earnings to Rs. 7000 crore with just a 5% share of the market, compared to current levels of Rs. 930 crore [3][7]. The company’s successful increase in cigarette exports, especially to international markets such as China and India, which have high taxes and tariffs, indicates an effective strategy to leverage global demand.\n\nFinancial results reflect that the company has focused not only on domestic performance but also on expanding export volumes, which could buffer against domestic market fluctuations and intensify revenue streams. The rise in profitability, alongside investments in new brands and product development (e.g., Piper, Tipper, Jaisalmer), suggests a strategic emphasis on innovation and market diversification.\n\n**Implications for strategy include:**\n- Continuing to enhance export markets, especially targeting countries with high tariffs and low current market shares,\n- Investing in product innovation to sustain competitive advantage,\n- Strengthening relationships with international retailers and partners,\n- Leveraging high potential export earnings to offset domestic market pressures and expand global presence.\n\nIn summary, the company's 2002-2003 financial results—growth in domestic sales, significant export increases, and the identified potential of the tobacco export market—highlight a strategic focus on global expansion. This positions the company well to capitalize on the high potential of tobacco exports, which could substantially enhance future revenues and market influence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The financial results of 2002-2003 demonstrate robust growth and strategic initiatives aligned with the high potential for tobacco export earnings, suggesting a focus on global market expansion as a key driver for future company strategy."}

The percentage decrease was about 32%.\n- **Net interest expense** **increased** by **$14.1 billion** (from $2.7 billion in 2019 to $16.8 billion in 2020). This substantial rise indicates higher costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n### Changes from 2018 to 2019:\n- **Net interest income** **decreased** by **$0.7 billion** (from $17.4 billion in 2018 to $16.9 billion in 2019), a smaller decline of about 4%.\n- **Net interest expense** **declined** by **$0.4 billion** (from $3.1 billion in 2018 to $2.7 billion in 2019), reflecting decreased costs in interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n### Reflection on Organizational Structure:\nThe distinctive patterns—particularly the sharp rise in net interest expense and the major drop in net interest income in 2020—are typical during periods of economic stress, such as in 2020 amidst COVID-19. The increase in interest expense suggests that Bank of America likely relied more heavily on borrowing and maintaining large interest-bearing liabilities (e.g., deposits, wholesale funding), which increased the total interest costs. Meanwhile, the reduced net interest income reflects lower earning assets, possibly due to declining interest rates and a cautious lending environment. \n\nThese dynamics are tied to Bank of America’s organizational structure, which segments activities into consumer banking, global markets, and wholesale banking, among others. For example:\n- **Consumer Banking** (see images 7 and 8) shows increased deposit balances, which directly influence interest expense.\n- **Global Markets** and **Global Banking** segments are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, affecting core income streams.\n- The competitive and risk-adjusted capital allocation methods (described in quotes [1] and [2]) influence how the bank manages liquidity, funding costs, and asset mix to adapt to changing economic conditions.\n\n### In summary:\n- The **dramatic increase** in net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 reflects the bank’s higher reliance on interest-bearing liabilities, likely driven by increased deposit balances and funding needs during uncertain economic times.\n- The **sharp decline** in net interest income indicates a contraction in earning assets and interest rates, which was more pronounced in 2020 than in 2018–2019.\n- These shifts illustrate how Bank of America’s organizational segments and capital strategies adapt to economic shocks, emphasizing funding and risk management in different operational areas."}

This reduction is primarily driven by lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as highlighted in quote [4], which states that declines in interest and other investment income were mainly due to lower income from these asset classes, resulting from persistently low interest rates in 2021. Despite holding substantial cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, the low interest rate environment limited income gains.\n\n**Asset Composition**:  \nRegarding asset composition, data from images [3] and [7] show that:\n- **Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills** increased from approximately \\$67 billion in 2020 to about \\$90.7 billion in 2021, indicating a significant **increase** in short-term, highly liquid assets.\n- **Equity securities** grew from \\$269.5 billion in 2020 to \\$334.9 billion in 2021, a substantial **increase** in marketable equity investments.\n- **Fixed maturity securities** decreased from about \\$20.3 billion in 2020 to \\$16.4 billion in 2021, reflecting a slight **reduction** in fixed income holdings.\n\n**Implications**:\n- The shift toward higher liquidity assets like cash and Treasuries suggests a strategic preference for safety and liquidity, likely in response to market volatility and low interest rates (as per [4]) and perhaps a cautious stance amid ongoing economic uncertainties.\n- The increase in equity securities, despite their inherent volatility, indicates an intention to benefit from potential market appreciation (supported by unrealized gains of approximately \\$76.4 billion in 2021, as per [7]). However, this also heightens earnings volatility due to the fluctuating value of equities.\n- The lower net investment income, coupled with a higher cash and equity allocation, suggests a cautious approach to income generation, emphasizing safety and liquidity over yield.\n\n**Concluding**, the insurance firm's asset portfolio shifted towards more liquid and equity investments while income from investments declined, likely reflecting strategies to safeguard capital in a persistently low-interest-rate environment.

To address these risks, Nestlé has implemented key mitigations such as developing policies and procedures to safeguard health and safety, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and active risk management of commodity and product sources [6].\n\nFurthermore, Nestlé is actively **enhancing its data-sharing and technological capabilities** to improve supply chain resilience. They pilot solutions with supply chain partners, such as expanding Transport Hub technologies to cover 50% of their global logistics network and applying AI-powered network optimization tools. These tools enable quick response to demand changes and optimize transport and production, which reduces operational carbon footprints and enhances efficiency [10].\n\nRegarding regional factory distribution, the geographic diversity of Nestlé's operations supports resilience. The detailed breakdown of factories and markets across regions—such as North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America—illustrates a broad global footprint. This distribution allows the company to better respond to regional disruptions, as supply chain risks can be mitigated by relying on multiple, localized manufacturing facilities, reducing dependency on any single region. The regional factory presence is linked to tailored mitigation strategies—like localized disaster management plans and regional supply networks—that help ensure continued supply despite regional disturbances.\n\n### In summary:\n- **Potential impacts** include supply shortages, transportation delays, sourcing difficulties, and broader disruptions during crises.\n- **Mitigations** involve policies, disaster recovery plans, technological innovations (AI and data sharing), and diversified regional manufacturing.\n- **Regional factory distribution** supports these mitigations by enabling localized responses, reducing reliance on particular regions, and fostering supply chain resilience across diverse markets.\n\n![Supply chain resilience and regional factory distribution](image10)"}

Simultaneously, the company redeemed preferred shares totaling $1.6 billion (see text, [10]), leading to cash outflows. These activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $14.93 billion in financing activities (image3), partly offset by issuance proceeds [10], indicating active management of preferred share capital.\n\n- **Shareholders' Equity:**  \n  Shares issued increased shareholders' equity by $153 million (image4, noted as \"Issuance of American Express preferred shares\") as of December 31, 2021. The redemption of preferred shares decreased shareholders’ equity by approximately $1.6 billion, reducing total shareholders' equity (see image4, \"Redemption of American Express preferred shares\"). The net impact in 2021 was thus a decrease in shareholders' equity due to the redemption exceeding the new issuance.\n\n**In 2020:**\n\n- **Cash Flows:**  \n  The company did not issue preferred shares in 2020. Instead, it redeemed preferred shares worth $0, resulting in no cash inflow from issuance but a minus impact from redemptions if any occurred (not explicitly noted in 2020). The overall financing cash flows showed a significant outflow of $9.068 billion (image3), primarily due to share repurchases and other financing activities, with no new preferred shares issued.\n\n- **Shareholders' Equity:**  \n  The issuance of preferred shares in 2020 was minimal or absent, with shareholders’ equity being affected mainly by other activities such as share repurchases and net income. The balance sheet (image4, 2020) shows preferred shares at around $1.584 billion, indicating issuance occurred earlier, and there were no significant preferred share activities in 2020.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **2020:** No preferred share issuance, but existing preferred shares contributed around $1.58 billion to shareholders' equity, with the major cash flow impacts coming from share repurchases.\n- **2021:** The company issued new preferred shares (~$1.58 billion) increasing shareholders' equity, while redeemed preferred shares (~$1.6 billion) decreased it. Cash flows reflected these activities, with proceeds from issuance and outflows from redemptions affecting the financing cash flows.\n\n**In conclusion**, in 2021, issuance increased cash inflows and shareholders' equity, while redemption decreased both. In 2020, with no issuance and some redemptions, the impact on cash flows was mainly negative, and shareholders' equity was shaped by previous issuances and repurchases."}

The decrease in cash was driven by higher Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and reduced customer deposits, partially offset by debt issuance.  \n\n### Total Liabilities\n- **2020:** \\$191,367 million  \n- **2021:** \\$188,548 million  \n- **Change:** Decrease of **\\$2,819 million**  \n\nTotal liabilities align with the decrease in assets, mainly due to reductions in customer deposits, short-term borrowings, and other liabilities, as reflected in cash flow activities where there was a net cash outflow of \\$14,933 million in 2021, primarily driven by repayments of long-term debt, debt issuance, and payout of dividends.  \n\n### Relation to Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows\n- **Comprehensive Income:**  \n  The comprehensive income for 2021 was \\$8,010 million, which is higher than the previous year's \\$2,977 million.

The financing activities also resulted in substantial cash outflows due to debt repayments and share repurchases, which contributed to the decline in total assets and liabilities.  \n   \nIn essence, the decrease in total assets and liabilities from 2020 to 2021 was driven by cash outflows related to loans, investments, debt repayments, and share buybacks, which are financed by operational income and debt issuance. Increased comprehensive income helped mitigate some of these outflows through net income, but overall, the cash flows led to a reduction in total balances.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Total assets and liabilities decreased by \\$2.8 billion** from 2020 to 2021.\n- These changes are closely aligned with the **cash flow activities**, including repayments and share repurchases.\n- **Net income and comprehensive income** contributed to retained earnings, but the significant cash outflows in 2021 resulted in reductions in asset and liability balances, reflecting effective management of liquidity and capital."}

This indicates a rising benefit over these years, possibly due to increased share-based compensation or related tax efficiencies [1].\n- **Unearned revenue (contract liabilities)** recognized as revenue closely correlates with sales and agreements, with notable jumps in revenue recognition in 2021 ($557 million) compared to 2020 ($40 million) [2]. This signifies increased contract activity and revenue recognition over time.\n- **Licensing revenues and settlements**: The settlement with Huawei in 2020 and with Apple in 2019 led to recognized licensing revenues in those fiscal years, indicating significant one-time licensing income during those years [3].\n\n### Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities:\n- **Deregistration of deferred tax assets** related to distributed intellectual property was significant in 2021 ($2.472 billion), with no such activity in 2019 or 2020 [4]. This reflects notable tax planning and accounting actions in 2021.\n- **Benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets** was recognized in 2019 ($570 million), driven by tax elections and intra-entity transfers, but not in 2020 or 2021 [8].\n- **Tax refunds related to Korea**: In 2021, Qualcomm recorded large noncurrent assets ($1.9 billion) for refunds from prior withholding taxes, indicating significant ongoing tax-related recoveries [4].\n\n### Repatriation and Reinvested Earnings:\n- Qualcomm estimated future payments of **$1.9 billion** for a one-time repatriation tax in 2021, with current installments due in 2022, reflecting ongoing tax liabilities from prior international operations [5].\n- The company continues to assert that **$63 million of foreign earnings** are not indefinitely reinvested** as of 2021, meaning potential future tax liabilities if these earnings are repatriated [9].\n\n### Unrecognized Tax Benefits:\n- **Unrecognized tax benefits** increased from **$1.9 billion in 2020** to **$2.1 billion in 2021**, primarily due to expected refunds from Korean withholding taxes [10].\n\n### Overall Trends:\n- There has been a **general increase in certain tax benefits** (e.g., share-based award benefits, deferred tax assets in 2021).\n- Major **one-time settlement and recognition events** in 2019 (Apple settlement) and 2020 (Huawei settlement) created spikes in licensing revenue.\n- There’s a **notable rise in large tax-related asset recoveries and liabilities in 2021**, reflecting complex international tax planning, refunds, and ongoing examination risks.\n\n### Visual Data Summary:\n- **Image1 shows increasing total revenues**, which supports the increase in tax benefits (e.g., share-based awards).\n- **Image2 details the fluctuating income tax provision**, with higher expected income tax at 2021 ($2,158 million) compared to prior years.\n- **Images 3 and 4** display increasing gross revenues and recognized performance obligations, aligning with increased financial activity and complexities in tax planning.\n- **Images 5 through 8** depict the evolution and accumulation of tax benefits, deferred assets, and liabilities, highlighting the impact of tax strategies and ongoing reviews over the three years.\n\n### Conclusion:\nQualcomm’s tax provisions and related benefits have shown a trend of growth and significant fluctuations driven by major settlement events, increased share-based compensation benefits, and large recoveries and liabilities tied to international tax issues. The year 2021 marks a period of substantial tax asset recognition, refunds, and complex tax planning measures, contrasting with the more modest figures of 2019 and 2020.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:** Qualcomm experienced increasing tax benefits and complex international tax adjustments from 2019 to 2021, with notable spikes related to licensing settlements, deferred tax assets, refunds, and ongoing examination risks."}

As shown in images 2 and 7, the total WFAM AUM decreased from approximately $674.1 billion at the end of 2020 to around $174.6 billion by the end of 2021, primarily due to the sale closure. This transfer resulted in an almost $500 billion reduction in managed assets, reflecting the divestiture's substantial scale.\n\nBroadly, the sale affected the company's financial and asset profile in several ways:\n\n- **Income Impact:** \n  - From the textual data [1][2][4], gains from the sale included $269 million recognized as net gains. Although this gain contributed positively to other income, it was modest compared to the overall income landscape, which was also impacted by lower interest income, decreased asset-based fees from the sale, and unrealized losses on investments.\n  - Additionally, lower noninterest income was seen due to the disappearance of fee income previously generated by managing those assets, as reflected in the decreased income from asset management.\n\n- **Balance Sheet Effects:**\n  - As depicted in images 2 and 7, the reduction in AUM led to lower assets under management, which directly affected fee revenues derived from such assets.\n  - The sale also likely contributed to a decrease in total assets, as the transferred assets were removed from the company's balance sheet. Reserve and valuation adjustments related to the remaining investment securities and loans reflect broader market conditions and company-specific losses, like the $268 million impairment of rail cars [6].\n  - The company's overall asset composition shifted, with declines in marketable securities and managed assets, influencing key metrics such as total assets and equity securities holdings.\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, caused a considerable drop in total assets under management, which reduced fee-based income and altered the asset profile of the company's balance sheet, alongside modest gains from the transaction itself."}

The decline in net interest income alongside an increase in interest-bearing liabilities indicates that the bank earned less interest relative to what it paid out, thus narrowing the spread.\n\n### Main Contributing Factors:\n**1. Lower Interest Rates:**  \nBoth the quotes and the text mention lower rates during 2020, which reduced the yield on assets, especially evident in the decrease of gross interest yield from 10.76% in 2019 to 10.27% in 2020 (image4) and the decline in net interest yield from 2.40% to 1.69% (image8).\n\n**2. Changes in Asset Composition:**  \n- The increase in total assets (from \\$839,629 million in 2019 to \\$939,629 million in 2020, from image7) implies more assets, but these may be earning at lower rates due to the interest rate environment.\n- The deployment of excess deposits into securities and the lower yield on these securities further compressed yields.\n\n**3. Reduced Interest Income Relative to Expenses:**  \n- While interest expenses decreased (from \\$16,904 million in 2019 to \\$13,739 million in 2020, image7), they did not decline as much proportionally as net interest income, contributing to the narrower spread.\n- The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, as mentioned in the quotes, along with a shift that increased assets with lower yields.\n\n### Summary:\nThe decrease in net interest income from 2019 to 2020, combined with an increase in interest-bearing liabilities, led to a narrowing of the net interest spread from 2.03% to 1.75%. This change was mainly driven by lower market interest rates, reduced yields on assets, and the deployment of deposits into securities with lower returns, all reflecting the challenging interest rate environment of 2020.\n\n**In brief:**  \nThe decline in net interest income, against increased interest-bearing liabilities, caused the spread to narrow significantly mainly due to lower interest rates and lower yields on assets in 2020."}

The S&P 500 index also increased from $100 in 2015 to $203.12 in 2020, but with more variability, especially a dip in 2018 before rising again. This signifies that while both saw growth, Amgen’s stock performance outpaced the index’s growth in absolute terms, particularly after 2018.\n\nRegarding stock return trends, the performance graph indicates that Amgen’s stock value generally grew over the period, but with some years of slower or negative growth in 2016 and 2018, reflecting market variability. Notably, the index showed steadier growth, particularly from 2018 to 2020, though less steep than Amgen’s increase after 2018.\n\nIn terms of stock repurchase activities, Amgen showed substantial repurchase commitments throughout this period.

This distribution reduces retained earnings and overall equity, as reflected in the equity statement, where dividends paid are deducted from retained earnings, leading to a decrease in total stockholders’ equity. The equity account shows a slight decrease in net equity from approximately **$139.9 billion** at the end of 2020 to **$139.94 billion** at the end of 2021 (see Image 8).  \n\n- **Treasury Stock Transactions:**  \n  Chevron repurchased treasury shares worth about **$1.383 billion** in 2021, as indicated by the net purchases under treasury share activity (see Image 6). This share repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding (from roughly 2.4427 billion to 2.4427 billion shares, but with a reduction in treasury shares issued). Treasury stock transactions decrease stockholders’ equity because treasury shares are recorded as a deduction from equity (see Image 8). However, the overall equity remains positive, indicating that the repurchases, combined with dividends, caused a moderate reduction in equity but did not significantly diminish the total equity value.\n\n**Impact on Cash Flow:**\n\n- **Cash Dividends:**  \n  The dividends paid significantly impacted the company’s cash flow—outflowing about **$10.179 billion** in 2021 (see Image 6), representing cash payments to shareholders, decreasing net cash from operating activities as part of total cash used.\n\n- **Treasury Stock Purchases:**  \n  The purchase of treasury shares resulted in an outflow of **$1.383 billion** (see Image 6). This reduces cash used for investing activities and reflects a strategic move to return value to shareholders via buybacks, which also influences cash flow.\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn 2021, Chevron’s **cash dividends** decreased both cash and retained earnings, reducing overall equity, while **treasury stock buybacks** reduced outstanding shares and also decreased cash and equity. These activities together reflect a strategic focus on returning value to shareholders, impacting both Chevron’s cash reserves and its equity structure by reducing retained earnings and issued shares.\n\n**Concise answer:**  \nIn 2021, Chevron paid about **$10.179 billion** in cash dividends, decreasing cash flow and equity, while repurchasing **$1.383 billion** worth of treasury shares lowered outstanding shares and further reduced both cash and stockholders’ equity."}

Despite the challenging environment marked by lower interest rates, reduced customer activity, and increased credit losses due to the pandemic, WPB focused on supporting customers through payment holidays and maintaining branch operations.\n\nLooking at the financial data:\n\n- **From the management view (image6)**:\n  - Wealth Management's adjusted revenue was **$1,816m** in 2020, significantly lower than previous years ($2,464m in 2019 and $2,621m in 2018).\n  - Other segments within WPB, such as retail banking and global private banking, contributed further to the group's overall adjusted revenues and profits but specific breakdowns for 2020 are limited in the images.\n\n- **Regarding profit contribution**:\n  - The detailed figures show that within HSBC's diversified operations, wealth management and private banking generally contribute a substantial part of the adjusted profits. The global operations faced headwinds such as lower interest rates and higher expected credit losses, impacting profitability further.\n\n- **Insights from the overall performance**:\n  - The group's adjusted profit before tax was **$12.1 billion**, down **45%** from the previous year, as per the text ([1], [2], [9]).\n  - The pandemic’s impact caused revenue decline and increased credit losses, which significantly affected income across all segments, including WPB.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- While specific dollar figures of WPB's direct contribution to the group's adjusted profit before tax in 2020 are not explicitly detailed in the images, the overall data indicates WPB faced a challenging year with reduced revenues and profits.\n- The group's **adjusted profit before tax of $12.1 billion** reflects a substantial decline, primarily due to lower interest rates, higher credit losses, and adverse valuation movements across the banking landscape, including WPB.\n\n**Summary:**\nIn 2020, HPBC’s Wealth and Personal Banking segment faced a difficult environment marked by lower interest rates and increased credit losses. Its contribution to the group's adjusted profit before tax was likely proportionately less compared to prior periods, aligning with the overall 45% decline in profit, highlighting the pandemic's adverse impact on retail and wealth management operations."}

This strategic emphasis is reflected in the data on store growth.\n\nThe store count in new territories increased markedly over this period, as evidenced by the following figures:\n\n- In **2016**, the number of stores in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Malaysia, the UK, France, and the US was relatively modest, totaling **250** stores (image8).\n- By **2020**, this number had grown to **435** stores, with notable increases in key markets like the UK (from 11 to 42 stores), the US (from 1 to 48 stores), and other regions (image8).\n\nAdditionally, the company’s strategy of exploring new markets via pilot programs and the ongoing evaluation of new territories—mentioned in [3], [11], and [12]—enabled it to scale rapidly internationally. The expansion into regions such as the US, France, and the UK demonstrates operational success, aligning with their goal to expand via \"pilot programs\" and \"capitalize on opportunities\" [3], [11].\n\nFurthermore, the focus on securing high-traffic sites (see [4]) and a homogenized store model allowed rapid, cost-efficient rollouts, exemplified by the approximately 14-day fit-out time (image4). The global store rollout, especially the penetration into mature markets like Europe and North America, contributed to the increment in store numbers.\n\n**In summary**, Lovisa's targeted international expansion strategy—leveraging regional assessments, pilot programs, and efficient store rollouts—resulted in a substantial increase in their store count across new territories, growing from 250 stores in 2016 to 435 in 2020."}

The transition date was 1 July 2019, with a *modified retrospective approach* adopted [6]. Specifically, lease liabilities at the transition were measured at the present value of remaining lease payments, resulting in the recognition of a new lease liability of approximately $143,621,000 at that date [1] (from image1).\n\nLooking at the 2020 figures, the *current lease liability* was recorded at $36,019,000, while *non-current lease liabilities* were $131,135,000, summing up to total lease liabilities of about $167,154,000 for 2020 [1]. The increase reflects the initial recognition of the lease liabilities under the new model [4].\n\nIn contrast, employee benefit liabilities show a different trend. The liability for annual leave was $2,848,000 in 2020, and for long-service leave, $837,000 [3], which are similar to the prior year's figures. The net change in employee benefit liabilities was minimal, from $4,054,000 in 2019 to $4,092,000 in 2020 [3], indicating consistent accounting of employees’ accrued benefits with no significant impact from the transition.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- *Lease liabilities increased significantly* due to initial recognition under AASB 16, totaling approximately **$167 million in 2020**, comprising lease liabilities recognized at transition and subsequent lease activity.\n  \n- *Employee benefit liabilities remained relatively stable*, with no major change attributable directly to the transition.\n\n**Therefore, the main financial impact of transitioning to AASB 16 in 2020 was an increase in lease liabilities, while employee benefit liabilities experienced little or no change.**\n\n---\n\n### Visual summary\n\n![The transition increased lease liabilities substantially in 2020, reflecting the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations under AASB 16](image1)"}

Specifically, it employs a weighted formula where 50% is based on **consolidated operating income**, reflecting overall business success, and the other 50% gauges **share price volatility** over a fiscal year, indicating shareholder value performance [7, 11, 7, 13]. This dual focus ensures that executives are rewarded based on both financial health and market confidence.\n\nFurthermore, individual performance evaluations are conducted by reviewing managerial efforts aligned with corporate strategies, as per the “Toyoda” concept [11] and detailed in the remuneration policies. These assessments take into account **individual responsibilities, efforts, and achievements**, directly linking personal contributions to financial outcomes such as profits and shareholder return [1, 2, 11].\n\nThe **performance-linked remuneration** component, which forms a significant part of total compensation, is explicitly calculated based on these business and share value indicators.

These charges led to a **decrease in net income** by that amount, as they are recognized expenses reducing profitability. The restructuring expense is explicitly listed as a separate line item in the income statement, indicating it is deducted from operating profit to derive net income.\n\nIn 2019, restructuring charges were **a credit of $15 million** due to the sale of a manufacturing facility, which actually increased the operating profit by that amount, reflecting a gain from the sale [9]. Therefore, compared to 2019, the restructuring charges in 2020 had a **negative impact** on net income, decreasing it by **$25 million**, whereas in 2019, a restructuring-related entry contributed positively to profit by **$15 million** due to asset sale gains.\n\nFurthermore, the restructuring charges in 2020 are included in the \"Restructuring charges/other\" line in the income statement, directly reducing operating profit. In contrast, in 2019, they contributed positively when associated with a sale, thus improving the operating profit.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- **Timing and nature:** In 2020, restructuring charges were recognized as expenses, decreasing net income by **$25 million**. In 2019, restructuring-related gains increased operating profit by **$15 million**.\n- **Impact on operating profit:** The charges in 2020 directly lowered operating profit, whereas the 2019 restructuring activity increased it.\n- **Overall effect:** Restructuring activities shifted from enhancing profit in 2019 via sale gains to reducing profit in 2020 due to incurred charges.\n\nThis demonstrates a significant change from a positive contribution in 2019 to a deductive expense in 2020, materially affecting the company's net income and operating profit figures in those years.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved visual evidence:**\n\n![2020 restructuring charges impact](image8)  \n*Restructuring charges in 2020 reduced net income by $25 million, contrasting with a $15 million gain in 2019 that increased operating profit.*\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nRestructuring charges in 2020 decreased the company's net income and operating profit by $25 million, whereas in 2019, restructuring activities contributed positively to profits through a gain of $15 million."}

When actuarial assumptions such as discount rates change, they can significantly affect the present value of future benefits. For example, a decrease in the discount rate results in an increase in the DBO, while an increase in the discount rate reduces it [8][12].\n\nFrom the data, the effect on the DBO due to actuarial assumption changes specifics can be seen in the effect table:\n- A **decrease in discount rate** of 271 basis points (from 2020 to 2021) led to an **increase of €242 million** in the DBO.\n- An **increase in discount rate** of 271 basis points caused a **decrease of €271 million** in the DBO.\n- Changes in compensation increases and pension progression also impacted the obligation; for example, a €16 million increase due to higher compensation assumptions, and a €158 million increase related to pension progression [7][12].\n\nRegarding plan assets, these are subject to market conditions and assumptions about future asset returns. The impact included a **decline of €26 million** due to changes in financial assumptions, indicating that market and assumption adjustments can decrease the value of plan assets [4][8][10].\n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions from 2020 to 2021:\n- Caused the DBO to **increase or decrease** significantly depending on assumption direction; specifically, a decrease in discount rate increased the obligation by €242 million [7][12].\n- Led to a **decrease in plan assets** by about €26 million due to financial assumptions adjustments, reflecting market and valuation effect variations [4][8][10].\n\n### In conclusion:\nChanges in actuarial assumptions significantly increased the defined benefit obligation (by approximately €242 million when the discount rate decreased) and decreased plan assets (by around €26 million) from 2020 to 2021."}

Their strategy emphasizes an opportunistic and nimble approach, assessing regional conditions and expanding or deferring market entry as appropriate [12].\n\nOver the years, their focus has shifted towards actively opening new stores in existing markets and exploring new territories through pilot programs, with a goal to scale in promising regions. This is reflected in the successful establishment of stores outside Australia, including the UK, France, and the US, with some countries like the USA experiencing a significant increase in store count from 1 in 2018 to 48 in 2020 [1, 9].\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n- Rapid international growth with the establishment of stores in numerous countries; for example, the US grew from 1 store in 2018 to 48 in 2020 [1, 9].\n- Net 47 stores opened outside Australia during 2020, including 4 in the UK, 13 in France, and 29 in the US, reflecting successful market entries [11].\n- Cultivated a flexible entry approach, entering markets with smaller initial investments and scaling up as opportunities or conditions improve [12].\n- Ongoing refinement of store models focused on high pedestrian traffic locations, enabling quick store roll-outs averaging 14 days for store fit-outs [8].\n\n**Challenges Faced:**\n- Market conditions, such as the impact of COVID-19, have affected the pace of expansion, prompting the company to monitor global retail leasing environments closely [12].\n- Competition and low industry entry barriers mean maintaining unique brand positioning and identifying optimal locations remains challenging [2, 7].\n- Operating in diverse regions requires substantial local knowledge and efforts to adapt to regional preferences and logistics, which Lovisa manages through local networks and global trend analysis [6, 12].\n\n**Summary:**\nLovisa's international expansion has been dynamic and strategic, marked by increasing store footprint across multiple regions, an emphasis on prime location selection, and a flexible, opportunistic entry approach.

For example, a US$1 per tonne decline in metallurgical coal’s price could impact FY2021 profit after taxation by approximately US$35 million, underscoring how sensitive results are to price shifts [4]. The report also highlights that controllable costs, such as operational and maintenance expenses, can partly offset adverse price impacts, but sustained low prices or volatility could threaten long-term asset viability.\n\n**Nickel Prices:**\nFor nickel, the report states that FY2021 saw an increase in average realized prices to US$16,250 per tonne, driven by strong demand and supply disruptions, as well as investor sentiment [6]. Higher nickel prices contributed to revenue growth, and underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million, mainly due to higher prices and volumes, along with lower maintenance and contractor costs, which amplified profit margins [9].\n\n### Key Drivers Behind the Impacts:\n1. **Market Price Volatility:** Both commodities are subject to high fluctuations driven by global economic, geopolitical, and supply-demand factors such as inventory levels, technological changes, tariffs, and exchange rates [4], [5].\n\n2. **Global Economic and Demand Trends:** Strong end-use demand for nickel and favorable market conditions led to price surges, boosting revenues, whereas declines in prices (e.g., metallurgical coal) negatively affected results.\n\n3. **Operational Cost Management:** Cost reduction initiatives and efficiency improvements can partly mitigate adverse price impacts, though they are limited by external factors like diesel prices and stripping requirements [3], [9].\n\n4. **Foreign Exchange Rates:** Currency fluctuations impact realized prices and costs, influencing margins and profitability [5].\n\n5. **Product Substitution and Technological Change:** Shifts towards alternative materials or technological advances can affect long-term demand and prices, introducing additional volatility risks.\n\nIn summary, commodity price fluctuations directly influence BHP's revenues and profitability, with strong demand or supply disruptions driving price increases (benefiting nickel), and declines leading to adverse effects. Effectively managing operational costs and understanding market drivers are crucial in mitigating these impacts.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Visual Summary:**\n\n![Impact of commodity prices on BHP's profit after tax for oil, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, energy coal, and nickel](image5)  \n*This table illustrates how changes in commodity prices directly impact BHP’s profit after tax, with a US$1 per tonne change in metallurgical coal and iron ore having particularly significant effects.*"}

This was achieved through multiple capital increases, notably in March 2021, where 53 million new shares were issued, increasing the capital by €53 million [11, 12].\n\n2. **Capital Reserve**:\n   - Rose substantially from approximately €13,476 million on October 1, 2019, to €15,818 million on September 30, 2021. This increase was largely due to the capital increase in March 2021 and the capital reserve adjustments following the acquisition of Varian [8].\n\n3. **Retained Earnings**:\n   - Grew from about €1,423 million on October 1, 2019, to a negative €300 million on September 30, 2021. The negative retained earnings in 2021 reflect the impact of dividends and other adjustments but overall, the total equity increased significantly mainly due to capital increases and net income [11, 12].\n\n4. **Other Components of Equity**:\n   - Other components, including currency translation differences, reserve of instruments, and revaluation effects, experienced fluctuations but contributed to overall equity growth. Notably, the reserves of equity instruments increased, and currency translation differences impacted the equity components [6, 7, 9, 10].\n\n5. **Total Equity**:\n   - Increased from €12,511 million on October 1, 2019, to €16,339 million on September 30, 2021. This growth is primarily attributable to capital increases, net income, and changes in reserves, offsetting dividends and other deductions [11, 12].\n\n6. **Shareholder Equity Percentage (Equity Ratio)**:\n   - Declined from 76% in 2020 to 55% in 2021, mainly due to increased loan liabilities which offset the equity increase resulting from capital increases and net income [7].\n\n### Visual Summary (Key Numbers):\n\n| Component | 01-Oct-2019 | 30-Sep-2021 | Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Issued Capital (€ million) | 1,000 | 1,128 | +128 |\n| Capital Reserve (€ million) | ~13,476 | 15,818 | +2,342 |\n| Retained Earnings (€ million) | ~1,423 | -300 | Decrease of ~1,723 (net effect of net income and dividends) |\n| Total Equity (€ million) | 12,511 | 16,339 | +3,828 |\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe main drivers of the significant change in Siemens Healthineers' equity between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2021, are **capital increases (notably in March 2021), net income growth, and reserve adjustments**.

This reflects issuance of the **Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock** as part of financing activities, which contributed directly to increases in stockholders’ equity by adding a significant preferred equity component.\n\n**Secondly, the cash flows from financing activities** influenced overall equity as follows:\n- In 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $16.6 billion, largely driven by proceeds from stock issuance, debt, and other financing.\n- In 2019, this decreased to $1.6 billion, mostly from issuance of preferred stock and debt, with a small overall impact on equity.\n- In 2020, net cash from financing activities was $1.0 billion, mainly reflecting proceeds from the issuance of common stock and preferred stock, but much lower than prior years.\n\n**Impact on total stockholders’ equity:**\n- In 2018, total equity was approximately **$25,162 million**.\n- In 2019, total equity increased to **$30,271 million**.\n- By 2020, total equity further increased to **$39,777 million**.\n\nThe issuance of preferred stock provided a substantial inflow of equity capital, contributing to the growth in total stockholders’ equity.

This uptick was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables, which enhanced cash inflows from core operations and demonstrates a stronger operational cash-generating capability during 2020.\n\nIn terms of **investing activities**, IBM experienced a **decrease** of **$23,908 million** in cash outflows, shrinking from an outflow of $26,936 million in 2019 to only $3,028 million in 2020 [1, Image1]. The substantial decline is largely attributed to the previous year's large expenditure on acquisitions, notably the Red Hat acquisition, as well as the wind-down of OEM IT commercial financing operations. This reduction in investing outflows indicates a strategic pause or slowdown in capital investments, thereby conserving cash.\n\nRegarding **financing activities**, IBM's cash flows **turned negative** from a **net source of $9,042 million** in 2019 to a **net use of $9,721 million** in 2020 [1, Image1], reflecting a shift of approximately **$18,763 million**. The primary drivers include debt repayments (early retirements and maturities totaling $11,267 million that were offset partially by new issuances of nearly $8,982 million) and dividend payments totaling $5,797 million [3, Image2, 11]. This pattern suggests a reduced reliance on external financing and a focus on debt reduction or return of capital to shareholders.\n\n**Impact on overall cash flow**:\n- The increased cash from operational activities strengthened IBM’s liquidity and operational resilience.\n- The sharp reduction in investing outflows indicates a strategic shift to preserve cash, possibly in response to economic uncertainties or to fund future investments internally.\n- The shift to net cash outflows from financing activities signifies efforts to deleverage, cut debt, and return value to shareholders, impacting liquidity but potentially improving financial stability.\n\n**In summary**, enhanced operating cash flows, decreased capital expenditure, and active debt management collectively improved IBM’s cash position, enabling stronger liquidity and flexibility in 2020 despite the challenging external environment.\n\n---\n**References:**\n- [1] Various textual quotes\n- [Image1] Operating cash flows increased; investing cash flows decreased; financing cash flows shifted from being sources to uses."}

This strategic expansion likely contributed to increased store numbers in regions like the Americas and Rest of Europe.\n\n2. **Store Closures and Streamlining:**  \n   During 2020 and 2021, Inditex absorbed stores actively to optimize its portfolio, especially stores at the end of their useful life, particularly in younger formats ([12]). The streamlining plan aimed at store closures in less profitable locations, which could have affected certain markets’ store counts, especially in areas impacted heavily by the pandemic or with declining sales.\n\n3. **Impact of the Pandemic:**  \n   The pandemic heavily disrupted operations in 2020, with store closures and restrictions leading to a significant impact on store counts and geographical distribution ([11]). As markets recovered in 2022, there was an opportunity for strategic reopening and expansion, contributing to the growth in total store number.\n\n4. **Market-specific Factors:**  \n   The removal or addition of stores in markets like Russia and Ukraine could be influenced by local economic, political, or lease considerations, especially since all stores in these countries are operated under lease ([9], [10]). External factors such as geopolitical tensions or economic sanctions might also influence store decisions.\n\n**Visualized Data:**\n\n![Summary of store distribution changes from 2021 to 2022](image8)  \n*This chart shows the overall store counts in Spain, Rest of Europe, Americas, and Rest of the World across both years, highlighting regional growth.*\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nFrom 2021 to 2022, Inditex’s store distribution expanded, particularly in mature markets, driven by new openings and strategic store optimizations, while pandemic-related disruptions and lease considerations impacted specific territories temporarily.

This indicates a substantial rise of €13,009 million.\n- The reason for this increase is primarily due to the payout for the acquisition of Varian, as explicitly mentioned in the text [6], where it states that cash outflows from investing activities went up by €12,228 million to €14,140 million, mainly for the acquisition of Varian.\n- The text [6] also highlights additional investments for capacity expansions and purchases of intangible assets.\n\n**Image evidence:**\n\n- In image7 (cash flow statement), the actual figures are:\n  - 2020: €–1,000 million (cash outflow)\n  - 2021: €–14,009 million (cash outflow)\n  \nThis confirms that cash outflows from investing activities increased dramatically from 2020 to 2021.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCash flows from investing activities increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly due to the acquisition of Varian and higher investments for capacity expansion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n**The cash flows from investing activities increased markedly from €1,000 million in 2020 to €14,009 million in 2021, primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian and expansion investments.**"}

This was noted as a key reason for the lower interest income in 2021 [5][8][10].\n\n2. **Higher paydown rates:**  \n   Customers paying down their revolving balances faster reduced the interest earned, directly impacting the interest yield [5].\n\n3. **Interest rate environment:**  \n   The environment of changing market rates affects yields. The reports mention that a 100 basis point increase or decrease could affect net interest income, indicating sensitivities to interest rate fluctuations [7].\n\n4. **Loan balance dynamics:**  \n   The **outstanding loan balances increased** slightly, but the **interest earned per dollar declined** because of the higher paydown speeds, which led to lower yields on the loans [2][8].\n\n### Summary:\nThe net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased from 11.3% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2021 mainly due to **faster paydowns of loans**, which reduced interest earnings, coupled with interest rate environment sensitivities and changes in loan balances.\n\n---\n\n![Summary of interest yield changes and influencing factors](image2)  \n*This image summarizes the interest yield trends and factors affecting it over 2019-2021.*"}

This drop was driven by lower unit demand and reduced net selling prices, partly offset by favorable sales deductions and inventory changes [4].  \n- Market share decline has contributed to ongoing sales challenges, compounded by reduced demand in the rheumatology market due to COVID-19, affecting sales early in 2021 [4].  \n- The competitive landscape also worsened with the approval of biosimilar versions, leading to patent litigations and imminent biosimilar entries [9].\n\n**Prolia:**  \n- Sales increased from $1,772 million in 2019 to $1,830 million in 2020, a 3% rise [2, 12], primarily due to higher unit demand and an increased net selling price [2], although pandemic-related impacts also influenced demand patterns.  \n- The pandemic disrupted inpatient visits, affecting demand and slowing growth, but overall, sales still showed growth driven by demand factors [11].\n\n**Contributing Factors:**  \n- For ENBREL, decreasing sales stem from market share loss to biosimilars, lower demand, and pricing pressures [4, 9].  \n- For Prolia, sales growth was influenced by higher demand and pricing, despite pandemic-related changes [2, 11].  \n- External factors like biosimilar competition and COVID-19 have broadly impacted demand, especially for sensitive biologics, leading to shifts in sales trends.\n\nIn summary, ENBREL's sales declined due to competitive pressures and demand reductions, while Prolia's sales grew owing to demand and pricing increases, with external factors like COVID-19 impacting both.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\n\n- ENBREL: Slight decline driven by demand and market share loss, intensified by biosimilar competition.\n- Prolia: Moderate increase driven by higher demand and prices, with some pandemic-related demand impact."}

Specifically, the revenue increase of US\\$17.9 billion (from US\\$42.9 billion in 2020 to US\\$60.8 billion in 2021) was mainly due to these higher prices, which positively impacted the underlying EBITDA by US\\$12.1 billion [9].\n\nRegarding volumes, record levels at WAIO (Western Australia Iron Ore) and the highest annual production at Olympic Dam, along with increased copper and nickel volumes, further supported EBITDA growth. For example, the increase in iron ore revenue by US\\$13.7 billion reflected higher production and prices, with higher volumes adding US\\$148 million to EBITDA [8]. Similarly, the cumulative effect of record volumes and higher realised prices at various assets boosted underlying EBITDA by approximately US\\$11.7 billion, as seen in the iron ore segment, including favourable price impacts and higher production volumes [8].\n\nConversely, some volume declines or adverse weather impacts marginally offset gains from higher prices. For example, lower grades at Escondida and Spence, the natural decline in Petroleum, and weather-related disruptions partially offset the positive effects of higher prices [9]. Also, unfavourable foreign exchange impacts and weather events negatively affected the net contribution of volume and price changes to EBITDA.\n\nIn summary, the upward movement in sales prices was a dominant driver of EBITDA growth, with higher volumes also positively affecting segments like iron ore and copper. The combined effects resulted in a roughly US\\$11.7 billion increase in underlying EBITDA, primarily fueled by higher commodity prices, while some volume reductions slightly offset these gains.\n\n---\n\n**Interleaved Summary with Evidence:**\n\n- Higher realised prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, and natural gas significantly increased revenue and contributed US\\$12.1 billion to EBITDA [9].\n\n- Record production volumes at WAIO and Olympic Dam, along with increased copper and nickel volumes, further supported EBITDA growth, with volume effects adding around US\\$148 million at iron ore alone [8].\n\n- Despite higher prices, some volume declines—like grade declines at Escondida and Spence and lower Petroleum production—partially offset EBITDA gains [9].\n\n- Overall, the combined impact of increased prices and volumes led to a notable increase in underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021, emphasizing the importance of commodity price rises and volume expansion in driving profitability.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nBoth increases in sales prices and volumes in 2021 significantly boosted Underlying EBITDA compared to 2020, with higher prices being the primary driver, complemented by volume growth in key assets."}

Equity Security Valuations:**\n\n- The **marketable equity securities** were valued at **$682 million** at September 26, 2021, compared to**$607 million** at September 27, 2020 (text [10]), reflecting an increase of **$75 million**.\n\n**3. Fair Value of Debt and Other Instruments:**\n\n- The **aggregate fair value of debt notes** was approximately **$17.0 billion** at September 26, 2021, higher than the total notes outstanding of **$15.5 billion** (text [7]), suggesting a change in the fair value of debt instruments over the period.\n\n**4. Overall Derivative and Hedging Instruments:**\n\n- The fair value of derivatives used for hedging, including foreign currency and interest rate derivatives, decreased overall, with a notable reduction in foreign currency forward contract net assets from **$60 million** to **$39 million**.\n\n- The total fair values recorded in different positions (assets and liabilities) in the balance sheet indicate that derivatives and financial instruments experienced valuation changes, likely impacted by market interest rate movements, foreign exchange fluctuations, and equity market performance.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary:\n![Summary of Financial Instruments Changes](image3)  \n*The fair value hierarchy and the inventory of derivatives suggest a slight overall decrease in derivative asset values but an increase in equity securities and debt fair values.*\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBetween September 27, 2020, and September 26, 2021, the company's financial instruments experienced predominantly positive valuation changes in equity securities and debt fair value, whereas derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps showed reductions in fair value assets. The net effect reflects market movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices, leading to a mixture of gains and losses across these instruments.\n\n**In summary:**  \n*The value of the company's financial instruments increased overall due to higher equity valuations and debt fair value, but derivative asset values declined, reflecting market movement impacts during this period.*"}

This was likely influenced by the sale of the Destiny publishing rights to Bungie in December 2018, leading to a decrease in ongoing development expenses.\n- **Cost reductions driven by overall lower development activity** during this period, which may overlap with the lower revenues and sales declines from franchise titles, as seen in the detailed revenue and expense reports [11], [12].\n\nAdditionally, the increase in capitalization of development costs by $25 million in 2019, primarily driven by Blizzard's game development cycles [3], suggests a shift in accounting strategy rather than a direct expense reduction.\n\n**In summary**, the primary factors were a decrease in costs related to the Destiny franchise, driven by the sale of rights and lower development activities, complemented by strategic capitalization adjustments.\n\n---\n\nHere's a visual summary of the expense reduction:\n\n![Restructuring and related costs](image2)  \n*Image shows a $122 million decrease in restructuring and related costs, distributed among various expense categories, including product development.*"}

Although there is a slight decrease in total equity, the differences are nuanced when considering retained earnings and comprehensive income components.\n\n- **Retained earnings** grew from **$13,837 million in 2020** to **$13,474 million in 2021** (see images 3 and 6). This decrease in retained earnings indicates the company paid dividends or experienced net income impacts, but overall, retained earnings still represent a significant portion of equity.\n\n- **Other comprehensive income (loss)** shifted from a **loss of $2,895 million in 2020** to a **loss of $2,945 million in 2021**, as shown in images 3 and 6. The increased net unrealized debt securities gains (see notes in images 4 and 6) and adjustments like foreign currency translation contribute to the comprehensive income elements.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- The **net unrealized debt securities gains** were **$42 million in 2021** versus **$32 million in 2020**.\n- Foreign currency translation adjustments, which are part of other comprehensive income, showed a **net loss of $330 million in 2021**, compared to **$381 million in 2020**.\n- Pension and postretirement benefits also impact comprehensive income, with net losses of **$184 million in 2021** versus **$236 million in 2020**.\n\n**Implication on financial position:**\n\nWhile the direct total shareholders' equity slightly decreased, the components reveal that the company's retained earnings, despite dividends paid, maintained substantial value, indicating ongoing profitability. However, the increase in other comprehensive income losses somewhat offset these gains, reflecting adverse effects from unrealized investment and translation losses.\n\nIn summary, the company's **financial position saw slight erosion in total equity**, primarily due to increased comprehensive income losses — especially from unrealized debt securities and foreign currency translation — even though retained earnings remained relatively stable.

This year experienced a **mark-to-market loss** of **$468 million**, primarily due to lower discount rates, which increased the benefit obligation. Despite this, the net benefit remained positive, indicating higher benefits recognized.\n  \n- In **2020**, the net benefit **decreased** to **$239 million**, with a **net MTM gain** of **$383 million**, mainly from higher discount rates and better actual returns on plan assets. The MTM gain offset some of the benefit costs, reducing the net benefit.\n  \n- In **2021**, the net benefit further **declined sharply to a loss of $1,122 million**, coinciding with a **mark-to-market loss** of **$833 million**.

The third graph confirms a continuous decline from about 38 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2012, likely reflecting broader market saturation or competition.\n\n- **XL**: XL's subscriber base was approximately 58.3 million in 2013 (Image 2). The next graph indicates a decreasing trend from around 36 million in 2009 to approximately 30 million in 2012, implying a decline in subscriber numbers.\n\n- **Indosat**: Had about 54.2 million subscribers in 2013 (Image 2), with a downward trend visible in the third graph, decreasing from approximately 35.4 million in 2010 to about 29 million in 2012.\n\nRegarding data user numbers:\n\n- **Telkomsel**: In late 2014, the number of data users stood at about 68.5 million (Image 2), compared to roughly 60.5 million in the first quarter of 2013.

Similarly, **Image3** highlights that only **38%** of third or higher-generation Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected to their ancestral origins, compared to **53%** among adults 18+ and **34%** among those younger than 18.\n\nThis pattern suggests that as generations progress, Hispanics are less likely to report strong ties to their ancestral cultures, which is reinforced by the declining percentages of heritage-related behaviors—such as attending cultural celebrations during childhood (**Image5**, 35% for third or higher-generation vs. 49% for second-generation). Additionally, the decrease in family language and cultural practices likely contributes to this decline.\n\nIn contrast, non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry (as shown in **Image6** and **Image8**) tend to identify less strongly as Hispanic or retain fewer cultural markers. For example, only **15%** of self-identified non-Hispanics say they speak Spanish, and just **9%** identify as American, compared to over **90%** of third-generation Hispanics who. This indicates that as the Hispanic heritage becomes more distant across generations, the likelihood of self-identification as Hispanic or maintaining cultural elements decreases significantly.\n\nFurthermore, **Image2** and **Image4** showcase that cultural markers such as neighborhood composition, linguistic cues, and family traditions diminish over generations, reinforcing the idea that heritage identification becomes less salient with each succeeding generation.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Heritage identification is strongest among first-generation immigrants, with nearly all identifying as Hispanic and maintaining close cultural ties.\n- Second-generation Hispanics still largely identify as Hispanic, but with some decline in cultural connectedness.\n- By the third or higher generation, cultural ties to Hispanic origins weaken considerably, leading to a significant reduction in heritage identification and cultural practices.\n- Non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are even less likely to identify strongly as Hispanic or to maintain cultural customs, reflecting assimilation and cultural dilution over generations.\n\n**Overall, the data illustrates how heritage identification wanes across generations, with a clear decline in cultural affinity, practices, and self-identification as Hispanic as one moves further from immigrant roots.**"}

In 1870, the population was very small at only 130 residents, but by 1890, it peaked at approximately 14,096 residents, as documented in the census data [2] and illustrated on the map showing the county. This explosive increase was driven by the influx of pioneers and the influence of policies like the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered 160 acres of land to settlers, prompting large migrations to Nebraska, particularly to Hamilton County [5].\n\nThe establishment of railroads, notably the Union Pacific, also transformed Nebraska from a sparsely populated frontier into a thriving agricultural region, attracting farmers and their families [5]. The building of rural churches, schools, and communities like Aurora, alongside the development of farm consolidation and mechanization, shaped the county's demographic shifts. As farming methods modernized, farm sizes increased and the number of farms declined, leading to rural depopulation outside towns, although towns like Aurora experienced population stabilization or growth in certain periods [6, 8].\n\nBy the 2000 census, the population had decreased from its peak but remained significant at around 9,403 residents, indicating a decline from 1890 but relative stability compared to the early decades, influenced by shifts in agriculture, transportation, and economic opportunities. Migration patterns changed as towns dependent on railroads declined and farm consolidation continued, which contributed to urbanization and population shifts away from rural areas.\n\n**In summary:**\n- From 1870 to 1890, the population surged sharply due to land policies and railroad development.\n- Post-1890, the population gradually declined as agricultural practices modernized, farms consolidated, and rural areas became less populated.\n- Town populations, including Aurora, showed resilience with some growth, despite overall rural decline.\n- Major historical influences include the Homestead Act, construction of railroads, agricultural mechanization, and economic shifts affecting rural demographics.\n\nThis reflects a common pattern in the Midwest, where population booms followed by stabilization or decline have resulted from key economic and technological changes over the century."}

According to the data [1], streams are composed of approximately 70% catalog content overall, but specific details about the exact catalog share for each genre are illustrated in the visual data.\n\nLooking closely at the charts, especially the third image, we observe that Rock music has a higher percentage of album sales (37%) compared to its streaming streams, which are heavily dominated by streams (most likely including a significant catalog component) at around 70% as indicated by the high streams percentage (81% of country fans spend more on streaming, which includes catalog content). In contrast, Pop music's streaming activity shows a lower proportion of catalog content relative to its total streams, with a significant portion coming from current releases.\n\nThis suggests that Rock relies more on catalog content in streaming, emphasizing its strong historical catalog's role in the genre's streaming market. Conversely, Pop seems to have a relatively larger share of current content in streams, indicating a market driven more by newer releases.\n\nIn summary, the higher catalog share in Rock streaming indicates a market with a strong emphasis on legacy artists and classic albums, while Pop's lower catalog share reflects a dynamic market focused more on current releases. This highlights how different genres balance between catalog and current content, influencing their distinct market strategies and consumer engagement patterns."}

Moreover, a larger proportion of Black STEM workers (62%) say they face discrimination compared to other groups such as Asians (44%) and Hispanics (42%) [7].\n\nThe interrelated data from the images further underscores these disparities.

For example, [2] mentions gains of approximately 3 BLEU points for higher-resource language pairs, but up to 11 points for low-resource pair G L, highlighting more substantial benefits in resource-scarce scenarios. Similarly, the images (particularly image7) show that pre-training enhances BLEU scores across different language pairs with varying initial performance.\n\n- **Language similarity and resource level:** The data suggests that pre-training is especially beneficial when the baseline performance is moderate (e.g., BLEU scores around 3-4), as indicated in [11]. Also, more similar language pairs (like G L /P T) tend to see larger gains, but the difference is nuanced, and in some cases, very dissimilar language pairs also benefit significantly.\n\n- **Effect of data size:** When training data size decreases, pre-training becomes even more crucial. The controlled experiment shown in images (specifically image7's lower plot) indicates that with smaller training sets, pre-training helps stabilize and improve BLEU scores, especially for low-resource languages like R U and T R.\n\n- **Alignment of embeddings:** The text [10] points out that aligning embeddings between languages can further improve BLEU scores, especially for multilingual models sharing an encoder or decoder, demonstrating that pre-training coupled with alignment optimizes transfer across language pairs.\n\n### In summary:\nPre-training generally boosts BLEU scores for all language pairs examined, with larger relative gains observed for less-resourceful and more dissimilar pairs.

This attention is straightforward, directly linking encoder states to the decoder's current step, and is specific to this single task.\n\nIn contrast, the **multitask model (Figure 1b)** shares the encoder across two output sequences, but maintains separate decoders and their own attention mechanisms for each task.

The blue line (\"With Coref.\") remains above the red line (\"Without Coref.\"), indicating that coreference information boosts recall significantly, while precision remains high (above 84%) in both scenarios.  \n- The text ([8]) confirms this, stating that propagating coreference links \"significantly improve the quality of the automatic constructed knowledge graph,\" and the system with coreference links has **higher recall**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Task | SciIE Performance (F1) | Compared to Previous Models | Effect of Coreference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Entity Recognition | 68.1 | Outperforms previous state-of-the-art (66.7) | Enhances entity boundary detection and overall accuracy |\n| Relation Extraction | 39.5 | Higher than prior models (~33.9) | Improves relation clustering and extraction |  \n| Coreference Resolution | 58.0 | Better than earlier methods (~54.8) | Significantly increases recall, enriching knowledge graphs |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe SciIE model outperforms previous systems across all key tasks, especially benefiting from coreference links, which substantially improve recall and the coherence of extracted information.

This indicates that SenseBERT's incorporation of lexical semantic information enhances its capability for word sense disambiguation even without fine-tuning.\n\nNext, focusing on the semantic sense disambiguation and lexical tasks, the trend is that SenseBERT demonstrates a consistent improvement over vanilla BERT. Particularly in the Word in Context (WiC) task (images 3 and 4), SenseBERT_BASE surpasses BERT_BASE notably (72.1 vs. 69.6 in image3), demonstrating its superior ability to understand lexical semantics in context, even in zero-shot scenarios (frozen embeddings). The state-of-the-art performance of SenseBERT LARGE on WiC further underscores this trend.\n\nIn terms of performance on the GLUE benchmark (images 5 and 8), which evaluates more general linguistic and reasoning skills, the scores are very comparable: SenseBERT_BASE achieves 77.9, close to BERT_BASE's 77.5, indicating that SenseBERT maintains competitive performance on broader NLP tasks while gaining semantic enhancements. The results in Table 4 (images 5 and 8) reinforce this, showing that pre-training with lexical semantic signals doesn't compromise BERT's general language understanding ability.\n\nA key observed trend is that **SenseBERT predominantly excels in lexical and sense-disambiguation tasks**, which directly benefit from its sense-aware training. In contrast, its performance on more diverse or reasoning-based tasks remains on par with vanilla BERT, suggesting that the improvements are semantically targeted rather than broad-spectrum.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- **SenseBERT_BASE consistently outperforms BERT_BASE in lexical-semantic tasks such as supersense disambiguation and Word in Context.**\n- The improvement is especially pronounced in zero-shot or frozen embedding settings, indicating that semantic information is more readily accessible.\n- On broader NLP benchmarks like GLUE, the performance remains comparable, showing that lexical enhancements do not detract from overall language understanding.\n  \nThis illustrates that the primary trend with SenseBERT is an enhanced ability to capture lexical semantics without sacrificing the versatility and general performance of traditional BERT, particularly benefiting tasks requiring fine-grained semantic understanding."}

It operates layer-by-layer, starting from the root and moving down to the leaves, progressively narrowing down the search to finer details. This method allows precise control over the breadth and specificity of the retrieved information by adjusting parameters like depth ($d$) and the number of nodes ($k$) at each level [9], [8], [3].\n\nIn contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval simplifies this process by flattening the multi-layered hierarchy into a single, unified layer, where all nodes are evaluated collectively. This approach evaluates all nodes simultaneously rather than layer-by-layer, enabling the retrieval of information at the appropriate level of detail without the need for iterative pruning [10], [11]. It offers greater flexibility in capturing relevant information across different hierarchical levels since it considers the entire structure at once [4].\n\n**In summary**:\n- **Tree Traversal Retrieval** proceeds hierarchically, selecting relevant nodes layer-by-layer, providing targeted, granular retrieval.\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** flattens the hierarchy, evaluating all nodes simultaneously, thus offering a more flexible and holistic retrieval across multiple abstraction levels.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Summary:\n![The diagram illustrates the structured process of Tree Traversal (layer-by-layer selection) versus Collapsed Tree (flattened, collective evaluation)]()"}

For instance, as shown in [5], the model achieves 53.12 F1 with 500 retrieved paragraphs, but this increases to 53.12 F1 when gold paragraphs are included, highlighting the importance of relevant evidence ([5], image4). Similarly, in the distractor setting, the single-paragraph BERT achieves 67.08 F1, indicating that the presence of gold evidence enables high performance ([7], image7).

Specifically, the example of phrases like “not really good” versus “really not good” illustrates how wording order influences sentiment, and that CNN and LSTM are better at recognizing these differences due to their architectures. The quote underscores that *word-order patterns are crucial* for sentiment analysis because they help differentiate nuanced meanings.\n\nAdditionally, [11] notes that word-order information does not significantly contribute to tasks like topic categorization or textual entailment but *does matter for sentiment analysis*, which is supported by Observations in [7]; models that can capture this order (like LSTM) perform better in sentiment tasks. The experiments with shuffling words, discussed in [9], further demonstrate this point. When words are randomly shuffled during training, the performance of LSTM drops, indicating that *word order is essential* for accurate sentiment prediction.\n\nThe accompanying images reinforce these ideas:\n- **Image 6** shows accuracy trends with subspace dimension for SWEM and CNN, illustrating that models capable of capturing word order (like CNN) tend to perform better on certain datasets, especially where nuanced word positioning impacts sentiment.\n\n**In conclusion**, word-order information significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models because it enables the models to capture the positional context necessary for nuanced sentiment detection.

This encoding is achieved through a bidirectional LSTM that captures context from both past and future words in the utterance, producing a comprehensive, contextualized embedding. Specifically, each word in the user’s utterance is first mapped into an embedding space, then sequentially processed by the forward and backward LSTMs. The final utterance vector is obtained by concatenating the last hidden states from both directions, effectively summarizing the entire utterance’s semantic and contextual information. This embedded representation is then used as input to subsequent components of the dialogue system, such as updating dialogue state and generating system responses.\n\n![The Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder processes user input into a context-aware vector for dialogue understanding](image8)"}

This step identifies key entities, facts, and rules within the problem statement, converting them into a logical format suitable for symbolic reasoning [11][12]. For example, in Figure 3, the problem of determining whether \"Black Mirror\" is popular is translated into a set of predicates and logical formulas.\n\nNext, in the **Symbolic Reasoning** stage, a deterministic symbolic solver—like a logic prover or constraint optimizer—performs inference on the formulated symbolic problem. It applies logical rules and rules of inference to reach a conclusion, which might involve checking logical validity or satisfiability. As exemplified in Figure 3, the symbolic reasoner computes an answer by evaluating the logical formulas and constraints, such as whether \"Black Mirror\" is popular based on the formalized facts and rules.\n\nFinally, in the **Result Interpretation** phase, another module interprets the output from the symbolic solver and maps it back into natural language or a final answer. This step ensures the result is understandable and relevant to the original question. In Figure 3, the answer \"B\" is derived and presented as the final solution.\n\nThroughout this process, **self-refinement** can be employed, where error messages from the symbolic solver are used to iteratively improve the symbolic formulation, enhancing fidelity and correctness [12].\n\n**In summary**, LOGIC-LM combines natural language understanding, formal symbolic formulation, deterministic logical inference, and result interpretation to solve problems systematically, reliably, and transparently.\n\n---\n\n**Visual summary:**\n\n![Summary of how LOGIC-LM solves a problem using modules](https://i.imgur.com/your-image-link)  \n*(Since I can't generate new images, please imagine this as a flowchart covering Problem Formulation ➝ Symbolic Reasoning ➝ Result Interpretation, with example snippets as referenced.)*"}

Additionally, roughly 26% of samples have more than one candidate supported by documents, including the correct answer, indicating some ambiguity [9].\n- **MedHop:** The majority of samples (around 9 out of 10) have exactly 9 candidates, due to the selection process capping support documents at 64 [4].

As shown in the diagram (image3), character embeddings are processed through a Bi-LSTM to generate character-based representations, which are then concatenated with word embeddings to form comprehensive word representations. This approach enables the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words and morphological nuances that are not fully captured by word embeddings alone [6].\n\nSecondly, the word-level embeddings (e.g., from fastText or GloVe) provide contextual semantic information derived from large corpora, helping the model understand the meaning of words within sentences. The combination of these embeddings with character-level features boosts the model’s ability to recognize entities, especially in languages with rich morphology or limited data [6].\n\nFurthermore, the presence of character embeddings ensures robustness against misspellings and variations in word forms, which is critical for low-resource languages or noisy data.

Gulordava and Baroni (2011) utilized this resource to compare word meanings from the 1960s and 1990s, correlating findings with human judgments, marking an important step in quantitative diachronic analysis ([5], [12]).\n\nProgressing into 2011-2012, the focus shifted toward distributional semantic models, with the introduction of word embedding techniques such as prediction-based models like Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS). Kim et al. (2014) notably employed incremental updates of these embeddings, establishing a foundation for tracking semantic shifts in a data-driven manner ([10], [5]). This marked a departure from solely corpus-based frequency measures towards neural embedding approaches.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, datasets like the Google Books Ngrams and other temporal corpora (e.g., Twitter, Amazon reviews, NYT) were extensively employed to analyze subtle semantic changes at finer time scales, such as yearly or monthly slices ([8], [12]). Yao et al. (2018) further advanced the field with dynamic word embeddings capable of evolving over time, highlighting the importance of continuous models for diachronic analysis ([9], [12]).\n\nIn 2015, Kulkarni et al. contributed significantly with the promotional work on statistically significant detection of linguistic change, demonstrating the use of diachronic embeddings in identifying meaningful semantic shifts, and exploring the application of these shifts to real-world events like armed conflicts ([4], [8]).\n\nThroughout these years, methodological innovations such as cross-time alignment, evaluation strategies like epoch disambiguation, and the development of datasets became central themes. These milestones collectively facilitated a more robust, data-driven understanding of semantic change, culminating in sophisticated neural embedding models that could reliably trace semantic shifts at different temporal granularities by 2017 ([3], [5], [9]).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of key milestones (2010–2017):**\n\n- **2010–2011:** Adoption of large diachronic corpora (e.g., Google Ngrams) for semantic shift detection ([12]).\n- **2011–2012:** Introduction and evaluation of distributional models, including early neural approaches and word embedding techniques ([5], [10]).\n- **2014:** Use of neural embedding models like SGNS with incremental updates for diachronic analysis ([10]).\n- **2015:** Development of statistically significant detection methods and application to real-world events ([4], [8]).\n- **2016–2017:** Refinement of dynamic word embeddings, evaluation frameworks, cross-time alignment, and higher resolution temporal studies ([9], [3], [12]).\n\n---\n\n### Visual summary:\n\n![Key milestones timeline from 2010 to 2017](image1)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe primary milestones include leveraging large corpora, advancing neural embedding models, developing evaluation methods, and applying these techniques to detect meaningful semantic shifts over short time spans, especially from 2010 to 2017."}

The nucleoli, the sites of ribosome assembly, become visible again, indicating the re-establishment of nuclear functions [3][5][12]. Correspondingly, the images show the reorganization of nuclear structures; Image 2 illustrates the nuclear envelope reforming around the separated chromatids.\n\nFollowing telophase, **cytokinesis** completes the division process by physically splitting the cytoplasm into two daughter cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle from vesicles containing cell wall material, which grows outward to reach the edges, effectively dividing the cell into two [10]. In animal cells, cytokinesis involves cleavage furrow formation, which pinches the cell into two [8]. The images demonstrate this division, with one showing a cell plate formation in plant cells and others depicting cleavage furrows or the final separation.\n\nOverall, during telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear structures (nuclear envelope, nucleoli) are reassembled, and the cytoplasm is divided, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells with preserved cellular structures.\n\n**Summary**: During telophase and cytokinesis, the nuclear envelopes re-form, nucleoli reappear, and the cell divides its cytoplasm through either a cell plate in plants or a cleavage furrow in animals, culminating in two separate daughter cells with restored cellular structures.\n\n![Cell structures during telophase and cytokinesis](image2)"}

These alleles segregate during gamete formation [4], leading to combinations in the offspring.\n- In the F₂ generation, when F₁ hybrids (heterozygous Ff) are self-crossed, the alleles segregate independently into gametes [5][8]. The Punnett squares demonstrate that the combinations of alleles can produce different genotypes, such as homozygous dominant (PP), heterozygous (Pp), or homozygous recessive (pp).\n- The genotypic ratio in the F₂ progeny typically shows 1:2:1 (PP : Pp : pp), as visualized in the genetic diagrams [4][7][8], meaning one quarter homozygous dominant, half heterozygous, and one quarter homozygous recessive.\n- The phenotypic ratio reflects which genotypes produce observable traits, with the classic example being a 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers [11], which occurs because three out of four plants express the dominant phenotype (purple), while one expresses the recessive phenotype (white).\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance, through the segregation of alleles and dominance relationships, results in the observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio and the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F₂ generation of pea plants.\n\n![Explanation of Mendelian ratios in pea plants](image2)"}

Similarly, many pages have items with errors, such as article and webpage markup issues.  \n   - These errors hinder search engines' ability to accurately interpret the website structure, leading to lower chances of rich snippets, improperly indexed pages, or reduced visibility in search results.\n\n2. **Meta Description Issues**:  \n   - As illustrated in Image 3, there are instances of missing, duplicate, or overly long meta descriptions. For example, some pages have duplicate meta descriptions (e.g., 21 duplicate long meta descriptions), and others are missing title tags.  \n   - These issues can cause search engines to choose suboptimal snippets, resulting in lower click-through rates. Duplicate meta descriptions reduce the uniqueness of search listings, and missing descriptions make listings less informative, negatively impacting organic traffic.\n\n3. **Impact on SEO**:\n   - Error-laden structured markup can prevent search engines from generating rich snippets, which are critical for attracting users.  \n   - Poor meta descriptions, especially duplicates or omissions, decrease the appeal and clarity of search listings, leading to potential CTR reductions.  \n   - Together, these issues diminish rankings and organic visibility, as search engines favor well-structured data and compelling, unique meta descriptions.\n\n### Summary:\nStructured markup errors impair search engine comprehension and rich result generation, while meta description issues influence how enticing and relevant your listings appear, both leading to decreased organic performance.\n\n![Backlink discovery with increasing backlinks](image1)\n\n*Visualizes the importance of proper SEO strategies; errors in markup and descriptions hinder such growth.*"}

As noted in [4], a siloed approach—that is, a fragmented way of managing different departments—acts as the greatest barrier to adopting a customer-centric approach. This is reinforced by the data in image5, which shows that 71% of respondents often or always use basic analytics, often siloed within their organizational structures, indicating limited integration across functions.\n\nLeadership commitment is another critical factor. According to [8], strong leadership guidance is essential for fostering a process-driven, organizational, and cultural shift towards integration.\n\nFurthermore, management and cultural barriers are identified in [11], where it's emphasized that management issues, rather than data or technology, are primary obstacles. Resistance can stem from a lack of understanding or willingness to change traditional behaviors, as shown by the statement \"adoption barriers relate to management & culture, not data & technology.\"\n\nAdditionally, a lack of clear processes, roles, responsibilities, and skilled resources also impede progress ([2], [11]). In particular, a deficiency in staff training and expertise can cause difficulties in implementing integrated systems effectively.\n\nFinally, technological infrastructure issues can contribute. As noted in [2], without proper processes and resources, over-engineering solutions, and technical limitations hinder effective integration.\n\n**In summary**, the main barriers include organizational siloing, management resistance, lack of leadership commitment, insufficient processes and skills, and infrastructural challenges.

For example, the close proximity of the letters helps the viewer perceive the word as a single, unified entity [1].\n\n- **Similarity**: The letters share consistent stylistic features, such as shape and size, creating a sense of similarity and unity across the word [10].\n\n- **Continuity and Closure**: The use of lines (such as the dashed or segmented lines around the letters) guides the eye smoothly from one letter to the next, fostering a perception of continuous flow. When parts of letters or their boundaries are implied rather than explicitly drawn, our perception \"fills in\" the missing elements, exemplifying closure [3, 11].\n\nIncorporating these principles helps viewers perceive the word as a complete, meaningful whole rather than as disconnected parts, embodying the core idea of Gestalt psychology—that our perception prioritizes global regularity, unity, and simplicity.\n\n![The design of the word \"GESTALT\" showcases proximity, similarity, and closure principles, creating a cohesive visual perception](image2)"}

These staffing priorities are directly related to the expected evolution of intranet functions over the next two years, which aim to consolidate information, enhance communication, and improve data exchange capabilities within healthcare systems [5].\n\nFrom the evidence, the anticipated increase in intranet functions—such as enhanced health information exchange, expanded connectivity between laboratories, outpatient services, physicians, and public health sectors [1, 6, 8]—suggests a growing need for specialized staff to support these expanded and more integrated systems. For example, as the intranet’s role in supporting data repositories, network applications, and EMR/EHR systems grows [6], the demand for network support and system integration expertise will likely rise correspondingly.\n\nMoreover, the move toward more sophisticated systems like telemedicine, sensors, and decision support tools [6] will require additional personnel with skill sets aligned to these advanced functionalities. The anticipated activity in these areas corresponds with the existing staffing focus on technical support, application management, and infrastructure support, indicating a need to expand and adapt staffing in response to these technological developments.\n\nIn summary, as intranet functions are projected to become more comprehensive, unified, and essential for healthcare delivery [5], the current staffing needs—centered around system support, network expertise, and information exchange [3], [10]—will likely increase to support the deployment, maintenance, and enhancement of these evolving systems over the next two years."}

In image 4, the table shows that the utility from each hot dog decreases as more hot dogs are consumed: the first hot dog provides +10 utility, the second +4, the third 0, and subsequent hot dogs result in negative utility (-1, -4, -10). Conversely, image 5 illustrates that as a person eats more hot dogs, the enjoyment diminishes significantly, aligning with the decreasing utility.\n\nThis pattern indicates diminishing marginal utility, meaning that each additional hot dog yields less satisfaction than the previous one. Initially, the utility is high, encouraging consumption, but after a certain point, additional hot dogs may lead to disutility or even dissatisfaction.\n\nImplication for consumption behavior:\n- Consumers are likely to stop consuming once marginal utility becomes zero or negative.\n- They balance their intake to maximize total utility, avoiding excess that causes discomfort or negative utility.\n- This behavior reflects typical economic principles where individuals seek to optimize satisfaction and avoid diminishing or negative returns from overconsumption."}

During meiosis I, homologous chromosome pairs (tetrads) align and then segregate into two different cells, as depicted in **images 2, 3, 4, and 5**. Specifically:\n- Homologous chromosomes (each consisting of sister chromatids) are separated during **anaphase I** (shown in images 4, 7, and 8), resulting in each daughter cell receiving one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n- The process includes the formation of tetrads and crossing over, enhancing genetic variation.\n\nIn **meiosis II**, sister chromatids are separated, similar to mitosis, but occurring in haploid cells resulting from meiosis I. The key differences are:\n- **Separation of sister chromatids** occurs during **anaphase II** (visualized in images 7 and 8), which results in genetically distinct haploid cells.\n- The cells divide again through **cytokinesis**, leading to four haploid daughter cells, each carrying a single set of chromosomes, as shown in **images 2, 3, 6, and 8**.\n\n### Summary in diagrammatic terms:\n- **Meiosis I**: Homologous chromosomes separate → reduces chromosome number by half.\n- **Meiosis II**: Sister chromatids separate → similar to mitosis, but in haploid cells.\n\n**In conclusion**, meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes resulting in halving the chromosome number, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids, producing four genetically diverse haploid cells."}

Specifically, electronic medical records reached about 62% in 2006, up from 61% in 2005, and the use of digital picture archiving systems increased from 42% to 52% [7]. Other significant progress includes improved cybersecurity measures like firewalls (from 53% to 98%) and user access controls (from 53% to 88%), highlighting increased focus on security.\n\nHowever, despite these positive trends, barriers to IT implementation remain prominent. The major challenges include lack of financial support (18–20%) and staffing resources (13%), as well as technological and organizational barriers such as inadequate systems (10–14%) and insufficient clinical leadership (8–10%) [2]. These barriers hinder the full realization of IT benefits, like reducing errors, enhancing operational efficiency, and ensuring patient safety.\n\nIn summary, while healthcare organizations are progressively adopting IT applications, the pace is still impeded by persistent barriers related to resources, infrastructure, and leadership, which must be addressed to facilitate broader and more effective implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Trends:** Steady growth in EMR usage, data sharing, security infrastructure, and workflow technologies from 2005 to 2006.\n- **Comparison with Barriers:** Despite increased adoption, significant barriers—including resource limitations and systemic challenges—still hinder optimal IT implementation in healthcare."}

In 1960, this percentage was around 5.2%, and by 2007, it had risen to approximately 16%. This significant upward trajectory reflects the growing economic burden of healthcare over nearly five decades.\n\nNow, relating this trend to major events in the Space Race timeline, we observe that the Space Race, marked by advances like the Apollo missions (notably Apollo 11 in 1969), peaked with significant investment and technological progress during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The timeline exhibits periods of substantial space exploration activity and national expenditure on space technology, especially around the Apollo landings.\n\nWhile the Space Race required substantial public and private funding, its peak coincided with the period when healthcare spending was also increasing markedly. Although these are distinct domains, both trends reflect broader governmental and societal priorities towards technological innovation and infrastructure development. The increased healthcare expenditure could be partly attributed to advancements in medical technology and increased access to medical services, paralleling the technological advancements driven by initiatives like the Space Race.\n\nIn summary:\n- **1960**: Healthcare expenditure was about 5.2% of GDP, during the early Cold War era.\n- **2007**: It increased to around 16%, reflecting ongoing growth.\n- **Relation to the Space Race**: The period of intense space exploration activity in the 1960s coincided with the start of this upward trend in healthcare spending, indicating a broader context of technological investment and societal development.\n\n**In conclusion**: U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP increased significantly from 1960 to 2007, and this trend parallels the period of intense technological and exploratory effort seen in the Space Race, highlighting a broader pattern of investment in innovation during these decades."}

This is evident in standard consumption, where each additional hot dog provides less utility than the previous one; for example, the first hot dog yields +10 utility, but the sixth yields only -10 utility, showing a decline in satisfaction with increased consumption [8]. This decline reflects the typical scenario in personal consumption, where after a certain point, further intake leads to boredom or discomfort.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, such as sports or mastery, the importance of focus and practice can alter this pattern. For instance, the images and quotes about practicing sports or skills suggest that repeated practice can lead to skill accumulation, increasing long-term utility rather than decreasing it. As seen in the violinists' data, practice initially shows divergence but then benefits compound over time, making increased effort more likely to yield higher utility and mastery [6, 7].\n\nSimilarly, the quotes about focus and deliberate practice indicate that in competitive environments, repeated effort can enhance performance and utility through skill development, which contrasts with the simple decline seen in standard consumption. Instead of a decreasing utility curve, persistent effort may lead to increasing returns over time, highlighting how context changes the utility perception—diminishing in personal enjoyment but potentially increasing in competitive mastery and success.\n\n**Summary:**\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility reflects decreasing satisfaction with additional units, as illustrated by the declining utility of hot dogs consumed in larger quantities. In competitive or mastery contexts, sustained focus and practice can generate increasing utility through skill accumulation, fundamentally differing from the typical pattern of diminishing returns observed in personal consumption.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in hot dog consumption](image8)"}

By employing different elicitation techniques, teams can adapt to distributed, diverse, and complex stakeholder environments, ensuring requirements are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Interrelation and Contribution**:\n- **Needs Exploration** sets the strategic foundation by framing high-level expectations and guiding the focus for detailed elicitation.\n- **Elicitation Methods** then delve deeper, extracting precise, actionable requirements, reducing misunderstandings and ensuring stakeholder needs are fully understood.\n- Together, these processes enable agile teams to prioritize work effectively, respond to change rapidly, and deliver value aligned with stakeholder expectations, even in complex or distributed settings.\n\n**In summary**, Needs Exploration provides the initial understanding of stakeholder goals, while Elicitation Methods refine this understanding through targeted techniques. Their combined application ensures that stakeholder needs are accurately captured, well-prioritized, and effectively addressed throughout the agile project lifecycle.\n\n![Process of exploring initial stakeholder needs and detailed requirement gathering](image7)"}
