Specifically, college graduates are substantially more likely than those with high school diplomas or less to say technology has made their work more interesting (64% vs. 38%) and increased their opportunities for advancement (53% vs. 32%) [9].\n\n![College graduates report technology making their work more interesting and increasing opportunities for advancement at higher rates than those with some college or a high school diploma or less.](image1)\n\nThis educational divide extends to specific technologies. Workers with college degrees are more likely than those without to report positive impacts from tools like word processing/spreadsheet software, smartphones, email/social media, scheduling software, customer self-service technologies, and industrial robots [6]. Conversely, those lacking a college education are much less likely to hold positive views towards current workforce technologies [1, 11]. Only 38% of workers with high school diplomas or less feel technology has made their jobs more interesting, and just 32% believe it has increased their career advancement opportunities [10].\n\nDemographics also show some variation. Certain groups, notably young adults aged 18-24, report being impacted by workforce automation technologies at somewhat higher rates than the average worker [4].\n\n![Adults aged 18-24 report experiencing impacts from workforce automation at higher rates than other age groups.](image3)\n\nPerceptions of the impact of workforce automation and technology are significantly more positive among workers with higher education levels compared to those with less education, while younger adults report higher rates of impact from automation."}

Specifically, 48% of women in STEM cite discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions as a major reason, compared to 29% of men in STEM [1].\n\n![39% view discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion as a major reason for women's underrepresentation in STEM.](image1)\n\nFurthermore, many Americans attribute the underrepresentation of women in STEM to a lack of encouragement from an early age [5], a point echoed by women in STEM who emphasize the need for quality schooling and early, sustained support [7, 10]. Difficulty balancing work and family is also cited as a significant reason [3].\n\n![39% cite lack of early encouragement and 33% cite difficulty balancing work/family as major reasons for women's underrepresentation in STEM.](image1)\n\nWhile both genders value flexibility, the challenges women face, including perceived discrimination in hiring and promotion and a lack of early encouragement, are seen as significant obstacles to increasing female representation in STEM [1, 3, 5].\n\nMen in STEM value pay and promotion more, while women value helping others and making meaningful contributions more; despite both valuing flexibility, women face significant barriers like discrimination and lack of early encouragement in the STEM workforce."}

A large majority of Black individuals in STEM jobs (72%) view discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotions as a major reason, a view shared by far fewer White (27%) and Asian (28%) STEM workers [2, 10].

Examining the breakdown by the number of transactions reveals that certain categories dominate in terms of frequency. Specifically, Fashion, Footwear & Accessories lead significantly, accounting for 35% of transactions, followed by Books at 21%. Other categories like Computers, Electronics & Appliances (10%) and Mobile, Tablets & Accessories (9%) have lower transaction volumes compared to Fashion and Books.\n![Fashion, Footwear & Accessories account for the largest share (35%) of online retail transactions by number.](image8)\n\nHowever, when looking at the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) breakup, which often correlates more closely with potential gross margin contribution (though not directly stated, higher value items generally offer potential for higher absolute margins), the picture shifts.

Books, despite their high transaction volume, contribute only 7% to the total GMV.\n![Mobile/Tablets & Accessories contribute the largest share (35%) of online retail GMV.](image4)\n\nThis disparity between high transaction volume categories (like Books) and high GMV categories (like Mobiles/Electronics) has significant implications for the e-commerce supply and demand model [6].\n![The e-commerce model connects supply and demand via a platform, logistics, and payment integration, focusing on selection, experience, and pricing.](image5)\nThe model must cater to both types. High-volume, lower-value categories require efficient logistics and inventory management to handle frequency, potentially focusing on customer acquisition. High-GMV categories, while perhaps lower volume, are crucial for overall value and likely profitability. This aligns with the strategic shift noted in the industry, moving focus from pure GMV and discounting towards profitability, customer experience, and retention [1]. Managing a wide selection and ensuring a great shopping experience across diverse categories, from high-frequency fashion/books to high-value electronics, becomes critical for balancing supply and demand effectively while aiming for overall profitability [1, 12]. The expectation for an \"anywhere, anytime, any channel\" experience further complicates this, requiring seamless integration across platforms [10].\n![E-commerce occurs across multiple channels and devices.](image1)\n\nTherefore, categories with high transaction volumes (like fashion and books) drive customer engagement frequency, while categories with high GMV (like mobiles and electronics) significantly impact overall revenue and potential profitability, requiring e-commerce platforms to tailor their supply chain, marketing, and customer experience strategies accordingly."}

Within semantic errors, structural errors show the most significant increase, particularly for 4-hop claims (57%), indicating the difficulty in generating correct complex reasoning structures [11].

Textual evidence highlights that employing the RAR method leads to peak performance on APr, significantly surpassing the CLIP model, suggesting a substantial advantage for rare category recognition [5]. This enhanced ability to discriminate rare classes is attributed to the retrieving and reranking mechanism, which provides MLLMs with richer context from external memory [5].\n\nFurther testing on the V3Det dataset, known for its extensive vocabulary of 13,204 classes, also showed positive results [4].

This involves using CLIP’s inherent image-text interaction capabilities to find the top-k category names from the memory bank that have the highest similarity to the cropped and processed image region [12].\n\nOnce the top-k candidate category names are retrieved {c1, c2, ..., ck} [10], they are sent to the MLLM along with the image information via a ranking prompt [7].

While Step-Back + RAG still helps on the Multi-hop Reasoning task StrategyQA, the baseline and RAG models might already perform relatively better, leaving less room for improvement via abstraction, or the nature of multi-step reasoning benefits less from the specific abstraction used. The lower rate of introducing new errors compared to RAG alone on StrategyQA (4.4% vs 6.3% on TimeQA) is also noteworthy [9, 10].\n\nStep-Back + RAG shows a substantially higher error correction rate on the large TimeQA Knowledge QA dataset compared to the smaller StrategyQA Multi-hop Reasoning dataset, indicating its abstraction mechanism is particularly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks."}

While Focal Loss (FL) and DL performance varied, DSC consistently performed best [9].\n\n**Limitations**\nIt's important to note that dice-based losses like DSC are optimized for F1 score, not accuracy. On accuracy-oriented tasks like SST-2 and SST-5 text classification, BERT with standard Cross-Entropy (CE) outperformed variants using DL and DSC [12].\n![On accuracy-oriented SST datasets, BERT+CE performs best, while DSC shows slightly lower accuracy, confirming dice-based losses are less suited for accuracy maximization.](image7)\n\nAcross NER, MRC, and PI tasks, variants using the DSC loss consistently improve F1 scores for both BERT and XLNet models compared to baselines and other loss functions like FL and DL, demonstrating particular strength on F1-evaluated and imbalanced datasets."}

For example, the `+positive` technique aims to create a balanced dataset, `+negative` creates a more imbalanced set (e.g., 21% positive, 79% negative examples) using negative examples as templates, and `-negative` also balances the dataset but reduces its overall size [1, 5].\n\nThe impact of these augmentation techniques on BERT model performance using the QQP dataset is primarily measured using the F1 score. The results show that the effectiveness depends on the resulting balance and the training objective used:\n```markdown\n![Table 8 shows F1 scores for BERT with different objectives (Baseline, FL, DL, DSC) across original and augmented QQP datasets, demonstrating performance variations based on augmentation and objective.](image2)\n```\nSpecifically, with a standard MLE objective, `+positive` augmentation improved performance over the original dataset, while `+negative` (more imbalanced) and `-negative` (smaller dataset) led to worse results [1]. When using Dice Loss variants, DSC consistently achieved the highest F1 scores across different QQP augmentations, significantly outperforming Dice Loss (DL) on the more imbalanced `+negative` set [9]. This highlights that DSC is effective in handling the imbalance introduced or exacerbated by certain augmentation methods.\n\nAcross different NLP tasks, the measurement of this effect varies:\n\n1.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Performance is measured using Precision, Recall, and F1 score.

Textual evidence highlights that the approach outperforms CHAPLOT18, improving TC accuracy by 5% [3], and generally improves instruction execution performance significantly by decomposing goal prediction and action generation [6].\n\nQuantitative results from the held-out test dataset confirm this:\n![Test set performance shows Our Approach achieves 36.9% TC on LANI, outperforming CHAPLOT18 (31.9%) and MISRA17 (23.2%).](image8)\nSimilar trends are observed on the development set:\n![Development set performance confirms the trend with Our Approach at 35.72% TC on LANI, compared to 31.0% for CHAPLOT18 and 22.9% for MISRA17.](image7)\nDespite this improvement over other methods, there is still a significant gap compared to human performance, where humans achieve 63% TC on LANI [11].\n\n**CHAI Manipulation Accuracy (MA):**\n\nOn the CHAI task, the performance is notably weaker across all methods, especially concerning manipulation accuracy (MA) [3, 6]. While the proposed approach shows some improvement in stop distance (SD), both CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17 fail to learn effectively [3].\n\nThe MA results underscore the difficulty of the CHAI task:\n![Test set results show Our Approach achieves 39.97% MA on CHAI, only marginally better than baselines like CHAPLOT18 (39.76%) and even STOP (39.77%).](image8)\nThe development set results show a similar pattern, with the proposed approach achieving 37.53% MA, identical to the CHAPLOT18 baseline and the simple STOP baseline [3].\n![Development set results show similar poor MA performance across methods on CHAI, with Our Approach at 37.53%, the same as CHAPLOT18 and STOP.](image7)\nFurther highlighting the challenge, even when provided with perfect \"oracle\" goals, the model completely fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI [7]. This contrasts sharply with human performance, where manipulation accuracy reaches 100% [11], indicating that CHAI manipulation remains largely an open problem [11].\n\n**Insights:**\n\nThe comparison reveals that the proposed model decomposition significantly benefits navigation tasks like LANI, leading to state-of-the-art results among the compared methods. However, this approach struggles with the complexities of manipulation in the CHAI environment, where its performance on MA is comparable to simple baselines and far below human capabilities. This suggests that while goal prediction helps navigation, the action generation component, particularly for complex manipulation sequences required in CHAI, needs substantial improvement [3, 6, 7]. The large gap to human performance, especially in CHAI, indicates the inherent difficulty and ambiguity of these instruction-following tasks [6, 11].\n\nIn summary, the proposed approach significantly improves task completion on the LANI navigation task compared to other methods but shows minimal improvement in manipulation accuracy on the more complex CHAI task, where all models perform poorly compared to humans."}

The evaluation uses metrics like Stop Distance (SD) and Task Completion (TC) for the LANI navigation task, and SD and Manipulation Accuracy (MA) for the CHAI household instruction task [12].\n\nOn the LANI navigation task, 'Our Approach' demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods including MISRA17 and CHAPLOT18. It achieves the lowest Stop Distance (SD) and the highest Task Completion (TC) accuracy [5, 8].\n![Table 4 shows performance metrics (SD, TC, MA) for various methods on LANI and CHAI datasets.](image6)\nSpecifically, 'Our Approach' shows a 5% improvement in TC over CHAPLOT18 on LANI [5].\n\nOn the more complex CHAI task, which involves household instructions including manipulation, the performance gains are less pronounced. While 'Our Approach' achieves a better Stop Distance (SD) compared to baselines, overall performance remains weak, particularly in manipulation (MA), where methods like CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17 fail to learn effectively [5, 8].\n![Table 4 shows performance metrics (SD, TC, MA) for various methods on LANI and CHAI datasets.](image6)\nWhen isolating navigation-only instructions within CHAI, 'Our Approach' shows a more significant reduction in SD error (17%) compared to its performance on the entire dataset (8% reduction) [11].\n\nSeveral factors influence the performance of 'Our Approach':\n1.  **Decomposition Strategy:** The separation of goal prediction and action generation is highlighted as a key factor for improved performance, especially in navigation tasks like LANI [1, 8].\n2.  **Goal Prediction Accuracy:** Performance is sensitive to the accuracy of the predicted goal. Using oracle (perfect) goals significantly boosts navigation performance on both tasks, indicating that errors in goal prediction limit overall success [2]. The model struggles with manipulation in CHAI even with oracle goals, pointing to the high planning complexity of that domain [2].\n![Table 3 presents ablation results and performance with oracle goals for 'Our Approach' on LANI and CHAI.](image8)\n3.  **Task Complexity:** The CHAI task is inherently more complex than LANI, involving manipulation actions which prove challenging for all tested models, including 'Our Approach' [5, 8]. Human performance also shows the tasks have inherent ambiguities, though the gap between models and humans remains large [6, 8].\n4.  **Cascading Errors:** A potential limitation is that errors in goal prediction directly impact action generation, as the action generation module does not have access to the original language instruction [4].\n5.  **Trajectory Constraints:** The model may struggle with instructions that impose constraints on the execution path itself (e.g., \"go past the house by the right side of the apple\"), rather than just specifying a final goal. This is because action generation focuses solely on the predicted goal [4]. Such constraints are common, particularly in the LANI dataset [4].\n![Table 2 lists instruction categories and their counts in LANI and CHAI datasets.](image1)\n\n'Our Approach' generally outperforms prior methods on the LANI navigation task in both Stop Distance and Task Completion, but while showing some improvement in Stop Distance on the CHAI task, its overall performance, especially manipulation, is limited due to task complexity and model limitations like potential cascading errors from goal prediction."}

The model's ability to leverage cross-sentence information contributes to its effectiveness [10]. Human evaluation also indicates that incorporating coreference links, a component of the SciIE task setup, significantly improves the quality of automatically constructed knowledge graphs [1, 11].\n\nOverall, the SciIE model demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline and previous state-of-the-art systems on entity, relation, and coreference tasks in scientific text, largely due to its effective multitask learning architecture."}

While stacking task-specific architectures on the pretrained model is beneficial [6], fine-tuning the entire pretrained model during task-specific training generally leads to larger performance gains compared to keeping the pretrained weights fixed (ELMo-style) [9].\n\n![NER F1 scores show that fine-tuning the CNN Large model yields better results than the ELMo-style combination.](image4)\n![Constituency Parsing F1 scores similarly show fine-tuning provides better results than the ELMo-style approach.](image5)\n\nThese combined factors resulted in significant improvements on benchmarks like GLUE [2] and new state-of-the-art results for tasks like NER and constituency parsing [2, 9].\n\n![Table showing GLUE scores for different models, including the CNN and BPE models discussed.](image3)\n\nIn summary, NLP task performance is enhanced by using large pretraining datasets with multi-sentence structures, employing effective training objectives like cloze, and fine-tuning the pretrained models for specific downstream tasks."}

The changes in BLEU scores across various language pairs were essentially insignificant, indicating that *a priori* alignment might not be necessary for standard bilingual translation tasks [7].\n\n![Table 4 shows BLEU scores for bilingual tasks with unaligned vs aligned embeddings, indicating minimal impact from alignment.](image3)\n\nConversely, in multilingual translation scenarios where a single encoder is used for multiple source languages, aligning the word embeddings proved helpful. Alignment ensures that the embeddings for different source languages reside in similar vector spaces, simplifying the learning process for the encoder, much like training on a single language [2]. Results demonstrated that aligning embeddings increased BLEU scores for all tested multilingual tasks compared to using unaligned pre-trained embeddings [2].\n\n![Table 5 shows BLEU scores for multilingual tasks, demonstrating improvements with aligned embeddings compared to just pre-trained ones.](image2)\n\nThis distinction is highlighted as a key finding: *a priori* alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios but is helpful in multilingual training setups [8].\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings generally does not significantly impact BLEU scores in bilingual NMT but provides notable improvements in multilingual NMT scenarios."}

There seems to be an optimal range or \"sweet-spot\" where pre-training is most effective: when the baseline system performs poorly but not extremely so (e.g., baseline BLEU scores around 3-4), suggesting that pre-training helps most when there is limited data, but enough to capture basic language characteristics [4, 12]. As the training set size increases, the gains from pre-training tend to diminish.\n```markdown\n![Figure 2 shows that the BLEU score gain from pre-training (difference between dashed 'pre' and solid 'std' lines) tends to decrease as training set size increases across multiple language pairs.](image2)\n```\nThe role of linguistic similarity between source and target languages is nuanced. An initial hypothesis was that pre-training benefits would be larger for more similar languages due to potentially more aligned semantic structures [3]. Experiments were conducted using Portuguese (PT) as the target and source languages from different levels of relatedness, controlling for training set size [9].\n```markdown\n![Table 3 shows BLEU scores for translating various languages into Portuguese (PT), comparing standard ('std') and pre-trained ('pre') models, along with the language family relationship.](image1)\n```\nContrary to the initial hypothesis for bilingual systems, results showed that while more similar languages (like Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT) to PT) did benefit, very different languages with low baseline scores (like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) to PT) sometimes saw even larger absolute gains [1]. This suggests that the potential for improvement (low baseline score) is a significant factor, possibly outweighing similarity effects in these bilingual cases [1].\n\nHowever, in multilingual translation systems that share components like an encoder across languages [10], similarity appears to play a clearer role, especially when combined with embedding alignment. Gains from pre-trained embeddings in multilingual settings were roughly proportional to the similarity of the language pairs involved, with the most similar pair (GL/PT) showing the largest gains and the least similar (BE/RU) showing smaller gains or even decreases without alignment [11]. Alignment becomes particularly helpful in these multilingual scenarios [11, 12].\n```markdown\n![Table 5 shows that in multilingual settings (multi:pre+align), combining pre-training with alignment leads to substantial BLEU score improvements, especially for the similar GL+PT pair evaluated on GL.](image8)\n```\nFurthermore, pre-training particularly helps in translating low-frequency words [7], suggesting it improves the representation of less common concepts, which is crucial for low-resource languages [6].\n```markdown\n![Figure 2 demonstrates that pre-training ('pre') yields a higher F-measure compared to the standard baseline ('std'), with the improvement being more pronounced for words with lower frequency in the training corpus.](image4)\n```\nQualitative examples confirm that pre-training can lead to better translation of specific names and multi-word phrases, resulting in more accurate and grammatically sound sentences [6].\n```markdown\n![Table 6 shows a translation example where the pre-trained multilingual model ('multi:pre-align') correctly translates 'chris', 'big lawyer', and 'patent legislation', unlike the poor baseline ('bi:std').](image7)\n```\nIn summary, pre-training generally enhances translation accuracy, especially for low-resource settings and low-frequency words, with its effectiveness influenced by training data size and, particularly in multilingual contexts when combined with alignment, by language similarity."}

This suggests that explicit alignment might not be necessary in this context [6].\n\n![Table 4 shows BLEU scores for bilingual NMT with unaligned vs. aligned embeddings, indicating insignificant changes across various language pairs.](image4)\n\nThis outcome is considered potentially positive, as it implies that the NMT system might be capable of learning adequate projections on its own during training, reducing the need for a separate alignment step [1, 6].\n\nHowever, the situation changes in multilingual translation systems, particularly those sharing an encoder between multiple source languages [9]. In these cases, aligning the word embeddings helps to increase BLEU scores [4]. The reasoning is that alignment places the embeddings of different source languages into similar vector spaces, which simplifies the learning process for the shared encoder, allowing it to function more like it would for a single language [4]. The gains observed were roughly proportional to the similarity of the languages involved [4].\n\n![Table 5 shows BLEU scores for multilingual NMT, where adding alignment ('align') consistently improves performance over pre-training alone ('pre') for the low-resource languages tested.](image8)\n\nRegarding target word frequency, analysis shows that using pre-trained embeddings improves the translation accuracy (measured by F-measure) across the entire vocabulary.

This demonstrates that the model heavily relies on the R-GCN to update mention representations based on their relations [4]. Simply connecting all nodes naively without distinguishing relation types also yields only marginal improvements over using ELMo alone, suggesting that the sophisticated parameterization of R-GCN and informative graph construction are necessary [1].\n\nAblating specific relation types reveals their varying importance [7].\n```markdown\n![Table 3 quantifies the impact of removing specific relation types like DOC-BASED, MATCH, and COREF on model accuracy.](image4)\n```\nRemoving connections between mentions co-occurring in the same document (DOC-BASED) causes a notable performance drop (65.1% to 62.9% unmasked, 70.4% to 65.8% masked), as these connections are numerous and informative [7]. Removing edges based on exact matches (MATCH) leads to a smaller decrease (65.1% to 64.3% unmasked, 70.4% to 67.4% masked) [7]. Removing edges predicted by an external coreference system (COREF) has an even smaller impact (65.1% to 64.8% unmasked), possibly because the MATCH heuristic already covers simple cases and the coreference system might not be fully reliable, sometimes even degrading test performance [7]. Nevertheless, modeling all relation types together yields the best results for the development set [7]. Furthermore, attempting to learn edge connections instead of using predetermined heuristics (Induced edges) resulted in performance significantly worse than even the model without R-GCN [9].\n\nOverall, removing the R-GCN module or specific informative relation types negatively impacts model performance in both unmasked and masked settings, underscoring their importance for the task."}

This configuration replaces the deep contextualized ELMo embeddings with context-insensitive GloVe vectors [9]. The model still utilizes the R-GCN component for reasoning over the graph structure but lacks the rich contextual information from ELMo [12].\n\nThe difference in performance is substantial:\n*   In the **unmasked** setting, the 'full (ensemble)' model outperforms 'GloVe with R-GCN' by **9.3** accuracy points (68.5 vs 59.2).\n*   In the **masked** setting, the performance gap is dramatically larger, with the 'full (ensemble)' model outperforming 'GloVe with R-GCN' by **60.5** accuracy points (71.6 vs 11.1). This significant drop for the GloVe model in the masked setting is expected because masking replaces entity mentions with generic identifiers (like MASK1), rendering context-insensitive embeddings like GloVe ineffective as all mentions become 'unknown' tokens [9]. Conversely, the full model benefits from masking as it simplifies coreference resolution [8].\n\nWhile Table 3 focuses on accuracy, Table 4 provides additional context on precision metrics (P@2, P@5) and performance variation across different relation types for the overall ensemble and single models.\n\n![Table 4 presents an error analysis by query type for the best single model, including overall precision metrics (P@2, P@5) for the ensemble and single models.](image6)\n\nThis table shows the 'overall (ensemble)' model achieving high precision scores (P@2: 81.0, P@5: 94.1), reflecting its strong overall performance seen in Table 3.

Although specific P@N metrics aren't provided for the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model in this table, its much lower accuracy scores in Table 3 strongly suggest its precision would also be significantly lower compared to the ensemble. The R-GCN component itself does contribute positively even without ELMo, as removing it further degrades performance [12], but it cannot compensate for the lack of rich embeddings, especially in the masked scenario.\n\nThe 'full (ensemble)' model significantly outperforms the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model in accuracy under both unmasked (by 9.3 points) and especially masked (by 60.5 points) conditions, reflecting the ensemble's use of multiple models and rich contextual embeddings compared to GloVe's context-insensitive nature."}

In the SciERC dataset, the coreference propagation layer has minimal effect on entity extraction performance [8].\n\n![Table showing DyGIE performance on SciERC with and without CorefProp and RelProp layers; Entity F1 scores are very close (68.2 vs 68.0).](image1)\n\nThe ablation study for SciERC [2] shows only a marginal difference in Entity F1 scores between the full DyGIE model (68.2) and the model without coreference propagation (68.0) ![Table showing DyGIE performance on SciERC with and without CorefProp and RelProp layers; Entity F1 scores are very close (68.2 vs 68.0).](image1). This is attributed to the nature of SciERC's annotations, where pronouns are uniformly labeled as 'Generic', limiting the utility of coreference information for specific entity type disambiguation [8].\n\nThe presence of useful coreference annotations in a dataset generally allows the DyGIE model's coreference propagation layer to improve entity recognition performance, especially when disambiguating entity types like pronouns requires broader context, though the magnitude of this improvement depends on the specific characteristics and annotation scheme of the dataset."}

The study aimed to understand when simple pooling strategies over word embeddings suffice [4].\n\nFor document classification tasks (like topic categorization, sentiment analysis, and ontology classification on datasets with ~100 words per document), SWEM models, particularly SWEM-concat which leverages average and max-pooling, showed surprisingly strong performance [1]. In some cases, like topic prediction (Yahoo! Ans., AG News) and ontology classification (DBpedia), SWEM models achieved comparable or even better results than sophisticated CNN and LSTM models, even outperforming a 29-layer deep CNN on topic prediction [1].\n![Table 2 shows SWEM models achieving comparable or superior results to CNN and LSTM on document classification tasks like Yahoo! Ans., AG News, and DBpedia.](image2)\nHowever, for sentiment analysis on longer documents (Yelp), the SWEM-hier variant, which incorporates hierarchical pooling to capture some spatial information, performed comparably to CNN/LSTM, outperforming other SWEM variants [2].\n\nWhen considering short text tasks like sentence classification (~20 words average), SWEM models yielded inferior accuracies compared to CNN/LSTM specifically on sentiment analysis datasets (MR, SST-1, SST-2) [5]. This aligns with observations from document categorization and suggests word-order features, better captured by CNN/LSTM, are more crucial for sentiment analysis in shorter texts where semantic information from embeddings alone is limited [5]. On other short text tasks like subjectivity (Subj) and question classification (TREC), SWEM performance was comparable to CNN/LSTM [5].\n![Table 8 shows SWEM models performing less effectively than CNN/LSTM on short sentiment datasets (MR, SST) but comparably on others like TREC and Subj.](image3)\n\nInterestingly, in sentence matching tasks (natural language inference, answer sentence selection, paraphrase identification), SWEM models often demonstrated the best results compared to CNN or LSTM encoders on most datasets considered, with SWEM-max performing particularly well on SNLI [12].\n![Table 5 shows SWEM models, particularly SWEM-max, outperforming CNN and LSTM on several sentence matching datasets like SNLI, MultiNLI, Quora, and MSRP.](image4)\n\nFurther analysis using subspace training investigated model complexity and parameter efficiency [11]. When comparing SWEM-max and a CNN model, results showed that SWEM achieved significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions (d_int) [10].\n![Figure 2(c)(d) shows SWEM achieving higher accuracy than CNN at lower subspace dimensions on AG News and Yelp P., indicating better parameter efficiency, while CNN can sometimes achieve higher accuracy with larger dimensions.](image5)\nThis indicates that SWEM is more parameter-efficient, requiring a lower intrinsic dimension to reach a decent solution [10]. However, CNNs, having more trainable parameters [9], could sometimes leverage larger dimensions to achieve higher peak accuracy [10].\n\nOverall, SWEM models perform surprisingly well, often matching or exceeding CNN performance on document classification and sentence matching tasks while being more parameter-efficient, whereas CNNs tend to perform better on short-text sentiment analysis where word order is more critical."}

Different fine-tuning strategies were compared: Naive, EWC, and GEM [2].\n```markdown\n![Table 3 shows domain expansion results comparing Base Model (BM) performance with fine-tuning using Naive, EWC, and GEM strategies on 1% new domain data, evaluated on both the original four domains and the new domain.](image5)\n```\nThe results show that fine-tuning using the GEM strategy significantly outperforms Naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of mitigating catastrophic forgetting, meaning it retains performance better on the original domains while adapting to the new one [2, 5]. For instance, when fine-tuning on the hotel domain, using GEM resulted in only a 5.44% drop in joint accuracy on the original four domains, compared to a 22.9% drop with naive fine-tuning [9]. Furthermore, fine-tuning the pre-trained TRADE model on the new domain consistently achieves better results than training a model from scratch using the same small amount of new domain data, highlighting the benefits of transfer learning [2, 3, 5]. For example, fine-tuning on 1% of the Train domain data yielded 59.83% joint accuracy, whereas training from scratch achieved only 44.24% [3]. This transferability also enables TRADE to perform zero-shot DST for unseen domains [11, 12].\n\nIn summary, the TRADE model significantly outperforms prior models on the MultiWOZ benchmark and demonstrates effective domain adaptation, especially when using the GEM fine-tuning strategy, which minimizes catastrophic forgetting while leveraging transfer learning better than training from scratch."}

For instance, when fine-tuning on a new domain after training on four domains including 'hotel', naive fine-tuning caused the joint goal accuracy on the original four domains to drop drastically by 22.9% (from 58.98% to 36.08%) [1]. In contrast, continual learning techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) [8] and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) [11] are employed to mitigate this issue [12]. Experiments show that GEM is particularly effective at preserving performance on the original domains compared to both Naive and EWC fine-tuning [5, 10]. When fine-tuning with GEM, the performance drop on the original four domains (using the hotel example) was only 5.44% (from 58.98% to 53.54%) [1].\n\n![Table 3 shows that GEM consistently maintains higher joint and slot accuracy on the original 4 domains after fine-tuning on a new domain compared to Naive and EWC methods.](image3)\n\nRegarding performance on the *new* domain, fine-tuning a pre-trained model generally achieves better results than training a model from scratch using the same small amount of new domain data [5, 6, 10]. Comparing strategies, GEM can also outperform naive fine-tuning on the new domain itself. For example, when 'attraction' was the new domain, fine-tuning with GEM achieved 34.73% joint accuracy, whereas naive fine-tuning only reached 29.39% [4]. This suggests that preserving knowledge from learned domains can sometimes benefit adaptation to the new one [4]. Results in Table 3 further illustrate these comparisons across different domains [5].\n\n![Table 3 indicates that fine-tuning a base model on 1% new domain data generally outperforms training from scratch on that 1% data, and GEM often achieves competitive or superior results on the new domain compared to Naive and EWC fine-tuning.](image3)\n\nThe model's ability to transfer knowledge is influenced by slot similarities across domains, particularly evident in zero-shot scenarios [2].

The choice of distractors, the evaluation setting (e.g., standard vs. open-domain), and the nature of the training data all play crucial roles.\n\nOne key factor is the type of distractors used during training and evaluation. When a single-paragraph BERT model is trained on standard distractors from the HOTPOTQA dataset, it achieves a baseline F1 score [4]. However, evaluating this same model on adversarially selected distractors causes a substantial drop in performance [4].\n```markdown\n![Table illustrating F1 scores under different training (Original, Adversarial) and evaluation (Original, Adversarial, +Type) conditions.](image8)\n```\nAs seen in the table above, the F1 score declines from 67.08 on the original evaluation data to 46.84 when tested on adversarial distractors [4]. Conversely, if the model is retrained using these adversarial distractors during the training phase, its F1 score on the adversarial evaluation set improves significantly, reaching 60.10 [4]. This demonstrates that matching the training strategy (using adversarial examples) to the evaluation strategy enhances robustness [4, 10].\n\nFurther complexity is added when filtering distractors based on entity type (+Type). Evaluating the originally trained model on adversarial distractors filtered by entity type leads to an even more drastic performance drop (40.73 F1) [1]. However, the model trained on adversarial distractors shows better resilience, achieving 58.42 F1 on this challenging evaluation subset [1, 10].\n```markdown\n![Table illustrating F1 scores under different training (Original, Adversarial) and evaluation (Original, Adversarial, +Type) conditions.](image8)\n```\nThe evaluation setting itself also heavily impacts scores. Single-hop models, like the single-paragraph BERT, can achieve high scores (e.g., 67.08 F1) competitive with multi-hop models in the standard distractor setting of datasets like HOTPOTQA [6, 11].\n```markdown\n![Table comparing F1 scores of various models, including Single-paragraph BERT, in Distractor and Open F1 settings.](image2)\n```\nHowever, these models struggle significantly in an open-domain setting where relevant paragraphs must first be retrieved from a large collection. Performance drops considerably (e.g., to 38.40 or 39.12 F1 depending on the number of retrieved paragraphs) primarily due to the difficulties of retrieving all necessary evidence using methods like TF-IDF, especially for multi-hop questions [8].\n```markdown\n![Table showing Single-paragraph BERT F1 scores in Distractor, Open-domain (10/500 paragraphs), and Open-domain with Gold Paragraph settings.](image7)\n```\nProviding the gold standard paragraphs alongside retrieved ones in the open-domain setting boosts the F1 score substantially (to 53.12), underscoring the impact of evidence availability on performance [8].\n\nFinally, the type of question influences performance depending on the model's capabilities. For instance, single-hop models perform poorly on comparison questions that often require multi-hop reasoning, achieving near chance accuracy [7].\n```markdown\n![Table showing F1 scores for Multi-hop, Context-dependent, and Single-hop comparison question types.](image1)\n```\nThis indicates that certain evaluation subsets (like specific question types) can reveal the limitations of different strategies or models [3, 7].\n\nIn summary, F1 scores are highly sensitive to the interplay between training data composition (standard vs. adversarial), evaluation data characteristics (standard, adversarial, entity-filtered), the evaluation setting (distractor-based vs. open-domain retrieval), and the intrinsic requirements of the questions themselves relative to the model's reasoning capabilities."}

Investigations revealed that BERT exploited spurious statistical cues in the dataset, such as the presence of specific words like \"not,\" rather than engaging in genuine reasoning [1, 2].\n\nTo create a more robust evaluation, an adversarial dataset was constructed. This involved taking each original data point, negating the claim, and inverting the label. This process mirrors the distribution of statistical cues across both labels, thereby neutralizing their effect [8, 9].\n\n![Example of creating an adversarial data point by negating the claim and swapping warrant/alternative.](image6)\n\nWhen BERT was trained and evaluated entirely on this adversarial dataset, its performance drastically decreased.

The COMET model, particularly when pre-trained, demonstrates superior performance compared to earlier models and its own ablations in terms of accuracy [9].\n\nAccuracy is evaluated using several metrics [3]. The COMET model achieves the lowest perplexity (PPL) score, indicating high confidence in its predictions, and the highest automatic classifier score, suggesting the generated tuples are often deemed correct by a pre-trained evaluator [11]. Human evaluations further confirm this high quality [11].\n\n![Table comparing different models (LSTM-s, CKBG, COMET variants) on ConceptNet using PPL, Score, Novelty (N/T sro, N/T o), and Human evaluation metrics.](image5)\n\nSpecifically, the full COMET model achieves a PPL of 4.32, a classifier score of 95.25, and a human evaluation score of 91.69% correct generations [image5]. This human evaluation score approaches human performance for the resource [7, 8]. In contrast, previous models like LSTM-s and CKBG have much lower scores (e.g., 63.86% and 53.95% human evaluation, respectively) [image5]. The importance of pre-training is evident when comparing the full COMET model to COMET (- pretrain), which has significantly worse scores across the board [6, image5]. Qualitative examples demonstrate the plausibility of COMET's generated completions [11].\n\n![Table showing plausible ConceptNet completions generated by COMET for various seed concepts and relations.](image3)\n\nRegarding novelty, COMET generates a substantial number of tuples not seen during training [1]. The N/T sro metric (percentage of novel subject-relation-object tuples) for COMET is 59.25%, significantly higher than the non-pretrained version (36.17%) but lower than LSTM-s and CKBG (86.25%) [image5]. However, the high novelty of LSTM-s and CKBG comes at the cost of much lower accuracy [image5]. COMET also generates new object nodes (N/T o = 3.75%) [1, image5]. An example highlights COMET's ability to generate novel, correct information like \"mango IsA fruit\" even when the training data is uninformative, thanks to pre-training [10].\n\nCompared to other models on ConceptNet, COMET achieves a strong balance of high accuracy and significant novelty, demonstrating its effectiveness for automatic commonsense knowledge base construction [7, 8]."}

The Background backoff shows slightly higher sensitivity in this context.\n![Sensitivity values show Pass-Through and Neutral backoffs have similar low sensitivity (11.3) for closed vocabulary models, while Background is slightly higher (13.1).](image6)\nThis lower sensitivity occurs because closed vocabulary models internally map all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words to a similar representation [8, 6].\n\nIn contrast, open vocabulary models (char, word+char, word-piece) exhibit different sensitivity patterns. The Pass-Through backoff strategy becomes significantly more sensitive because these models treat every unique combination of characters differently, leading to a larger variety of outputs when corrupted text is passed through [8, 6].\n![Sensitivity values show Pass-Through backoff is much more sensitive (30.3) than Background (14.7) or Neutral (11.3) for open vocabulary models.](image6)\nThe Neutral backoff strategy consistently achieves the lowest sensitivity across both model types [8]. This is expected because it maps all UNK predictions to a single fixed neutral word like 'a', reducing the degrees of freedom available to an attacker and minimizing the number of unique outputs [1, 3, 8].\n\nRegarding Word Error Rate (WER), the choice of backoff strategy also has a clear impact. The strategy of backing off to a background model trained on a larger corpus generally yields the lowest WER (6.9% in the evaluated setting), indicating more accurate word reconstruction compared to other methods [10].\n![WER comparison shows the Background backoff variant achieves the lowest overall WER (6.9%).](image7)\nThis improvement is partly attributed to the background model's ability to handle words unseen in the foreground training corpus [10]. Pass-Through and Neutral backoffs result in higher WER compared to the Background model [10].\n\nThere is often a trade-off between minimizing WER and minimizing sensitivity [12]. The Background model, while having the lowest WER, can exhibit higher sensitivity, especially with open vocabulary models. The Neutral model has the lowest sensitivity but a higher WER [3, 10].\n![Plots show Background backoff (orange) generally has lower WER but higher Sensitivity, while Neutral backoff (green) has higher WER but lower Sensitivity.](image3)\nWhile low WER is necessary, low sensitivity is also crucial for robustness against attacks, and sensitivity is often the more dominant factor when WERs are reasonably low [3, 5, 12].\n\nOverall, open vocabulary models using Pass-Through backoff are the most sensitive, Neutral backoff yields the lowest sensitivity for both model types, and Background backoff achieves the lowest Word Error Rate."}

The reduction in Capex was part of the Corporation's effort to manage finances during this downturn [2], [12].

This increase was primarily driven by a significant rise in cash provided by receivables, largely due to sales of receivables, including financing receivables [8, 9]. Other contributing factors included an increase in deferred taxes related to an intra-entity IP sale and payroll/VAT tax deferrals under government relief programs [4, 9].

The primary reason for this large decrease was the absence of a major acquisition comparable to the Red Hat purchase completed in 2019, resulting in a $32,294 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions [1, 7]. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, mainly due to the wind-down of OEM IT commercial financing operations [1, 7].\n\n**Financing Activities:**\nFinancing activities shifted from being a net source of cash in 2019 ($9,042 million provided) to a net use of cash in 2020 ($9,721 million used), a total year-over-year change of $18,763 million [12, image3]. This shift was mainly driven by a significant decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions ($19,998 million lower) compared to the prior year when substantial debt was added to fund the Red Hat acquisition [6]. A decrease in cash used for share repurchases provided a partial offset [6].\n\nOverall, the increase in operating cash flow combined with the dramatic decrease in cash used for investing activities (due to lower M&A spending) more than offset the shift from cash inflow to outflow in financing activities, resulting in a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2020 compared to a net decrease in 2019."}

Its net operating income increased by $392m, moving from a loss of $654m in 2019 to a loss of $262m in 2020. Similarly, profit before tax rose by $387m, from $924m in 2019 to $1,311m in 2020.\n![Corporate Centre adjusted results show improved Net Operating Income (loss reduced) and Profit Before Tax in 2020 compared to 2019.](image1)\nThis improvement in the Corporate Centre's results is partly attributed to changes in how certain items are allocated. Specifically, starting in 2020, revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings debt funding costs, and Argentina hyperinflation impacts were allocated to the global businesses instead of being retained solely within the Corporate Centre [5, 11]. The Corporate Centre's results primarily consist of profits from associates and joint ventures, Central Treasury revenue, stewardship costs, and consolidation adjustments [8]. The detailed breakdown of the Corporate Centre's adjusted revenue confirms the net operating income figures and changes year-on-year.\n![Corporate Centre's management view of adjusted revenue confirms a Net Operating Income of -$262m in 2020, an improvement from -$654m in 2019.](image8)\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking and Markets (GBM) segment experienced different trends. While its net operating income increased by $434m (3%) from $14,869m in 2019 to $15,303m in 2020, its profit before tax decreased by $342m (7%) from $5,172m in 2019 to $4,830m in 2020.\n![Global Banking and Markets adjusted results show increased Net Operating Income but decreased Profit Before Tax in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by higher credit losses.](image7)\nThe increase in Net Operating Income for GBM was driven by strong performance in areas like FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities), particularly Foreign Exchange and Credit [image2].\n![Global Banking and Markets revenue breakdown shows strong performance in FICC, contributing to the overall increase in Net Operating Income for 2020.](image2)\nHowever, the decline in GBM's profit before tax was primarily due to a substantial increase in the 'Change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges', which jumped from $153m in 2019 to $1,209m in 2020 [image7]. This reflects the significant financial impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the economic environment [2, 6], leading to increased provisions for potential loan defaults. The key risk appetite metrics show that Expected Credit Losses (ECL) were outside the desired appetite levels in 2020 [2].\n![Key risk appetite metrics for 2020 show Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) at 3.1% and Expected Credit Losses significantly higher than target levels.](image6)\nDespite the challenging environment and increased ECL, GBM's RoTE (excluding significant items and UK bank levy) was 6.7% in 2020 [image7], while the Corporate Centre's RoTE was 3.1% [image1].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the Corporate Centre saw improvements in both net operating income and profit before tax, partly due to internal reallocations, whereas Global Banking and Markets experienced increased net operating income but decreased profit before tax due to significantly higher expected credit losses amid the pandemic."}

In fiscal 2019, unallocated revenues were $4,723 million, largely due to a settlement with Apple [5]. In fiscal 2020, they were $1,841 million, mainly from a settlement and new license agreement with Huawei [5].

The reconciling items impacting EBT were $2,040 million in 2019, -$475 million in 2020, and -$3,032 million in 2021. This negative trend indicates that unallocated expenses increasingly outweighed unallocated revenues/income in the reconciliation. These items include certain R&D, SG&A, interest expenses, and other corporate charges not allocated to segments [3].\n    ![Table showing reconciling items (net unallocated impact on EBT) of -$3,032M in 2021, -$475M in 2020, and $2,040M in 2019.](image8)\n    ![Breakdown showing components of reconciling items for EBT, including unallocated revenues, costs, R&D, SG&A, interest, and investment income.](image6)\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the company acquired NUVIA [4].\n*   **NUVIA Acquisition:** The acquisition was completed on March 16, 2021 [4].

The *swing* in the net reconciling items impacting EBT from +$2,040 million in 2019 to -$3,032 million in 2021 represents a negative change of $5,072 million. Both the decrease in unallocated revenues and the overall negative swing in reconciling items over the three years are significantly larger in magnitude than the $1,264 million in net assets acquired from NUVIA in 2021.\n\nUnallocated revenues decreased dramatically from 2019 to 2021 primarily due to large settlements in prior years, while the net impact of unallocated items on EBT became increasingly negative, with these fluctuations significantly exceeding the value of net assets acquired from NUVIA in 2021."}

In 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, driven by $8.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases and $5.0 billion in debt payments/redemptions, partially offset by $4.6 billion in debt issuance [3]. Conversely, in 2020, net cash *provided by* financing activities was $3.8 billion [12]. This shift was primarily due to substantially higher proceeds from long-term debt issuances ($13.8 billion in 2020 vs $4.6 billion in 2019), which more than offset the $7.5 billion returned to shareholders via dividends and repurchases and $2.9 billion in debt payments/redemptions [12, 3].\n\nThis increased borrowing directly impacted PepsiCo's contractual commitments.\n```![Table shows total contractual commitments of $66.3 billion, dominated by long-term debt obligations ($40.3 billion) and related interest ($16.0 billion).](image2)```\nThe significant issuance of long-term debt in 2020 [12] is reflected in the large figures for long-term debt obligations and future interest payments detailed in the commitments table [image2].

This strong Global Markets performance more than offset the impact of lower global interest rates [2, 7] and a decrease in Global Banking revenue, which fell by $0.1bn or 2% due to lower fee income and losses on legacy positions [1, image3].\n\nDespite the higher net operating income, adjusted profit before tax fell by $342m, or 7%, from $5,172m in 2019 to $4,830m in 2020 [image2].\n```markdown\n![Bar chart confirms GBM's profit before tax decreased to $4.8bn in 2020 from $5.2bn in 2019.](image1)\n```\nThe primary reason for this decline was a significant increase in the charge for expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL), which rose dramatically from $153m in 2019 to $1,209m in 2020 [image2].

Indeed, actuarial gains in 2022 for both plans were primarily related to these increases in discount rates [8].\n\nRegarding the expected return on plan assets (EROA), which impacts the defined benefit expense calculation [4], the assumptions for the *years ended* June 30 were as follows:\n![Table showing discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase, and interest crediting rate for cash balance plans for years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.](image2)\nFor Pension Benefits, the EROA assumption decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022 [image2]. For Other Retiree Benefits, the EROA assumption remained constant at 8.4% for both 2022 and 2021 [image2]. A lower EROA assumption generally leads to higher calculated net periodic benefit cost (or a lower credit) [4].\n\nThe \"net amount recognized\" typically refers to the funded status (plan assets less benefit obligations) recorded on the balance sheet.\n![Table showing the classification of net amount recognized for Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, including assets, liabilities, and amounts in AOCI.](image8)\nThe significant increase in discount rates from 2021 to 2022 substantially reduced the calculated benefit obligations for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits [6, 8]. While the decrease in the Pension EROA assumption would increase the expense component [4], and negative actual asset returns reduced plan assets for Pensions in 2022 [image6], the reduction in liabilities due to higher discount rates was the dominant factor. This led to an improvement in the net amount recognized (funded status) for both plans: the net liability for Pension Benefits decreased from $5,428 million in 2021 to $2,435 million in 2022, and the net asset for Other Retiree Benefits increased from $2,238 million in 2021 to $3,819 million in 2022 [image8].\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022, discount rates increased significantly for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits, while the expected return on plan assets decreased for Pension Benefits but remained unchanged for Other Retiree Benefits; these changes, particularly the higher discount rates, led to an improved net amount recognized (funded status) for both types of plans."}

This growth was largely attributed to improved performance in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), particularly Foreign Exchange and Credit, which benefited from higher volatility levels, increased client activity, and wider spreads [7].

Additionally, adjusted operating expenses for this segment decreased by 3% due to cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay, which helped offset increased regulatory and technology costs [1, image8].

This overall growth was driven by varying performances within its major segments:\n\n1.  **Media Segment**: Revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion, boosted significantly by the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics ($1.8 billion revenue). Excluding the Olympics, the increase was 11.0%, driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue, reflecting some recovery from COVID-19 impacts. However, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 18.0% to $4.6 billion. This decline was largely due to the investment in Peacock, which generated $778 million in revenue but incurred $2.5 billion in operating costs and expenses in 2021 as the company focused on content and customer base growth [6]. Despite this investment, NBCUniversal anticipates continued declines in subscribers and ratings for its traditional networks due to competition and changing viewing habits [4].\n2.  **Studios Segment**: Revenue grew 16.2% to $9.4 billion as film and television production returned to full capacity post-COVID, leading to increases in content licensing, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment [6].

Revenue surged 141.2% to $5.1 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA improved significantly from a loss of $0.5 billion in 2020 to a profit of $1.3 billion in 2021. This turnaround reflects the positive impact of customers returning to parks as pandemic restrictions eased and capacity increased, along with the opening of the Beijing park [6].\n\nThe performance of NBCUniversal's segments, particularly the strong recovery in Theme Parks and Studios and the mixed results in Media (driven by Peacock investments), contributed to the overall financial health of Comcast Corporation.\n![Comcast Corporation's consolidated Adjusted EBITDA calculation shows a total of $34.7 billion in 2021, reflecting contributions from all segments including NBCUniversal.](image6)\n\nOverall, NBCUniversal's financial performance from 2020 to 2021 was marked by strong revenue recovery driven by returning customers to theme parks and cinemas and broadcast events, though profitability was tempered by strategic investments in streaming (Peacock) and anticipated shifts in traditional media consumption."}

Investments were made to scale with customers, which would include supporting the growth in the Platform category [7].\n\nThe substantial revenue growth in 'Salesforce Platform and Other' significantly contributed to the overall increase in total revenues, which grew 29% year-over-year [6].\n```markdown\n![Total revenues increased 29% from $13,282M in 2019 to $17,098M in 2020.](image7)\n```\nThis strong revenue performance, driven in part by the 'Salesforce Platform and Other' segment, helped boost the overall Gross Profit.\n```markdown\n![Consolidated statements show overall revenue, cost, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income for 2020 and 2019.](image5)\n```\nAs seen in the consolidated statement, Gross Profit rose from $9,831 million in 2019 to $12,863 million in 2020 [image5]. While the specific cost of revenue for 'Platform and Other' isn't isolated, its high revenue growth was a key factor in the improved gross profit figure. However, it's important to note that this increased gross profit did not translate to higher net income, primarily because operating expenses also saw a large increase during the same period, driven by investments in R&D, marketing & sales, G&A, and acquisitions [2, 3, 8].\n```markdown\n![Total operating expenses increased significantly from $9,296M in 2019 to $12,566M in 2020.](image6)\n```\n\nRevenue for Salesforce Platform and Other grew substantially by 57% from 2019 to 2020, contributing significantly to overall revenue and gross profit growth, although specific cost allocation for this category is not detailed."}

Key drivers included loan paydowns outpacing originations, particularly in the residential mortgage portfolio due to the low interest rate environment and a large transfer of first lien mortgage loans to held-for-sale [5]. Actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations also contributed, along with a decline in Small Business PPP loans [9]. Conversely, total deposits increased substantially, driven by higher levels of liquidity and savings among consumer customers, boosted by government stimulus programs, payment deferral initiatives, and ongoing economic uncertainty related to the pandemic [8].\n\n**Commercial Banking:**\nCommercial Banking experienced a decrease in average loan balances but an increase in deposits.\n![Commercial Banking average loans decreased 14% while average deposits increased 10% year-over-year.](image7)\nThe decrease in average total loans was driven by lower loan demand, including reduced line utilization, and higher paydowns as clients maintained high levels of liquidity and utilized strong capital markets [12]. However, period-end commercial loans showed a slight increase, reflecting higher loan demand later in the year which led to increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness [5, 12].\n![Commercial Banking period-end loans increased 1% while period-end deposits increased 9% year-over-year.](image3)\nTotal deposits increased due to higher client liquidity levels and reduced investment spending, influenced by government stimulus and continued economic uncertainty [11].\n\n**Corporate and Investment Banking:**\nThis segment saw an increase in loan balances but a decrease in total deposits.\n![Corporate & Investment Banking average loans increased 1% while average deposits decreased 19% year-over-year.](image5)\nThe increase in total loans (both average and particularly period-end) was supported by higher commercial loan demand resulting in increased originations and draws [5], along with modest loan growth late in 2021 driven by higher line utilization and customer growth [12]. The decrease in total deposits shown in the balance sheet data contrasts with the general trend described elsewhere, suggesting segment-specific factors or outflows offset the broader drivers like stimulus [11] and uncertainty [8] mentioned for other areas.\n\nIn summary, from 2020 to 2021, Consumer and Commercial Banking saw loan decreases (on average) and deposit increases, while Corporate & Investment Banking experienced loan increases alongside deposit decreases, driven by varying factors including loan demand, paydown activity, interest rates, stimulus impacts, and strategic portfolio actions."}

Credit Risk RWA saw a significant increase under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches during 2020 [3]. This rise was attributed to several factors, including increased market volatility affecting Derivatives exposures, the impact of the E\\*TRADE acquisition on Investment securities, growth in Lending commitments, and higher Equity investments [3].\n\n![Detailed breakdown of changes in Credit Risk, Market Risk, and Operational Risk RWA from 2019 to 2020.](image4)\n\nThe image above quantifies this, showing Standardized Credit Risk RWA increased by $44,382 million and Advanced Credit Risk RWA increased by $56,003 million over the year [image4]. Market Risk RWA also contributed to the overall RWA increase, driven primarily by higher market volatility [9], while Operational Risk RWA under the Advanced Approach decreased [11].

Specifically, impairment charges totaling $6,117,000 were included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year ended 28 June 2020 [6]. These charges were driven by the company's decision to exit the Spanish market and a write-down of assets within the store network [6].\n![Image2 details the breakdown of the $6,117,000 impairment charge in 2020 between the Spanish market exit and other store impairments.](image2)\nThe breakdown shows $3,360,000 related to the Spanish market exit and $2,757,000 from other store impairment charges.\n\nFor tax expenses, while the total income tax expense decreased from $15,575,000 in 2019 to $9,641,000 in 2020, the effective tax rate (ETR) for global operations increased significantly.\n![Image3 shows the components of income tax expense and the reconciliation of the effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019.](image3)\n![Image8 presents the effective tax rates (ETR) for global and Australian operations, showing a significant increase in the global ETR for 2020.](image8)\nThe global ETR rose from 29.6% in 2019 to 46.2% in 2020. The Australian operations ETR also saw an increase from 27.8% to 31.4% [4].

This aligns with the policy to only recognise deferred tax assets when future taxable profits are probable [11], and unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset was recognised increased in 2020 [12]. Additionally, lower tax payments during the financial year affected the franking percentage of the interim dividend [9].\n\nTherefore, the major changes between 2019 and 2020 were the emergence of significant impairment charges in 2020 ($6.1 million) compared to none in 2019, and a decrease in total tax expense coupled with a sharp increase in the global effective tax rate."}

The primary reason for this drop was the lower income generated from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities due to the prevailing low short-term interest rates throughout 2021 [4]. This impacted the substantial holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills [1]. Dividend income, however, saw a modest increase of 3.5% in 2021 compared to 2020 (see image7).\n\nThe asset composition of the insurance business shifted significantly between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021.\n![Total insurance assets grew, driven by increases in Cash, cash equivalents & U.S. Treasury Bills (to $90.7B) and Equity securities (to $334.9B), while Fixed maturity securities decreased (to $16.4B).](image3)\nAs shown in the table above, there was a notable increase in holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills (up $23.6 billion) and a substantial increase in equity securities (up $65.4 billion). Conversely, the holdings of fixed maturity securities decreased by nearly $4 billion [image3]. The overall growth in invested assets is supported by the increase in insurance float, which rose from $138 billion at year-end 2020 to $147 billion at year-end 2021 [8]. The reduced portfolio of fixed maturity securities at the end of 2021 primarily consisted of foreign government and U.S. Treasury/agency securities.\n![Fixed maturity securities carrying value at Dec 31, 2021 was $16,386 million, with major components being Foreign governments and U.S. Treasury/agencies.](image2)\n\nThe implications of these changes include lower earnings from interest-bearing assets due to low rates, despite a preference for liquidity and safety [1, 4]. The increased reliance on equity securities contributes significantly to overall earnings through unrealized gains (approximately $76.4 billion pre-tax in 2021), but also introduces substantial volatility to reported periodic net earnings [7]. Sales of these equities also resulted in significant taxable gains ($3.6 billion in 2021) [6, 7].\n\nIn summary, net investment income decreased slightly in 2021 due to lower interest income, while asset composition shifted more towards cash/equivalents and equities, impacting earnings sources and volatility."}

This resulted in a large increase in liabilities, notably non-current liabilities to the Siemens Group which rose from €2,982 million to €11,708 million [6]. This increase in debt contributed to a lower equity ratio despite the capital increase [7].\n    ![Cash flow from financing activities shows €11,839 million net inflow in 2021, driven by share issuance (€2,309M) and financing transactions with the Siemens Group (€10,961M).](image4)\n*   **Equity:** The increase in equity resulted from positive net income and OCI, along with a capital increase in March 2021 that raised subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million [7]. These positive effects were partially offset by dividend distributions (€856 million) [7] and purchases of treasury shares (€266 million).\n    ![Statement of Changes in Equity details the impacts of net income (€1,727M), OCI (€696M), dividends (-€856M), share issuance (€2,328M), and treasury share purchases (-€266M) on equity attributable to shareholders.](image5)\n    The capital increase provided net inflows of €2.3 billion [3], supporting the Varian financing.\n\nThe key differences between 2020 and 2021 involved a significant increase in comprehensive income driven by higher net income and favorable OCI movements, and a substantial expansion of the balance sheet primarily due to the Varian acquisition, which was financed through increased liabilities and a capital increase, leading to higher assets (goodwill, intangibles), liabilities, and equity."}

As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion of these benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate [1]. The company is subject to ongoing tax examinations, particularly by the IRS for the 2017-2020 tax years [5].\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company maintains a program aimed at optimizing its capital structure, enhancing shareholder returns, and mitigating the dilutive effect of share-based awards [3].

Following new U.S. Treasury regulations, the company relinquished a previously claimed federal tax basis step-up, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense [8]. This is reflected in the large deferred federal tax provision in 2019 shown in Image 7 and the large negative item in the tax rate reconciliation in Image 2. Also contributing to tax events in 2019 was a $570 million benefit recorded from making \"check-the-box\" elections for several foreign subsidiaries [8], visible as a benefit in the 2019 column of Image 2.\n\nTax benefits related to share-based awards have shown a consistent upward trend over the period. The total tax benefits realized from these awards were $237 million in 2019, $273 million in 2020, and $567 million in 2021 [1].\n```markdown\n![Table showing increasing share-based compensation tax benefits from $184M in 2019 to $435M in 2021.](image8)\n```\nThis increasing benefit is also reflected as a growing reduction in the effective tax rate calculation, particularly the excess tax benefit component, which reduced the provision by $27 million, $83 million, and $265 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively (Image 2). Benefits from R&D tax credits and the FDII deduction also contributed significantly to reducing the effective tax rate, with R&D benefits increasing steadily and FDII benefits fluctuating but remaining substantial (Image 2).\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits have also increased during this period, rising from $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2019 to $1.9 billion at the end of 2020, and further to $2.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2021 [10].\n```markdown\n![Rollforward table showing ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits increasing from $1,705M (2019) to $1,901M (2020) to $2,136M (2021).](image5)\n```\nA primary driver for the increase in fiscal 2021 was related to ongoing disputes over Korean withholding taxes, where Qualcomm believes taxes are being withheld at rates higher than owed [10]. This has led to the recording of a significant noncurrent income tax receivable and a corresponding liability for uncertain tax benefits, both amounting to $1.9 billion at September 26, 2021 [4].\n\nOther ongoing tax matters include a remaining liability for a one-time repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018, payable over the next five years [5], potential risks related to tax incentives in Singapore [6], and a policy of not indefinitely reinvesting certain foreign earnings, which could lead to future tax liabilities [9]. The company also maintains significant unused tax carryforwards, including NOLs and tax credits, primarily state and foreign, available to offset future tax liabilities [11].\n\nQualcomm's tax provisions and benefits fluctuated significantly from 2019 to 2021, influenced heavily by a major deferred tax asset derecognition in 2019 and growing benefits from share-based compensation and other deductions in subsequent years, alongside increasing unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to Korean withholding tax disputes."}

Basic EPS is calculated based on the net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG [5, 8].\n\nConversely, in 2020, the core results for net income and basic EPS were substantially higher than the IFRS results.\n![Table showing 2020 Group results: IFRS Net income $8,071M, Core Net income $13,158M; IFRS Basic EPS $3.55, Core Basic EPS $5.78.](image6)\nThe 2020 IFRS net income from continuing operations was $8,071 million, with a basic EPS of $3.55 [6]. The core net income for 2020 was $13,158 million, leading to a core basic EPS of $5.78 [6].\n\n**Significant Adjustments:**\n\nThe discrepancies between IFRS and core results stem from specific adjustments made to exclude certain items, aiming to reflect the underlying operational performance.\n\nFor **2021**, the single most significant adjustment affecting the difference between IFRS and core net income was related to \"Income from associated companies\". The IFRS income from associated companies was $15,339 million, which was adjusted downwards by $14,556 million to arrive at the core figure of $993 million [8]. This substantial adjustment largely reflects the gain from the divestment of the investment in Roche, which is excluded from core results [1].

The adjustment related to income from associated companies ($424 million added back) was considerably smaller than in 2021 [6].\n![Breakdown of 2020 adjustments showing $3,335M amortization, $1,335M impairments, and a $424M positive adjustment for income from associated companies.](image6)\n\nIn both years, adjustments are also made for items such as acquisition/divestment related costs, restructuring charges, legal settlements, and fair value adjustments [2, 3, 4, 7, 10], though these were generally less impactful than the items mentioned above for the respective years. The tax effects related to all these adjustments also contribute significantly to the final difference between IFRS and core net income [1, 12].

This relative resilience, despite the pandemic, reflects positive sales performance noted in the U.S. [2, 8], potentially boosted by strategic marketing, promotional activity, and growth in delivery, particularly in the second half of the year [10]. However, this positive performance was partly offset by support provided for marketing initiatives, such as the Thank You Meals for first responders [5, 8], and incremental COVID-19 related expenses [4].\n\nConversely, the International Operated Markets (IOM) segment experienced a much more significant decline. Total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues in IOM decreased by 17% (or 17% in constant currencies), falling from $11,398 million in 2019 to $9,462 million in 2020 [image4]. This steep drop was primarily driven by sales declines resulting from the impacts of COVID-19 [2, 6, 8], including temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [10, 12]. The IOM segment also faced over $100 million in marketing support costs to aid recovery [6].\n\nThis divergence in performance shifted the revenue composition between the two segments.

While interest income fell substantially by $12.9bn (24%) due to lower yields on assets [4], this was partially offset by a considerable reduction in interest expense. Interest expense decreased from $24,233m in 2019 to $14,178m in 2020, driven mainly by lower funding costs on liabilities like customer accounts and debt securities [11].\n```markdown\n![Breakdown of interest expense shows significant decreases in cost for customer accounts and debt securities in issue from 2019 to 2020.](image6)\n```\nThe $2.9bn decrease in NII directly impacted total operating income, contributing to its decline from $71,024m in 2019 to $63,074m in 2020. Consequently, net operating income before changes in expected credit losses (ECL) fell from $56,098m to $50,429m.

This significantly reduced the total liability for uncertain tax positions from $303 million at the end of 2019 to $89 million at the end of 2020 [1].\n```markdown\n![The liability for uncertain tax positions decreased from $303 million at the start of 2020 to $89 million at the end, primarily due to a $249 million reduction for prior year positions.](image1)\n```\nThe reduction in this liability implies that the associated tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained [2]. If these uncertain tax positions are ultimately recognized, they would generally lower the effective tax rate and could lead to the realization of existing deferred tax assets [1].\n\nLooking at the components of deferred taxes, there were shifts in various categories between 2019 and 2020. For instance, deferred tax assets related to deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards decreased slightly, while liabilities related to property, plant and equipment, international earnings, and acquisition-related intangibles also saw reductions. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets decreased marginally by $1 million in 2020 [9].\n```markdown\n![Breakdown shows deferred tax assets decreased slightly before valuation allowance, deferred tax liabilities decreased significantly, and the valuation allowance decreased marginally, resulting in a higher net deferred tax asset in 2020 compared to 2019.](image4)\n```\nThe overall change in the net deferred tax asset balance is reflected in the deferred tax provision. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded a total deferred tax benefit of $137 million, compared to a deferred tax expense of $81 million in 2019. This significant swing from expense to benefit directly contributed to the increase in the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.\n```markdown\n![The company recorded a total deferred tax benefit of $137 million in 2020, compared to a deferred tax expense of $81 million in 2019.](image8)\n\n```\nOverall, the resolution of uncertain tax positions combined with changes in various deferred tax asset and liability components led to a substantial increase in the net deferred tax asset from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020."}

While Salary & Fees saw a slight increase, the main driver for the decrease was the Share Based Payments component, which showed a negative value of ($316,667) in FY20 compared to a positive $433,360 in FY19 [7].\n\nThe negative value in Share Based Payments relates to the vesting profile and movement of performance rights and options awarded as remuneration [4, 12]. Specifically, the FY18 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) rights were forfeited during FY20.\n\n![The table shows S Fallscheer's FY18 LTIP (1,308,901 rights) was 100% forfeited in the period ending 28 June 2020.](image4)\n![This table confirms that S Fallscheer forfeited 1,308,901 FY18 LTIP performance rights during the year ended 28 June 2020.](image5)\n\nThe forfeiture of these 1,308,901 performance rights from the FY18 LTIP resulted in the reversal of previously recognised remuneration expenses, leading to the negative figure in the Share Based Payments category for FY20 [12].

Total home equity production for the corporation declined.\n![Total home equity production decreased from $11,131 million in 2019 to $8,160 million in 2020.](image2)\nThis decrease in production was primarily driven by a decline in applications [2]. Furthermore, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion during 2020, mainly because loan paydowns were higher than new originations and draws on existing lines [1]. This suggests consumers were less inclined to apply for new home equity loans or lines of credit and were potentially focusing on paying down existing debt.\n\n**Credit Card:**\nCredit card metrics also showed significant changes, largely influenced by the economic environment and consumer behavior shifts during the pandemic. Outstanding balances in the credit card portfolio decreased substantially by $18.9 billion in 2020 [11]. This reduction was attributed to lower retail spending combined with higher payment rates by consumers [11]. Reflecting the lower spending, total credit card purchase volumes declined.\n![Total credit card purchase volumes decreased from $277,852 million in 2019 to $251,599 million in 2020, while debit card volumes increased.](image7)\nThe decline in purchase volumes was specifically linked to the impacts of COVID-19, with spending on travel and entertainment remaining particularly low, although overall spending improved in the latter half of the year [10]. Lower client activity also contributed to reduced card income [5]. Despite lower spending, metrics related to credit quality improved, with net charge-offs and past-due amounts decreasing, partly due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferral programs [11].\n\n**Consumer Behavior Interpretation:**\nThe decrease in both home equity originations and outstanding balances, coupled with reduced credit card spending and higher payment rates, indicates a shift towards more cautious consumer financial behavior in 2020, likely driven by the economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; consumers reduced discretionary spending on credit cards, applied for less home equity debt, and prioritized paying down existing balances, aided in part by government support programs."}

The company generally sells its products at prevailing market prices, making its financial results susceptible to price volatility [4]. Sustained low prices can negatively impact performance as BHP typically cannot offset lower revenues by increasing prices [4]. The sensitivity of BHP's profits to these price fluctuations is significant, as illustrated by the estimated impacts of a US$1 change per unit for various commodities on profit after taxation and Underlying EBITDA [4].\n\n![Table showing the estimated impact on profit after taxation and Underlying EBITDA (in US$M) from a US$1 change in various commodity prices, including coal and nickel.](image5)\n\nFocusing on coal, fluctuations in market prices directly impacted its financial results. In FY2021, Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased substantially, with lower price impacts (net of price-linked costs) accounting for US$0.7 billion of this decline [2]. This is reflected in the average realised prices compared to the previous year [image6].\n\n![Table summarising Coal segment results for Year ended 30 June 2021 vs 2020, showing lower revenue, significantly lower Underlying EBITDA, and lower average realised prices for metallurgical coal but slightly higher for thermal coal.](image6)\n\nCosts also play a role, with increased maintenance and stripping volumes driving up controllable cash costs in FY2021 [2]. Unit costs for Queensland Coal were expected to be higher in FY2022 due to factors like diesel prices [3], although optimization efforts aim to offset some increases [3].\n\n![Table showing detailed cost breakdown for Queensland Coal and NSWEC for FY2021 vs FY2020, including revenue, gross costs, net costs, sales volume, and cost per tonne.](image8)\n\nFor nickel, price movements had a positive effect in FY2021. The average realised sales price for nickel increased compared to FY2020 [6]. This rise was driven by strong global demand, supply disruptions, and declining London Metal Exchange stocks [6]. Consequently, Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased significantly, reflecting these higher prices along with higher volumes and lower maintenance costs [9]. However, this positive impact was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements [5, 9] and the adverse effect of the stronger nickel price on the costs of purchasing third-party concentrate [9].\n\nCommodity price fluctuations, driven by factors like supply and demand, global economics, exchange rates, and operational costs, significantly impact BHP's financial results for commodities like coal and nickel."}

These inflows were largely driven by the aforementioned MCPS issuances, proceeds from common stock offerings (particularly in 2019 and 2020 [4, image8]), and significant debt issuance in 2019 [12], offset partially by dividend payments and debt repayments (especially in 2020 [image8]).

The operating profit margin increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 19.0% in 2020 [5]. This improvement in the most recent year was favorably impacted by higher core sales volumes, cost savings from productivity initiatives, lower spending levels for business travel due to the pandemic, and the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates [7, 12].

This rise was primarily due to favorable changes in estimated sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, though this was partially offset by lower unit demand [5]. However, in 2020, ENBREL sales decreased by 4% compared to 2019. This decline was driven by lower unit demand and a lower net selling price [4]. Factors contributing to this decrease include continued market share loss and a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market partly due to COVID-19 [4]. Additionally, ENBREL faces competitive pressure from approved biosimilars, which could further impact sales if market entry occurs [9].

In 2020, sales continued to grow, increasing by 3%, driven by both higher unit demand and net selling price [2]. However, the growth rate decelerated in 2020. This was attributed to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected patient visits for their semi-annual doses and lowered the rate of new osteoporosis diagnoses [11].\n\nENBREL sales increased in 2019 due to pricing factors but decreased in 2020 due to lower demand, price, and competition, while Prolia sales consistently grew driven by demand and price increases, although its growth slowed in 2020 due to pandemic-related disruptions."}

This reinstatement, along with the California R&D credit, contributed $10.7 million towards the difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate in 2014 [3].\n\nSimilarly, in December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 retroactively and permanently extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2015 [4, 9]. The company recognized a retroactive benefit of approximately $16.5 million for the 2015 Federal R&D credit in the fourth quarter of 2015 [9]. This $16.5 million, combined with the California R&D credit, was a primary factor in the difference between the 14% effective tax rate and the 35% federal statutory rate in 2015 [11].\n\nThe increase in R&D credits was a main driver for the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 [7], which is consistent with the larger reduction shown in the tax reconciliation for 2015 compared to 2014.\n![Table shows the R&D tax credit reduced the provision for income taxes by $13.8M in 2013, $18.7M in 2014, and $29.4M in 2015.](image8)\n\nOverall, the R&D tax credit consistently reduced the provision for income taxes from 2013 to 2015, with the impact increasing each year due in part to retroactive legislative extensions."}

Significantly higher gasoline prices boosted net sales substantially [11].

This increase of approximately $2.6 billion (or 70%) from 2019 to 2020 was mainly due to higher net earnings, partially offset by the differing impacts of net discrete noncash tax charges/benefits between the years, along with changes in depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, and working capital management [3, 5].\n\nComparing the two, net cash used in investing activities fluctuated more dramatically than operating cash flows, particularly with the large outflow in 2020 driven by acquisition activity [10].

The vesting for each of these three years is dependent on the achievement of pre-defined performance objectives related to the relevant Business Unit's financial performance [3].\n\nSpecifically, the condition requires the Business Unit's Non-GAAP Operating Income (OI) for a given year to be reasonably close to the objective set in the Annual Operating Plan (AOP) for that same year. The number of shares vesting is the Annual Target Amount, potentially adjusted by a Performance Factor, and rounded [8].\n\n![Table outlining annual RSU vesting conditions based on Business Unit Non-GAAP OI relative to AOP objective for three years.](image8)\n\nThis table [8] shows that for each of the first three full years, the vesting condition is met if the Business Unit's Non-GAAP OI is no more than 15% less than the Non-GAAP OI objective set in the AOP for that year [8]. The specific business unit could be Activision Blizzard as a whole, or specific divisions like Advertising, ATVI Publishing, Blizzard, CPD, or King [3].\n\nA specific example provided for the \"2019 Performance Share Units\" illustrates a similar mechanism, where the first tranche vested only if the 2019 non-GAAP OI was at least 90% of the 2019 AOP OI objective, with the actual number of shares vesting potentially scaling up to 125% based on performance relative to the objective [2].

This trend is strongly linked to increasing assimilation and distance from direct immigrant connections.\n\nNearly all immigrants from Latin America or Spain (97%) identify as Hispanic, and this rate remains very high for the second generation (92%), who are the U.S.-born children of at least one immigrant parent [3]. However, this identification tends to weaken in subsequent generations.\n\nA key factor is the increasing prevalence of mixed heritage. Among self-identified Hispanics, the share reporting a non-Hispanic parent or grandparent significantly increases across generations: 18% for the foreign-born, 29% for the second generation, and 65% for the third or higher generation.

Similarly, participation in Hispanic cultural celebrations during childhood is reported less frequently by later generations (49% second generation vs. 35% third or higher generation) [12]. Language use also shifts, with bilingualism dropping from 51% in the second generation to 24% in the third or higher generation [1].\n\nSocial networks and marriage patterns further illustrate this shift. The proportion of self-identified Latinos whose friends are mostly Latino decreases from 77% among immigrants to 55% for the second generation and 37% for the third or higher generation [5]. Intermarriage rates also show a decline in marrying within the Hispanic community across generations [6, 7].\n\nWhen individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not identify as Hispanic, common reasons include having a mixed background where the Hispanic ancestry feels too distant (27%), lack of contact with Hispanic relatives during upbringing (16%), not speaking Spanish or lacking a cultural link (15%), and identifying as American (9%) [11].\n![Reasons for not identifying as Hispanic include mixed background, lack of contact with relatives, not speaking Spanish/lacking cultural links, identifying as another race, and identifying as American.](image7)\n\nThe generational breakdown indicates that Hispanic self-identification is strongest among those closer to the immigrant experience and tends to fade in later generations due to factors like mixed heritage, cultural assimilation, and weaker ties to ancestral origins."}

For higher-resource languages, the gains from pre-training are often consistent, around 3 BLEU points [2]. This can be observed in pairs like Portuguese to English (PT → EN) which saw an increase from 26.2 to 30.3 BLEU [image3].\n\n```markdown\n![Table 2 shows BLEU scores for various language pairs translated to English, comparing standard (std) models with those using pre-trained embeddings (pre), highlighting significant gains especially for low-resource languages like GL.](image3)\n```\n\nIn contrast, for extremely low-resource languages, the impact varies more dramatically. Some pairs like Azerbaijani (AZ) and Belarusian (BE) to English show smaller gains, while others like Galician (GL) to English can experience very large increases, up to 11 BLEU points [2]. In the experiments shown, GL → EN jumped from 2.2 to 13.2 BLEU with source pre-training [image3]. This suggests pre-training can be particularly effective for bootstrapping models that are on the verge of producing reasonable translations [2].\n\nThe initial performance of the baseline system also plays a role. Systems with lower baseline scores, indicating more room for improvement, tend to see larger gains from pre-training [9]. For instance, when translating into Portuguese (PT), Russian (RU → PT) and Hebrew (HE → PT), which had low baseline scores (2.4 and 3.0 respectively), saw larger BLEU increases (+6.2 and +8.9) compared to more similar languages like Spanish (ES), French (FR), and Italian (IT) which had higher baselines [9].\n\n```markdown\n![Table 3 compares standard (std) and pre-trained (pre) BLEU scores for translations from various languages into Portuguese (PT), showing larger gains for languages less similar to PT or with lower baseline scores.](image2)\n```\n\nFurther analysis suggests that the gain is often highest when the baseline system is poor but not excessively so, typically having a baseline BLEU score around 3-4 [11]. Once a system captures basic language characteristics, pre-training becomes highly effective [11].\n\n```markdown\n![Figure 1 illustrates that BLEU score gains from pre-training (difference between pre and std lines, shown explicitly in the bottom plot) are often largest when the training set size is smaller, corresponding to lower baseline BLEU scores.](image7)\n```\n\nIn multilingual translation settings involving similar language pairs (like GL/PT), pre-training also shows significant benefits, with gains roughly corresponding to the similarity between the languages [5, 10].\n\n```markdown\n![Table 5 demonstrates BLEU score improvements in multilingual systems (trained on language pairs like GL+PT) evaluated on the low-resource language, showing gains from standard (std) to pre-trained (pre) and further gains with alignment (align).](image5)\n```\n\nPre-training affects BLEU scores positively for most language pairs, with the largest improvements often observed in low-resource settings or for pairs with lower baseline performance, particularly when the baseline is sufficient to capture basic language structures."}

However, continuing to increase the demonstrations to 10 or 20 results in limited subsequent improvements [4].

For instance, 35% of questions were identified as potentially single-hop due to weak distractors [12].\n```markdown\n![Table 2 shows that 35% of questions have weak distractors allowing single-hop answers.](image1)\n```\nHowever, model performance degrades substantially when faced with more challenging distractors. When distractors are selected adversarially or filtered by entity type to match the gold paragraphs, the F1 score of the original single-paragraph BERT model drops significantly [2, 8]. Specifically, accuracy declined from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1 with adversarial distractors and to 40.73 F1 with type-filtered distractors [2, 8].\n```markdown\n![Table 4 shows F1 scores dropping significantly with adversarial or type-filtered distractors but largely recovering after retraining on them.](image2)\n```\nThese results indicate that single-paragraph models struggle when the distribution of distractors changes [3].

Single-hop models struggle significantly here, largely due to the failure of standard TF-IDF retrieval methods to find the necessary gold paragraphs for multi-hop questions [1, 5]. The single-paragraph BERT model achieves only 38.40 F1 (or 39.12 F1 with 500 paragraphs) in the open-domain setting, highlighting this challenge [10, 5].\n```markdown\n![Table 5 illustrates the performance difference between the distractor setting, open-domain settings with varying paragraphs, and the improvement when gold paragraphs are added.](image4)\n```\n```markdown\n![Table 1 compares model performance, showing Single-paragraph BERT achieves 67.08 F1 in the distractor setting and 38.40 F1 in the open setting.](image7)\n```\nThe crucial role of gold paragraphs is underscored by the fact that performance improves notably (to 53.12 F1) when the two gold paragraphs are explicitly provided, even in an open-domain context with 500 retrieved paragraphs [5]. This demonstrates the significant negative impact of failing to retrieve the necessary evidence [5]. Even with 500 distractors, performance doesn't reach the level seen in the simpler distractor setting, indicating that simply increasing the number of distractors via TF-IDF isn't sufficient [11].\n\nIn summary, F1 scores are high when gold paragraphs are easily accessible and distractors are weak, but scores decrease significantly with stronger distractors or when gold paragraphs are not retrieved, implying that both evidence retrieval and distractor quality heavily dictate measured model performance."}

Unlike SWEM models, which ignore word order, LSTMs can capture sequential information [7, 9]. Experiments demonstrate that for sentiment analysis tasks, LSTM models perform better than SWEM variants, suggesting that the word-order information captured by LSTMs is beneficial [7, 10].\n\nTo specifically test the importance of word order, an experiment was conducted where the words in the training sentences were randomly shuffled, removing word-order features, while the test set remained in original order. An LSTM model was used for this evaluation [9]. The results showed that for sentiment analysis (Yelp Polarity dataset), the LSTM model's accuracy dropped noticeably when trained on the shuffled data compared to the original data [11].\n\n![Table showing LSTM accuracy dropping from 95.11 to 93.49 on the Yelp P. dataset when trained on shuffled vs original data, while showing minimal change on Yahoo and SNLI datasets.](image4)\n\nThis drop indicates that word-order information is indeed important for sentiment analysis. The performance of the LSTM on the shuffled Yelp dataset became very close to that of SWEM models, suggesting that the primary advantage of LSTM over SWEM for this task lies in its ability to capture word-order features [12]. This contrasts with tasks like topic categorization (Yahoo) and textual entailment (SNLI), where shuffling the training data had minimal impact on LSTM performance, indicating word order is less critical for those tasks [8, 11]. The reason word order matters in sentiment is that the arrangement of words can significantly alter the expressed sentiment, such as the difference between \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" [7]. Furthermore, incorporating local word-order information (n-grams) via hierarchical pooling significantly improved SWEM's performance on sentiment tasks, bringing it closer to LSTM/CNN results, further reinforcing the importance of word order [2, 3].\n\nRemoving word-order information significantly reduces the accuracy of LSTM models on sentiment analysis tasks."}

Therefore, the `z=10` setting should ideally produce questions 100% of the time.\n\nHowever, when repetition control is introduced alongside question-asking control, the actual question-asking rate is reduced [6]. Specifically, for the `z=10` setting, which is intended to yield 100% questions, the model combined with repetition control only produces questions 79.67% of the time [6]. This reduction occurs because the repetition control mechanism, particularly the `extrep bigram` feature, discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared previously, including common question-forming bigrams like \"do you\" or \"what is\" [6].\n\n![The graph shows that without repetition control (blue line), the question rate reaches nearly 100% at z=10, but with repetition control (purple line), it only reaches about 80% at z=10, falling short of the target (red dotted line).](image2)\n\nThis effect is clearly visible in the comparison between the standard question-controlled CT model and the one combined with repetition control [6].\n\nIntroducing repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level (z=10) from the target 100% to approximately 79.67%."}

Another evaluation on code-to-documentation generation further supports this, showing CodeBERT (MLM+RTD) achieving a 22.36 BLEU score, significantly improving over RoBERTa and illustrating better generalization to potentially unseen programming languages [6].\n```markdown\n![CodeBERT (MLM+RTD) achieves a high BLEU score (22.36) on code-to-documentation generation, outperforming RoBERTa and other CodeBERT variants shown.](image1)\n```\nSimilarly, in the natural language code search task, the CodeBERT configuration utilizing both MLM and RTD (initialized with RoBERTa weights) achieves the highest overall Mean Average Precision (Ma-AVG) across the six programming languages [7].\n```markdown\n![CodeBERT (MLM+RTD, init=R) achieves the highest overall Mean Average Precision (0.7603) for natural language code search across multiple languages.](image7)\n```\nWhile NL-PL probing tasks, evaluated without fine-tuning model parameters [8, 9], show CodeBERT (MLM) performing better than baselines on almost all languages overall [10], the fine-tuned results on downstream tasks like code generation and search consistently favor the combination of MLM and RTD.\n```markdown\n![CodeBERT (MLM) shows the best overall accuracy in both PL (85.66) and NL (74.53) probing tasks across languages.](image3)\n```\nThe CodeBERT configuration pre-trained with both MLM and RTD objectives demonstrates the best overall performance across multiple programming languages on downstream tasks like code documentation generation and natural language code search."}

The LLM's role shifts from solving the problem directly to representing it symbolically [2, 9].\n2.  **Symbolic Reasoning**: The generated symbolic formulation is passed to a deterministic symbolic solver (e.g., a logic programming engine, first-order logic prover, constraint solver) [2, 5]. This solver performs inference or execution based on the symbolic representation to derive a symbolic answer [12]. Because this stage uses deterministic algorithms, the reasoning is guaranteed to be faithful if the formulation is correct [2].\n3.  **Result Interpretation**: The symbolic answer obtained from the solver is translated back into natural language [2]. This stage can be handled by an LLM or a rule-based system to present the final answer in an understandable format [12].\n\nAdditionally, LOGIC-LM incorporates a self-refinement mechanism where error messages from the symbolic solver during the reasoning stage can be used as feedback to revise and improve the initial symbolic formulation generated by the LLM [10, 12].\n\nLOGIC-LM solves problems by using an LLM to formulate the problem into a symbolic language, then employing a deterministic symbolic solver for reasoning, and finally interpreting the symbolic result back into natural language."}

The text notes that the U.S. energy breakdown, which is comparable to AWS's, is used to provide reasonable estimates of CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour [5].\n\nMicrosoft uses nearly double the percentage of renewable energy compared to Amazon-AWS, but both utilize a similar high percentage of coal for their energy needs, suggesting both contribute substantially to CO2 emissions despite differences in their renewable portfolios."}

This contrasts with results on single-document datasets like SQuAD where their performance is often nearly identical. It is hypothesized that the iterative latent interactions and conditioning across multiple layers in BiDAF's architecture make it potentially better suited for integrating information distributed across multiple documents, which is characteristic of these datasets [6, 12].\n\nThe performance metrics clearly show BiDAF achieving higher accuracy:\n```markdown\n![Table showing BiDAF outperforms FastQA on WIKIHOP and MEDHOP standard and masked tests.](image1)\n```\nFor instance, on the standard WIKIHOP test set, BiDAF achieves 42.9% accuracy compared to FastQA's 25.7%. Similarly, on the standard MEDHOP test set, BiDAF scores 47.8% while FastQA scores 23.1% [image1].\n\nBoth models show significant improvement when provided only with the relevant documents (the 'gold chain'), indicating that a major challenge lies in selecting pertinent information from a larger set of documents [8].

A similar gap exists for MEDHOP [image2].\n\nExperiments designed to probe multi-step inference capabilities by removing intermediate documents further highlight differences.

This allows the model to capture subword information, such as morphological variations (like prefixes or suffixes) and capitalization patterns, which can be important signals for identifying named entities [12]. Accessing the original character sequences is noted as an advantage [7], and failing to use character-level features can lead to reduced tagging accuracy [11].\n\nThe word-level component uses embeddings for entire words. These embeddings capture semantic meaning and contextual information [12]. For instance, the frequency information conveyed by the length of unnormalized word embedding vectors can be an important signal for NER, as named entities often appear less frequently [3].\n\nThe overall architecture combines these two levels. As described, the model first generates a representation for each word by concatenating its character representation (derived from a character-level Bi-LSTM) with its word embedding [6].

This process is visually demonstrated in the provided diagram:\n![Objects within bounding boxes are cropped for processing.](image8)\n\nThe rationale for this pre-processing is that objects in detection datasets vary significantly in size and position, unlike the typically large, centered objects in standard image classification. Cropping isolates the region containing the object, and blurring the surrounding, non-target areas helps to direct the Multimodal Large Language Model's (MLLM) focus specifically onto the relevant object [8]. This adaptation is crucial for improving region-level recognition accuracy [7].\n\nThe pre-processing step contributes to the zero-shot recognition system by cropping the image to the object's bounding box and blurring the background, thereby focusing the model's attention on the relevant object for better identification [8]."}

The release and utilization of the Google Books Ngrams corpus around 2011 provided a crucial resource, enabling studies like those by Gulordava and Baroni (2011) and Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) to quantitatively compare word meanings across different time spans [12].\n\n![Timeline showing key developments in diachronic semantic shift research from 2010 to 2017, including corpus usage, model types, evaluation methods, and theoretical findings.](image1)\n\nThe period saw the development of new evaluation methods, like word epoch disambiguation around 2012, designed to assess a system's ability to identify the correct time period for a word's usage [3]. A major technological shift occurred with the application of prediction-based word embedding models (like word2vec, emerging around 2013) to this task [5]. Kim et al. (2014) were pioneers in using these models, specifically Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS), often with incremental updates, to trace semantic changes [10].\n\nFurther advancements included Kulkarni et al.'s (2015) work on statistically significant detection of linguistic change [4, 8], and Hamilton et al. (2016a) demonstrating the advantages of SGNS models over earlier methods [10]. This period also saw the incorporation of additional corpora like the New York Times Annotated Corpus (from 2015), COHA (from 2016), and the Gigaword corpus (from 2017), allowing for more diverse analyses [8]. Research expanded into theoretical areas such as proposing statistical laws of semantic change (Hamilton et al., 2016a) [4], exploring model alignment techniques [3, image1], and using semantic shift detection to track real-world phenomena like cultural shifts or conflicts [3, 8].\n\nKey milestones from 2010 to 2017 involved leveraging large corpora, adopting word embedding models, devising new evaluation strategies, and formulating theories about semantic change patterns."}

The median performance is 71.2% and the mean (excluding degenerate runs) is 71.6% [11].\n    ![Table 1 shows BERT (Large) test results on the original dataset, with a max accuracy of 0.770.](image3)\n2.  **Performance Attributed to Spurious Cues**: Probing experiments reveal that this high performance is largely due to BERT exploiting spurious statistical cues within the dataset [1, 5]. Using only the warrants (W) as input, BERT already achieves a maximum accuracy of 71% [5, 10].

Research indicates that models generally perform better when responding to specific questions compared to general ones [3]. This improvement is attributed to specific questions providing clearer instructions on the knowledge required for the answer [3].\n\nLet's examine the performance differences between GPT-4 and ChatGPT across these settings using citation and text evaluation metrics presented in the table below:\n\n![Table comparing GPT-4 and ChatGPT performance on General and Specific settings for Citation and Text Evaluation.](image6)\n\nIn **Citation Evaluation**, both GPT-4 and ChatGPT show improvements when moving from the General to the Specific setting across most metrics, including Alignment, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score [image6]. In the Specific setting, GPT-4 (0.5) achieves higher Alignment (92.0 vs 84.5), Correctness (97.6 vs 94.8), Precision (36.0 vs 29.9), and F1-Score (39.4 vs 37.2) compared to ChatGPT (0.5). However, ChatGPT (0.5) demonstrates higher Recall (49.0 vs 43.6) in the Specific setting [image6]. This aligns with the general observation that GPT-4 tends to generate shorter answers leading to higher precision, while models like ChatGPT may generate longer answers boosting recall [1]. Overall, OpenAI models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT outperform LLaMA family models in citation quality and alignment [1, 11].\n\nFor **Text Quality Evaluation**, the difference between General and Specific settings is less pronounced for both models [image6]. Interestingly, ChatGPT (0.5) scores slightly higher than GPT-4 (0.5) across all text quality metrics (Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, Relevance) in both General and Specific settings [image6]. This pattern is also observed in broader text quality evaluations:\n\n![Table showing text quality metrics (Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, Relevance) for various models including GPT-4 and ChatGPT variants.](image4)\n\nHowever, it's noted that using ChatGPT itself for text quality evaluation might introduce a bias, potentially favoring its own generation style, which could explain these slightly higher scores compared to GPT-4 [6]. Despite this potential bias, OpenAI models generally exhibit better text quality than LLaMA models [4].\n\nThe improved performance on specific questions suggests a trade-off: specific questions enhance knowledge coverage but might seem less natural, while general questions feel more natural but provide weaker guidance on knowledge use [3].

For the EA pin specifically on the 8751H and 8751H-8 models, the input low voltage (VIL1) should be between 0V and 0.7V [image1].\n*   **Input High Voltage (VIH):** For most pins (excluding XTAL2, RST, and EA), the input high voltage must be between 2.0V and VCC + 0.5V [image1]. The supply voltage VCC operates between 4.5V and 5.5V [image4]. For the XTAL2 and RST pins, the input high voltage (VIH1) must be between 2.5V and VCC + 0.5V when XTAL1 is tied to VSS [image1]. A specific high voltage level (VIH2) is defined for the EA pin on the 8751BH and 8752BH models, requiring 4.5V to 5.5V [image1]; this differs from the 8751H which uses the standard VIH or VIL1 depending on the intended state of EA.\n\n![DC Characteristics table showing VIL, VIH, VOL, VOH specifications for various pins and conditions, including specific values for 8751H, 8751H-8, 8751BH, and 8752BH models.](image1)\n![Operating conditions table showing VCC ranges from 4.5V to 5.5V.](image4)\n\n**Output Voltage Specifications:**\n\n*   **Output Low Voltage (VOL):** For Ports 1, 2, and 3, the maximum output low voltage is 0.45V when sinking 1.6 mA (IOL = 1.6 mA) [image1].

This involves sharing data and insights.\n*   **Iterative Learning and Inquisitiveness:** The approach is iterative and focused on learning [image8]. It requires an inquisitive and questioning attitude throughout the organization [2, image8].\n*   **Data Access and Skills:** Broad data literacy is essential [image8]. This means ensuring business units have necessary data access and analytical skills [8], democratizing data access through tools like BI [12], and leveling up everyone's data skills [11]. Training, like \"Stats for managers class,\" and mentoring analysts helps improve necessary skills [12].\n*   **Data Leadership and Fact-Based Decisions:** Strong data leadership is needed [image8], often embodied by a CDO/CAO who champions data as a strategic asset [2, 7]. Decisions should be fact-based, moving away from the \"Highest Paid Person's Opinion\" (HiPPO) [2].\n    ![A cartoon depicts a meeting where data for Option A and Option B are presented, but a large hippopotamus declares \"Option B it is.\", representing decisions made by authority rather than data.](image4)\n    Managers expect and rely on data insights for informed decisions [1].\n*   **Goals and Impact:** Efforts should be goal-oriented (\"Goals first\" [image8]) and tied back to strategic objectives and ROI [12]. The entire process aims to push data through the \"analytics value chain\" to achieve tangible impact [4].\n\nAccording to the diagram, the key components of a data-driven culture are Testing, Open sharing, Iterative learning, Self service, Data leadership, Inquisitive Questioning, Goals first, and Broad data literacy."}

Gregor Mendel conducted experiments with garden peas [1] and showed that parents pass heritable factors, now known as genes, to their offspring [4].\n\nIn a typical monohybrid cross, Mendel started with true-breeding parental (P) plants, for example, one with purple flowers and one with white flowers [11].\n![Parental generation cross shows true-breeding purple flowers crossed with white flowers resulting in all purple F1 offspring.](image4)\n\nThese parents have different versions (alleles) of the gene controlling flower color, located at specific gene loci on homologous chromosomes [3, 5]. Let's denote the dominant purple allele as 'P' and the recessive white allele as 'p' [7]. The true-breeding purple parent has the genotype PP, and the white parent has the genotype pp.\n![Definitions of homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (aa), and heterozygous (Bb) genotypes.](image8)\n\nWhen these P plants are crossed, the resulting F1 generation consists entirely of hybrids with the genotype Pp. Due to the dominance of the P allele, all F1 plants exhibit the purple flower phenotype [11].\n![F1 generation plants all have purple flowers.](image4)\n\nMendel then crossed these F1 hybrid plants (Pp x Pp). According to Mendel's principle of segregation, during gamete formation (sperm and egg), the two alleles for a trait separate, so each gamete carries only one allele. F1 plants produce gametes containing either the P allele or the p allele in equal proportions. Fertilization is the random union of these gametes [8].\n\nThe possible combinations of alleles in the F2 generation can be visualized:\n![Diagram shows the cross between F1 hybrids (Pp), detailing gamete formation (P, p) and the resulting F2 genotypes PP, Pp, and pp through fertilization.](image1)\n\nThis process leads to the following genotypes in the F2 generation: PP, Pp, and pp. The expected genotypic ratio is 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp.\n\nRegarding the phenotype (observable trait), both PP and Pp genotypes result in purple flowers because the P allele is dominant. Only the pp genotype results in white flowers [7].\n![Dominant (free earlobe, FF or Ff) and recessive (attached earlobe, ff) traits shown with corresponding genotypes, illustrating dominance.](image2)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation is 3 purple (from PP and Pp genotypes) : 1 white (from pp genotype) [11].\n![Diagram illustrating the F2 generation results with a 3 purple:1 white phenotypic ratio and a 1 PP:2 Pp:1 pp genotypic ratio.](image1)\n![F2 generation shows 3/4 purple flowers and 1/4 white flowers, matching the 3:1 phenotypic ratio.](image4)\n\nMendelian inheritance explains the F2 ratios through the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the principle of dominance, resulting in a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (PP:Pp:pp) and a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (dominant:recessive)."}

While usage for administrative tasks like posting policies/procedures and staff communication is expected to increase significantly, access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders via the intranet are projected to decrease [image4].\n![Projected intranet functions show increased use for administrative tasks but decreased use for clinical information and order access over the next two years.](image4)\n\nThis contrasts with observed trends in website functions, where areas like remote employee access and physician portal links showed growth between 2005 and 2006, alongside established functions like marketing and consumer health information [image2]. There's also a slow but noticeable increase in patient access to medical records via websites [image2].\n![Website functions show growth in external access points like remote employee access and physician portals, alongside marketing and consumer information.](image2)\n\nThis suggests a potential shift: functions requiring external or remote access (like physician portals or remote employee access), and potentially patient-facing tools, are increasingly migrating towards web platforms rather than traditional intranets. The intranet seems poised to focus more intensely on internal administrative and communication roles.\n\nThis shift is happening alongside broader trends in technology adoption. There's a strong projected increase in the implementation of security measures like firewalls, user access controls, audit logs, and data encryption over the next two years [image1].\n![Security technology adoption, such as firewalls and user access controls, is projected to increase significantly over the next two years.](image1)\nSimultaneously, adoption rates for various other technologies like single sign-on, barcoding, handheld PDAs, and automated alerts were already increasing between 2005 and 2006 [image5].\n![Adoption of various technologies like single sign-on, bar code technology, and handheld PDAs showed growth between 2005 and 2006.](image5)\n\nThese technology trends support the move towards more sophisticated, potentially web-based or externally accessible systems, necessitating enhanced security. The current system often fragments patient information [6], and the goal of a future system is to consolidate information and unify efforts [4]. The increasing adoption of diverse technologies and the shift in where certain functions (like clinical access) reside likely reflect this move towards more integrated, albeit potentially web-centric or portal-based, solutions rather than relying solely on traditional intranets for all tasks.\n\nProjected intranet changes, emphasizing internal administration while decreasing clinical access, align with website trends showing growth in external portals and remote access, all supported by increased adoption of diverse and secure technologies to enable broader, unified information systems."}

The term \"Gestalt\" is German for \"shape\" or \"form\" [7], and the psychology explores how we organize visual elements into unified wholes. Several specific principles, known as Gestalt Laws of Grouping, describe these processes [8].\n\nThe design of the word \"GESTALT\" in the provided image serves as a visual example, incorporating several of these principles:\n![The word GESTALT is depicted with different visual treatments for letters, explicitly labeling Gestalt principles like Closure, Proximity, Similarity, and Continuity corresponding to specific design elements.](image2)\n\nOne key principle demonstrated is **Closure**. This principle states that we tend to perceive incomplete objects as complete by mentally filling in the missing parts [11]. This is seen in the letter 'G' in the image, which is recognizable despite gaps in its outline. A similar effect is shown below, where fragmented lines are perceived as a complete circle and rectangle.\n![Fragmented outlines of a circle and a rectangle are easily perceived as whole shapes due to the Gestalt principle of closure.](image1)\n\n**Proximity** is also utilized. We tend to group elements that are close to each other [1]. In the \"GESTALT\" image, the letters 'G', 'E', and 'S' might be perceived as one subgroup partly due to their spatial closeness, visually separating them slightly from the 'TALT' section. The image explicitly labels proximity in relation to the spacing within the 'GES' block.\n![Two arrangements of dots illustrate proximity; the left shows a unified grid, while the right shows dots grouped into vertical columns due to closer horizontal spacing within columns than between them.](image6)\n\nThe principle of **Similarity** suggests that objects similar in appearance (e.g., shape, color) are often perceived as belonging to the same group [10]. In the image, the letters 'T', 'A', 'L', 'T' share a common diagonal line pattern, causing us to group them together as distinct from the other letters.\n![A grid of circles demonstrates similarity, where rows of black circles are perceived as groups distinct from rows of white circles due to shared color.](image7)\n\nFinally, **Continuity** is illustrated by the pink vertical line passing through the letter 'S'. This principle suggests that elements arranged in a line or curve are perceived as more related than elements not on the line or curve; we tend to see the line as a single, continuous element extending behind the 'S' [3].\n\nThe design of the word 'GESTALT' visually manifests principles like closure, proximity, similarity, and continuity to demonstrate how these concepts influence visual perception."}

Firstly, it is crucial to arrange accommodation. If you have been offered campus housing, ensure your arrival details are submitted online as per your offer email [3]. It's recommended to settle into your housing *before* proceeding with other administrative tasks [9]. For any housing-related questions, contact the Office of Housing and Auxiliary Services (HAS) via email [10].\n![HAS email contacts for different student types](image7)\n\nOnce housing is settled, the next step is formal registration with SAO-Student Support during office hours. This involves completing registration procedures and getting briefed on Student’s Pass formalities. Remember to bring essential documents like your passport, embarkation card, Letter of Admission/Enrolment, and receipts for any NTU Miscellaneous Fee payments [9]. This registration process is part of matriculation, after which you will receive your NTU matriculation card [5]. Completing the Student's Pass formalities is essential.\n![Example of a Singapore Student's Pass](image6)\nThere are fees associated with the Student's Pass process.\n![Fees associated with Student's Pass processing, issuance, and visa](image3)\n\nFor banking needs, students staying for 6 months or more can open an account with a Singaporean bank [12]. OCBC has a branch on campus, and other banks are available nearby at Jurong Point Shopping Centre [7]. It's advisable to check the specific bank's requirements beforehand [7].\n![Contact information for major banks in Singapore](image4)\n\nTo set up communication, you can sign up for a mobile line at Jurong Point Shopping Centre or a convenience store [8]. Singapore has three main telecommunication companies, and you can visit their websites for details on plans [8].\n![Websites for major Singaporean telecommunication companies](image8)\n\nAfter registration, you will receive details about your network account, granting access to essential NTU services like the intranet portal iNTU, e-services (Student Link, GSLink), e-learning (NTULearn), and library databases [2]. Ensure you update your personal particulars and contact details using Student Link (for undergraduates), GSLink (for graduates), or the Exchange Portal (for exchange students) [4]. Finally, take advantage of welcome ceremonies, orientations, and tours organised by SAO-Student Support, schools, and Halls of Residence to learn about campus life and expand your social network [6].\n\nTo settle in at NTU, a new international student should first secure housing, then complete official registration and Student's Pass procedures, followed by setting up banking and mobile communication services, and finally accessing university systems and engaging in orientation activities."}

Variety is often preferred because enjoyment drops with repeated consumption of the same item, prompting a switch to something else [2].\n\n![Standard hot dog consumption provides initial enjoyment.](image4)\n\nFor example, the first hot dog might provide a lot of enjoyment, but the sixth provides significantly less, potentially even negative utility, as illustrated in typical diminishing utility tables.\n\n![Utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed in a standard scenario.](image8)\n\nHowever, in a competitive context, the focus shifts. While the physical act of eating more hot dogs might still follow a pattern of diminishing (and potentially negative) physical utility, the *outcome* of the competition introduces a powerful new factor. Focus, which might be detrimental in standard consumption due to diminishing returns, can be highly beneficial in competition [9]. The potential for mastery and winning through focused effort adds a different dimension to utility [12].\n\nThis is clearly shown in the hot dog eating contest example comparing standard diminishing utility with the differential outcome in a competition:\n\n![Joey Chestnut's utility from hot dogs differs dramatically in a competition compared to standard consumption due to the value placed on winning.](image1)\n\nIn the competitive scenario shown in image1, the utility from consuming the 64th hot dog, which results in tying the championship, is extraordinarily high (+5000), completely overriding the standard diminishing utility curve. This occurs because focused effort can lead to improved outcomes (like winning), which itself provides significant utility [11].\n\nIn standard consumption, utility from hot dogs steadily diminishes with quantity, whereas in a competitive context like an eating contest, the utility dramatically increases at the point of winning, overriding the normal diminishing returns."}

This involves understanding and adapting to their needs throughout the project lifecycle. Agile analysis plays a critical role here [2].\n`![A graphic poses the question 'How Does Agile Analysis Work?' illustrating the complexity.](image8)`\n\nThe process often starts during the Inception phase with activities aimed at understanding the initial requirements, referred to as \"Explore initial scope\" [image7].\n`![A diagram depicts the Disciplined Agile Delivery lifecycle phases, highlighting 'Explore initial scope' and 'Address changing stakeholder needs'.](image7)`\nThis exploration involves deciding on appropriate strategies for defining the initial requirements, such as determining the necessary level of detail, the types of views or models needed (e.g., usage, domain), the modeling strategy (like informal sessions), and how work items and non-functional requirements will be managed [image3].\n`![A diagram outlines strategies for exploring initial project scope, including modeling and requirements detail.](image3)`\nThis initial exploration sets the foundation by facilitating requirements envisioning [6].\n\nAs the project progresses into the Construction phase, the focus shifts to producing the solution and continually \"Address changing stakeholder needs\" [image7]. This is where specific **Needs Exploration** strategies come into play as part of producing the solution [image6].\n`![A diagram shows 'Needs Exploration' strategies within the process of producing a consumable solution.](image6)`\nOptions for Needs Exploration at this stage include active stakeholder participation, defining high-level specifications, using acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), and employing just-in-time (JIT) model storming or look-ahead modeling [image6]. This iterative approach avoids the pitfalls of demanding overly detailed specifications upfront, preferring a more flexible, agile manner [image2].\n`![A meme contrasts needing detailed upfront specs with the agile preference for iterative work.](image2)`\n\nDirectly supporting the goal of addressing changing needs are **Elicitation Methods** [image4].\n`![A diagram details strategies for addressing changing stakeholder needs, including elicitation methods and interaction.](image4)`\nThese methods are the specific techniques used to gather requirements and feedback from stakeholders on an ongoing basis. Examples include Just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, all-hands demos, and iteration demos [image4]. The choice of method can be influenced by factors such as stakeholder distribution, potentially requiring Business Analysts at different locations [5, 8]. Effective elicitation is linked with active stakeholder participation and iterative modeling practices [image5].\n`![A diagram illustrates the interconnectedness of agile modeling practices like requirements envisioning and stakeholder participation.](image5)`\nOn advanced teams, the output of elicitation might even be executable acceptance tests rather than traditional documents [10].\n\nNeeds Exploration establishes the initial understanding and ongoing discovery of requirements, while Elicitation Methods provide the specific techniques to continuously gather and refine these requirements directly from stakeholders, ensuring the project adapts to their evolving needs."}

Different modes are suited for different situations:\n![A table shows three focus modes: AF-S (single) for stationary subjects, AF-C (continuous) for moving subjects, and MF (manual) for touching the subject to focus.](image4)\n*   **AF-S (single)** is designed for stationary subjects, ensuring they remain sharp.\n*   **AF-C (continuous)** is better suited for moving subjects, continuously adjusting focus to track them.\n*   **MF (manual)** gives you direct control, allowing you to touch the screen to focus precisely on your chosen subject, like their face.\n\n**Metering Modes:**\nSimilarly, you can adjust the metering mode (`M`) in Pro mode [8]. This controls how the camera measures the light in the scene to determine the correct exposure:\n![A table shows three metering modes: Matrix for measuring light across the entire frame (ideal for landscapes), Center for focusing on light near the center (ideal for portraits), and Spot for focusing on light from a specific region.](image5)\n*   **Matrix** mode evaluates light across the entire frame, making it ideal for balanced exposures in scenes like natural landscapes.\n*   **Center** mode prioritizes the light in the center of the frame, which is often useful for portraits where the subject is centrally located.\n*   **Spot** mode measures light in a very small, specific area, allowing for precise exposure control on a particular point, such as a subject's eyes against a challenging background.\n\nPro Mode's distinct focus and metering modes enhance photography by allowing precise control over focus for stationary or moving subjects and tailoring light measurement for different scene types like landscapes or portraits."}
