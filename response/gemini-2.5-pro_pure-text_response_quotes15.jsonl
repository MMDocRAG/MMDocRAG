Several analyses highlight these differences.\n\nIn the U.S., there's a notable trend regarding perceptions of European allies' defense spending. While Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have historically been more likely than Democrats to say that U.S. European allies should increase their defense budgets, support for this view has fallen among both groups between 2017 and 2019 [5].

Supporters of major German parties like the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens typically name France as a key partner, with the U.S. also figuring prominently [1].\n![Bar chart displays numerical values for German political parties: CDU/CSU at 51, SPD at 41, and Greens at 28.](image2)\nA chart on \"German party supporters' views on the importance of the U.S. as a partner\" indicates that supporters of the CDU/CSU (51) tend to place a notable emphasis on the U.S. partnership, with differing levels of emphasis from SPD (41) and Greens (28) supporters.\n\nWithin the U.S., political affiliation is a strong determinant of which countries are considered the most important foreign policy partners. Both Republicans and Democrats largely agree on the UK's importance, but divergences appear with other nations [10]. Republicans and their leaners are notably keener on Israel (26%) compared to Democrats (9%), while Democrats place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico [10]. Despite these differences, views on Germany as a key partner are relatively similar across U.S. partisan lines, with both sides ranking it fifth [10].\n![Bar charts compare US Republican and Democrat preferences for key foreign policy partner countries, highlighting differing priorities.](image3)\nThe chart \"Republicans and Democrats differ on most important foreign policy partners\" details these distinct preferences.\n\nThe appetite for greater cooperation between the U.S. and Germany is also influenced by partisan identity.

This skepticism towards fairness is reflected in its acceptability; 68% of Americans find the use of personal finance score algorithms unacceptable, citing concerns such as privacy violations (26%) and the system not accurately representing a person (20%) `![A bar chart illustrates that 68% of U.S. adults find automated personal finance scores unacceptable, with privacy and inaccuracy as key concerns.](image2)` [9]. Indeed, when asked about fairness, a combined 66% of adults rate automated personal finance scores as \"not fair at all\" or \"not very fair\" `![A bar chart compares fairness perceptions across four automated systems, showing automated personal finance scores and video job interview analysis as least fair.](image4)`.\n\nIn contrast, the \"automated criminal risk score\" used for parole decisions is viewed differently. While 49% think this algorithm would be effective at identifying individuals deserving of parole, half (50%) believe it would be fair to those being analyzed [1]. In this case, the perceived fairness is slightly higher than its perceived effectiveness `![A table compares the perceived effectiveness and fairness of four automated systems, highlighting differences such as personal finance scores being +22 effective-fair and parole scores -1.](image3)`.\n\nOther systems also elicit varied responses.

Americans are generally skeptical about the fairness of these programs, with none being viewed as fair by a clear majority [7].\n\nThese differences in perception, especially the significant gap between effectiveness and fairness in some areas, imply a complex and often wary public trust in automated systems. A broad concern is that computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias, a view held by 58% of Americans, although 40% believe they can be designed to be bias-free [6] `![A bar chart shows a majority of adults, especially older ones, believe programs will always reflect designer bias rather than being bias-free.](image1)`. This underlying skepticism suggests that while the public may acknowledge the potential effectiveness of certain AI tools, concerns about fairness, bias, and privacy significantly temper their trust and acceptance.\n\nPerceptions of fairness and effectiveness diverge notably across automated systems—financial scoring is often seen as effective but unfair, whereas parole scoring is viewed as relatively more balanced in fairness and effectiveness; these disparities, alongside general concerns about bias, indicate a cautious and often limited public trust in these technologies."}

A significant portion (27%) cite a mixed background or their Hispanic ancestry being too far removed as the primary reason [10].\n![A bar chart indicates that 27% of individuals with Hispanic ancestry not identifying as Hispanic attribute it to a mixed background or distant ancestry.](image2)\nOther common reasons include their upbringing or limited contact with Hispanic relatives (16%), not speaking Spanish or lacking a connection to Hispanic culture (15%), identifying as another race or not looking Hispanic (12%), and being born in the U.S. and primarily identifying as American (9%) [10]. For a substantial majority (81%) of these individuals, they report having never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino [10].\n![A bar graph shows that 81% of individuals with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic report never having considered themselves as such.](image4)\n\nAmong those who do self-identify as Hispanic, the perceived importance of certain traditional cultural markers, like language and surname, also shifts across generations. While a majority of Latino adults across generations believe speaking Spanish is not a prerequisite for being considered Latino, this view is more pronounced in later generations: 58% of immigrant Latinos, 84% of second-generation Latinos, and 92% of third or higher generation Latinos share this sentiment [6]. Similarly, most self-identified Hispanics (84%) do not consider having a Spanish last name essential to Hispanic identity [4].\n![The chart illustrates that the belief that speaking Spanish is not required to be Latino increases from 58% among foreign-born to 92% among third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics, with a similar pattern for the non-necessity of a Spanish last name.](image5)\nThis indicates that as generations become more removed from their family's immigrant origins, the emphasis on these specific cultural traits as defining elements of Hispanic identity tends to lessen, while identification with American society often strengthens [8].\n\nOverall, factors such as generational proximity to immigration, mixed heritage, cultural engagement, language proficiency, and the strength of American identity influence Hispanic self-identification, with later generations often showing a decreased likelihood of identifying as Hispanic and placing less emphasis on traditional markers of ethnicity."}

For example, 26.8% of actual \"Supported\" claims and 23.6% of actual \"Refuted\" claims were predicted as \"NEI\" by InstructGPT [6]. Conversely, GPT-4 exhibits \"overconfidence,\" incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported (10.3% of actual NEI) or refuted (8.5% of actual NEI) [6]. This underscores that distinguishing whether a claim is verifiable is a key challenge in ScITaB [6]. Overall, open-source LLMs generally do not achieve promising results on ScITaB, with performance only moderately better than random guessing in 3-class settings, indicating a substantial gap compared to human performance [2].\n\nThe primary reasons for refuted claims in ScITaB are calculation errors and incorrect approximations, while NEI claims often result from insufficient evidence or lack of necessary knowledge; these factors make 3-class classification difficult for models, leading to specific error patterns like over-predicting NEI or misclassifying NEI as supported/refuted."}

This difficulty in accurately predicting the NEI class is a key challenge in the SCITAB dataset [10].\n\nThe SCITAB dataset presents unique challenges that contribute to these errors, such as table grounding, dealing with ambiguous claims, and compositional reasoning [4]. An analysis of errors in a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) model, which also struggles with the dataset, identified several error categories relevant to understanding model performance.\n`![Table showing types of errors in PoT model: Grounding errors (50%), Ambiguity errors (22%), Calculation errors (20%), and Program errors (8%).](image4)`\nGrounding errors, where the model incorrectly associates data with table cells, and ambiguity errors, where claims contain ambiguous expressions, are particularly prominent [9].

These types of errors likely affect InstructGPT and GPT-4 as well, contributing to their differing misclassification patterns for NEI, supported, and refuted claims.

A proposed demonstration compression technique, for example, results in notable efficiency gains. As detailed in Table 3 (referenced in the text), the speed-up ratio can range from 1.1x to 2.9x, with the extent of this gain being influenced by the length of the demonstrations [2].

The actual model confusion between categories is calculated using metrics like AUC-ROC and visualized through heatmaps [1]. A key insight is that if the key vectors for label words of different categories are similar, this similarity can lead to the model confusing these labels [4].\n`![A confusion matrix visualizing classification performance across different categories with varying accuracy levels.](image2)`\nConfusion matrices like this one are used to visualize these classification results, showing how well the model distinguishes between categories such as \"Abbreviation,\" \"Entity,\" and \"Description.\" For instance, when analyzing the GPT2-XL model on the TREC dataset, which exhibits varying levels of confusion between categories [7], the framework successfully identifies the most confusing category pairs (e.g., Description-Entity) [9].

Recall, however, remains stable at about 15% regardless of the number of absent knowledge elements. This stability in recall suggests that current Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a limited ability to identify absent knowledge. The rising precision and F1-Score indicate that as more knowledge is missing, the \"[NA]\" (Not Available) mechanism allows the generated outputs to locate this absent knowledge more accurately, highlighting the increasing importance of the “Conscious Incompetence” setting when the knowledge graph's coverage is more problematic [5].\n\nIn retrieval analysis, experiments simulate varying retrieval accuracy by replacing portions of ground truth knowledge graphs with irrelevant ones [1]. As retrieval accuracy decreases, there are clear downward trends in precision, recall, and F1-Score [10].\n![The line graph shows that as retrieval accuracy decreases from 100 (gold) to 20, precision, recall, F1 Score, and correctness all generally decrease, with recall showing a particularly significant drop.](image5)\nThe impact of poor retrieval quality is much more significant on recall than on precision. This suggests that the model has some ability to filter out incorrect knowledge, leading to a less pronounced effect on precision compared to recall. The reduction in recall is nearly linear as retrieval accuracy decreases, which is logical since knowledge cannot be cited if it is not provided [10]. Even with perfect retrieval, there is room for improvement in recall, though correctness of citations is less of a concern when retrieval accuracy is reasonably high [7].\n\nThese changes imply that while models can identify and to some extent filter out incorrect or irrelevant information (as seen in the retrieval analysis where precision drops less sharply than recall, and in the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting where precision in identifying *absent* knowledge improves), their ability to recall correct information is heavily dependent on it being provided or accurately retrieved, and their inherent ability to recognize what's missing is still limited but improves with mechanisms designed for such awareness."}

In fact, incorporating logical constraints with a smaller number of demonstrations can even surpass the performance of prompts with only a larger number of demonstrations without these constraints [7]. For example, on MAVEN-ERE, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints (25.7% Micro-F1) outperformed 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5% Micro-F1) [7]. This suggests the importance of providing LLMs with both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) [7].\n\nGenerally, an intuitive observation is that incorporating relevant logic into the LLM instruction is very helpful in solving reasoning tasks [3]. Models directly receive significant improvements when relevant logic is added [3]. For instance, when using generative-based approaches to encourage LLMs to produce logical constraints in the reasoning process, LLMs can significantly improve their performance [4].

Similarly, for GPT-4 on MAVEN-ERE, these figures are 1.4% and 1.6% respectively. Adding logical constraints into LLM instructions generally provides stable improvements in reasoning [2]. Iterative retrieval of logical constraints can also lead to a gradual decrease in logical inconsistency, as demonstrated with the MAVEN-ERE dataset, although the overall micro-F1 score might remain relatively stable due to potential \"over thinking\" by the LLMs [7].\n![Ablation study graph shows that logical inconsistency for MAVEN-ERE decreases with iterative retrieval of logical constraints.](image5)\nWhile logical constraints improve the inherent logicality of the model's generation process, post-processing directly enforces consistency on the final output, albeit with potential trade-offs in semantic accuracy [8].\n\nPost-processing is more effective at entirely eliminating logical inconsistencies by achieving 0% LI, whereas logical constraints significantly reduce logical inconsistency but do not always eliminate it across the specified models and datasets."}

It employs pre-retrieval strategies such as query routing, rewriting, or expansion, and post-retrieval strategies like reranking, summarization, or fusion of retrieved content to refine the information fed to the generator [1]. Advanced RAG also refines indexing techniques through methods like a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata [1].\n\nModular RAG represents a more significant leap, offering enhanced adaptability and versatility by allowing for the substitution or reconfiguration of modules to address specific challenges [5], [10]. This paradigm moves beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG by introducing new specialized components and adjusting interaction flows among existing ones [5]. For example, it can incorporate a dedicated Search module to query various data sources directly, a Memory module to leverage the LLM's memory to guide retrieval, or Routing modules to select optimal pathways for queries [7]. Modular RAG also supports more dynamic and adaptive retrieval processes, such as iterative retrieval or autonomously deciding when external knowledge retrieval is necessary, as seen in frameworks like FLARE and Self-RAG [6].\n![Iterative, recursive, and adaptive retrieval processes enhance RAG system performance by alternating retrieval and generation, refining queries into sub-problems, or deciding when external knowledge is needed.](image4)\nThis flexibility allows Modular RAG to integrate new modules or adjust interaction flows, enhancing its applicability across different tasks and allowing for more sophisticated query processing and document handling [5].\n\nThese frameworks differ in their approach to document retrieval and query processing: Naive RAG uses a simple retrieve-then-read process; Advanced RAG adds pre- and post-retrieval optimization strategies and refined indexing; and Modular RAG introduces a flexible, component-based architecture with specialized modules and adaptive, iterative processing capabilities."}

Given its better performance and flexibility, the collapsed tree approach (specifically with 2000 maximum tokens) was selected as the primary querying mechanism for RAPTOR in further experiments [3, 10].\n\nNow, considering \"RAPTOR with DPR\", which refers to the RAPTOR framework using DPR as its embedding model (and thus employing the collapsed tree querying strategy), its performance can be assessed.

The MLLMs then rank these retrieved class names, using advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, rather than just relying on the initial retrieval order [4]. This reranking process helps in accurately identifying objects, as shown by examples where MLLMs correct or refine the initial retrieved labels `![{A table demonstrates MLLMs reranking initially retrieved class names to correctly identify objects like \"earring\" and \"glove\"}](image2)`.

The DSC loss, in particular, consistently achieved high F1 scores across various datasets, showing significant improvements especially on more imbalanced sets [3].\n\nWhen considering accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets (SST-2 and SST-5), the choice of training objective for BERT is critical. Experiments involving fine-tuning $\\mathrm{BERT_{Large}}$ revealed that while Dice Loss (DL) and DSC were tested, they did not surpass the standard cross-entropy (CE) objective in terms of accuracy. For example, on the SST-5 dataset, BERT with CE achieved an accuracy of 55.57, whereas BERT with DL scored 54.63 and BERT with DSC scored 55.19. Similar observations were made for the SST-2 dataset, leading to the conclusion that Dice Loss is not primarily oriented towards accuracy and may not be optimal for such tasks [1].\n```markdown\n![Accuracy scores on SST-2 and SST-5 datasets show BERT+CE achieving higher accuracy (SST-2: 94.90, SST-5: 55.57) compared to BERT+DL and BERT+DSC.](image1)\n```\nThis table provides a clear comparison of accuracy scores, highlighting that BERT with cross-entropy (BERT+CE) performed best for sentiment classification on both SST-2 and SST-5 [8].\n\nFor Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, performance is often measured by the F1 score, which can be significantly influenced by the choice of loss functions and their specific hyperparameters. The Tversky index (TI), for example, offers flexibility in managing the trade-off between false negatives and false positives through its hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Experiments on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset demonstrated that the F1 score varied substantially as $\\alpha$ was adjusted [4].\n```markdown\n![F1 scores on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 and English QuoRef datasets vary with different alpha values for the Tversky Index, with optimal alpha values differing per dataset (e.g., 84.67 F1 at alpha=0.6 for Chinese Onto4.0, 68.44 F1 at alpha=0.4 for English QuoRef).](image2)\n```\nThe results indicate that the highest F1 score of 84.67 on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 dataset was achieved when $\\alpha$ was set to 0.6, while for the English QuoRef dataset, the optimal $\\alpha$ was 0.4, yielding an F1 score of 68.44. This underscores that hyperparameter tuning is crucial and dataset-dependent [4]. Moreover, on other Chinese NER datasets, the proposed DSC loss demonstrated superior performance, outperforming baselines by a significant margin in F1 scores, indicating its robustness in addressing data imbalance issues in NER tasks [10].\n\nData augmentation techniques on the QQP dataset affect BERT model performance based on whether they balance or exacerbate existing imbalances, with F1 scores typically used for measurement, while for sentiment analysis tasks accuracy is a key metric where cross-entropy often excels, and for NER tasks, F1 scores are heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions and their specific hyperparameters."}

Conversely, adding only negative examples (`+negative`) can lead to underperformance compared to the original, especially if this skews the dataset balance further [4]; one such `+negative` augmentation created a dataset with 21% positive and 79% negative examples [9]. Down-sampling negative examples (`-negative`) can create a balanced dataset, but the reduction in data size might lead to inferior results [4]. Augmenting with both positive and negative examples (`+positive & +negative`) is another method to achieve a balanced training set, for instance, with 50% positive and 50% negative examples [2]. The impact of these techniques on different BERT variants is detailed below.\n\n![Performance metrics of BERT model variations under different augmentation conditions, showing BERT, BERT+FL, BERT+DL, and BERT+DSC results across Original, +Positive, +Negative, -Negative, and +Positive & Negative scenarios.](image1)\nAmong these configurations, BERT+DSC tends to achieve the highest F1 scores, particularly on more imbalanced datasets where it significantly outperforms BERT+DL [6].\n\nFor Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) tasks, such as those involving SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef datasets, the BERT+DSC configuration provides significant improvements in both EM and F1 scores [1]. For example, when applied with XLNet, this approach improved F1 scores by +1.25 on SQuADv1.1 and +1.41 on QuoRef over the base XLNet [1].\n![Comparison of different models including BERT, BERT+FL, BERT+DL, and BERT+DSC on SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and QuoRef datasets, reporting EM and F1 scores.](image3)\n\nHowever, on accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification using the SST-2 and SST-5 datasets, BERT fine-tuned with a standard cross-entropy (CE) objective outperforms BERT+DL and BERT+DSC [3], [8]. This indicates that dice-based losses, like DL and DSC, may not be the best choice for tasks where accuracy is the primary metric [3].\n![Accuracy results for BERT+CE, BERT+DL, and BERT+DSC on SST-2 and SST-5 sentiment analysis datasets, where BERT+CE shows higher accuracy.](image4)\nThe Tversky index, a component of DSC, allows for adjustment between false positives and false negatives via hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The optimal settings for these can vary by dataset, as seen with Chinese OntoNotes4.0 achieving peak F1 at $\\alpha=0.6$ and QuoRef at $\\alpha=0.4$ [7].\n![Table showing F1 scores for Chinese Onto4.0 and English QuoRef datasets at varying alpha values for the Tversky Index, highlighting optimal alpha values differ per dataset.](image2)\n\nPerformance differences among BERT configurations depend on the augmentation technique, with `+positive` generally being beneficial and BERT+DSC excelling in F1-score driven tasks and imbalanced data, while standard objectives are better for pure accuracy tasks."}

Even with access to oracle goals, which significantly improves navigation performance on both tasks, the model completely fails to learn reasonable manipulation behavior for CHAI, illustrating its planning complexity [2].\n\nWhen examining the linguistic categories present in the instructions for LANI and CHAI, distinct differences emerge.\n![The table shows counts of linguistic categories for LANI and CHAI, such as LANI having 123 instances of \"Spatial relations between locations\" versus 52 for CHAI, and 94 instances of \"Constraints on the shape of trajectory\" for LANI versus 0 for CHAI.](image2)\nFor instance, \"Spatial relations between locations\" appear more frequently in LANI (123 occurrences) compared to CHAI (52 occurrences). Similarly, \"Conjunctions of two or more locations\" are more common in LANI (36) than CHAI (5). A notable difference is in \"Constraints on the shape of trajectory,\" which has 94 occurrences in LANI but none in CHAI. Conversely, \"Temporal coordination of sub-goals\" is relatively balanced, with 65 occurrences in LANI and 68 in CHAI.\n\nThe LANI and CHAI systems exhibit varied performance levels, with LANI tasks showing better model performance in navigation compared to CHAI where manipulation remains a significant challenge, and they also differ in the prevalence of specific linguistic categories within their instructional datasets."}

This performance is superior to other methods; for example, it improves TC accuracy by over 5 percentage points compared to CHAPLOT18, which scored 31.7% TC, and significantly surpasses MISRA17, which had a 17.5% TC [7]. Baselines such as STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT all registered 0.0% TC on LANI, further demonstrating the advanced capabilities of the proposed model for this task.\n\nFor the CHAI task, focusing on manipulation accuracy (MA), \"Our Approach\" yielded a score of 39.97%. This is particularly notable because both the CHAPLOT18 and MISRA17 methods failed to learn this aspect, each scoring 0.0% MA [7]. While a RANDOMWALK baseline managed 14.6% MA, \"Our Approach\" performed substantially better. However, it is important to acknowledge that all models, including the one proposed, exhibit poor performance on the CHAI task, especially in manipulation [7]. The challenge posed by CHAI is significant, as evidenced by human performance achieving 100% manipulation accuracy on this dataset, which highlights a large gap to current model capabilities [10]. The inherent planning complexity of the CHAI domain is considerable, to the extent that models can struggle to learn reasonable manipulation behavior even when provided with oracle goals [1].\n\nInsights from this comparison reveal that \"Our Approach\" offers a marked improvement in task completion on the LANI dataset and uniquely demonstrates the ability to learn manipulation on the CHAI dataset where other sophisticated methods do not.

Pretraining on corpora that retain paragraph structure or, more generally, using multiple sentences in each training example is crucial for many tasks and performs better than using individual sentences [4], [8].

One hypothesis is that creating consistent embedding spaces across source and target languages might be beneficial, as it could help the NMT system more easily learn correspondences between them [4]. To investigate this, an approach was adopted to learn orthogonal transformations that convert word embeddings of multiple languages into a single, shared space [4].\n\nFor bilingual translation tasks, the impact of aligning word embeddings on BLEU scores was found to be minimal.\n![The table displays BLEU scores for various language pairs translating to English, comparing unaligned and aligned embeddings; the changes are generally small and inconsistent.](image3)\nAs indicated by the data, the alignment of word embeddings did not yield significant benefits for training in these scenarios, with gains or losses being essentially insignificant across all languages [8]. For instance, translating Galician (GL) to English (EN) showed a BLEU score of 12.8 with unaligned embeddings and 11.5 with aligned embeddings, a decrease of 1.3. Conversely, Russian (RU) to English (EN) had a score of 21.1 unaligned and 21.4 aligned, a slight increase of 0.3 [8].\n\nHowever, in the context of multilingual NMT systems, aligning word embeddings demonstrated a more positive effect.\n![The table shows evaluation metrics for multilingual training, with the 'align' column consistently indicating the highest performance across different language evaluations.](image2)\nWhen applying pre-trained embeddings in multilingual settings, aligning the word embeddings helped to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks presented, such as GL + PT evaluated on GL, which showed a BLEU score of 22.4 with alignment compared to 20.8 with pre-trained but unaligned embeddings [7]. This increase is considered intuitive because a single encoder is used for both source languages, and alignment helps place their word embeddings into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn more effectively, similar to how it would train on a single language [7].\n\nThe alignment of word embeddings has a negligible impact on BLEU scores for bilingual translation tasks but generally improves BLEU scores in multilingual translation systems."}

This enhancement is not just quantitative; qualitative analyses, such as for Galician to English (GL→EN) translations, show that pre-training helps models capture rarer vocabulary (like names and multi-word phrases) and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [7].\n![A table shows a source sentence in another language, a reference English translation, a poor translation labeled 'bi:std', and a much better translation labeled 'multi:pre-align' which correctly translates names and phrases.](image2)\nThe effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings is significantly influenced by the amount of training data. There appears to be a \"sweet-spot\" where pre-trained embeddings are most beneficial: in scenarios with very little training data, but not so little that a system cannot be trained at all [4]. The gain in BLEU score is often highest when the baseline system is poor but has achieved a basic level of competence, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [9]. As training data increases, the advantage of pre-training tends to diminish.\n![Two line graphs show that pre-trained models (dashed lines) achieve higher BLEU scores than standard models (solid lines) especially at smaller training set sizes, and the gain from pre-training decreases as training set size increases.](image5)\nThe similarity between source and target languages also plays a crucial role. The general hypothesis is that pre-training yields larger gains when the languages are more linguistically similar, as their semantic neighborhoods are more likely to align [10], and this is supported by findings that pre-trained embeddings seem more effective for more similar translation pairs [4]. For instance, in multilingual translation experiments where a single encoder is used for two similar source languages, the gains from pre-trained embeddings are roughly in order of their similarity; GL/PT (Galician/Portuguese), a highly similar pair, showed larger gains compared to BE/RU (Belarusian/Russian), which are less similar [3, 6]. In these multilingual setups, aligning word embeddings is beneficial, ensuring that embeddings of different source languages are in similar vector spaces, which helps the model learn more effectively [3].\n![A table shows evaluation metrics for multilingual training (e.g., GL+PT evaluated on GL), where 'align' scores are consistently the highest, indicating the benefit of alignment in such setups.](image3)\nHowever, the relationship with language similarity can be nuanced. For bilingual translations into a common target language like Portuguese, while Romance languages (Spanish, French, Italian) showed improvements with pre-training, Hebrew (HE), which has no common family with Portuguese, showed the largest improvement (+8.9 BLEU) [8]. This suggests that languages with very low baseline BLEU scores, often due to dissimilarity or extreme low-resource conditions, have more \"headroom\" to improve and can thus see substantial gains from pre-training [8].\n![A table shows translation performance from various languages to Portuguese (PT), with Hebrew (HE) to PT showing the highest improvement (+8.9) despite its linguistic dissimilarity, while similar languages like Spanish to PT also show strong gains (+7.0).](image1)\nInterestingly, while *a priori* alignment of embeddings is helpful in multilingual training scenarios [3, 4], it may not always be necessary or beneficial in bilingual scenarios.\n![A table shows that for bilingual translations to English, aligning embeddings leads to mixed results: small decreases for GL->EN and PT->EN, a small increase for AZ->EN, and no change for BE->EN.](image4)\nThis indicates that the utility of pre-training is context-dependent, influenced by data availability, language characteristics, and the architectural choices of the NMT system [4].\n\nPre-training generally improves translation accuracy, especially in low-resource settings and for similar language pairs, though dissimilar languages with low baselines can also see large gains, and its effectiveness is modulated by training set size and whether embeddings are aligned, particularly in multilingual contexts."}

Some research suggests it may not be strictly necessary, as the NMT system itself can often learn a reasonable projection of word embeddings during its standard training process [2, 5].\n![Table showing mixed results of aligning word embeddings in bilingual NMT, with some language pairs showing decreased BLEU scores.](image4)\nEvidence from bilingual translation tasks, such as various language pairs to English (e.g., GL→EN, PT→EN), shows that aligning embeddings does not consistently improve BLEU scores; in some cases, scores decreased (e.g., -1.3 for GL→EN, -0.2 for PT→EN), while in others there was a slight increase or no change [4].\n\nConversely, for multilingual NMT systems, especially those sharing an encoder or decoder between multiple languages, aligning word embeddings proves more consistently beneficial [5, 10]. When a single encoder processes multiple source languages, pre-training and alignment ensure that the word embeddings of these languages are projected into similar vector spaces. This allows the model to learn more effectively, akin to training on a single language, and helps increase BLEU scores across different translation tasks [7].\n![Table showing BLEU score improvements with alignment in multilingual NMT setups for various language pairs.](image3)\nFor instance, in multilingual systems translating pairs like Galician (GL) and Portuguese (PT) into English (evaluated on GL), or Azerbaijani (AZ) and Turkish (TR) into English (evaluated on AZ), alignment consistently led to higher BLEU scores compared to using unaligned pre-trained embeddings or standard embeddings [7, 9].\n\nRegarding the translation of words with varying frequencies, pre-training word embeddings, which is often a precursor to or used in conjunction with alignment strategies, demonstrates a clear positive impact on the accuracy of translating target words, particularly those that appear infrequently in the training corpus [8].\n![Bar chart showing higher F-measure scores for pre-trained models compared to standard models, especially for lower frequency target words.](image2)\nAnalysis of F-measure scores, bucketed by word frequency, reveals that pre-training improves translation accuracy across the entire vocabulary. However, the most significant improvements are observed for low-frequency words, indicating that pre-trained embeddings help in providing better representations for less common concepts [8]. This is further supported by qualitative analyses, such as in Galician-to-English translation, where pre-training helped the model successfully translate rarer vocabulary, including proper names like \"chris\" and multi-word phrases such as \"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\" [4].\n![Qualitative comparison showing improved translation of specific low-frequency terms like names and multi-word phrases with pre-training and alignment.](image1)\nThis suggests that pre-trained embeddings are particularly useful in low-resource scenarios by enhancing the representation of less frequent words [4].\n\nIn summary, aligning word embeddings generally improves translation performance in multilingual NMT systems but has mixed effects in bilingual settings, while pre-training word embeddings significantly boosts F-measure scores for low-frequency target words."}

For instance, when the R-GCN component is removed from a model using GloVe embeddings, a notable performance drop of 8.0 points is observed on the unmasked validation set [2]. This underscores the R-GCN's contribution to updating mention representations based on their relationships with other mentions, even without deep contextual information [2].\n![Ablation study results showing performance (unmasked and masked) when different model components are removed.](image1)\nEven when using more powerful ELMo embeddings, the removal of the R-GCN component (indicated as \"No R-GCN\" in `image1`) results in performance scores of 62.4 for unmasked and 63.2 for masked conditions. These scores are lower than the full single model's performance of 65.1 (unmasked) and 70.4 (masked), suggesting that the task genuinely benefits from the multihop inference capabilities provided by R-GCN [4]. Comparing \"GloVe with R-GCN\" (59.2 unmasked, 11.1 masked) with \"GloVe w/o R-GCN\" (51.2 unmasked, 11.6 masked) further highlights the positive impact of the R-GCN, especially in the unmasked setting.\n\nThe method of incorporating relations is also crucial. If the model operates on a graph where all nodes are connected without distinguishing between different types of edges (\"No relation types\" in `image1`), the performance is 62.7 (unmasked) and 63.9 (masked). This configuration yields only slight improvements compared to not using R-GCN at all (62.4 unmasked, 63.2 masked), suggesting that a simple, undifferentiated graph is insufficient and that a more informative graph structure and sophisticated parameterization are needed [9].\n\nExamining the removal of specific types of relations independently reveals their differing degrees of importance [1]. Removing connections based on mentions co-occurring within the same document (DOC-BASED) has a considerable impact, as shown by the \"No DOC–BASED\" configuration in `image1` which scored 62.9 (unmasked) and 65.8 (masked). The model leverages DOC-BASED connections more effectively because these connections are predominant and convey vital information about the proximity of mentions [1]. The removal of connections between mentions that exactly match (MATCH), shown as \"No MATCH\" in `image1`, results in scores of 64.3 (unmasked) and 67.4 (masked). When edges predicted by a coreference system (COREF) are removed (\"No COREF\" in `image1`), the unmasked performance is 64.8. Coreference links and complement edges tend to play a more marginal role, partly because the MATCH heuristic already addresses simpler coreference instances, and external coreference systems might lack reliability on out-of-domain data [1]. Interestingly, incorporating a coreference system can sometimes even lead to performance degradation on test sets if the documents prove challenging for the coreference system [1].\n\nRemoving components like R-GCN, failing to distinguish between relation types, or omitting specific relation types such as DOC-BASED, MATCH, or COREF generally reduces model performance in both unmasked and masked settings, with the magnitude of this impact varying depending on the specific component."}

In the unmasked setting, entities might be referred to using different surface forms (e.g., “US” vs “United States”), and a coreference system is employed to link these mentions [2]. These coreferences are represented as distinct connections in the entity graph.\n![Mentions of entities in supporting documents are connected by different types of edges, with a bold-red line specifically indicating a coreference.](image1)\n\nAblation studies show that removing coreference links (`COREF`) in the unmasked setting has a relatively small impact. For instance, one experiment showed that the model makes better use of document-based (`DOC-BASED`) connections than `MATCH` or `COREF` connections, with coreference links playing a more marginal role [6]. This is partly because the `MATCH` heuristic already captures many easy coreference cases, and the out-of-domain coreference system may not always be reliable [6]. The performance of the full single model on the unmasked development set was 65.1, and removing coreference (`No COREF`) resulted in a score of 64.8 [6].\n![Table 3 shows that the 'full (single)' model achieved 65.1 in the unmasked setting, while the 'No COREF' configuration scored 64.8.](image2)\nOn the test set, results were somewhat surprising: the Entity-GCN model *without* coreference achieved a higher accuracy (67.6) in the unmasked setting compared to the model *with* coreference (66.4), suggesting that the coreference system might have introduced noise or errors on the test documents, which could be harder for it [6].\n![Table 5 shows the Entity-GCN without coreference (single model) achieved 67.6 on the unmasked test set, while the Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) scored 66.4.](image4)\n\nIn the masked setting, the scenario is different. Coreferred mentions are typically labeled with the same unique identifier (e.g., `MASK1`), regardless of their original surface forms [2]. This inherent characteristic of the masked data means that exact matching is more effective in recovering coreference links [10]. Consequently, the explicit addition of a coreference system is less critical, as the masking process itself aids in identifying coreferring entities [2]. While `image2` does not show a \"No COREF\" result for the masked setting, the text indicates that results are generally stronger in masked settings even without a dedicated coreference resolution system due to this labeling [2].\n\nThe inclusion of coreference information has a mixed impact on Entity-GCN: in unmasked settings, it can offer a marginal benefit or even slight degradation depending on the dataset, while in masked settings, its explicit role is diminished due to the nature of entity masking."}

Despite using GloVe embeddings instead of more advanced ones like ELMo, the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model still yields a competitive system, ranking above several baselines and even the Coref-GRU model on the unmasked validation set [6]. The R-GCN component is crucial for this model, as its absence leads to an 8.0 point drop in performance, underscoring R-GCN's role in updating mention representations based on their relationships [6].\n\nThe performance disparities are clear: the 'full (ensemble)' model surpasses the 'GloVe with R-GCN' model by 9.3 points (68.5 vs 59.2) in the unmasked condition and by a striking 60.5 points (71.6 vs 11.1) in the masked condition.\n\nThese overall performance differences are indicative of how they would manifest in relation-specific accuracy and precision. The 'Ensemble' model, which aligns with the 'full (ensemble)', exhibits high accuracy and precision across various relation types. For example, for the 'member_of_political_party' relation, it achieves an accuracy of 85.5 and a P@2 of 95.7, and for 'publisher', it shows 81.5 accuracy and 100.0 P@5 `![Table showing performance metrics (Accuracy, P@2, P@5) for different relations for Ensemble and Single models.](image2)`.

These experiments use the coreference propagation layer [8].\n![The table displays Entity F1 scores for DyGIE and other systems on ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA, with DyGIE achieving the highest scores.](image1)\n\nThe use of propagation layers, specifically coreference propagation (CorefProp) and relation propagation (RelProp), has distinct effects. Generally, relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in domains like ACE05 and SciERC, particularly where sentences have multiple relation instances [1]. Coreference propagation is mainly helpful for entities, especially on ACE05, but its impact on relation extraction can vary [1].\nAn ablation study on the ACE05 development set (Table 5 in the study [5]) shows the effects of removing these layers.\n![The table shows ablation results on entity and relation tasks for DyGIE, DyGIE without CorefProp, DyGIE without RelProp, and a Base model, with DyGIE (full model) achieving Entity F1 68.2 and Relation F1 42.0.](image2)\nIn this setting, removing CorefProp (-CorefProp) resulted in a slight decrease in Entity F1 (from 68.2 to 68.0) and Relation F1 (from 42.0 to 41.2).

Interestingly, for relation extraction, removing coreference propagation increases the F1 score from 58.4 to 60.2, supporting the observation that coreference propagation can sometimes hurt relation extraction on ACE05 [1]. Removing relation propagation (-RelProp) slightly decreases both Entity F1 (to 86.9) and Relation F1 (to 58.0). The study focuses on ablating coreference propagation's effect on entity extraction and relation propagation's effect on relation extraction [4]. The number of iterations for these propagation layers also matters; for instance, coreference propagation achieves its best performance on entity extraction with two iterations (N=2) [7].\n![The line graphs show that Entity F1 with CorefProp and Relation F1 with RelProp both peak at 2 iterations.](image3)\nFor ACE05, the best entity extraction performance was even obtained by switching the order, applying RelProp first, then CorefProp [9].\n\nOverall, DyGIE significantly improves entity and relation extraction across various datasets, with coreference and relation propagation layers generally enhancing performance, although the specific impact of coreference propagation on relation extraction can vary by dataset or configuration."}

Answer and AG news) and ontology classification (DBpedia), SWEMs have demonstrated strong performance. They sometimes surpass both LSTM and CNN compositional architectures, particularly in topic prediction where SWEM models leveraging both average and max-pooling features from word embeddings exhibit stronger results [7]. In fact, a SWEM-concat model even outperformed a 29-layer deep CNN in predicting topics [7]. For sentiment analysis within document classification, the SWEM-hier variant, which employs a hierarchical pooling operation, greatly outperforms other SWEM variants and achieves accuracies comparable to those of CNN or LSTM models. This suggests that hierarchical pooling effectively abstracts spatial (word-order) information from the input sequence, which is beneficial for these tasks [4]. This advantage is also observed in classifying Chinese text, where SWEM-hier performs comparably to CNN and LSTM, indicating that hierarchical pooling is particularly suitable for languages like Chinese that are more sensitive to local word-order features [8].\n\nWhen considering sentence matching tasks, which include natural language inference, answer sentence selection, and paraphrase identification, SWEMs again show notable results [1].\n![Table showing SWEM models achieving competitive or superior performance against CNN and LSTM on several sentence matching tasks.](image2)\nOn most of these datasets (with the exception of WikiQA), SWEMs demonstrated the best results compared to models using CNN or LSTM encoders.

This might be because, for shorter text sequences, word-order features—which CNNs are adept at capturing—tend to be more important since the semantic information provided by word embeddings alone is relatively limited [10]. Nevertheless, SWEMs exhibit comparable performance on other short sentence tasks like subjectivity classification (Subj) and question classification (TREC), often with significantly fewer parameters and faster training times [10].\n\nThe parameter efficiency of SWEMs is a key differentiator when compared to CNNs, particularly when their performance is analyzed across different subspace dimensions during subspace training [3, 9].\n![Line graphs comparing SWEM and CNN accuracy over different subspace dimensions, showing SWEM's higher accuracy in lower dimensions on one dataset and CNN's ability to leverage more parameters in higher dimensions on another.](image1)\nWhen pre-trained GloVe word embeddings are kept frozen and only model parameters are optimized, SWEM often shows significantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low subspace dimensions, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efficient in achieving a decent solution [3]. For example, on the AG News dataset, if a performance threshold of 80% testing accuracy is considered, SWEM demonstrates a lower intrinsic dimension (the minimum `d` to yield a good solution) than CNN. Conversely, on other datasets like Yelp P., CNNs can leverage a larger number of trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy when the subspace dimension `d` is large [3].\n\nSWEM models often perform comparably or better than CNNs, especially in document classification and sentence matching, and tend to be more parameter-efficient, whereas CNNs may have an advantage in tasks heavily reliant on capturing detailed word-order in short texts or when a larger model capacity can be effectively utilized."}

The benefit of transferring the embedding layer is particularly pronounced for datasets D3 and D4. This may be because these datasets have an extremely unbalanced label distribution, and with a small number of training examples in negative and neutral classes, the embeddings trained solely by aspect-level classification may not effectively capture the true semantics of relevant opinion words [7]. The small number of neutral examples in the test sets of D3 and D4 also means macro-F1 scores are more sensitive to small prediction differences for this class [2].\n\nWhen varying the percentage of document-level training examples used for a combined pretraining and multi-task learning approach (PRET  $^+$  MULT), clear performance trends emerge [5].\n![Line graphs demonstrate that increasing the percentage of document-level training examples generally improves accuracy and Macro-F1 scores for all four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4).](image3)\nThe improvements in accuracy are stable across all datasets as more document-level examples are incorporated.

In domain expansion experiments where a model pre-trained on four domains is fine-tuned on a new, held-out domain, GEM generally outperforms both naive and EWC fine-tuning methods, particularly in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, which is the tendency of a model to lose its ability to perform well on previously learned tasks when trained on a new one [6, 9].\n![Table 3 shows GEM outperforming Naive and EWC fine-tuning in domain expansion experiments.](image3)\nFor instance, when fine-tuning on the `hotel` domain, using GEM resulted in only a $5.44\\%$ drop in joint accuracy on the original four domains, whereas naive fine-tuning led to a much larger drop of $22.9\\%$ [5].

Knowledge about slots that are common or semantically similar across domains, such as `people`, `area`, `price range`, and `day`, can be successfully transferred from learned domains to new ones. This is evident in zero-shot analyses of `hotel` and `restaurant` domains, where these shared slots are tracked effectively [7].\n![Figure 5 shows successful knowledge transfer for shared slots in hotel and restaurant domains during zero-shot DST.](image2)\nConversely, slots that are unique to a new domain and have not been encountered before, like `parking`, `stars`, and `internet` in the `hotel` domain, or `food` in the `restaurant` domain, are very difficult for the model to track correctly in a zero-shot setting [7]. The similarity between slot embeddings, visualized in heatmaps, indicates that certain slots learn similar representations, likely due to sharing correlated values, such as \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars.\"\n![Heatmap shows cosine similarity between slot embeddings, highlighting correlations like 'destination' and 'departure'.](image5)\nThis implies that if a new domain contains slots similar to those already learned, the model can leverage this existing knowledge for better performance.\n\nFine-tuning strategies like GEM are more effective than EWC and naive approaches in adapting models to new domains while preserving knowledge from old domains, and slot similarities across domains facilitate knowledge transfer, thereby improving performance on shared or similar slots."}

This is potentially due to the iterative latent interactions within the BiDAF architecture, which are hypothesized to be more important for tasks requiring information distributed across multiple documents [4].\n\nExamining their performance under standard test conditions, we can observe specific scores.\n![The table shows BiDAF and FastQA performance scores on WikiHop and MedHop under standard and gold chain conditions for test and test*.](image3)\nFor instance, in the \"standard\" setting on WIKIHOP, BiDAF achieves scores like 42.9 (test) and 49.7 (test*), while FastQA scores 25.7 (test) and 27.2 (test*). On MEDHOP, BiDAF scores 47.8 (test) and 61.2 (test*), whereas FastQA gets 23.1 (test) and 24.5 (test*) under the same standard conditions [image3].\n\nWhen answers are masked, a technique used to prevent models from relying on spurious lexical cues [8], both neural RC models, BiDAF and FastQA, are largely able to retain or even improve their strong performance because they can leverage the textual context of candidate expressions [9].\n![This table displays performance metrics for models including FastQA and BiDAF under standard and masked conditions across test and test* categories.](image4)\nIn the masked setup on WIKIHOP, BiDAF mask scores 54.5 (test) and 59.8 (test*), and FastQA mask scores 35.8 (test) and 38.0 (test*). For MEDHOP under masking, BiDAF mask achieves 33.7 (test) and 42.9 (test*), while FastQA mask obtains 31.3 (test) and 30.6 (test*) [image3]. The reduction of answer vocabulary to single-token mask expressions on WIKIHOP helps models select candidate spans, whereas on MEDHOP, where drug mentions are normalized, performance drops under masking [9].\n\nIn a \"gold chain\" setup, where models are presented with only the relevant documents leading to the correct answer, performance improves greatly [1].\n![The table shows BiDAF and FastQA performance scores on WikiHop and MedHop under standard and gold chain conditions for test and test*.](image3)\nFor WIKIHOP in this gold chain scenario, BiDAF mask reaches up to 81.2% (test) and 85.7% (test*). On MEDHOP, BiDAF mask can achieve almost perfect scores, like 99.3% (test) and 100.0% (test*) [image3, 1]. This indicates that RC models can identify the answer when few or no plausible false candidates are present [1].\n\nExperiments designed to test if neural RC models can draw upon information requiring multi-step inference by discarding documents without candidate mentions showed that BiDAF's performance drops significantly on both MEDHOP (3.3%/6.2%) and WIKIHOP (10.0%/2.1%), demonstrating its ability to leverage cross-document information. FastQA, with fewer latent interactions, shows mixed results, with a slight increase on WIKIHOP and a decrease on MEDHOP, suggesting it has more difficulty integrating cross-document information [3].\n\nOverall, BiDAF generally outperforms FastQA on both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets across standard, masked, and gold chain test conditions, with both models showing improvement in the gold chain setting."}

The RetNRef model shows some improvement, particularly in doubling the use of rare words, but its statistics are still not close to human levels. However, the RetNRef++ model significantly improves these statistics, bringing them much closer to human utterances, with a word count of 12.7 and 2.3% usage of rare words (frequency <100), compared to human statistics of 13.0 words and 3.0% rare words respectively [8]. This suggests RetNRef++ is better at generating more diverse and potentially engaging content.\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, perplexity is considered a flawed metric for dialogue evaluation, especially for retrieve and refine models, as a model might refine a retrieved response that is valid but different from the true response, leading to poor perplexity despite good human judgment [5, 10]. For instance, RetNRef++ performs worse in terms of perplexity than other models, yet it shows improved human judgments [10].\n\nHuman evaluation provides more direct insights. The RetNRef++ model demonstrates superior engagingness scores compared to Seq2Seq and even slightly outperforms the retriever it conditions on, while still maintaining the ability to generate novel text [9].\n![The table presents engagingness, fluency, consistency, and persona scores for various models.](image2)\nThe table shows RetNRef++ achieving an engagingness score of 3.80, higher than Seq2Seq (PPL) at 2.70 and Memory Network at 3.66. However, RetNRef++ (and Memory Network) is weaker at using persona (0.65) compared to Seq2Seq (0.90 for Seq2Seq PPL) [9].\n\nA/B tests comparing models directly show that RetrieveNRefine (RetNRef) obtains statistically significant wins over both the Memory Network retriever and the Seq2Seq generator, with a win rate of around 54% [6].\n![The table displays win rates, number of wins for A and B, ties, and p-values for various model comparisons.](image1)\nFor example, RetNRef vs. Memory Network shows A wins at 380 and B wins at 325, and RetNRef vs. Seq2Seq shows A wins at 376 and B wins at 327. This indicates RetNRef can effectively learn when to use a retrieved utterance and when to generate a new one [6]. Small sample A/B tests directly against humans also show a higher win rate for RetNRef [3].\n\nThe RetNRef++ model effectively utilizes the retriever, showing over 80% word overlap with the retriever's output about 53% of the time [1].\n![The table shows the percentage distribution of performance for Seq2Seq, RetNRef, RetNRef+, and RetNRef++ across different percentage ranges (<30%, 30-60%, 60-80%, >80%).](image4)\nThis contrasts with Seq2Seq and the basic RetNRef, which rarely have such high overlap (3% and 8% respectively). This demonstrates that RetNRef++ uses the retriever but can also generate novel content [1]. Example dialogues illustrate that longer, more nuanced sentences from RetNRef++ often come from attending to the retriever, while it can also produce shorter, contextually appropriate replies independently [4].\n![The table shows example conversations comparing responses from Seq2Seq, MemNet, and RetNRef+.](image5)\nWhile there are still issues like repeated phrases [4], overall, the RetNRef++ model produces conversations that are more engaging and have statistics closer to human utterances [7].\n\nThe main differences show that RetNRef++ generally produces more human-like word statistics and achieves higher engagement in conversations compared to Seq2Seq and older RetNRef versions, though it may be weaker in persona consistency."}

Asset management revenues in 2020 increased by 15% compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average AUM, which was driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows [9]. This suggests that the growth in the volume of assets managed more than offset the impact of declining fee rates on overall revenue.\n\nOverall, AUM increased significantly while fee rates generally decreased from 2018 to 2020, with the growth in AUM leading to higher asset management revenues for the firm."}

QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) revenues saw a substantial 64% increase in fiscal 2021.

A significant portion of these liabilities relates to the company's extensive insurance operations. Consolidated claim liabilities, including those from retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021, with about 80% pertaining to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group [2]. The invested assets of these insurance businesses are derived from shareholder capital and \"float,\" which approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase from $138 billion at the end of 2020 [10]. This float includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which for \"Insurance and Other\" increased from $79,854 million in 2020 to $86,664 million in 2021 (image2). However, claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, positively impacting pre-tax earnings [6]. Another notable change in liabilities was the increase in \"Income taxes, principally deferred,\" which grew from $74,098 million in 2020 to $90,243 million in 2021 (image2). Regarding debt, Berkshire parent company debt outstanding decreased by $1.3 billion to $21.4 billion at December 31, 2021, mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate changes, alongside repayments and new issuances of senior notes [7]. The consolidated \"Notes payable and other borrowings\" for \"Insurance and Other\" decreased from $41,522 million to $39,272 million, while for \"Railroad, Utilities and Energy\" it slightly decreased from $75,373 million to $74,990 million (image2).\n\nShareholders' equity saw substantial growth. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021, was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020 [4]. This is reflected in the balance sheet, moving from $443,235 million in 2020 to $506,229 million in 2021 (image2). A primary driver for this increase was net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders, which amounted to $89.8 billion in 2021 [4]. These earnings included significant after-tax gains on investments of approximately $61.6 billion [4].\n![The table displays Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated statements of earnings for 2021, 2020, and 2019, highlighting revenues, costs, and net earnings.](image4)\nThe comprehensive income statement also details how net earnings contribute to the overall financial health.\n![The table shows Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated statements of comprehensive income for 2021, 2020, and 2019, including net earnings and other comprehensive income components.](image5)\nChanges in the components of shareholders' equity, such as retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income, are further detailed.\n![The table illustrates changes in Berkshire Hathaway's equity components, including common stock, accumulated other comprehensive income, retained earnings, treasury stock, and non-controlling interests from 2018 to 2021.](image3)\nFor 2021, \"Other Comprehensive Income, Net\" was $234 million, which included factors like unrealized appreciation/depreciation of fixed maturity securities and foreign currency translation effects (image5). The company's insurance companies maintain exceptionally high capital strength, with the combined statutory surplus of U.S.-based insurers at approximately $301 billion at December 31, 2021 [5, 8].\n\nIn summary, Berkshire Hathaway's total liabilities increased primarily due to growth in insurance-related liabilities and deferred income taxes, while its shareholders' equity significantly rose, largely driven by strong net earnings which included substantial investment gains."}

Revenue declines were particularly significant in this segment, impacted by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [5]. Specifically, in the International Operated Markets, company-operated sales decreased by 19% and franchised revenues fell by 14% from 2019 to 2020 [image5].\n![A table details revenue changes by market, showing significant decreases in International Operated Markets for both company-operated and franchised revenues in 2020.](image5)\nWhile the U.S. market showed some positive sales performance, this was offset by support provided for marketing and incentives to franchisees [6].

Other factors contributing to the financial picture included increased Selling, General & Administrative Expenses due to commitments to charities and brand communications, over $200 million in incremental franchisee support, and higher restaurant closing costs [7].

Conversely, Noncontrolling interests decreased substantially by $509 million (from $514 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022).\n\nThe substantial decrease in noncontrolling interests is largely attributable to Costco's strategic decision to acquire the equity interest of its Taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner during 2022 for $842 million [1].

The company strives to ensure stable and continuous dividend payments, with a target to maintain and improve upon a consolidated payout ratio of 30% [10].\n![The table shows Toyota's dividend payments, payout ratios, and share repurchases from fiscal year 2017 to 2021, illustrating their commitment to shareholder returns.](image5)\nThis approach demonstrates a balance: utilizing retained earnings for vital investments in next-generation growth, such as environmental technologies for electrification, while also ensuring consistent returns to shareholders.\n\nToyota's financial strategy correlates by using reinforced profitability and retained earnings to fund essential electrification measures in response to climate scenarios, while simultaneously striving to provide stable dividend returns to its shareholders."}

These shifts were influenced by both underlying business performance and significant internal reallocations of revenue and expenses.\n\nFor the Corporate Centre, there was a substantial improvement in its financial metrics. Its net operating income increased by $392 million, moving from a loss of $(654) million in 2019 to a smaller loss of $(262) million in 2020. Similarly, profit before tax for the Corporate Centre rose by $387 million, from $924 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020.\n![Image4 presents adjusted financial results, indicating a $392 million increase in net operating income and a $387 million rise in profit before tax for the Corporate Centre in 2020 compared to 2019.](image4)\nThis improved performance in the Corporate Centre was partly due to changes in its components, such as an $85 million positive change in legacy portfolios and a $321 million positive change in \"Other\" revenue, though Central Treasury revenue saw a small decline [2].\n![Image3 shows components of Corporate Centre's adjusted revenue, contributing to an overall increase in its net operating income in 2020 from 2019.](image3)\nA key factor in the Corporate Centre's improved results was the reallocation of certain items to global businesses. During 2020, revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina began to be allocated to the global businesses [10]. Additionally, certain funding costs previously retained in Corporate Centre in 2019 were allocated to global businesses from January 1, 2020 [4]. These reallocations aimed to better reflect where revenue and expenses were generated or utilized [10] and likely reduced the net costs held within the Corporate Centre. The Corporate Centre's results primarily comprise the share of profit from associates and joint ventures, Central Treasury revenue, stewardship costs, and consolidation adjustments [2]; the share of profit from associates and JVs was $2,054 million in 2020, a decrease from 2019 (image4).\n\nIn contrast, the Global Banking and Markets (GBM) segment experienced changes in its adjusted revenue streams. For Global Markets, adjusted revenue in 2020 was $7,290 million, a significant increase of $1,562 million (27%) compared to 2019, largely driven by a 33% rise in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) revenue, which reached $6,278 million [image1]. Within FICC, Credit revenue saw a substantial 90% increase. Global Banking, however, saw its adjusted revenue decrease slightly by $71 million (2%) to $3,804 million in 2020 [image1].\n![Image1 details the adjusted revenue for various business lines, including Global Markets and Global Banking, showing a significant increase in Global Markets revenue and a slight decrease in Global Banking revenue for 2020 compared to 2019.](image1)\nCollectively, the combined adjusted revenue for Global Markets and Global Banking increased by $1,491 million. The reallocation policy also benefited the global businesses; for instance, \"Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense and Argentina Hyperinflation\" contributed $340 million to revenue in these business lines in 2020, an increase of $284 million from 2019 (image1), reflecting the shift mentioned in text quote [10]. Profit before tax figures for the specific Global Banking and Markets segment are not detailed in the provided quotes.\n\nThese operational changes occurred against a backdrop of significant global economic events, primarily the Covid-19 outbreak, which weakened GDP in many markets [1] and required banks to play an expanded role in supporting society and customers [5]. The pandemic also dominated the geopolitical and economic landscape [8]. Despite these challenges, the Group’s balance sheet and liquidity remained strong [3], and it conducted internal stress tests to assess resilience [7]. The Group's Return on average tangible equity (RoTE) was 3.1% in 2020 (image2, image4).\n\nThe Corporate Centre's net operating income and profit before tax improved significantly from 2019 to 2020, largely due to internal reallocations and changes in legacy items, while the Global Banking and Markets segment saw a substantial increase in combined adjusted revenue driven primarily by strong performance in Global Markets."}

The discontinuation of LIBOR is a factor being evaluated for its potential impact on these facilities [9]. As of December 31, 2020, the Five Year Revolver due July 2023 had an annualized weighted average interest rate of 2.06% [3]. Another facility, the Seven Year Fixed Facility, bears an interest rate of 4.06% per annum [4]. Details of the company's debt can be seen in its financial statements.\n![Table showing outstanding balances for various debt facilities including Ten Year Fixed Facility, Seven Year Fixed Facility, Five Year Revolver due July 2023, Five Year Revolver due December 2022, Five Year Fixed Facility, and 2019 Zydeco Revolver as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.](image4)\nDepreciation and amortization expense on property, plant, and equipment was $50 million in 2020 and $49 million in 2019 [7]. These non-cash expenses relate to the company's long-lived assets.\n![Table detailing property, plant, and equipment values including land, buildings, pipeline and equipment, other, total, accumulated depreciation and amortization, construction in progress, and net property, plant, and equipment for years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.](image3)\nThe company also evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment; however, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, no triggering event for impairment of property, plant, and equipment was identified in 2020 [6]. The total debt (before amortization of issuance costs) was $2,694 million as of December 31, 2020 [10].\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, Amberjack's net income decreased from $157 million to $126 million, while Mars' net income increased from $154 million to $161 million; specific net income data for 2020 is unavailable, and these changes could be influenced by various financial factors including operating performance, financing costs, and depreciation."}

Consolidated costs and expenses in 2020 included an adjustment of $177 million related to a legal settlement, though this was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and segment operating results [3]. More significantly, 2020 saw cost-saving initiatives that included severance charges, particularly at NBCUniversal, with these costs presented in Corporate and Other [7]. Expenses also increased across NBCUniversal, Cable Communications, and Sky segments in 2020 [3].\n\nThe subsequent rebound in Adjusted EBITDA in 2021 was driven by a combination of revenue growth and expense management. Overall revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting a general market recovery [1]. For example, revenue in one segment increased by 18.5% from 2020 to 2021, although its Adjusted EBITDA shifted from $32 million in 2020 to $(65) million in 2021 due to operating costs and expenses increasing by 14.4% [image1].\n![A table showing financial data for a segment from 2019-2021, including revenue, operating costs, and Adjusted EBITDA.](image1)\n\nIn the Corporate and Other segment, Adjusted EBITDA improved from $(1,785) million in 2020 to $(1,358) million in 2021.

Revenue for Corporate and Other, which includes Sky Glass, increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at Comcast Spectacor (recovering from COVID-19 impacts) and sales of Sky Glass televisions [6].\n![A table detailing revenue categories and operating cost components for a segment, likely Sky, for 2019-2021.](image4)\nHowever, the Sky segment also saw increased expenses due to direct network costs and other expenses [3].\n\nThe NBCUniversal segment experienced increased expenses in 2021 due to growth in its Media, Studios, and Theme Parks segments. Similarly, the Cable Communications segment saw higher expenses from increased programming costs, technical and product support, franchise fees, and marketing, although this was partially offset by decreases in other areas like customer service expenses [3].\n\nComcast Corporation's Adjusted EBITDA varied across its segments and over the 2019-2021 period due to market recovery post-COVID, strategic revenue growth in areas like Sky Glass, and changes in operating expenses influenced by programming costs, severance charges, and cost-saving initiatives."}

Similarly, unallocated SG&A expenses grew from $413 million in 2019 to $538 million in 2021 (image1). In contrast, unallocated cost of revenues fell from $430 million in 2019 to $277 million in 2021, and unallocated interest expense also decreased over this period (image1). Unallocated other income (expenses) shifted from an expense of $414 million in 2019 to $0 in 2021 (image1).\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the company also completed the acquisition of NUVIA, Inc. on March 16, 2021, for approximately $1.1 billion (net of cash acquired) [5]. This acquisition led to the recognition of various assets and liabilities.\n![Table detailing assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, resulting in net assets acquired.](image4)\nThe net assets acquired from NUVIA totaled $1,264 million, composed of $174 million in cash, $247 million in in-process research and development (IPR&D), $885 million in goodwill, and $26 million in other assets, offset by $68 million in liabilities (image4).\n\nComparing these financial activities, the decrease in unallocated revenues from 2019 to 2021, which amounted to $4,669 million (from $4,723 million down to $54 million) (image1), was considerably larger—over 3.7 times—than the $1,264 million in net assets acquired from NUVIA (image4). The increase in unallocated R&D expenses during the same period, an $831 million rise (from $989 million to $1,820 million) (image1), was also significant, representing approximately 66% of the NUVIA net assets acquired and being comparable in scale to the $885 million of goodwill recognized from the NUVIA deal (image4).\n\nUnallocated revenues significantly decreased while certain unallocated expenses like R&D increased from 2019 to 2021; the magnitude of the revenue decrease was substantially larger than the NUVIA net assets acquired in 2021, while the R&D expense increase was a considerable portion of it."}

The growth in operating cash flow primarily reflected lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in 2020 [2]. Capital spending remained relatively consistent year-over-year [image1].\n\nThe company's investing activities saw a significant increase in cash utilization. Net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion in 2020, up substantially from $6.4 billion in 2019.\n`![Table summarizing PepsiCo's net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for 2020 and 2019.](image4)`\nThis increase was primarily due to $5.75 billion in net cash paid for acquisitions, including Rockstar ($3.85 billion), Pioneer Foods ($1.2 billion), and Be & Cheery ($0.7 billion), alongside net capital spending of $4.2 billion [3]. These acquisitions also influenced contractual commitments. For example, PepsiCo has commitments related to estimated future tax benefits from the Rockstar acquisition and commitments to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa linked to the Pioneer Foods acquisition [1](e). Furthermore, there are commitments to incur capital expenditures and/or business-related costs associated with the Pioneer Foods acquisition [1](i).\n\nFinancing activities in 2020 provided a net cash inflow of $3.8 billion, a notable shift from 2019 when these activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $8.5 billion [image4]. The 2020 inflow was primarily driven by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $13.8 billion, which were partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases totaling $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion, and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion [5]. In contrast, 2019's financing cash use was mainly for dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.3 billion and debt payments, partially offset by debt issuances [10]. PepsiCo uses its free cash flow for such acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends, and share repurchases [9].\n\nAs of December 26, 2020, PepsiCo's total contractual commitments amounted to $66.3 billion.\n`![Table detailing PepsiCo's contractual commitments and liabilities by type and due period as of year-end 2020.](image5)`\nThese obligations include $40.3 billion in long-term debt, nearly $16 billion in associated interest payments, $1.9 billion in operating leases, and a $3.2 billion transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, alongside commitments for purchases and marketing [1], [image5].\n\nIn 2020, PepsiCo's financial activities led to higher free cash flow than in 2019 due to increased operating cash, while acquisitions expanded investment outflows and added to contractual commitments, and financing activities provided net cash, contrasting with the net use of cash in the prior year."}

Specifically, revenue in Global Markets rose by 27% ($1,562 million) to $7,290 million in 2020 `![GBM adjusted revenue by sector table for 2020, 2019, and 2018, showing a $1,562 million increase in Global Markets revenue from 2019 to 2020.](image4)`. This was largely due to heightened volatility, increased client activity, and wider spreads, leading to a 33% increase in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) revenue, with Foreign Exchange, Rates, and Credit all performing strongly [10, image4]. This robust performance in Global Markets helped to more than offset the adverse impact of lower global interest rates and unfavorable movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments [1]. It also compensated for revenue declines in other areas within GBM, such as a 2% decrease in Global Banking revenue, which was affected by lower fee income in real estate and structured finance, despite growth in capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending [4, image4].\n\n![Table showing GBM's adjusted financial results for 2020, 2019, and 2018, with Net Operating Income at $15,303m in 2020 and $14,869m in 2019, and Profit Before Tax at $4,830m in 2020 and $5,172m in 2019.](image3)\n\nDespite the rise in net operating income, GBM's adjusted profit before tax decreased by 7% from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million in 2020 [image3].

The primary reason for this decline in profit was a substantial increase in the 'Change in Expected Credit Losses and Other Impairment Charges' for GBM, which rose from $153 million in 2019 to $1,209 million in 2020 [image3]. This increase in credit loss provisions significantly impacted profitability. However, a reduction in operating expenses provided some offset; GBM's operating expenses fell by $280 million (3%) from $9,544 million in 2019 to $9,264 million in 2020 [image3], reflecting successful cost reduction initiatives [8].\n\nGBM's net operating income increased due to strong Global Markets performance, while its profit before tax decreased primarily because of significantly higher expected credit losses, partially mitigated by lower operating expenses."}

Similarly, for Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022 [9].\n![The table shows discount rates for Pension Benefits increased from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022, and for Other Retiree Benefits from 3.2% in 2021 to 5.0% in 2022.](image1)\nSince pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, such increases in discount rates generally lead to a decrease in the present value of plan obligations [10]. This reduction in obligations typically results in actuarial gains. Indeed, the actuarial gain for pension plans in 2022 was primarily related to increases in discount rates, and increases in discount rates also contributed to actuarial gains for other retiree benefits in 2022 [4]. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $135 million for pension plans and $10 million for OPRB plans, illustrating the sensitivity of these figures to discount rate changes [10].\n\nRegarding the expected return on plan assets, for Pension Benefits, this assumption decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022.

A decrease in this rate, as seen with Pension Benefits, would typically increase the net periodic benefit cost. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $125 million [1].\n\nThese changes in assumptions, particularly the significant rise in discount rates, likely contributed to an improvement in the net amount recognized on the balance sheet. For Pension Benefits, the net amount recognized changed from a net liability of $(5,428) million as of June 30, 2021, to a reduced net liability of $(2,435) million as of June 30, 2022.

This is reflected in image4 where \"Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings Interest Expense and Argentina Hyperinflation\" revenue, allocated to global businesses, increased by $284 million.\n\nRegarding net operating income, the Corporate Centre's net operating income improved considerably.\n![Corporate Centre's net operating income improved by $392 million, or 60%, from -$654 million in 2019 to -$262 million in 2020.](image1)\nThis improvement in the Corporate Centre's net operating income from -$654 million in 2019 to -$262 million in 2020 was influenced by factors such as a significant positive change in legacy portfolios, which improved by $94 million, and in the \"Other\" category, which improved by $321 million (image1). Furthermore, changes in how certain items were accounted for played a role; for instance, certain funding costs previously retained in the Corporate Centre were allocated to global businesses starting January 1, 2020 [7]. The reallocation of revenue and expenses for Markets Treasury, funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses also contributed to this shift, improving how revenue and expenses related to these activities are reflected [1].\n\nHSBC's adjusted revenue from Global Markets increased by $1,562 million (27%) in 2020 due to strong FICC performance and revenue reallocations, while its Corporate Centre net operating income improved by $392 million, influenced by changes in legacy portfolios and the reallocation of certain costs and revenues to global businesses."}

Excluding the Olympics' impact, Media revenue still saw an $11.0\\%$ increase, driven by distribution, advertising, and the growth of Peacock [1]. Peacock, a key initiative for direct customer engagement, generated $\\S778$ million in revenue in 2021, a substantial increase from $\\S118$ million in 2020 [1, 9]. This growth was supported by continued investment in content and customer acquisition, including the introduction of Peacock programming into Sky video services in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the fourth quarter of 2021 [1].

This segment saw its net interest income fall by $3.5 billion in 2020 [8].\n`![Net interest income for Total Consumer Banking decreased from $28,158M in 2019 to $24,698M in 2020.](image1)`\nThis substantial decrease in Consumer Banking's net interest income accounted for a large part of the corporation's total $5.5 billion NII decline [1, 8]. The bank's \"All Other\" segment, which incorporates Asset and Liability Management (ALM) activities [image2], plays a crucial role in managing interest rate risks across the entire organization. The overall changes in net interest income and expense demonstrate how the bank's various segments, especially the extensive Consumer Banking division, were affected by and responded to the evolving interest rate landscape, with ALM strategies aiming to mitigate adverse effects, such as through reduced deposit and funding costs [1].\n\nThe major differences were a shift from net interest income growth in 2018-2019 to a significant decline in 2019-2020, and a corresponding shift from increasing to decreasing interest expense, reflecting the broad impact of the interest rate environment on core operations within Bank of America's segmented organizational structure, particularly Consumer Banking."}

Specifically, these earnings declined by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 [10]. This was influenced by a significant drop in interest and other investment income.\n![The table shows Net Investment Income was $4,807 million in 2021, down from $5,039 million in 2020.](image2)\nThe decline in interest and other investment income was substantial, falling by 44.4% in 2021 compared to 2020 [6]. This reduction was primarily attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as low interest rates prevailed throughout 2021 [6].\n\nConcurrently, the asset composition of the insurance business saw notable shifts between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021.\n![The table shows cash and cash equivalents increased from $67,082 million to $90,688 million, equity securities increased from $269,498 million to $334,907 million, and fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million to $16,386 million from 2020 to 2021.](image1)\nHoldings of \"Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills\" increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021.

Conversely, \"Fixed maturity securities\" decreased from $20,317 million to $16,386 million over the same period. The company maintained substantial balances of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, prioritizing safety over yield in a low-rate environment [6].\n\nThe implications of these changes are multifaceted. The decrease in net investment income, driven by lower interest income, suggests reduced earnings from traditionally safer, interest-bearing assets [6, 10]. The shift in asset composition towards more cash and U.S. Treasury Bills enhances liquidity, aligning with the strategy of prioritizing safety [6]. The increased allocation to equity securities offers the potential for higher returns, but also introduces greater volatility to periodic net earnings, as unrealized gains and losses from these investments are included in reported earnings [9].\n\nNet investment income decreased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to lower interest income, while the asset composition shifted towards more cash and equity securities and less in fixed maturity securities, implying enhanced liquidity and potential for higher but more volatile returns alongside reduced income from fixed-income assets."}

The upstream segment, which is the primary driver of the company's earnings [3], experienced a substantial recovery in 2021 after a challenging 2020.\n![The table displays Chevron's earnings by major operating area, including Upstream and Downstream operations, for 2019, 2020, and 2021, along with the total net income.](image1)\nIn 2019, total upstream operations recorded earnings of $2,576 million. This turned into a loss of $2,433 million in 2020, before rebounding significantly to earnings of $15,818 million in 2021. Specifically, U.S. upstream operations went from a loss of $5,094 million in 2019 and $1,608 million in 2020 to earnings of $7,319 million in 2021 [5]. This increase in 2021 was attributed to higher realizations, the absence of prior year impairments and write-offs, higher sales volumes, and asset sales gains [5]. Similarly, international upstream operations earned $7,670 million in 2019, saw a loss of $825 million in 2020, and then reported strong earnings of $8,499 million in 2021 [6]. The improvement in international upstream earnings in 2021 was primarily due to higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments, write-offs, and severance charges [6]. The most significant factor affecting upstream results is the price of crude oil [3].\n![The graph shows quarterly average spot prices for Brent Crude Oil, WTI Crude Oil, and Henry Hub Natural Gas from 2019 to 2021, indicating a dip in 2020 and a rise in 2021.](image5)\nThe trend in crude oil prices, with a dip in 2020 and a subsequent rise through 2021, correlates with the upstream segment's performance.\n\nChevron's downstream operations also experienced shifts, though the impact on overall earnings was less pronounced than that of the upstream segment. Total downstream earnings were $2,481 million in 2019, fell to $47 million in 2020, and recovered to $2,914 million in 2021. U.S. downstream operations reported earnings of $1,559 million in 2019, a loss of $571 million in 2020, and then earnings of $2,389 million in 2021 [9]. The increase in 2021 U.S. downstream earnings was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales, increased earnings from CPChem, and higher sales volumes [9]. International downstream earnings were $922 million in 2019, $618 million in 2020, and $525 million in 2021 [2]. The decrease in international downstream earnings in 2021 compared to 2020 was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales and higher operating expenses [2].\n\nThese trends in the upstream and downstream segments culminated in significant variations in Chevron's net income. The company reported a net income of $2,924 million in 2019. This turned into a net loss of $5,543 million in 2020, largely driven by the downturn in upstream earnings. However, with the strong recovery in the upstream sector and improved downstream performance in the U.S., Chevron's net income rebounded to $15,625 million in 2021.\n\nChevron's upstream operations experienced a loss in 2020 before a strong recovery in 2021, while downstream operations saw a dip in 2020 followed by a recovery in 2021; these trends, particularly the significant upstream rebound, led to a net loss in 2020 followed by a substantial net income in 2021."}

Card Member loans and receivables (net of reserves) grew significantly `![Consolidated balance sheet showing assets and liabilities for 2021 and 2020.](image3)`, and this growth in loans is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities `![Consolidated statement of cash flows for 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image2)`. Within other assets, the carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values increased, with net unrealized gains of $777 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, contributing to income [3].\n\nThe decrease in total liabilities was mainly due to a reduction in customer deposits and long-term debt `![Consolidated balance sheet showing assets and liabilities for 2021 and 2020.](image3)`. These activities, including debt maturities and a reduction in customer deposits, are noted as reasons for the decrease in cash and investments [10] and are reflected as uses of cash in financing activities `![Consolidated statement of cash flows for 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image2)`. Additionally, the unfunded status related to defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, which is recorded in Other liabilities, decreased from $706 million as of December 31, 2020, to $414 million as of December 31, 2021 [8].\n\nThe entity generated a net income of $8,060 million in 2021, a key component of comprehensive income `![Consolidated statement of cash flows for 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image2)`. This strong operating performance provided substantial cash flow from operating activities ($14,645 million). However, this cash, along with proceeds from maturing investments, was largely utilized for increasing card member loans, repaying debt, repurchasing shares ($7,877 million), and paying dividends ($1,507 million) `![Consolidated statement of cash flows for 2021, 2020, and 2019.](image2)`. These distributions to shareholders and debt reduction contributed to a decrease in total shareholders' equity from $22,984 million in 2020 to $22,177 million in 2021 `![Details of shareholders' equity components for 2021 and 2020.](image4)`, despite the positive net income.\n\nTotal assets and total liabilities both decreased from 2020 to 2021, driven by reductions in cash, investments, customer deposits, and long-term debt, reflecting significant cash outflows for loan growth, debt repayments, and returns to shareholders, even as the company generated substantial net income."}

Additionally, revenue from 'Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other' within WPB declined, affected by lower interest rates, a fall in income from Insurance, Investments, and Markets products, and smaller revaluation gains on shares [10].\n\nThe Commercial Banking (CMB) segment, in comparison, recorded a net operating income of $13,312 million in 2020.\n![Image1 presents a breakdown of CMB's adjusted revenue, with net operating income at $13,312 million in 2020.](image1)\n![Image4 shows the adjusted results for CMB, confirming the net operating income of $13,312 million for 2020.](image4)\nCMB's financial results in 2020 were negatively affected by an increase in adjusted Expected Credit Losses (ECL) and the impact of lower global interest rates [5]. For instance, within CMB, revenue from Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM) dropped by $1.8 billion or 30%, primarily because of reduced global interest rates [6]. Similarly, revenue from Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) saw a decrease of $82 million or 4%, attributed to lower lending balances and fees, which reflected a contraction in global trade volumes due to the Covid-19 pandemic [8].\n\nRegarding profitability, the Commercial Banking segment's adjusted profit before tax for 2020 was $1,868 million, a figure also stated as $1.9 billion [7].\n![Image4 details that CMB's profit before tax stood at $1,868 million in 2020.](image4)\nThis marked a substantial 74% decline from 2019, largely driven by increased ECL charges amounting to $4.8 billion (a $3.6 billion rise from 2019) due to the worldwide economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, alongside a fall in adjusted revenue [7, 9]. Despite these challenges, CMB's adjusted operating expenses decreased by $0.1 billion or 2% to $6.7 billion, a result of reduced performance-related pay and discretionary spending, even as the bank continued to invest in its digital and transaction banking capabilities [4]. The provided information does not include a specific profit before tax figure for the Wealth and Personal Banking segment for 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Wealth and Personal Banking's net operating income ($22,013 million) was higher than Commercial Banking's ($13,312 million), while Commercial Banking's profit before tax was $1,868 million; a profit before tax figure for Wealth and Personal Banking was not provided in the quotes, precluding a direct comparison of this metric for both segments."}

This decrease was particularly noted in Italy, Poland, and Spain [6], partly as a result of adult smokers switching to heated tobacco units [5]. Consequently, the market shares for major PMI cigarette brands such as Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield, and Philip Morris all saw a reduction within the EU [image5].\n\nConversely, the shipment volume of heated tobacco units (HTUs) in the European Union saw substantial growth. Shipments of HTUs increased by an impressive 57.9% from 2019 to 2020 [image5]. This growth was propelled by a higher market share for HTUs across the Region [2], with notable contributions from markets including Italy and Poland [6, 9]. Specifically, the market share for HEETS, PMI's heated tobacco brand, rose by 1.7 percentage points in the EU [image5]. Despite the decrease in cigarette volumes, the robust performance of HTUs led to a slight overall increase of 0.1 percentage points in PMI's total market share in the European Union [image5].\n\nTurning to Eastern Europe, a similar trend was observed for cigarette shipment volumes.\n![PMI shipment volume in Eastern Europe for 2019-2020, showing a 7.1% decrease in cigarettes and a 55.3% increase in heated tobacco units.](image1)\nPMI's cigarette shipments in this region decreased by 7.1% between 2019 and 2020 [image1].

HTU shipment volume in Eastern Europe increased by a significant 55.3% [image1]. This increase was notably driven by higher HTU volumes and market share gains in countries such as Russia and Ukraine [2, 7, 8, 9]. For example, in Russia, PMI's overall market share saw an increase, largely driven by the performance of heated tobacco units [8]. The growth in HTUs helped to substantially offset the decline in cigarette volumes, leading to a nearly stable total PMI shipment volume in Eastern Europe, which experienced a marginal increase of 0.2% [image1].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, both the European Union and Eastern Europe saw decreases in cigarette shipment volumes, while heated tobacco unit shipment volumes and their market shares significantly increased."}

This reduction in net interest income can be further understood by examining the underlying changes in total interest income and total interest expense.\n![The financial summary shows net interest income decreased from $48,937 million in 2019 to $43,410 million in 2020.](image3)\nData indicates that total interest income decreased by $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, while total interest expense decreased by $14,120 million over the same period.\n![The table shows a larger decrease in total interest income ($19,747 million) than in total interest expense ($14,120 million) from 2019 to 2020.](image2)\nThe fact that interest income decreased more substantially than interest expense directly contributed to the reduction in overall net interest income.\n\nThese dynamics directly affected the net interest spread. The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, a closely related measure to the net interest spread, decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent for 2020 [6]. A comprehensive breakdown of average balances, interest income/expense, and the specific yield/rate for earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which includes the net interest spread for 2020 and 2019, is available.\n![This table provides data on average balances, interest components, and yields, including the net interest spread for 2019 and 2020.](image5)\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these changes. The primary driver for the decrease in net interest income was lower interest rates [6]. For instance, in Consumer Banking, net interest income decreased primarily due to lower rates, although this was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [3]. While lower rates negatively impacted interest income, they also led to reduced deposit and funding costs, which helped to somewhat mitigate the overall decline in net interest income [6]. Other contributing factors included the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual in 2020 [6]. The specific components of interest income and expense changes, such as a $1,464 million decrease in interest income from interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments shown in the table data, further illustrate these impacts `image2`.\n\nThe changes in net interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020, where interest income fell more significantly than interest expense, resulted in a compression of the net interest spread (or yield), primarily driven by lower interest rates, though this was partly offset by reduced funding costs."}

As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate [3]. Correspondingly, accrued interest and penalties for these uncertain tax positions grew from $76 million in 2019 to $128 million by the end of 2020 [3], indicating a higher potential cost associated with these positions. However, the company also believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [10].\n\nRegarding shareholder returns through buybacks, the company's common share repurchases saw a reduction [4].\n![The table shows the aggregate cost of common share repurchases was $4,250 million in 2020, down from $5,500 million in 2019.](image1)\nSpecifically, the aggregate cost decreased from $5,500 million in 2019 (for 22 million shares) to $4,250 million in 2020 (for 14 million shares). This activity is part of a share repurchase program adopted in November 1997 and periodically evaluated by the Board, with objectives including optimizing the company’s capital structure, improving returns to shareholders, and offsetting the dilutive impact of share-based awards [2, 5]. Despite the lower repurchase spending in 2020, as of December 31, 2020, the Board's authorization allowed for the potential purchase of up to 58 million additional shares of common stock [2].\n\nThe implications for the company's financial position from these changes include increased uncertainty surrounding its ultimate tax liabilities due to the rise in unrecognized tax benefits, which also brought higher accrued interest and penalties [3]. This suggests a greater potential for future financial outflows if these tax positions are not sustained. The decrease in share repurchase spending, on the other hand, indicates that less capital was returned to shareholders through this particular avenue in 2020 compared to 2019, which might reflect a strategic shift in capital allocation or a response to market conditions, even as the company increased its quarterly cash dividend in June 2020 [1].\n\nThe company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased between 2019 and 2020, heightening potential tax-related financial uncertainty, while its common share repurchases decreased, reflecting a reduction in this method of returning capital to shareholders during that period."}

These increased costs were more than offset by higher sales volume, favorable price realization, and net restructuring income from the sale of a facility [7]. The Financial Products' segment profit also contributed positively, increasing by $53 million, or 27 percent, primarily due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower provision for credit losses [3]. However, the operating profit margin slightly decreased from 12.3 percent in Q4 2020 to 11.7 percent in Q4 2021 [1].

For example, the discount rates applied saw shifts between 2020 and 2021: the rate for the Euro increased from 0.9% to 1.0%, and for the U.S. dollar from 2.4% to 2.7%.\n![The table shows the discount rates for Euro, U.S. dollar, British pound, and Swiss franc as of September 30, 2021, and 2020.](image4)\nThe sensitivity of the DBO to these assumptions is considerable. As of September 30, 2021, a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the DBO by €271 million, whereas a 0.5 percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the DBO by €242 million. Similarly, a 0.5 percentage point increase in compensation would raise the DBO by €16 million, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in pension progression would raise it by €158 million [1].\n![The table quantifies the impact on the defined benefit obligation from a 0.5 percentage point change in discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression for 2021 and 2020.](image1)\nChanges in demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, also affect the DBO. A 10% reduction in mortality rates for all beneficiaries would have led to an increase of €110 million in the DBO as of September 30, 2021 [7].\n\nThe cumulative impact of these changes in actuarial assumptions on the DBO is reflected in the actuarial gains and losses. For the fiscal year 2021, changes in financial assumptions resulted in an actuarial loss of €26 million, compared to a €72 million gain in 2020. Changes in demographic assumptions led to an €8 million loss in 2021, following a €3 million loss in 2020.\n![The table presents actuarial gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions, financial assumptions, and experience for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.](image3)\nThese changes in actuarial assumptions directly influence the DBO, which, together with the performance of plan assets, determines the funded status of the pension plans [4], [8]. While actuarial assumptions are crucial for calculating the DBO, the value of plan assets is primarily driven by financial market movements and the chosen investment strategy [8]. The total plan assets, for example, grew from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021, reflecting shifts in various investment categories such as equity and fixed income securities.\n![The table details the composition of plan assets, including equities, bonds, and alternatives, and their total values for 2021 and 2020.](image2)\nSiemens Healthineers manages the risks to the funded status by considering both plan assets and the DBO, and adjusts its investment strategy based on ongoing monitoring of these elements [8].\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions directly altered the defined benefit obligation through variations in discount rates and demographic factors, while plan assets were primarily influenced by market performance, with actuarial considerations informing the overall risk management of the pension fund's status."}

However, these supports, along with incremental COVID-19 related expenses for employee costs, personal protective equipment, and signage, also impacted margins [2, 6].\n\nConversely, the International Operated Markets segment experienced more significant downturns. Its contribution to total company revenues decreased from 54% in 2019 to 50% in 2020 (see image4). This segment's total revenues fell by 17% in 2020 (see image3). The impact of COVID-19 was particularly acute here, leading to a 15.0% decrease in comparable sales for 2020 (see image2, also [4]). These declines were driven by temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in key markets such as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [3, 4]. The ability of these markets to drive sales was also affected by the number of drive-thru restaurant locations [3]. Furthermore, the International Operated Markets segment incurred over $100 million in marketing support to accelerate recovery, alongside incremental COVID-19 related expenses and other costs like payments for obsolete inventory [5, 6].\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the U.S. segment's share of McDonald's total revenue increased while its revenue growth moderately declined; conversely, the International Operated Markets segment saw a decrease in its revenue share and experienced a significant drop in revenue growth, with COVID-19 impacts, marketing support, and operational adjustments being key influencing factors for both segments."}

By December 31, 2020, while solar energy systems in service increased to $6,758 million, the accumulated depreciation and amortization rose more significantly to $955 million. This increase in accumulated depreciation, which occurs once systems are interconnected and placed in service [1], along with changes in systems under construction ($28 million) and pending interconnection ($45 million), resulted in a decrease in the total net value of solar energy systems to $5,979 million in 2020.

Total credit card purchase volumes also declined by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, with spending on travel and entertainment remaining particularly low [6]. Despite this, the total risk-adjusted margin for credit cards increased by 88 basis points, driven by a lower mix of customer balances at promotional rates, the lower interest rate environment, and lower net credit losses [6]. Net charge-offs on credit cards decreased by $599 million, and past due loans also saw a decline, largely due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19 [4].\n![The table shows that total credit card purchase volumes decreased from $277,852 million in 2019 to $251,599 million in 2020, while the risk-adjusted margin increased from 8.28 to 9.16.](image2)\nThese changes suggest a shift in consumer behavior towards reduced discretionary spending, particularly in sectors affected by the pandemic, and an increased focus on paying down existing debt, possibly supported by government aid.

The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on these market prices is also a consideration [8].\n\n![The table quantifies the sensitivity of BHP's profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA to changes in the prices of oil, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, energy coal, and nickel.](image1)\nThis table illustrates how a US$1 per ton increase in the metallurgical coal price impacts profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million, while a US$1 per ton increase in energy coal price impacts profit by $9 million and EBITDA by $13 million. For nickel, a US¢1 per pound price increase impacts both profit and EBITDA by $1 million [image1].\n\nFocusing on coal, the Underlying EBITDA for Coal experienced a significant decrease of US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, with lower price impacts (net of price-linked costs) accounting for US$0.7 billion of this decline [2].\n![This table shows a decrease in coal revenue, underlying EBITDA, and average realised prices for metallurgical and energy coal between FY2020 and FY2021, alongside changes in production and capital expenditure.](image2)\nAs seen in the financial data, average realised prices for metallurgical coal dropped from $130.97/t in 2020 to $106.64/t in 2021, and for thermal (energy) coal, prices slightly increased but overall coal EBITDA fell sharply [image2]. Lower volumes also contributed to a US$168 million decrease in Underlying EBITDA for coal [2]. Furthermore, controllable cash costs for coal increased by US$102 million due to higher maintenance costs, particularly for earth-moving equipment and at Hay Point port, as well as increased stripping volumes, though these were partly offset by cost reduction efforts [2].\n![The table details the financial performance of Queensland Coal and NSWEC, highlighting decreased revenue and underlying EBITDA for both segments in FY2021 compared to FY2020, alongside increased costs per tonne.](image5)\nFor instance, Queensland Coal's underlying EBITDA fell from $1,935 million to $593 million, and its cost per tonne rose from $67.59 to $81.81 [image5]. The ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China also affects medium-term volume and unit cost guidance for Queensland Coal, where unit costs are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022 due to anticipated higher diesel prices [6].\n\nIn contrast, Nickel West saw its Underlying EBITDA increase by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, primarily due to higher prices and volumes [1]. The average realised sales price for nickel rose to US$16,250 per tonne in FY2021 from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 [10]. This price strength was driven by positive investor sentiment, a strong rebound in end-use demand, multi-region supply disruptions, and falling London Metal Exchange stocks [10]. Lower maintenance costs following major shutdowns in the prior year and reduced contractor costs after transitioning to new mines also contributed positively. However, these gains were partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impact of the stronger nickel price on the costs of purchasing third-party concentrate [1].\n\nChanges in commodity prices significantly influence BHP's financial results, with coal's performance negatively impacted by lower prices and volumes alongside increased operational costs, while nickel's results improved due to higher prices and volumes despite some offsetting factors."}

This reduction in cash outflow was primarily due to tax deductions resulting from a senior notes exchange, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in 2021 and more than offset higher taxable income from operations during the year [1].\n\nProceeds from investments and other activities also contributed positively, increasing from $190 million in 2020 to $1,246 million in 2021. This rise was mainly due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments [5].\n\nFurthermore, operating income increased from $17,493 million in 2020 to $20,817 million in 2021. This growth in operating income was supported by improved performance in several segments, notably the Theme Parks segment, which saw revenue increase by 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA improve from a loss of $0.5 billion to a gain of $1.3 billion. This turnaround reflected the operation of theme parks in 2021 compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 in 2020, as well as the opening of the theme park in Beijing [10]. The Studios segment revenue also increased by 16.2% as film and television production operations returned to full capacity [10].\n\nNon-cash expenses, which are added back to net income to determine operating cash flow, also increased. Depreciation and amortization rose from $13,100 million in 2020 to $13,804 million in 2021, and noncash share-based compensation increased from $1,193 million in 2020 to $1,315 million in 2021.\n\nThese positive factors were partially offset by a larger negative change in operating assets and liabilities, which shifted from a net cash inflow component of ($178 million) in 2020 (representing a smaller use of cash or source of cash relative to other years) to ($1,499 million) in 2021 (representing a larger use of cash). This decrease was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for film and television costs, including increased production spending. It was also affected by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of the broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics. These decreases were partially offset by increases related to the operations of theme parks [2].\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $4,409 million from 2020 to 2021, mainly due to lower income tax payments, increased proceeds from investments, higher operating income, and increased non-cash charges, despite a larger negative impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities."}

Factors that generally influence operating profit margins include higher core sales volumes, changes in spending levels (such as those related to business travel), cost savings from productivity initiatives, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates [2]. Price increases can also contribute to sales growth and thereby affect margins [3].\n\nA third set of financial data reveals a more significant positive change, where operating profit as a percentage of sales grew from 17.2% in 2018 to 20.8% in 2020.\n`![This financial data shows operating profit as a percentage of sales increased from 17.2% in 2018 to 20.8% in 2020.](image5)`\nThis represents a substantial improvement of 3.6 percentage points. Such an increase typically indicates improved operational efficiency, stronger pricing power, or a more profitable sales mix. For example, operating profit margins increased 350 basis points during 2020 compared to 2019 in one instance [5], driven by various favorable factors [10]. The management of Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses also plays a role; a decline in SG&A as a percentage of sales can be driven by increased leverage from higher sales volumes and cost-saving initiatives [8]. However, these positive impacts can sometimes be offset by unfavorable factors, such as incremental costs associated with new product development or acquisition-related charges [2, 4, 8].\n\nThe operating profit as a percentage of sales showed varied changes from 2018 to 2020 across different reported datasets, with one experiencing a slight decrease and two others showing increases, indicating different profitability trajectories for those business areas."}

The overall profit for the company was $6.489 billion in 2021, a notable increase from $2.998 billion in 2020, largely \"due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization\" [10]. This increase in sales volume stemmed from \"higher end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, along with favorable price realization\" [1]. Furthermore, operating profit increased by 51 percent in 2021, attributed to \"higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses,\" although these gains were partially offset by \"unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses\" [2].\n\nConversely, the \"Total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\" component negatively impacted the overall change, shifting from an income of $679 million in 2020 to a loss of $(665) million in 2021 [image3].

Other elements within other comprehensive income, such as \"Pension and other postretirement benefits,\" \"Derivative financial instruments,\" and \"Available-for-sale securities,\" also contributed to this decline with either losses or smaller gains in 2021 compared to 2020 [image3].

Therefore, Total Liabilities can be derived by subtracting Total Equity from Total Assets.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Total Liabilities = Total Assets ($59,268 million) - Total Equity ($18,078 million) = $41,190 million.\n\nThe description of the balance sheet image indicates that Current Liabilities totaled $29,441 million for 2021.

This figure of $41,190 million represents the Total Liabilities, confirmed by the accounting equation. This means that Other (non-current) Liabilities would be $41,190 million (Total Liabilities) minus $29,441 million (Current Liabilities), which equals $11,749 million.\n\nThese total liabilities include various obligations. For example, at the end of 2021, Costco had self-insurance liabilities amounting to $1,257 million for items such as employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, and general liability; these were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets [2, 6].

This increased to $1,231 million by December 31, 2020.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this increase. A primary driver was the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an initial increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million [5]. Image4 shows a specific \"Effect of CECL adoption\" as -$41 million, which appears to be a component of the overall CECL impact described in the text, or a specific adjustment within the period shown. The adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans [5].\n\nThe aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses, particularly within the Institutional Securities business segment, principally resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19 [8]. This provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19 [8]. Image4 shows a provision for credit losses of $762 million during 2020. Non-compensation expenses also increased in 2020, partly due to an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending commitments [1].\n\nCharge-offs in 2020, primarily related to certain Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities business segment, also affected the ACL [8]. Image4 indicates gross charge-offs of $105 million and recoveries of $8 million, resulting in net charge-offs of $97 million. Additionally, total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $28 billion in 2020, which would naturally lead to a higher ACL [6].\n\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses increased from $590 million at the end of 2019 to $1,231 million at the end of 2020, primarily due to the adoption of CECL, increased provisions for credit losses driven by the economic impact of COVID-19, and net charge-offs."}

Several factors contributed to this. A primary driver was a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, with fresh foods and foods and sundries being predominantly affected [5]. Indeed, all segments were negatively impacted by decreases in these core merchandise categories [1]. The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when measured as a percentage of core merchandise sales, decreased by 27 basis points, most significantly in fresh foods [6]. Furthermore, a LIFO charge related to higher merchandise costs negatively impacted the gross margin by 19 basis points in 2022, particularly affecting the U.S. segment [5], [1]. Increased 2% rewards also contributed a minor negative impact of one basis point [5], with the Other International segment being specifically impacted by these increased rewards [1].\n\nConversely, there were some positive influences. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted the gross margin by 29 basis points, largely due to gasoline, although this was partially offset by e-commerce [5]. It's important to note that while the gasoline business enhances warehouse traffic, it generally carries a lower gross margin percentage compared to the non-gasoline business [2]. In 2022, higher gasoline prices significantly boosted net sales, and an increased penetration of gasoline sales typically exerts downward pressure on the overall gross margin percentage [2], [7]. Additionally, all segments benefited from the cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19, which positively impacted the gross margin by five basis points in 2022 [1], [5].\n\nBroader factors such as inflation and merchandising strategies also played a part. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than experienced in recent years [3]. The company's strategies in response to these cost increases—which can include working with suppliers, making earlier and larger volume purchases, or passing costs to members—influence net sales and gross margin. Investments in merchandise pricing, such as reducing prices to drive sales or holding prices steady despite cost increases, also negatively affect the gross margin and gross margin percentage [3].\n\nThe gross margin percentage decreased from 11.20% in 2020 to 10.48% in 2022, primarily due to reduced margins in core merchandise, a LIFO inventory charge, increased member rewards, and the dilutive effect of a higher mix of lower-margin gasoline sales, although these were partly offset by contributions from ancillary businesses and the discontinuation of COVID-19 related incremental wages."}

The Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862 were pivotal, transforming Nebraska into a booming agricultural state and attracting a \"great tide of emigration\" [9]. Consequently, Hamilton County’s population exploded in the late 1800s, growing from a mere 130 individuals in 1870 to 8,267 by 1880, and reaching its all-time high of 14,096 in 1890 [5].\n![Table 1 details Hamilton County's population figures from 1870 to 2000, illustrating a peak in 1890 followed by a general decline and a slight rebound by 2000.](image3)\nThis rapid growth was fueled by early settlers from other U.S. states, followed by immigrants from various European countries including Germany, Sweden, England, and Russia, who tended to settle in specific enclaves [8]. For example, Danish immigrants settled in northeastern Hamilton County, establishing the Kronborg area where St. John’s Lutheran Church became a central part of their community, consciously preserving their Danish heritage [7].\n![St. John’s Lutheran Church in Kronborg, a prominent building with a tall steeple, served as a vital community hub for Danish settlers.](image1)\nSimilarly, the Zion Lutheran Church and School in northeastern Hamilton County served as a focal point for the German settlement in that area, with the current church structure dedicated in 1897 [1].\n![The Zion Lutheran Church, pictured with its distinctive architecture, was a significant religious and community center for German settlers in Hamilton County.](image4)\nThese settlements, like the Danish culture in Kronborg and the Swedish culture around Hordville, contributed to the diverse cultural landscape of the county [10], as seen on maps detailing the communities.\n![A map of Hamilton County, Nebraska, highlights communities such as Kronborg and Hordville, which were established by distinct ethnic groups.](image5)\nHowever, after this peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population began a gradual decline [5]. A primary cause for this was the significant changes in agriculture due to mechanization. This led to farm consolidation, where the number of farms decreased while their average size increased substantially; for instance, the number of farms dropped from over 2,000 in 1900 to 603 by 2002, and the average farm size grew from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres in 2002 [4]. These changes had \"significant impacts on rural life\" [4], likely contributing to a reduction in the rural population. The consolidation of rural school districts, from over 100 in the early 1920s to just a few, further illustrates this demographic shift [6]. While most rural communities saw their populations peak between 1900 and 1940 [3], some towns, notably Aurora, experienced population gains in later years, with Aurora reaching its peak population in the 2000 census [2].\n\nHamilton County's population dramatically increased in the late 19th century due to westward expansion policies and immigration, peaked in 1890, and subsequently declined mainly because of agricultural mechanization and farm consolidation, though some towns showed renewed growth by 2000."}

The most significant improvements often come from pre-training the source language embeddings, suggesting that a better encoding of the source sentence contributes substantially to the overall gain [6].\n\nFor instance, translations into English from various source languages demonstrate this trend.\n![Table comparing BLEU scores for different language pairs to English, showing improvements with pre-training (pre) over standard (std) methods.](image4)\nAs seen in the table, which compares standard (std) translation metrics with those achieved using pre-training (pre), pre-training consistently improves scores. For Galician (GL) to English (EN), the score can dramatically increase (e.g., from 1.2 std to 12.7 with source pre-training), and even for higher-resource languages like Portuguese (PT) to English, there are clear gains when pre-training is applied [1, 6].\n\nThe magnitude of improvement from pre-training can vary. For extremely low-resource languages, gains might be small, such as for Azerbaijani (AZ) and Belarusian (BE) in some experiments, or very large, as seen with Galician (GL), which can achieve gains of up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This indicates that pre-training may be particularly useful for languages on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [1]. The effectiveness of pre-training also appears to be linked to the baseline performance of the system; the gain in BLEU score is often highest when the baseline system is poor but not excessively so, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4].\n\nThe impact of pre-training is also evident when considering the amount of training data available, as shown in experiments that down-sample training data for higher-resource languages [7].\n![Graphs showing higher BLEU scores with pre-trained models (pre) compared to standard models (std) across varying training set sizes for translations to English, with gains more pronounced at smaller data sizes.](image2)\nThese graphs illustrate that pre-trained models (dashed lines) consistently outperform standard models (solid lines) across different training set sizes for Portuguese, Turkish, and Russian to English translations. The bottom graph specifically highlights that the gain from pre-training is more significant when the training set size is smaller and tends to decrease as more training data becomes available.\n\nSimilar positive effects are observed in translations to other target languages, such as Portuguese.\n![Table showing BLEU score improvements (pre vs. std) for various languages translated to Portuguese, with gains highlighted.](image3)\nThis table demonstrates that for languages like Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Russian (RU), and Hebrew (HE) translated to Portuguese, pre-training (pre) leads to notable increases in BLEU scores compared to standard methods (std), with improvements ranging from +4.7 to +8.9 BLEU points [9]. Languages with lower baseline scores, such as Russian and Hebrew when translated to Portuguese, tend to see larger accuracy gains, reinforcing the observation that systems with more room to improve often benefit more significantly from pre-training [9].\n\nIn multilingual translation systems that share components like an encoder or decoder between multiple languages, pre-training also plays a crucial role [5, 10]. When applying pre-trained embeddings in these systems, gains are often observed, particularly for language pairs with higher similarity, such as Galician/Portuguese (GL/PT) which shows the largest gains [10].\n![Table showing BLEU scores for multilingual translation to English with pre-trained embeddings, comparing unaligned and aligned settings for language pairs like GL/PT, AZ/TR, BE/RU.](image1)\nFurthermore, aligning the pre-trained word embeddings in such multilingual setups can further enhance BLEU scores, as seen for pairs like RU → EN (21.1 unaligned vs 21.4 aligned). This alignment helps by putting the word embeddings of the two source languages into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn more effectively [10].\n\nPre-training improves translation quality not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, by helping models capture rarer vocabulary and generate more grammatically well-formed sentences [2]. It particularly boosts the translation accuracy of low-frequency words in the training corpus [8].\n\nPre-training generally improves BLEU scores across different language pairs, though the extent of this improvement varies based on factors like language resource levels, baseline system performance, data availability, and specific model architectures like multilingual systems."}

It primarily involves two main stages: a multimodal retriever and a subsequent retrieving and ranking mechanism that utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1], [2].\n\nThe first core component is the **Multimodal Retriever**. Its primary function is to efficiently create, store, and retrieve relevant multimodal embeddings from a large external memory or database [8]. This retriever establishes an explicit memory for different categories beyond the MLLM's immediate context window [9]. Key elements within this retriever include an **Image Encoder**, which extracts feature embeddings from visual images. For object detection tasks, images undergo pre-processing such as cropping regions based on bounding boxes and blurring non-target areas to focus the model's attention before encoding [3].\n![The diagram illustrates the \"Multimodal Retriever\" stage, including an Image Encoder, Feature Index, Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$), and a k-NN retrieving process.](image3)\n![This diagram shows pre-processing steps such as cropping and resizing images from detection datasets before they are passed to an Image Encoder for embedding extraction and subsequent k-NN retrieval.](image5)\nThese embeddings are stored in an external **Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$)** [8]. To ensure quick and accurate retrieval, a **Feature Index** is constructed, sometimes using methods like HNSW for dimensionality reduction and faster searching [7], [8]. At inference, this retriever identifies the top-k class names most similar to the input image from this memory [1].\n\nThe second main component is the **Retrieving & Ranking** mechanism, which is activated during the inference stage. After the multimodal retriever fetches the top-k candidate results from memory, these retrieved category labels, along with the input image's embedding, are integrated and sent to the MLLMs via a specialized **ranking prompt** [1], [4], [5]. This prompt's role is to guide the MLLMs in ranking the retrieved candidates according to their similarity to the input image [5].\n![This image provides an example of a ranking prompt for few-shot image classification, where an input image is shown alongside several retrieved car images that are then sorted by relevance.](image4)\nThe **MLLMs** then leverage their extensive internal knowledge combined with the retrieved information to rank these candidates and make the **final prediction** of the image category [1], [4]. This process ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification [4].\n![The \"Retrieving & Ranking\" stage of the pipeline shows an input image being encoded, top-K categories being retrieved from memory, and then MLLMs ranking these categories to output a final prediction.](image3)\n\nIn essence, the RAR pipeline's main components are a multimodal retriever that builds and queries an external memory of embeddings, and a ranking system where MLLMs refine these retrieved options to produce the final output."}

These methods offer distinct ways to navigate the multi-layered tree to find relevant information [2].\n\nThe tree traversal method, as the name suggests, navigates the tree level by level. It begins by selecting the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query. Then, it considers the children of these selected nodes at the next layer, again choosing the top k most similar nodes. This iterative process continues until the leaf nodes are reached [7]. This approach allows for control over the specificity and breadth of the retrieved information, starting broadly at the top layers and becoming more focused as it descends [9].\n\n![Tree Traversal Retrieval starts with a query, traverses the tree level by level selecting top nodes, and combines context from selected nodes with the query for an LLM to generate an answer.](image2)\n\nConversely, the collapsed tree method takes a more holistic approach.

This method essentially flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, allowing for a collective evaluation of all nodes to find the most relevant ones [2, 3].

Similarly, using distractors filtered by entity type to match the gold paragraphs also led to a significant performance degradation, with F1 dropping to 40.73 [2].\n![Model performance drops from 67.08 on \"Original\" evaluation to 46.84 on \"Adversarial\" and 40.73 on \"Adversarial + Type\" evaluation when using \"Original\" training data.](image2)\nHowever, models demonstrate an ability to adapt; when retrained on these more challenging distractor distributions, they can recover a large part of their initial accuracy [8]. For example, after retraining on adversarial distractors, the F1 score improved from 46.84 to 60.10 [4], and for type-filtered adversarial distractors, it increased from 40.73 to 58.42 F1 [2]. This recovery suggests that even these enhanced distractors might not fully push the models towards genuine multi-hop reasoning, as the models can learn patterns from the new distractor types [7].\n\nThe impact of gold paragraphs becomes especially pronounced in \"open-domain\" settings, where the model must first retrieve relevant paragraphs from a vast collection. Standard retrieval methods like TF-IDF often struggle to find the correct gold paragraphs for multi-hop questions [10]. In such a challenging retrieval scenario, a single-paragraph BERT model achieved an F1 score of only 39.12, even when considering 500 retrieved paragraphs [10].\n![The F1 score with 500 open-domain paragraphs is 39.12.](image5)\nCrucially, the explicit inclusion of the gold paragraphs within this set of 500 paragraphs leads to a significant improvement in performance, boosting the F1 score to 53.12 [10, 5].\n![Adding gold paragraphs to 500 open-domain paragraphs increases the F1 score from 39.12 to 53.12.](image5)\nThis highlights that the successful retrieval of gold paragraphs is a major factor in open-domain multi-hop QA.\n\nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs significantly boosts F1 scores, particularly when retrieval is difficult, while stronger or adversarially chosen distractors can lower F1 scores, underscoring the need for robust models and improved methods for both distractor generation and effective gold paragraph retrieval to truly assess multi-hop reasoning capabilities."}

This focus on expert-level skills aims to measure how well models can perceive and understand information across different modalities and apply reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [1].\n\nMMMU significantly differs from other benchmarks. While many existing benchmarks like MMBench and MM-Vet largely focus on relatively basic perception abilities without requiring expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate reasoning, MMMU presents more difficult expert-level problems [4].\n![MMMU is shown to have greater depth in reasoning and breadth in knowledge compared to other benchmarks such as VQA, GQA, and ScienceQA, and includes a wide variety of image formats from sources like textbooks and the internet.](image3)\nPrior benchmarks were heavily focused on daily knowledge and common sense, whereas MMMU targets college-level knowledge and nuanced perception [5]. This design introduces challenges such as processing heterogeneous image types and integrating domain-specific knowledge for reasoning, which goes significantly beyond basic visual perception [6].\n\nThe implications for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) are that MMMU provides a more comprehensive and demanding assessment. It tests not only the perception capabilities of LMMs across diverse image formats but also their ability to perform deliberate reasoning with subject-specific knowledge [6, 10]. The benchmark underscores the substantial room for improvement in current LMMs, especially in domains with complex visual input and tasks requiring heavy reasoning with subject knowledge [8].\n\nTherefore, MMMU offers a more robust and challenging evaluation framework for LMMs by significantly expanding the breadth of subjects and image types, and increasing the depth of required knowledge and reasoning to an expert, college-level standard compared to previous benchmarks."}

For instance, in the standard setting on the WIKIHOP dataset (test scores), the masked version of BiDAF achieves 54.5% while the masked FastQA achieves 35.8%. On MEDHOP (test scores), masked BiDAF scores 33.7% and masked FastQA scores 31.3% [image2].\n`![Performance of BiDAF and FastQA on WIKIHOP and MEDHOP, with and without masking, under standard and 'gold chain' conditions.](image2)`\nThe impact of masking answers differs between the datasets and models. For WIKIHOP, masking candidate expressions as single tokens helps the models, whereas on MEDHOP, where drug mentions are already normalized, performance tends to drop under masking [4].\n\nWhen provided with only the relevant \"gold chain\" documents, both models improve substantially, but BiDAF's potential appears higher. On WIKIHOP (test*, masked), BiDAF reaches 85.7% accuracy, and on MEDHOP (test*, masked), it achieves a near-perfect 100.0% [7, image2]. This indicates that the models can identify answers effectively when distracting information is minimized, with BiDAF showing a particular strength in this ideal scenario.\n\nFurther experiments were designed to test if these neural RC models can utilize information requiring multi-step inference by discarding documents that do not contain candidate mentions [10].\n`![Performance of BiDAF and FastQA on WIKIHOP and MEDHOP, including versions where some documents ('rem') are removed.](image1)`\nIn this setup for the WIKIHOP dataset (test scores), BiDAF's performance dropped from 54.5% to 44.6% (\"BiDAF rem\"), while FastQA's performance changed from 35.8% to 38.0% (\"FastQA rem\").

This is especially helpful for handling out-of-vocabulary words or words with slight variations.\n\nWord-level embeddings, on the other hand, provide a representation of the word's meaning in context [1]. These embeddings are typically pre-trained on large corpora and capture semantic relationships between words.\n\n![The diagram shows character embeddings and word embeddings being combined and fed into a Word Bi-LSTM, followed by self-attention and a CRF layer.](image5)\n\nThe model combines these two types of information by first producing a representation for each word by concatenating its character representation (derived from a character-level network) with its word embedding [5].

An image in an object detection dataset often contains multiple objects of varying sizes, where some might be very large and others minimal [4]. The procedure begins by cropping the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates, and then these cropped regions are resized to a fixed proportion [4].\n\nUnlike image classification tasks where objects are typically large and centrally positioned, objects in detection datasets are often smaller and their positions more varied [4]. To aid the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding which objects to detect, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest [4]. This blurring strategy is specifically designed to direct the MLLMs’ focus towards the relevant objects, thereby facilitating their identification in object detection tasks [4]. This enhanced focus is important for the zero-shot object recognition task, which aims to measure the model's ability to align these specific regions with textual class descriptions [2].\n\nThe pre-processing steps of cropping and blurring contribute to the zero-shot recognition system by isolating objects of interest and directing the model's attention to these specific regions, thereby improving their identification and alignment with textual descriptions."}

Specifically, the accuracy of the discriminator on a dataset $N^{D}$ (which is not used during the adversarial training itself but for pre-training the discriminator) is a key indicator [3, 10]. As the generator improves and learns to create more accurate true-positive samples, it becomes more effective at challenging the discriminator. This leads to a situation where \"as the training epoch increases, this accuracy gradually decreases, which means the discriminator becomes weaker\" [3]. This decline in the discriminator's accuracy is not indefinite; there is a \"critical point of the decline of accuracy for each presented relation types. It is because that the chance we give the generator to challenge the discriminator is just one time scanning of the noisy dataset; this critical point is yielded when the generator has already been robust enough. Thus, we stop the training process when the model reaches this critical point\" [3].\n\nThe trend of the discriminator's accuracy over epochs is illustrated in the provided graph for three example relation types.\n![A line graph shows the discriminator's accuracy on $N^{D}$ decreasing over epochs for three relation types, with training stopped at a critical point of decline.](image3)\nFor the relation type \"/people/person/place_lived\", its accuracy trend is depicted by the \"Red curve with square markers\" (image3).

The availability of large corpora and developments in computational semantics led to numerous data-driven initiatives, particularly with the rise of word embeddings after 2011 [2].\n\n![The timeline from 2010 to 2017 shows key developments in using distributional models for tracing diachronic semantic shifts, including new corpora and modeling techniques.](image1)\n\nIn 2010, the concept of a \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" was introduced, building on earlier ideas like the conceptualization of a Word:Semantic Vector:Time tensor, which allowed for quantitative comparisons of word meaning development over time [4]. The year 2011 marked increased exploration using the Google Ngrams corpus [9]; for instance, Gulordava and Baroni (2011) utilized this dataset to compare word meanings between the 1960s and 1990s [9]. Following this, 2012 saw work on \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" with researchers like Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) using the Google Ngrams dataset to identify differences in word usage across 50-year spans [9].\n\nThe advent of \"Prediction-based models\" in 2013, such as word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013b), became a widely adopted input representation for this task [2]. This was further solidified in 2014 with the application of \"Word embeddings\" like word2vec. Notably, Kim et al. (2014) published seminal work using prediction-based word embedding models (specifically Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling, SGNS) to trace diachronic semantic shifts [7]. Also in 2014, Mitra et al. used Google Ngrams for detecting word sense changes [9].\n\nThe year 2015 brought focus to \"Models alignment.\" Kulkarni et al. (2015) demonstrated that computational methods for detecting semantic shifts could be robustly applied to shorter time spans using corpora like Amazon Movie Reviews and Twitter data, in addition to Google Ngrams [10]. During the same year, Zhang et al. (2015) utilized the New York Times Annotated Corpus for tracing subtle semantic shifts [10].\n\nIn 2016, the \"NYT corpus\" and the \"COHA corpus\" (Corpus of Historical American English) gained prominence. Hamilton et al. (2016a) demonstrated the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models and used both COHA and Google Ngrams [7, 10]. Eger and Mehler (2016) also expanded the use of diachronic corpora by employing COHA [10].\n\nFinally, 2017 was a year of diverse developments, including insights into the \"Laws of semantic change,\" the observation that \"Local measures better for cultural shifts,\" the use of the \"Gigaword corpus,\" exploration of \"Diachronic relations,\" \"Criticism of semantic change laws,\" and \"Joint learning across time spans\" (as shown in image1). Textual evidence supports some of these: Kutuzov et al. (2017b) began using yearly slices of the English Gigaword corpus for analyzing cultural semantic drift [10], and Szymanski (2017) employed the NYT corpus for work on temporal word analogies [3, 10]. Furthermore, the \"law of prototypicality\" was proposed by Dubossarsky et al. (2017) [8].\n\nKey milestones from 2010 to 2017 in tracing diachronic semantic shifts include the introduction of time-aware modeling, the use of large-scale corpora like Google Ngrams, NYT, and COHA, the adoption of prediction-based word embeddings, and the development of methods for model alignment and analysis of semantic change laws."}

For example, the model can accurately complete sentences requiring birth date information, and these predictions can be directly controlled by modifying the facts in the knowledge graph [2].\n\nThe performance of KGLM, including an \"oracle\" version (Oracle KGLM) that is given correct entity annotations, is evaluated on various types of factual relations.

Conversely, adding author names as an input, alongside the title and abstract, surprisingly hurts performance across most tasks. This could be due to the sparsity of author names or suboptimal tokenization by Wordpieces, which might split names into less meaningful sub-words [10]. Adding venue information slightly decreases overall performance, though it can improve document classification, likely because venues often correlate highly with document topics [10].\n\nBeyond input features, other design decisions are crucial. The use of hard negative distractors in the citation-based fine-tuning objective is important; relying only on easy negatives reduces performance across all tasks [2]. Furthermore, the choice of the base language model is critical. Using a general-domain language model like BERT-Large instead of SciBERT (which is pretrained on scientific text) considerably reduces SPECTER's performance [2]. The citation-based pretraining objective itself is also vital, as removing it and using a vanilla SciBERT results in decreased performance on all tasks [8].\n\nTherefore, the inclusion of abstracts and the use of SciBERT with hard negatives in a citation-based pretraining objective are key for SPECTER's optimal performance, while adding author or venue information can have mixed or negative effects."}

For instance, GPT-4's F1-score for citations increases from 35.6 in the general setting to 39.4 in the specific setting, and ChatGPT's F1-score rises from 32.9 to 37.2. GPT-4 generally achieves higher alignment (e.g., 92.0 vs. 84.5 for ChatGPT in specific setting) and correctness (e.g., 97.6 for GPT-4 vs. 94.8 for ChatGPT in specific setting). A key difference lies in precision and recall: GPT-4 tends to have higher precision (36.0 in specific setting) but lower recall (43.6), while ChatGPT shows lower precision (29.9) but higher recall (49.0). This characteristic of GPT-4, generating shorter answers with fewer, more precise citations, is also noted elsewhere [8]. The improved performance in specific settings is attributed to clearer instructions, as \"specific questions provide clearer instructions to the models on which knowledge to use\" [9]. These questions \"target the knowledge more explicitly in the question context, and hence cover the scope of the paragraph better\" [9].\n\nFor text evaluation, both models also show enhanced performance in specific settings. For example, GPT-4's fluency score improves from 4.48 (general) to 4.64 (specific), and ChatGPT's relevance score increases from 4.70 (general) to 4.81 (specific), according to the data in image5. ChatGPT often scores higher than GPT-4 in several text quality dimensions like conciseness and relevance. However, this finding comes with a caveat: the evaluation of text quality utilized ChatGPT as the model evaluator, which \"could potentially have a bias if the model prefers the text style generated by itself\" [5]. This potential bias is highlighted by the \"abnormal phenomenon that the scores of ChatGPT generated answers are higher than that of the GPT4 generated answers for all four dimensions\" in text quality [5].\n\nThe implications are that for optimal performance in both citation and text generation, questions should be framed as specifically as possible. GPT-4 is generally preferable for tasks requiring high citation precision, while ChatGPT might be better suited if higher recall of potentially relevant information is desired, albeit with more scrutiny needed for precision. While both produce high-quality text, evaluations of text quality, especially if conducted by ChatGPT itself, should be interpreted with caution regarding potential biases.\n\nGPT-4 typically offers more precise citations, particularly in specific contexts, whereas ChatGPT exhibits strong text quality scores that could be affected by self-evaluation bias; both models demonstrate improved performance with more specific queries."}

This is where knowledge of Boolean search logic, and its interpretation through tools like Venn diagrams, becomes relevant. While future Recruiter versions may simplify searching, \"understanding how to construct accurate Boolean search strings remains a fundamental skill for all talent acquisition professionals\" [7]. The exam assesses this by asking how a specific search string, such as \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager\" [6], will produce certain results, which can be understood \"according to the Venn diagram\" [8]. ![A Venn diagram shows overlapping circles for \"Engineering\" and \"Java,\" illustrating how Boolean operators refine search results.](image2) Such diagrams visually represent the intersections and exclusions defined by Boolean operators, aiding in predicting and refining search outcomes to identify the right talent.\n\nThe LinkedIn Recruiter Certification exam requires candidates to focus on identifying and engaging talent, building talent pipelines, posting jobs, and maximizing efficiency, with an understanding of Boolean search results through Venn diagrams being crucial for the talent identification aspect."}

While TRUCS certification assures users of the security protocols protecting their data from unauthorized access or breaches, Level 2 reliability ensures that the data is also safeguarded against loss due to common server hardware failures. This combination of robust security and hardware fault tolerance contributes significantly to the overall dependability and trustworthiness of the OBS platform.\n\nLevel 2 reliability, by protecting against server hardware failures using erasure codes, ensures data durability and availability, thereby complementing the security assurances of the TRUCS certification to provide a more robust and trustworthy storage service."}

For the 8751H microcontroller, the Input Low Voltage (VIL) for its Ports 1, 2, and 3 is specified to be between -0.5V and 0.8V. The Input High Voltage (VIH) for Ports 1, 2, 3, as well as the RST and EA pins, must be at least 2.0V and can go up to VCC + 0.5V. These input voltage specifications are generally consistent across related models such as the 8751H-8, 8751BH, and 8752BH, as detailed in their electrical characteristics.\n![The table shows input low voltage (VIL) for ports 1, 2, 3 is -0.5V to 0.8V, and input high voltage (VIH) for ports 1, 2, 3, RST, EA is 2.0V to VCC+0.5V for all listed models.](image1)\n\nWhen considering output voltages, the Output Low Voltage (VOL) for Ports 1, 2, and 3 of the 8751H is a maximum of 0.45V, under the test condition of sinking 1.6mA (IOL). This particular specification is also shared by the 8751H-8, 8751BH, and 8752BH models. However, a distinction appears for Port 0, ALE (Address Latch Enable), and PSEN (Program Store Enable) pins. While the VOL for these pins on the 8751H also remains at a maximum of 0.45V, this is specified at a higher IOL of 3.2mA for the 8751H and 8751H-8. In comparison, other related models (such as the 8751BH and 8752BH, often grouped under \"All Others\" in datasheets) typically specify the same VOL at a lower IOL, for example, 2.4mA. This indicates that the 8751H can sink more current on Port 0 while maintaining the specified low output voltage level.\n\nSimilarly, for Output High Voltage (VOH), Ports 1, 2, and 3 of the 8751H provide a minimum of 2.4V when sourcing -60µA (IOH), with VCC operating at 5V ±10%. This specification is consistent for the 8751H-8, 8751BH, and 8752BH as well. For Port 0, ALE, and PSEN, the VOH is also a minimum of 2.4V. On the 8751H and 8751H-8, this is achieved while sourcing an IOH of -200µA. In contrast, other models like the 8751BH and 8752BH often specify this VOH at a lesser IOH, such as -80µA. This suggests the 8751H can source more current from Port 0 at a high logic level compared to some other variants.\n![The table details output low voltage (VOL) and output high voltage (VOH) for different ports and models, highlighting varying IOL and IOH test conditions, particularly for Port 0, ALE, and PSEN where 8751H/8751H-8 can handle higher currents (IOL=3.2mA, IOH=-200µA) compared to 'All Others' (e.g., IOL=2.4mA, IOH=-80µA) for the same voltage levels.](image1)\nThese AC characteristics are typically defined with specific load capacitances; for Port O, ALE/PROG, and $\\overline{{\\mathsf{P S E N}}}$, this is 100pF, while for all other outputs it is 80pF [3]. It's also important to note that significant capacitive loading, especially on Ports 0 and 2 (greater than 100pF), can introduce noise. This noise on the ALE/PROG pin might even exceed 0.8V, which is the maximum VIL [1]. The supply voltage (VCC) for these operations is specified as 4.5V to 5.5V [image4].\n![The table shows operating conditions including VCC supply voltage from 4.5V to 5.5V and oscillator frequency from 3.5 MHz to 12 MHz.](image4)\nThe absolute maximum voltage rating on any pin to VSS is generally -0.5V to +7V, though the $\\overline{{\\mathsf{E A}}}/\\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{P\\mathsf{P}}}$ pin on the 8751H has a higher absolute maximum rating of -0.5V to +21.5V [9].\n\nThe 8751H microcontroller has input voltage specifications (VIL: -0.5V to 0.8V; VIH: 2.0V to VCC+0.5V) and output voltage specifications (VOL: max 0.45V; VOH: min 2.4V) that are generally similar to related models, but the 8751H can handle higher currents on Port 0, ALE, and PSEN pins for the same output voltage levels."}

In Afghanistan, NAMRU-3 partners with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP), a collaboration designed to enhance the U.S. government's biodefense and disease surveillance capabilities [8]. Their work in Afghanistan began by assessing the laboratory capacities and capabilities of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the Afghan Public Health Institute, initially focusing on the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) in Kabul before planning expansion to other regions [3].\n\nNAMRU-3 has established five hospital laboratories as well as virology, bacteriology, and serology laboratories within the CPHL [2]. A core component of their mission involves extensive training programs. In 2011, for example, NAMRU-3 provided training for 160 Afghan scientists and technicians on laboratory operations, diagnostic procedures, and ethics in research and management, particularly concerning U.S. select agents [1, 6].\n![Several people in lab coats are gathered around a table in a laboratory, likely for training or a demonstration.](image3)\nBased on needs and gaps identified by their assessments, a comprehensive training plan was developed, featuring modules on diverse topics such as parasitology, bacteriology, bioscience facility management, clinical epidemiology, biomedical equipment repair, laboratory quality management systems, serology, molecular biology, and virology [9]. NAMRU-3 has also conducted workshops to train laboratory and administrative staff on proper laboratory procedures, establish inventory for supplies, institute quality control procedures, and develop national laboratory biosafety and quality control plans [10].\n\nMeanwhile, the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) serves as an operational medicine laboratory with a distinct focus on the submarine force and the human factors associated with it [4]. An agreement with the Commander, Submarine Forces (CSF) established NSMRL as CSF’s primary human technology laboratory, tasked with conducting medical, psychological, and human performance research covering all physical and mental aspects of submariner health and performance [4]. NSMRL also investigates diving medicine and is equipped with unique facilities like the Genesis hyperbaric chamber. This chamber can simulate high altitudes and allows for prolonged studies, including those involving mission profiles that transition from depth to altitude—such as those relevant to Special Operations Forces missions—without needing reconfiguration, directly aligning its research with the submarine force's strategic direction and operational needs [4].\n\nNAMRU-3 enhances global and U.S. biodefense through laboratory capacity building and training in partner nations, while NSMRL conducts specialized research to optimize the health and performance of U.S. submarine personnel, with both units' missions closely supporting U.S. military operational readiness and strategic interests."}

Since 2010, Navy biomedical researchers, as part of NAMRU-3's efforts, have collaborated with the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR) on projects focused on disease vector surveillance, the detection of vector-borne pathogens such as malaria, and vector control. These initiatives are designed to strengthen Liberia's ability to independently conduct surveillance and detection of vector-borne diseases, benefiting not only the Liberian Armed Forces but also the entire population of Liberia [5].\n\n![Captain Oyofo, commanding officer of NAMRU-3, is shown with U.S. Operation Onward Liberty forces in Liberia, indicating collaboration with local and U.S. military.](image4)\nThis collaborative spirit extends to direct military-to-military engagements, where NAMRU-3, with assistance from OOL (Operation Onward Liberty), has provided vector control training to the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) in conjunction with LIBR [7]. Such engagements also focus on protecting U.S. forces. For instance, a project combining insecticide spraying for all base housing with surveillance and geospatial mapping to determine the distribution of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes was a point of interest for Col.

During its 56 days of mission activities across four host nations—Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Cambodia—the USNS Mercy delivered extensive humanitarian aid. This included providing medical, dental, and vision care to over 49,000 patients ashore, performing more than 900 surgeries, and treating over 7,000 livestock and domestic animals. The mission also extended to non-medical projects like engineering repairs, construction, community service donations, and conducting over 60,000 hours of subject-matter expert exchanges on topics such as basic first aid, nutrition, public health, and disaster response [6].\n\nConcurrently, the Department of Defense maintains a vital, ongoing humanitarian initiative through the C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program. This program, supported by the Naval Medical Research Center’s (NMRC) Bone Marrow Research Directorate, aims to provide military contingency support for casualties with marrow toxic injury due to radiation or chemical warfare agents [1] and to facilitate marrow transplants for patients with over 80 potentially fatal diseases [9]. Activities for this program include organizing donor drives, like the one at Marine Corps Base Hawaii where service members provided oral swab samples [8].\n![A volunteer provides an oral swab sample for the DoD Marrow Donor Program.](image5)\nThese consent forms and cell samples are then sent to the C.W. Bill Young DoD Marrow Donor Program Donor Center and Laboratory, where staff perform genetic testing to match potential donors with patients [3]. The impact of this program is significant, with over 42,000 service members, family members, and DoD employees registering in 2012, adding to a total of more than 730,000 DoD volunteers who are potential marrow donors. Of these, over 5,200 have successfully donated marrow [9]. The NMRC Bone Marrow Research Directorate also contributes through laboratory research to innovate DNA-based typing for marrow transplants, enhancing the program's effectiveness [1].\n\nThe humanitarian impact of the USNS Mercy Pacific Partnership 2012 was characterized by its broad scope, providing immediate and diverse assistance to tens of thousands of people and animals across multiple nations through direct care, infrastructure support, and knowledge sharing within a concentrated timeframe [6]. In contrast, the DoD Bone Marrow Program offers a highly specific, life-saving intervention for individuals facing critical illnesses, relying on a continuous, long-term effort to build and maintain a comprehensive donor registry to find precise matches for patients in need [1], [9].\n\nThe USNS Mercy Pacific Partnership 2012 focused on delivering broad, immediate humanitarian assistance and strengthening international relations through diverse medical and community support in several countries, while the DoD Bone Marrow Program's main objective is to save lives by recruiting donors and providing marrow transplants for individuals with critical diseases, offering a more targeted but profoundly life-altering impact over time."}

A CD8+ T cell, a type of immune cell, recognizes these foreign peptides. Upon recognition and engagement with the infected liver cell, the CD8+ T cell initiates an immune attack. It releases cytotoxic substances such as perforin and granzymes. These substances cause the infected liver cell to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), which in turn leads to the death of the parasite residing within it. The illustration also indicates that IFN-γ signaling and Fas/FasR interactions are additional mechanisms contributing to the induction of apoptosis in the infected cell.\n\nThe immune system targets malaria parasites when CD8+ T cells recognize parasite antigens presented by infected liver cells and then release cytotoxic molecules like perforin and granzymes, inducing apoptosis of the infected cell and killing the parasite."}

This stage often raises questions. As an organization matures, it moves towards \"Analysis,\" which is more prescriptive, forward-looking, and aims to answer \"Why?\" something happened, transforming data and information into insights and recommendations often through storytelling [image1].\n\nThese two concepts are complementary because the \"analysis\" phase within the Analytics Value Chain can be executed at various \"Levels of Analytics.\" For instance, when data is pushed through the value chain [4], the \"analysis\" component can range from basic standard reports (\"What happened?\") to sophisticated optimization (\"What's the best that can happen?\") as shown by the different levels [image2]. Applying higher levels of analytics within the value chain allows for deeper understanding, more accurate predictions, and more impactful recommendations, thereby enabling more effective decisions and actions, which in turn generate greater value and impact as defined by the value chain [4, 1].\n\nThus, the Analytics Value Chain provides the framework for converting data into impact, while the Levels of Analytics define the depth and sophistication of the analytical activities undertaken within that framework to generate insights and guide actions."}

Its primary role in an engine management system is to determine critical parameters like the amount of fuel and ignition timing necessary for the internal combustion engine to operate efficiently [4]. It accomplishes this by continuously reading values from various sensor devices that monitor the engine and then using this data to make adjustments [4].\n\n![The diagram illustrates the ECU centrally receiving inputs from various engine sensors and sending control signals to multiple injectors.](image5)\n\nAs shown in the diagram, the ECU is centrally positioned, receiving input from a range of sensors including engine temperature, intake air temperature, mass air flow, throttle position, oxygen (HEGO), crankshaft, and camshaft sensors. Based on this influx of data, the ECU then exercises control over the injectors, regulating the opening of these injectors [1] to manage fuel delivery. This control function is crucial in electronic fuel injection systems, where the ECU, often referred to as a control module, uses information from various engine sensors to regulate the opening and closing of injector valves [3].\n\n![The diagram shows the control system (ECU) receiving input from the detecting system and controlling the fuel metering system.](image2)\n\nWithin the broader fuel system, the \"CONTROL SYSTEM\" (which represents the ECU) receives data from the \"DETECTING SYSTEM\" and, in turn, sends control signals to the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM\" to manage how fuel is supplied to the engine. Beyond fuel, the ECU also governs other vital functions such as idle speed control, where it monitors engine RPM via the crankshaft position sensor and adjusts accordingly [5]. It also precisely controls ignition timing, adjusting when the spark plug fires to optimize power and fuel economy [6].\n\nThe ECU's role is to process information from engine sensors to control fuel injection, ignition timing, idle speed, and other essential engine operations."}

Variety becomes important because when enjoyment drops, we should switch to another choice [3]. In this context, focusing on consuming a single item repeatedly is often considered \"bad\" because enjoyment typically declines [4].\nConsider the consumption of hot dogs:\n![A child enjoys eating a hot dog.](image2)\nThe initial hot dog might provide significant pleasure, but with each subsequent one, the utility gained lessens, and can eventually become negative.\n![A table shows the utility from each hot dog consumed, demonstrating diminishing returns as consumption increases from 1 to 6 hot dogs.](image4)\nThis table clearly illustrates how the utility from the first hot dog is +10, but by the fourth hot dog, it drops to -1.\n\nHowever, this dynamic can change significantly in a competitive context. While focus in standard consumption might lead to lower utility, in competition, \"the cumulative effect of focus may be good\" [10]. This is because focused effort can lead to an \"improved activity outcome due to cumulative experience\" [7], which can dramatically alter the perceived utility.\n![A comparison table shows standard diminishing utility for hot dogs versus a competitive scenario where utility spikes at 64 hot dogs, illustrated by a photo of a hot dog eating champion.](image5)\nIn a hot dog eating contest, for example, the utility derived from consuming additional hot dogs is not solely based on taste or immediate satisfaction. As shown in the image, while the 63rd hot dog might yield negative utility (-50) in a typical diminishing returns scenario, consuming the 64th hot dog in a competition to tie for a championship could result in a massive positive utility (+5000). The outcome of winning or achieving a competitive goal introduces a different utility function that can override the standard diminishing marginal utility.\n\nIn standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility means each additional hot dog provides less satisfaction, whereas in a competitive context like a hot dog eating contest, consuming more hot dogs can lead to a significant increase in utility if it results in winning."}

This rate is part of a sequence that tracks how many leads convert into MQLs, then SALs, then Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs), and finally Sales Won Opportunities (SWOs) [4].\n\nAnother perspective is offered by cross-industry average conversion rates.\n`![Cross-industry average conversion rates showing MQL to SAL at 45-75%.](image5)`\nAccording to these averages, the conversion rate from MQLs (described as \"leads ready to be qualified\") to SALs (\"leads accepted by sales\") is significantly higher, ranging from 45% to 75%.\n\nThe substantial difference between the 1.50% rate seen in the specific funnel and the 45-75% cross-industry average has several implications. A low MQL to SAL conversion rate, like 1.50%, can indicate:\n*   **Misalignment in Lead Definition**: Marketing and sales may have different criteria for what constitutes a \"qualified\" lead. According to lead scoring principles, when a prospect's score reaches a pre-determined threshold, they are deemed Marketing Qualified and sales-ready [1]. If sales frequently rejects these MQLs, it suggests the scoring or threshold is not aligned with sales' expectations of readiness.\n*   **Poor Lead Quality**: Marketing might be passing leads that are not genuinely interested or ready for a sales conversation, despite being classified as MQLs.\n*   **Ineffective Handoff or Follow-up**: There might be issues in the process of transferring leads from marketing to sales, or sales may not be following up effectively or in a timely manner.\n\nConversely, a higher MQL to SAL conversion rate, such as the 45-75% average, generally implies:\n*   **Strong Sales and Marketing Alignment**: Both teams likely agree on lead definitions and quality criteria.\n*   **Effective Lead Nurturing and Scoring**: Marketing is doing a good job of nurturing leads and accurately identifying those who are sales-ready through a robust lead scoring methodology [1].\n*   **Efficient Sales Acceptance Process**: The sales team trusts the quality of MQLs and promptly accepts them for engagement.\n\nThe variation highlights the importance of continuously monitoring and optimizing the lead management process, ensuring clear communication and agreement between marketing and sales on lead qualification criteria to improve the efficiency of the lead funnel progression [4, 10].\n\nThe MQL to SAL conversion rates vary significantly, with one dataset showing 1.50% and another indicating a cross-industry average of 45-75%; these differences imply varying degrees of alignment between marketing and sales, lead quality, and the effectiveness of lead scoring and handoff processes."}
