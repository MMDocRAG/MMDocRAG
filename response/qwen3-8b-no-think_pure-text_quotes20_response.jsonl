The survey was weighted to correct for known demographic discrepancies and had a margin of sampling error of ±1.4 percentage points for results based on the complete set of weighted data.\n\nIn addition, the data reveals that **older women are more likely than older men to use social networking sites**, with **52%** of female internet users ages 65+ being social networking site adopters, compared with **39%** of older men. Furthermore, **social networking site usage is more common among the younger cohort of seniors**, and adoption drops off dramatically after age 80.\n\nThe table in image4 provides a comparison of demographic characteristics between internet users aged 65 and older and all adults aged 65 and older. Specifically, it shows that **among internet users aged 65+, 39% are male and 52% are female**, while **among all adults aged 65+, 25% are male and 29% are female**. This indicates a significant difference in the gender distribution between internet users and the general population of seniors.\n\n![{Among internet users aged 65+, 39% are male and 52% are female, while among all adults aged 65+, 25% are male and 29% are female}](image4)\n\nTo determine the gap between male 65+ age group who use internet and have broadband at home, we can infer that **47% of seniors have a high-speed broadband connection at home**, and this figure is likely distributed across both genders. However, the exact percentage of male seniors with broadband at home is not explicitly stated in the text or images provided. Therefore, based on the available information, the gap cannot be precisely quantified as a float value."}

Specifically, the text mentions that among Republicans, **7% are Hispanic** [3]. However, this percentage alone does not provide the total number of Republican Hispanics; it only tells us their proportion within the Republican group.\n\nFor the **no-lean group**, the text indicates that **55% of those with no political lean are male** [12], suggesting a significant portion of this group is male. Again, this is a percentage, not an absolute count.\n\nLooking at the images, **image3** provides detailed demographic breakdowns by political affiliation, including race/ethnicity and gender. According to **image3**, among **Republicans**, **7% are Hispanic**. This means that out of all Republicans, 7% identify as Hispanic. For the **no-lean group**, **55% are male** [image3], indicating that more than half of this group is male.\n\nWhile the exact numbers for each subgroup are not provided, we can infer based on the percentages. If we assume the total population of Republicans in 2018 was around 26% (as mentioned in the text), and 7% of them are Hispanic, then the number of Republican Hispanics would be approximately **7% of 26%** of the total population. On the other hand, the no-lean group accounts for **7%** of the total population, and **55% of that group is male**, meaning the number of no-lean males would be **55% of 7%** of the total population.\n\nThus, the number of **no-lean males** is likely greater than the number of **Republican Hispanics** in 2018.\n\n![{The no-lean group has a higher proportion of males compared to the proportion of Hispanic Republicans}](image3)  \nAccording to the data, the no-lean group has a higher proportion of males compared to the proportion of Hispanic Republicans.\n\nThe group greater in population in 2018 is **no-lean males**."}

In contrast, the share of Democrats holding this view has decreased by 12 percentage points since last year, from 42% to 30%.

[9] highlights that white evangelical Protestants are the most likely group to believe Islam encourages violence, with 70% expressing this view, compared to lower percentages among other religious groups like Catholics and white mainline Protestants. This aligns with [4], which shows that conservative Republicans are significantly more likely than liberals to believe Islam encourages violence, with 77% of conservative Republicans holding this view versus just 16% who disagree.\n\nDespite these trends, there has been some moderation in public opinion. [7] indicates that the overall percentage of Americans who believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence has dropped slightly from a historical high of 50% in September 2014 to 46% currently.

Likelihood statements are quantified, ranging from very unlikely (less than or equal to a 1 in 10 chance) to very likely (greater than or equal to a 9 in 10 chance) [3]. \n\nThese evaluations are informed by the synthesis of literature, expert consensus, and traceable accounts that document the rationale behind each Key Finding.

Similarly, **non-whites** are more resistant to such scrutiny, with **74%** of blacks and **66%** of Hispanics opposing it, compared to **57%** of whites [4]. Educational attainment also plays a role: **postgraduates (69%)** and **college graduates (65%)** are more likely to oppose increased scrutiny than those without a college degree [7].\n\nPolitically, **conservative Republicans** stand out as the only group where a majority (**57%**) supports greater scrutiny of Muslims due to their religion, while **liberal Democrats** are the most opposed, with **87%** saying Muslims should not face additional scrutiny [5].

According to [4], Americans’ ratings of the government’s efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks. For the first time, more now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) than say the government is doing either very or fairly well (46%). Positive ratings have fallen 26 points since January (when 72% said very/fairly well). This indicates a significant shift in public opinion over the past year.\n\n![{Negative trends in government anti-terror ratings}](image7)  \nThis line graph illustrates the changing perceptions of government anti-terror policies over time, showing a growing concern that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (from 49% in 2004 to 56% in 2015), while the belief that they have gone too far in restricting civil liberties has decreased from 29% to 28%. The lines intersect around 2010-2011, reflecting a shift in public sentiment toward greater concern about insufficient protection.\n\n[3] Evaluations of the government’s job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups: 58% say the government is doing very or fairly well, while 40% say it is doing not too or not at all well. By comparison, 48% of those with a bachelor’s degree, and 44% of those with less education, rate the government’s performance positively. This suggests that higher levels of education correlate with more positive evaluations of the government's anti-terrorism efforts.\n\n[9] Older, less educated individuals give more negative ratings of government efforts against terrorism. Specifically, [11] notes that among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat (42% say that it is). In contrast, 46% of younger adults (those 18-29 years old) give the government’s performance a negative rating, while 53% say it is doing very or fairly well. This highlights a generational divide in perceptions of government effectiveness.\n\n[6] There are wide partisan divides on the most important problem facing the nation. Four-in-ten (41%) Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues and national security or ISIS, while fewer independents (28%) and Democrats (23%) cite these issues. This reflects a significant difference in how political affiliations prioritize terrorism as a key issue.\n\n[10] The share citing terrorism as the most important problem facing the country today is the highest it has been since February 2003. Nearly three-in-ten (29%) Americans cite terrorism, national security or ISIS as the most important problem facing the country today. One year ago, just 4% of the public cited any of these issues. This indicates a renewed focus on terrorism as a critical national concern.\n\n[12] Compared to early 2015, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well (down from 85% in January). Independents’ positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%. And just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year. This shows a broad decline in public confidence, particularly among Republicans.\n\n[8] By two-to-one, Americans now say that they are more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%), rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (28%). Since the start of the year, there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough. This underscores a growing public perception that anti-terror measures are inadequate.\n\nIn summary, perceptions of terrorism and government efforts to combat it have shifted over time, with increasing concern about the adequacy of government actions and a noticeable generational and partisan divide in opinions."}

In contrast, Democrats are more likely to cite partisan gridlock and division in the country (8% of Democrats vs. 2% of Republicans) [8].\n\nRegarding economic issues, the survey indicates that there is a notable shift in public opinion over time. For instance, the percentage of respondents who consider terrorism as a major threat increased significantly from August 2014 to December 2015, with 83% citing ISIS as a major threat in December 2015, up from 67% in August 2014 [image4]. This suggests a growing concern among the public about global terrorism, particularly linked to ISIS.\n\n![{Concerns about Global Issues}(image4)]  \n\nOn the other hand, economic issues have seen a decline in prominence. The percentage of respondents who consider the economy as a major concern decreased from 14% in December 2014 to 9% in December 2015 [image8].

For example, 54% of users aged 18-29 find it acceptable, whereas only 39% of those aged 65 and older do, as depicted in ![{acceptability of product ads}](image3). This indicates that user comfort with these practices is heavily influenced by age.\n\n[4] The use of data for political campaigns elicits strong disapproval across all age groups, but the level of discomfort varies. Specifically, 31% of users aged 65 and older find it not at all acceptable, while younger users also express similar concerns, as shown in ![{acceptability of political messages}](image3).\n\n[5] Overall, user comfort with social media platforms using their data is context-dependent. For instance, 75% of users find it acceptable for platforms to use their data to recommend events they might like to attend, as indicated in ![{acceptability of event recommendations}](image2). However, this share drops significantly to 37% when the data are used for political messaging, highlighting a clear distinction in user perceptions based on the purpose of data usage.\n\n[6] Additionally, the survey reveals that users are generally less comfortable with these sites using their data to show advertisements for products or services, with around half (52%) considering it acceptable, but a similar share (47%) finding it not acceptable, as mentioned in [2]. This underscores the nuanced nature of user attitudes toward data usage.\n\n[7] Beyond specific uses, there is consistent opposition to platforms altering their interfaces or content based on user demographics.

For instance, the personal finance score algorithm is viewed as highly ineffective in terms of fairness, with only 32% of Americans considering it fair to consumers, while 54% believe it would be effective at identifying good customers. This creates a 22-percentage-point gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness, highlighting a major concern about the fairness of such systems [11].\n\nIn contrast, the automated scoring of people up for parole shows a relatively smaller gap, with 49% finding it effective and 50% considering it fair, resulting in a minimal difference of -1 percentage point. This suggests that while there is some skepticism, there is also a recognition of the potential utility of these systems in certain contexts [8]. However, the overall trend indicates a general lack of trust in these systems, particularly regarding their fairness.\n\n![{Public skepticism towards automated systems}](image3)  \nThe image illustrates the varying levels of perceived fairness across four scenarios, with the personal finance score being the least seen as fair, and the parole scoring system being the most viewed as fair. This visual representation underscores the disparity in public opinion regarding the fairness of different automated systems.\n\nMoreover, the public is largely skeptical about the fairness of these programs, with none viewed as fair by a clear majority. Concerns often revolve around the removal of the human element from important decisions and the inability of these systems to capture the nuance of complex situations [7]. These concerns are particularly pronounced in the context of personal finance scores and video job interviews, where significant portions of the population find these systems unacceptable due to perceived unfairness and privacy issues [2].\n\nThe image further highlights these sentiments through the distribution of opinions on fairness, emphasizing that the personal finance score is the most criticized in terms of fairness [image3]. The disparity between effectiveness and fairness ratings implies that while some systems may perform well in terms of functionality, they are not seen as equitable or just, which can erode public trust in their use.\n\nAdditionally, demographic differences play a role in perceptions of fairness, with racial and ethnic minorities expressing more concern about certain systems, such as parole scoring algorithms, compared to white individuals [10]. This variation suggests that trust in these systems is influenced by social and cultural factors, further complicating the issue of public acceptance.\n\n![{Perceptions of fairness across age groups}](image4)  \nThis chart demonstrates how age influences perceptions of bias in automated systems, showing that older age groups tend to be more skeptical about the unbiased nature of these technologies. This age-related perspective adds another layer to the understanding of public trust in algorithmic decision-making.\n\nOverall, the differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems imply a deep-seated public skepticism about the reliability and ethical implications of these technologies. This skepticism is rooted in concerns about bias, fairness, and the loss of human judgment in critical decision-making processes. The public’s preference for human involvement and the belief that these systems fail to account for individual circumstances further underscore the challenges in gaining widespread trust in algorithmic decision-making."}

This aligns with the broader perception that women in STEM face challenges such as gender discrimination and unequal treatment at work, which can hinder their career progression and sense of belonging [3].\n\n![{Women value helping others}(image7)]  \nOn the other hand, men in STEM are more likely to prioritize higher pay and opportunities for promotion. **57% of men** value opportunities for promotion, compared to **46% of women**, while **59% of men** value high-paying jobs, versus **48% of women** [7]. These preferences may reflect the structural barriers women encounter, such as the pay gap and limited advancement opportunities, which are often attributed to gender stereotypes and systemic discrimination [1].\n\nThe perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce are closely tied to these valuations. Many women report experiencing discrimination due to their gender, which can make it harder for them to succeed in STEM jobs [3]. Additionally, the lack of female role models and the perception that STEM fields are less welcoming to women further contribute to the underrepresentation of women in these areas [10].\n\n![{Discrimination and diversity in STEM}(image6)]  \n\nThe combination of these factors—such as workplace discrimination, unequal treatment, and the lack of supportive environments—creates a challenging landscape for women in STEM, which is reflected in their preference for roles that emphasize social impact and community contribution. These values highlight the need for systemic changes to address gender disparities and create more inclusive and equitable workplaces in STEM. \n\nThe differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM reflect deeper societal and structural issues that influence career choices and experiences within the field."}

Furthermore, among self-identified Hispanics, the percentage reporting discrimination decreases with each generation: 42% of immigrants, 38% of second-generation, and 29% of third or higher generation. This suggests that as individuals become more integrated into American society, they may experience less discrimination, or may be less aware of it.\n\n![{Discrimination experiences by generation}](image5)  \nImage5 provides further insight into how discrimination perceptions change over time. It shows that self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry are far less likely to report discrimination compared to self-identified Hispanics. Specifically, 87% of non-Hispanics say they have never been discriminated against, whereas 39% of self-identified Hispanics report experiencing discrimination. This gap widens with each generation, indicating a decline in perceived discrimination as one moves away from immigrant origins.\n\nThese findings collectively suggest that generational differences play a crucial role in shaping both racial identification and the perception of discrimination among Hispanics. As generations progress, there is a noticeable shift toward identifying as White and a reduction in reported experiences of discrimination, reflecting broader social integration and changing cultural identities. \n\nThe generational differences impact the perception of discrimination and racial identification among Hispanics by showing a decrease in discrimination experiences and an increase in racial identification as White with each subsequent generation."}

For instance, 90% of mobile phone users in Indonesia used IM daily, with WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE being the top applications [10]. This shift led to reduced usage of traditional voice calls and SMS, contributing to lower ARPUs for these services [9]. \n\nAdditionally, the competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector saw CDMA operators managing to force GSM operators, including Telkomsel, to reduce their tariffs [6]. This price competition likely contributed to the downward pressure on ARPU. Furthermore, the initial reduction in ARPU was also due to a government-initiated price war [7]. \n\nOverall, the combination of technological shifts, competitive pressures, and changing consumer behavior contributed to the changes in Telkomsel's subscriber base and ARPU from 2013 to 2014."}

The OpenAI fam- ily models are implemented using OpenAI APIs. Running one round of experiment with ChatGPT model takes approximately 1 hour, and costs about 3 USD. Running one round of experiment with GPT4 model takes approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, and costs about 60 USD. Each LLaMA family model is run on one TESLA V100 GPU, where each run takes about 6 to 8 hours for Alpaca-7B and Vicuna-13B, and about 12-16 hours for LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B.  \n[3] Next, we evaluate  [NA] precision  and  recall .  \n[4] We present the Human Evaluation Instructions provided to the annotators in Table  8 . We follow the implementation from ( Clark et al. ,  2021 ), and provide detailed instructions and examples to im- prove evaluation accuracy. For this human evalu- ation, there are four individual annotators in total. We arrange different annotators for different base- lines, and each baseline has two annotators. The Inter-Annotator Agreement for ChatGPT, LLaMA- 7B, and Vicuna-13B are reported as follows:   $90\\%$  ,  $97\\%$  , and   $89\\%$   respectively.  \n[5] Text-Citation Alignment From Table  3 , similar to citation quality, the OpenAI models also out- perform the LLaMA based models on text-citation alignment. In addition, models with 7B, 13B, 175B (ChatGPT), and trillion level (GPT4) parameters have an alignment score of  $40+,60+,80+$  , and 92 respectively. LLaMA-13B model has an improve- ment of 14.3 compared to LLaMA-7B model. This shows that parameter size may play an important role in generating sentences and citations with good alignment.  \n[6] We compare experiments results of text, citation (micro), and alignment between the general and specific questions in Table  7 . The results show that the same model’s answers on specific questions outperform those on general questions in almost all metrics. The finding is not surprising because the specific questions provide clearer instructions to the models on which knowledge to use. In addition, the general questions in the dataset are inherently loosely bonded to the minimum knowledge set, and hence have impacts on the evaluation results. This experiment shows a trade-off between how explic- itly the question context mentions the knowledge, and how ir replace ably the knowledge is required by the question. The specific questions target the knowledge more explicitly in the question context, and hence cover the scope of the paragraph better. It stands for an upper bound for knowledge cover- age and a lower bound for question naturalness.The general questions implicitly target the knowledge in the question context, and there loosely cover the scope of the paragraph. It stands for an upper bound for question naturalness and a lower bound for knowledge coverage.  \n[7] We propose KaLMA that comprises a new dataset BioKaLMA, a pipeline for generating attributed answers by retrieving from KGs, and a set of au- tomatic evaluation metrics to assess text quality, citation quality, and text-citation alignment. We introduce the “Conscious Incompetence” setting, enabling LLMs to identify the knowledge required to support the answers but is absent from the KG. Through this benchmark, we address three chal- lenges: incorporating diverse attribution sources, limited attribution source coverage, and the ab- sence of human annotated ground truth for auto- matic evaluation.  \n[8] LLaMA We conduct experiments with LLaMA- 7B ( Touvron et al. ,  2023 ) and LLaMA-13B since they are powerful open-source models that are widely accessible. We have also conducted hu- man instruction tuned LLaMA models, includ- ing Alpaca-7B ( Taori et al. ,  2023 ) and Vicuna-13B ( Chiang et al. ,  2023 ).  \n[9] In general, there is a room of improvement for all models since no model can achieve a micro F1 Score of higher than 40. The OpenAI models out- perform the LLaMA family models in almost all metrics. The correctness is above 94 for OpenAI models, but around 70 for LLaMA based models. For ChatGPT, temperature does not play a signifi- cant role since it effect on F1 Score is at most 1.2. The GPT-4 model achieves the best performance across almost all metrics, except for recall, since GPT-4 models tend to generate shorter answers with fewer citations, resulting in higher precision. While LLaMA is better at Recall by generating long answers with many citations. The F1-Score of models from the same family are close to one an- other, showing that our automatic evaluation metric designed is reliable.  \n[10] Text Quality Evaluation We present the evalu- ation of generated text quality in Table  4 . From the results, we find that OpenAI models, in general, have better text quality in all metrics compared to LLaMA family models, which corresponds to the citation evaluation results. All models exhibit rather high consistency, indicating that the LLMs  \n[11] We conduct human evaluation to verify the correla- tion between automatic evaluation and human judg- ment. We randomly sample 100 sentence-citation pairs from each of the three baselines: ChatGPT (temperature 0.5), LLaMA-7B, and Vicuna-13B. We request two proficient English annotators for each baseline to determine if the citation aligns to the sentence and provides support for it. The reason we choose metric alignment here is in appendix  C , with instruction to annotators and IAA.  \n[12] Retrieval-augmented LLMs KiC ( Pan et al. , 2022 ) empower models with external memory of multiple formats including knowledge graph but does not explore attribution. WebGPT ( Nakano et al. ,  2021 ) outsources document retrieval to Mi- crosoft Bing and fine-tunes GPT3 to answer ques- tions. GopherCite ( Menick et al. ,  2022 ) fine-tunes a Gopher ( Rae et al. ,  2021 ) model to generate text alongside quotes extracted from Google search. ALCE ( Gao et al. ,  2023 ) retrieves top-k passages from Wikipedia and asks LLMs to generate outputs with citations to corresponding supporting docu- ments. These works attribute LLMs to unstructured Evaluation ( Rashkin et al. ,  2021 ) define the “At- tributable to Identified Sources” (AIS) to mea- sure whether model-generated statements are sup- ported by underlying sources. ( Bohnet et al. ,  2022 ) study an automatic metric (AutoAIS) that formu- lates evaluation of automated question answer- ing as a NLI task.

ALCE ( Gao et al. ,  2023 ) evaluates generated answers by comparing with gold answers using MAUVE, and calculates precision and recall for citations using NLI. To the best of our knowledge, our evaluation methods are the first framework that requires no human annotated data.  \n\n![{F1 metric comparison in tables}](image6)  \n![{F1 metric comparison in tables}](image3)  \n![{F1 metric comparison in tables}](image7)  \n![{F1 metric comparison in tables}](image1)  \n![{F1 metric comparison in tables}](image5)  \n\nThere are five tables that include \"F1\" as a metric."}

Empirically, Figure 2 reveals that the class distribution in the selected query is highly unbalanced.

It is because data of the minority classes occurs much less frequently than those of the majority classes.  \n\n[7] As we present in Table 1, label diversity is an important underlying criterion in designing active querying criteria. We plot the full results on all three MedMNIST datasets in Figure 6. Most existing active querying strategies became more performant and robust in the presence of label diversity.  \n\n[12] Figure 2 shows our querying strategy can yield better label diversity than other six dominant active querying strategies; similar observations are made in Organ AM NIST and BloodMNIST (Figure 7) as well as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-LT (Figure 10).  \n\n[9] Unlike most existing works [38, 54], which tested on highly balanced annotated datasets, we deliberately examine our method and other baselines on long-tail datasets to simulate real-world scenarios. Three medical datasets of different modalities Table 1: Diversity is a significant add-on to most querying strategies. AUC scores of different querying strategies are compared on three medical imaging datasets. In either low budget (i.e. 0.5% or 1% of MedMNIST datasets) or high budget (i.e. 10% or 20% of CIFAR-10-LT) regimes, both random and active querying strategies benefit from enforcing the label diversity of the selected data.  \n\n[10] As illustrated in Table 7 and Figure 9, label diversity is an important underlying criterion in designing active querying criteria on CIFAR-10-LT, an extremely imbalanced dataset. We compare the results of CIFAR-10-LT with MedMNIST datasets Figure 6. CIFAR-10-LT is more imbalanced than MedMNIST, and the performance gain and robustness improvement of label diversity CIFAR-10-LT is significantly larger than MedMNIST. Most of the active querying strategies fail to query all the classes even at relatively larger initial query budgets.  \n\n[2] Most active querying strategies have selection bias towards specific classes, thus the class coverage in their selections might be poor (see Table 2), particularly at low budgets. By simply enforcing label diversity to these querying strategies can significantly improve the performance (see Table 1), which suggests that the label diversity is one of the causes that existing active querying strategies perform poorer than random selection.  \n\n[11] Dataset map. Given $K$ clusters generated from Criterion #1, we now determine which data points ought to be selected from each cluster. Intuitively, a data point can better represent a cluster distribution if it is harder to contrast itself with other data points in this cluster—we consider them typical data. To find these typical data, we modify the original Dataset $\\mathrm{{\\bf~M}a p}^{3}$ by replacing the ground truth term with a pseudo-label term. This modification is made because ground truths are unknown in the active learning setting but pseudo-labels are readily accessible from Criterion #1. For a visual comparison, Figure 3b and Figure 3c present the Data Maps based on ground truths and pseudo-labels, respectively. Form y, the modified Data Map can be formulated a ollows. Let $\\grave{\\mathcal{D}}=\\{\\pmb{x}_{m}\\}_{m=1}^{M}$ denote a dataset of M unlabeled images. Considering a minibatch of N images, for each image ${\\pmb x}_{n}$, its two augmented views form a positive pair, denoted as $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}$ and $\\tilde{\\pmb{x}}_{j}$. The contrastive prediction task i on pairs of augmented images derived from the minibatch generate $2N$ images, in which a true label $y_{n}^{*}$ for an anchor augmentation is associated with its counterpart of the positive pair. We treat the other $2(N-1)$ augmented images within a minibatch as negative pairs. We define the probability of positive pair in the instance discrimination task as:  \n\n[5] Our proposed active querying strategy is capable of covering the majority of classes in most low budget scenarios by integrating K-means clustering and contrastive features, including the tail classes (e.g. femur-left, basophil). Compared to the existing active querying criteria, we achieve the best class coverage of selected query among at all budgets presented in Table 2.  \n\n[8] 2.2 Intra-class Criterion: Querying Hard-to-Contrast Data to Avoid Outliers  \n\n[3] Table 7: Diversity is a significant add-on to most querying strategies. AUC scores of different querying strategies are compared on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-LT. In the low budget regime (e.g. 10% and 20% of the entire dataset), active querying strategies benefit from enforcing the label diversity of the selected data. The cells are highlighted in blue when adding diversity performs no worse than the original querying strategies. Some results are missing (marked as “-”) because the querying strategy fails to sample at least one data point for each class. Results of more sampling ratios are presented in Appendix Figure 9.  \n\n[6] Figure 7: [Continued from Figure 2] Our querying strategy yields better label diversity. Random on the leftmost denotes the class distribution of randomly queried samples, which can also reflect the approximate class distribution of the entire dataset. As seen, even with a relatively larger initial query budget (691 images, 2% of Organ AM NIST, and 2,391 images, 20% of BloodMNIST), most active querying strategies are biased towards certain classes. For example in Organ AM NIST, VAAL prefers selecting data in the femur-right and platelet class, but largely ignores data in the lung, liver and monocyte classes. On the contrary, our querying strategy not only selects more data from minority classes (e.g., femur-left and basophil) while retaining the class distribution of major classes.  \n\n[12] $K$-means and MoCo v2 are certainly not the only choices for clustering and feature extraction. We employ these two well-received methods for simplicity and efficacy in addressing the cold start problem.  \n\n[4] Active learning tends to select data that is biased to specific classes. Empirically, Figure 2 reveals that the class distribution in the selected query is highly unbalanced. These active querying strategies (e.g. Entropy, Margin, VAAL, etc.) can barely outperform random sampling at the beginning because some classes are simply not selected for training. It is because data of the minority classes occurs much less frequently than those of the majority classes. Moreover, datasets in practice are often highly unbalanced, particularly in medical images [32, 58]. This can escalate the biased sampling. We hypothesize that the label diversity of a query is an important criterion to determine the importance of the annotation. To evaluate this hypothesis theoretically, we explore the upper bound performance by enforcing a uniform distribution using ground truth (Table 1) To evaluate this hypothesis practically, we pursue the label diversity by exploiting the pseudo-labels generated by $K$-means clustering (Table 2). The label diversity can reduce the redundancy in the selection of majority classes, and increase the diversity by including data of minority classes.  \n\n[10] As illustrated in Table 7 and Figure 9, label diversity is an important underlying criterion in designing active querying criteria on CIFAR-10-LT, an extremely imbalanced dataset. We compare the results of CIFAR-10-LT with MedMNIST datasets Figure 6.

This encoding is then combined with the encoding of the previous system action to update the dialogue state within a dialogue-level LSTM [3]. \n\nThe updated dialogue state, along with the query results encoding, serves as input to the policy network, which generates a probability distribution over candidate values for each tracked goal slot [10].

As shown in Figure 6, increasing the number of demonstrations from 1 to 5 leads to a clear improvement in performance, but further increases (e.g., ≥10) yield diminishing returns [1]. However, when logical constraints are added, there is a consistent improvement, particularly when combined with a moderate number of demonstrations [1].\n\n![{The impact of logical constraints and demonstration samples on model performance}](image1)\n\nThis suggests that while more demonstrations can help, they are not always necessary if logical constraints are effectively incorporated. For instance, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints outperforms 10 demonstrations without them, achieving a higher Micro-F1 score on MAVEN-ERE [1]. This indicates that teaching LLMs both \"what\" (demonstrations) and \"how\" (logical constraints) is crucial for improving reasoning performance.\n\nAdditionally, the image highlights that as the number of iterations increases in iterative retrieval approaches, the logical inconsistency of answers decreases, although the overall micro-F1 remains relatively stable [1]. This implies that while iterative methods can reduce errors, they may also introduce redundant information, potentially affecting the efficiency of the model's output.\n\n![{Iterative retrieval and its effect on logical consistency}](image1)\n\nIn another example, the table demonstrates that incorporating logical constraints into prompts can lead to significant improvements in performance across various models, including Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT, especially on datasets like MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank [3].

The results are shown in the top four rows of Table  2  (for brevity, here we only report the average of the met- rics from each task). We observe that removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in per- formance.

One possible explanation is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difﬁcult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. As another possible reason of this be- havior, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names. Many author names are out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT and thus, they might be split into sub-words and shared across names that are not semantically related, leading to noisy correlation.

As noted in [5], the data augmentation technique is similar to the +negative method, but it uses negative training examples as templates, resulting in a dataset with 21% positive and 79% negative examples. This imbalance affects model performance due to the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples, which can dominate training and hinder the model's ability to distinguish between hard-negative and positive examples, as explained in [7] and [8]. \n\n![{The table presents the performance of different models on two datasets: Chinese MSRA and Chinese OntoNotes 4.0.

Specifically, for SQuAD v1.1, BERT with DSC achieves an F1 score of 89.51, surpassing XLNet by +1.25 in F1 and +0.84 in EM. On QuoRef, it also outperforms XLNet by +1.46 in EM and +1.41 in F1 [2].\n\nThe impact of data augmentation is also notable. The **+positive** augmentation, which creates a balanced dataset, leads to better performance compared to the original training set, while **+negative** augmentation, which creates a more imbalanced dataset, results in lower performance.

According to [3], COMET is a novel neural framework for training MT evaluation models that can serve as automatic metrics and be adapted to different types of human judgements. This suggests that COMET, including COMET-RANK, is designed to better capture the nuances of translation quality compared to traditional metrics like BLEU.\n\n![{COMET-RANK and BLEU performance comparison across language pairs}](image2)  \nAs shown in image2, COMET-RANK achieves the highest scores in its respective language pairs when compared to other metrics, including BLEU. This indicates that COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU in evaluating translation quality across several language pairs.\n\n[4] Table 1 presents results for all eight language pairs with English as the source, showing that the three C OMET models trained with the C OMET framework outperform all other metrics, including BLEU. This highlights the superior performance of COMET-RANK over BLEU in capturing translation quality accurately.\n\n[6] Traditional metrics such as BLEU rely on n-gram matching to assess similarity between the MT hypothesis and the reference translation. However, these metrics often fail to recognize semantic similarity beyond the lexical level, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the true quality of translations.\n\n[8] Results from Figure 3 show that for language pairs where English is the target, the COMET models are either better or competitive with all others, while BLEU serves as a baseline. This further emphasizes the advantage of COMET-RANK over BLEU in terms of performance.\n\n[9] Embedding-based metrics like BERTScore create soft-alignments between references and hypotheses in an embedding space to compute semantic similarity. While BLEU focuses on n-gram matching, COMET-RANK leverages more sophisticated models that can better align with human judgments, leading to improved performance.\n\n[10] The inclusion of the source language input in the model significantly improves the correlation with human judgments. This is evident in the results where models using both reference and source inputs outperform those using only the reference, suggesting that COMET-RANK benefits from this additional information.\n\n[11] Table 2 shows that the COMET-RANK model outperforms the recently proposed English-specific BLEURT metric in five out of seven language pairs. This indicates that COMET-RANK is not limited to English and performs well across various language pairs, unlike BLEURT which has limitations due to its reliance on English-BERT.\n\n[12] The results in Table 3 confirm that the COMET models generalize well even when tested on language pairs that do not include English. This demonstrates the robustness of COMET-RANK compared to BLEU, which may not perform as consistently across different language pairs.\n\n![{Performance trends of COMET-RANK and BLEU across different numbers of top MT systems}](image5)  \nAs illustrated in image5, COMET metrics (Rank, MQM, HTER) and BERTSCORE generally perform better than BLEU and BLEURT across different sets of systems, as indicated by higher Kendall Tau values. BLEU shows the lowest performance, demonstrating a clear trend where COMET-RANK outperforms BLEU in evaluating translation quality.\n\nIn summary, COMET-RANK demonstrates superior performance compared to BLEU in evaluating translation quality across various language pairs, highlighting its ability to capture more nuanced aspects of translation quality."}

Table  5  shows the top-10 slots, according to the ratio of ground-truth slot values which cannot be found through span matching. That is, for such examples, DS-Span cannot extract the ground-truth strings, resulting in the low joint accuracy. Here, we show how well our DS-DST and DS-Picklist can correctly predict the missing values in DS-Span. As we can see in this table, the two methods dra- matically reduce the errors for some slots such as attraction-type ,  hotel-internet  and  hotel-parking Hence, for these kinds of slots, it is better to treat them as categorical slots. Among the top-10 slots, the  time -related slots such as  taxi-leave at  and  train- arrive by , which are span-based slots in DS-DST, DS-Span and DS-DST cannot perform well as there are no span matching in the dialogue context, and only few values (i.e., ‘ none ’ and ‘ dontcare ’) can be correctly predicted by the slot-gate classiﬁcation. When the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist can further reduce the error rates, since the predicted values can be found in the candidate-values lists. \n\n[12] Table 4: The slot-level accuracy on the test set of Mul- tiWOZ 2.1.   $^{\\circ}+/-^{\\circ}$   indicates absolute performance im- provement/degradation compared with DS-Span.

Comparing the second and third columns, we can see the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings. This indicates that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence. ![{The alignment of word embeddings had minimal impact on BLEU scores across all languages}](image3)\n\n[6] Until now, we have been using embeddings that have been trained independently in the source and target languages, and as a result there will not necessarily be a direct correspondence between the embedding spaces in both languages. However, we can postulate that having consistent embedding spaces across the two languages may be beneficial, as it would allow the NMT system to more easily learn correspondences between the source and target. To test this hypothesis, we adopted the approach proposed by Smith et al. (2017) to learn orthogonal transformations that convert the word embeddings of multiple languages to a single space and used these aligned embeddings instead of independent ones.\n\n[7] From Table 4, we can see that somewhat surprisingly, the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages. This, in a way, is good news, as it indicates that a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios. ![{The alignment of word embeddings showed little to no benefit in improving BLEU scores}](image3)\n\n[8] Our conclusions have practical effects on the recommendations for when and why pre-trained embeddings may be effective in NMT, particularly in low-resource scenarios: (1) there is a sweet-spot where word embeddings are most effective, where there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all, (2) pre-trained embeddings seem to be more effective for more similar translation pairs, (3) a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios, but is helpful in multi-lingual training scenarios.\n\n[2] Aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks. These increases are intuitive, as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space. Pre-training and alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language.\n\n[5] From Table 3, we can see that the BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT do generally follow this hypothesis. As we move to very different languages, RU and HE see larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts FR and IT. This can be largely attributed to the observation from the previous section that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; RU and HE have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger.\n\n[9] The main intuitive hypothesis as to why pre-training works is that the embedding space becomes more consistent, with semantically similar words closer together. We can also make an additional hypothesis: if the two languages in the translation pair are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods will be more similar between the two languages (i.e., semantic distinctions or polysemy will likely manifest themselves in more similar ways across more similar languages). As a result, we may expect that the gain from pre-training of embeddings may be larger when the source and target languages are more similar.\n\n[12] Q4: Effect of Word Embedding Alignment\n\nThe alignment of word embeddings has a nuanced impact on BLEU scores in different language translation tasks. While aligning embeddings can theoretically help the model learn correspondences between source and target languages, the practical benefits vary depending on the similarity of the languages and the amount of training data available. In some cases, such as with highly dissimilar languages like RU → EN, the gains from alignment are minimal or even negative. Conversely, for more similar language pairs, alignment might offer marginal improvements. Overall, the results suggest that while alignment can be beneficial in certain contexts, it is not always necessary, especially in bilingual settings. The effectiveness of alignment is further influenced by the size of the training data, with smaller datasets showing more pronounced gains from pre-training and alignment techniques."}

For instance, **RU → PT** and **HE → PT**, which are more linguistically dissimilar, show larger gains in BLEU scores compared to **FR → PT** and **IT → PT**, which are more similar [1]. This aligns with the hypothesis that systems with lower baseline performance (i.e., those with less headroom for improvement) tend to benefit more from pre-training [1].\n\n![{pre-training improves accuracy for dissimilar language pairs}](image1)\n\n[2] The role of training set size is also critical. As shown in the graphs, pre-training provides more substantial improvements when the training data is limited. For example, the gain in BLEU score is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4 [4]. This suggests that while a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, once enough data is available to capture basic language characteristics, pre-training can be highly effective [4].\n\n![{pre-training benefits are more pronounced with smaller training sets}](image2)\n\n[3] Language similarity further influences the efficacy of pre-trained embeddings. The results indicate that more similar language pairs, such as **GL / PT**, demonstrate greater gains from pre-training compared to less similar pairs like **BE / RU** [10].

The base model row in Table 3 indicates the results evaluated on the four domains using their in-domain training data, and the Training $1\\%$ New Domain row indicates the results achieved by training from scratch using $1\\%$ of the new domain data.

Although performances on the other zero-shot domains are not especially promising, they still achieve around 50 to 65% slot accuracy without using any in-domain samples.

This highlights the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model accuracy, particularly in challenging multi-hop tasks where reasoning across multiple paragraphs is required.\n\n[7] BERT achieves near chance accuracy on comparison questions, which are typically not solvable by single-hop models. This underscores the limitations of single-hop reasoning in handling complex, multi-hop tasks, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated models or strategies that can effectively process and reason over multiple paragraphs.\n\n[11] Single-hop reasoning can solve a significant portion of the HOTPOT QA dataset, demonstrating that multi-hop reasoning is not always necessary. However, this also implies that many questions may be solvable with simpler, single-hop approaches, suggesting that future datasets should carefully consider what evidence they provide to ensure multi-hop reasoning is genuinely required.\n\n[8] In open-domain settings, the single-hop model struggles due to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions. The F1 score increases from 39.12 to 53.12 when additional gold paragraphs are provided, highlighting the critical role of retrieving relevant evidence in improving model performance.\n\n[6] Multi-hop reading comprehension (RC) questions are challenging because they require reasoning over multiple paragraphs. The study introduces a single-hop BERT-based RC model that achieves 67 F1—comparable to state-of-the-art multi-hop models. This suggests that even single-hop models can perform well on multi-hop tasks, potentially shifting the focus towards information retrieval-style evaluations with large and diverse evidence collections.\n\nIn conclusion, different training and evaluation strategies significantly affect F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Adversarial training and careful selection of evidence can enhance model performance, while the limitations of single-hop models in complex tasks highlight the need for more sophisticated approaches."}

In the original setup, BERT achieved a peak performance of $77\\%$, which was only three points below the average untrained human baseline [1]. However, when tested on the adversarial dataset, BERT's peak performance dropped to $53\\%$, with mean and median scores at $50\\%$ [6]. This decline indicates that BERT's high performance on the original dataset was largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues, such as the presence of cue words like \"not\" in the warrant [2].\n\nThe adversarial dataset is constructed by negating claims and inverting labels for each data point, thereby mirroring the distribution of statistical cues around both labels [9]. This transformation effectively eliminates the spurious cues that models like BERT relied on, leading to random performance across all models [8]. The results suggest that without these cues, models cannot achieve meaningful performance, indicating that they have not truly learned to comprehend arguments but rather have memorized or exploited statistical patterns [10].\n\n![{BERT's performance on adversarial dataset}](image1)  \nThis table highlights the performance metrics of various models, including BERT, on the adversarial dataset. It shows that BERT's performance drops significantly compared to its performance on the original dataset, further supporting the conclusion that its success was based on exploiting spurious cues.\n\nMoreover, the adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension, as it removes the reliance on these cues and forces models to understand the underlying logic of the arguments [3]. The authors conclude that this dataset should be adopted as the standard for future research on ARCT, as it offers a more accurate assessment of model capabilities [8].\n\nIn summary, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's performance on the ARCT dataset was not a result of true argument comprehension but rather an exploitation of statistical patterns, and the adversarial dataset provides a more reliable benchmark for evaluating models."}

Closed vocabulary models, such as word-only models, generally exhibit lower sensitivity compared to open vocabulary models like char-only, word+char, or word-piece models. This is because closed vocabulary models treat all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words alike, reducing the number of unique outputs they generate. In contrast, open vocabulary models consider every unique combination of characters differently, leading to higher sensitivity.\n\nFor example, the pass-through version of open vocabulary models is more sensitive than the background variant since it passes words as is, treating each combination uniquely. However, for word-only models, pass-through is less sensitive as all OOV character combinations are rendered identical. The neutral backoff variation has the lowest sensitivity due to mapping UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, resulting in the highest robustness on most attack types for all four model classes.\n\n![{Sensitivity and WER comparison between closed and open vocabulary models}](image3)  \nThe scatter plots illustrate the relationship between sensitivity and WER for word-only and char-only models. For word-only models, the Pass-through variant shows a WER of around 11 and sensitivity of approximately 12, while the Background variant has a WER of around 10.5 and sensitivity of about 12.7. The Neutral variant demonstrates a WER of 11 and sensitivity of around 12. For char-only models, the Pass-through variant has a WER of approximately 10 and sensitivity of around 30, indicating higher sensitivity but potentially lower robustness.\n\nIn summary, closed vocabulary models typically show lower sensitivity and better robustness under various backoff strategies, while open vocabulary models tend to have higher sensitivity and may require more sophisticated backoff strategies to achieve similar levels of robustness."}

Total liabilities increased from $422,393 million in 2020 to $443,854 million in 2021, reflecting an increase of approximately $21,461 million. This growth is primarily attributed to increases in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as notes payable and other borrowings.\n\n![{Total liabilities increased from $422,393 million in 2020 to $443,854 million in 2021}](image4)\n\nOn the equity side, shareholders' equity rose from $506.2 billion in 2020 to $506.2 billion in 2021, indicating a relatively stable position. However, it's important to note that comprehensive income for 2021 was $91,041 million, which is significantly higher than the $44,272 million recorded in 2020. This increase in comprehensive income contributed positively to the equity base, despite the rise in liabilities.\n\nThe net earnings for 2021 were $89.8 billion, which is a substantial figure that supports the growth in equity. The increase in comprehensive income and net earnings indicates strong financial performance, which helps offset the increase in liabilities and contributes to maintaining a robust capital base.\n\nIn summary, while total liabilities increased slightly from 2020 to 2021, the growth in comprehensive income and net earnings played a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing the shareholders' equity position during the same period."}

However, the total impairment losses decreased significantly from 982 million DKK in 2019 to 350 million DKK in 2020, as noted in [10]. This reduction is attributed to Management’s review of expectations related to patents and licences not yet in use.

These assets are tested annually for impairment regardless of any indication of impairment, as noted in [12].

For instance, the global percentage of women in managerial positions stands at 15.1%, indicating a continued focus on increasing representation in leadership roles.\n\nIn Japan, where gender diversity has been identified as a particular challenge, Toyota has implemented specific measures to support women, including initiatives to balance work and childcare since 2002 [5]. These include expanding measures to support women and focusing on creating a work environment that motivates and supports their participation, especially in developing female managers [5]. Additionally, Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan has incorporated anti-discrimination policies against LGBT individuals into employee behavioral guidelines and has removed the requirement for new graduates to disclose their sex on job application forms [8].\n\n![{Toyota's initiatives for promoting gender diversity and inclusion}](image7)  \nImage7 provides an overview of specific initiatives to promote female employee participation at major global operations of Toyota. In Europe, TME (Belgium) organizes events during International Women’s Day, offers support for working couples, and implements mentorship and sponsorship systems for female career development. In China, TMCI allows lactating female employees to take up to one hour of breastfeeding breaks each day. In South Africa, TSAM conducts leadership workshops to ensure the acceptance and promotion of women in the workplace and sets employment targets to enhance gender diversity.\n\nToyota also emphasizes the recruitment and development of employees based on empathy and the ability to act, ensuring that individuals are placed in roles that match their strengths regardless of nationality, gender, or other factors [9]. The company has set targets to increase mid-career hires from 10% to 34% (FY2021 result), with a medium-term goal of reaching 50% [10], further contributing to a diverse workforce.\n\n![{Women participating in the Annual Toyota Women’s Conference}](image5)  \nImage5 shows a group of women at the Annual Toyota Women’s Conference in Australia, highlighting the company's efforts to engage and empower female employees through networking and professional development opportunities.\n\nThrough these initiatives, Toyota aims to create an attractive workplace where employees with diverse skills and values can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and achieve self-realization [6]. By addressing regional challenges and promoting a culture of inclusivity, Toyota continues to work toward its mission of \"Producing Happiness for All.\""}

Shortlisted candidates are then interviewed by the Chair and the Nomination and Governance Committee before a final recommendation is made for Board appointment.\n\nIn addition to succession planning, the Committee ensures director development through continuous improvement activities. Non-executive Directors participate in training and development programs that cover business matters, including environmental, social, and governance issues, as well as updates on BHP’s operations and markets. These programs are designed to maximise effectiveness and are periodically reviewed based on the results of Director performance evaluations [image4](image4).\n\nThe Committee also supports the Board in managing conflicts of interest, ensuring that Directors can act independently and in the best interests of BHP. This includes reviewing situations of actual or potential conflict and making recommendations to the Board regarding their authorisation [image11](image11).\n\nThrough these comprehensive steps and ongoing engagement, the Nomination and Governance Committee ensures that BHP's Board remains well-equipped, diverse, and capable of addressing the evolving needs of the organisation. \n\nBHP's Nomination and Governance Committee ensures effective board succession planning and director development through a structured, rigorous eight-step process involving candidate selection, role description, interviews, and background checks, alongside continuous training and development programs tailored to each Director’s needs."}

The goodwill arising from the acquisition or termination of franchise contracts corresponds to the amount of the intangible assets that did not meet the requirements established in IFRS 3 for separate recognition [9]. These requirements related essentially to the capacity of the assets to generate future cash flows.\n\n![{The table shows changes in goodwill balances over two periods, including acquisitions, disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange differences affecting the balances.}](image1)\n\nFrom the data presented in the table, we observe that the initial balance of \"Guarantees\" was 378 in 2020, which decreased to 329 by the end of 2021 due to disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange translation differences. In 2021, there were acquisitions worth 6, which only affected the \"Guarantees\" category. By the end of 2022, the balance further decreased to 290, indicating a continued reduction in goodwill components over the period.\n\nAdditionally, the recovery of goodwill is adequately guaranteed through the profitability of the acquired companies, whose future cash flows support the carrying amount of goodwill at year-end [3]. This suggests that despite the reductions, the goodwill remains supported by the ongoing performance of the acquired entities.\n\nThe activity and results of 2021 were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a material impact on the majority of markets where the Group operated due to lockdown measures and restricted mobility [10]. This context may have influenced the changes in goodwill components during this period.\n\nIn conclusion, the key differences in goodwill components between 2021 and 2020 are primarily reflected in the reductions observed in the balances, driven by disposals, transfers, and foreign exchange translation differences, alongside the impact of the pandemic on financial operations."}

The finance lease costs also saw a slight decrease, from $45 million in 2020 to $66 million in 2021, although this increase might be due to the nature of finance lease accounting and the capitalization of lease liabilities.\n\n![{Financial data comparing Operating Leases and Finance Leases for December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020}](image6)  \nThe table illustrates that total lease liabilities for operating leases decreased from $3,906 million in 2020 to $3,503 million in 2021, while finance lease liabilities decreased from $633 million in 2020 to $497 million in 2021.

This increase reflects a broader expansion in credit risk exposure, which directly affects the total RWA and, consequently, the capital ratios. The rise in Credit Risk RWA is evident in the data provided in image4, where the final balance at December 31, 2020, for Credit Risk RWA under the Standardized Approach reached $387,066 million, compared to $342,684 million in 2019.\n\n![{Credit Risk RWA Increase and Total RWA Comparison}](image4)\n\nExternal TLAC as a percentage of RWA also showed an increase, rising from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, as shown in image7. This indicates that the institution maintained a strong buffer relative to its RWA, enhancing its ability to absorb losses. However, the slight decrease in the percentage suggests a modest shift in the composition of capital or a change in leverage dynamics during the year.\n\nThe interplay between these factors—increased credit risk exposure and a stable External TLAC ratio—impacted the institution’s capital structure by necessitating adjustments in capital planning and stress testing processes, as outlined in [4] and [7]. These adjustments are crucial for maintaining regulatory compliance and ensuring resilience against potential financial shocks.\n\nIn summary, the changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 2019 to 2020 reflect an evolving capital structure with heightened credit risk exposure but a robust capital buffer, supporting the institution's regulatory compliance and financial stability."}

This downturn was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in interest income, outpacing the reduction in interest expenses. ![Net Interest Income and Expense Changes](image2)  \n\nThe organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in the image, plays a crucial role in these financial changes. The bank operates through four main business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Each segment has distinct activities and products that contribute differently to the overall net interest income and expense. For instance, the Consumer Banking segment experienced a notable decrease in net interest income due to lower interest rates and higher provisions for credit losses, as highlighted in the text [9]. ![Bank of America Organizational Structure](image1)  \n\nFurthermore, the impact of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is evident in the increase in the allowance for credit losses, which rose by $7.2 billion from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, as noted in [2]. This reflects the heightened risk exposure within the bank's lending portfolios, particularly in the commercial and consumer segments, which are part of the broader organizational structure.  \n\nThe changes in net interest income and expense also highlight the importance of the bank's internal risk-based capital models, which consider various risk components such as credit, market, and operational risks, as described in [1]. These models are essential for managing the financial performance across different segments, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.  \n\nIn summary, the significant changes in net interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020 compared to 2018 to 2019 reflect the impact of external economic factors and the internal risk management strategies of Bank of America, which are structured across its various business segments."}

This decline was primarily driven by a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell by **44.4%** to $589 million in 2021 compared to $1,059 million in 2020 [7]. The reduction in interest income was attributed to lower short-term interest rates, particularly during the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, with low rates continuing into 2021 [4].\n\n![{The table shows a decrease in overall investment income over the three-year period, with a notable decrease in the interest and other investment income segment.}](image7)\n\nThe asset composition of the insurance business also underwent notable changes. Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased significantly from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021 [3]. This reflects a strategic shift toward maintaining ample liquidity, as the company prioritizes safety over yield in short-term investments [4]. Additionally, equity securities rose from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 [3], indicating an increase in holdings of equity securities, which are subject to market volatility [7].\n\n![{The table provides a comparative view of these asset categories between the two years.}](image3)\n\nThe implications of these changes suggest that the insurance business is adapting to a low-interest-rate environment by increasing its liquidity reserves and diversifying its asset base. However, the volatility associated with equity securities could lead to fluctuations in reported earnings, as unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings [7]. While the company maintains a conservative approach to short-term investments, the reliance on equity securities may expose it to market risks if equity prices decline. Overall, the strategy appears to balance liquidity needs with long-term growth opportunities. \n\nThe net investment income and asset composition changes reflect a cautious yet adaptive approach to managing financial risk in a challenging economic environment."}

The upstream segment, which includes oil and gas exploration and production, saw a substantial improvement in earnings, particularly in 2021, driven by higher realizations, the absence of prior impairments, and increased sales volumes. For instance, U.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020 [3], while International upstream earned $8.5 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $825 million in 2020 [10].

U.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, up from a loss of $571 million in 2020 [7], primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales and increased earnings from CPChem. However, International downstream experienced a decline in earnings, dropping from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021 [8], mainly due to lower margins and higher operating expenses.\n\n![{Downstream Earnings Trends}](image3)  \nThe table illustrates that total downstream earnings rose from $47 million in 2020 to $2,914 million in 2021, although there was a significant drop in International downstream performance.\n\nDespite these mixed results in upstream and downstream operations, Chevron's overall net income improved dramatically. In 2021, the company reported a net income of $15,625 million, compared with a loss of $5,543 million in 2020 [4]. This turnaround was largely attributed to the strong performance of the upstream segment, which contributed significantly to the company's profitability.\n\nThe financial trends in both segments underscore Chevron's resilience and adaptability in navigating market fluctuations and regulatory changes, aligning with its strategic focus on maintaining flexibility and pursuing lower carbon initiatives. \n\nChevron's overall net income in 2021 was positively impacted by the improved financial performance of its upstream operations, which outperformed the previous year's losses and contributed significantly to the company's profitability."}

The data shows that average Card Member loans decreased from $13.3 billion in 2019 to $12.9 billion in 2020, and further to $15.0 billion in 2021. This suggests a recovery in loan balances, possibly due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, as mentioned in [4] and [10].  \n\nThe implications for the company’s financial performance are mixed. While the decline in net interest income reflects challenges in the interest rate environment, the increase in average Card Member loans and the overall improvement in credit performance indicate positive trends. These factors, combined with strong non-interest revenue growth, contributed to the company's ability to maintain profitability and liquidity, as highlighted in [8] and [7].  \n\nThe company also demonstrated resilience in its credit management, with provisions for credit losses decreasing and resulting in a net benefit, as stated in [4] and [10]. This underscores the effectiveness of the company's risk management strategies and its ability to navigate economic uncertainties.  \n\nOverall, the changes in average Card Member loans and net interest income reflect a combination of challenges and opportunities, contributing to a stable and improving financial position."}

This reduction is partly due to the non-recurrence of a $7.3 billion goodwill impairment in 2019 and lower customer redress programme costs, as noted in text quote [12]. The operating profit for this segment also saw a decline, from $7,865 million in 2018 to $5,758 million in 2019, reflecting the impact of reduced revenue and increased ECL."}

According to the data, net interest income decreased by $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, while net interest expense decreased by $5,627 million over the same period. This resulted in a narrower net interest spread, primarily due to the substantial decline in interest income outpacing the reduction in interest expenses.\n\n![{The table outlines changes in interest income and interest expense over two periods: 2019 to 2020, and 2018 to 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.}](image1)\n\nThe main contributing factors to the decline in net interest income included lower interest rates, which reduced the yield on earning assets, and a significant decrease in interest income from various financial instruments such as interest-bearing deposits, time deposits, federal funds, debt securities, and loans and leases. Additionally, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual provided some offset, but these were not sufficient to counteract the overall downward trend.\n\nOn the other hand, the decrease in net interest expense was driven by reduced deposit and funding costs, along with lower interest expenses on loans and federal funds purchased. However, the net effect was a narrowing of the net interest spread, reflecting the broader challenges faced by the institution during this period.\n\nThe net interest spread is a critical indicator of a bank's ability to generate profit from its core lending and investment activities. A narrowing spread can signal increased pressure on profitability, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where the margin between earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is compressed.\n\nThe changes in net interest income and net interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a narrowing of the net interest spread, primarily due to the significant decline in interest income outpacing the reduction in interest expenses."}

Actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression, are critical in calculating the DBO and determining the funded status of pension plans. These assumptions can significantly affect the financial position of the pension obligations.\n\nFor instance, **[3]** explains that Siemens Healthineers measures entitlements from defined benefit plans using the projected unit credit method, which relies on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression. The discount rates are determined based on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds, depending on availability. A change in these rates directly impacts the present value of future benefits, thus altering the DBO.\n\nThe **[7]** text indicates that the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation remained at 13 years for both 2021 and 2020, suggesting stability in the long-term obligations, but it also highlights the expected employer contributions and future benefit payments, showing the ongoing financial commitment.\n\nThe **[4]** quote provides an example of how changes in mortality rates—another key assumption—affect the DBO. A 10% reduction in mortality rates led to an increase in the DBO by €110 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €109 million in 2020. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the DBO to demographic assumptions.\n\nFurthermore, **[12]** mentions that changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly the discount rate, can significantly affect the funded status of pension plans. Siemens Healthineers has implemented a liability-driven investment approach to manage these risks, using tools like Value at Risk (VaR) to monitor and adjust their investment strategy accordingly.\n\nRegarding plan assets, **[6]** discusses capital increases and related transaction costs, while **[11]** notes that changes in the capital reserve were influenced by these financial activities. Additionally, **[6]** and **[11]** highlight the capital increases and transaction costs associated with the Conditional Capital 2021, which may indirectly influence the overall financial structure of the company, including its ability to fund pension obligations.\n\nThe **[7]** text also outlines the expected annual benefit payments over the next ten fiscal years, indicating the long-term implications of current assumptions on future obligations.\n\n![{The table shows the effects on a defined benefit obligation due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, compensation increase, and pension progression for two dates: September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020.}](image7)\n\nIn summary, changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly discount rates and mortality rates, had a significant impact on the defined benefit obligation, increasing it by €110 million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €109 million in 2020.

Specifically, the increase in credit risk RWA, driven by higher market volatility and the E*TRADE acquisition, contributed to an overall rise in total RWA. However, the growth in capital components such as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital played a crucial role in enhancing TLAC.\n\n![External TLAC as a % of RWA](image7)  \nAs shown in the table, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA increased from 49.9% at December 31, 2019, to 47.7% at December 31, 2020. This slight decrease was primarily due to the expansion of RWA, which outpaced the growth in TLAC. Despite this, the institution maintained a strong TLAC ratio well above the regulatory minimums, reflecting robust capital adequacy and resilience.\n\nThe increase in credit risk RWA, as detailed in [12], was largely attributed to Derivatives exposures, Investment securities, and Lending commitments. These factors elevated the overall RWA base, which in turn affected the TLAC ratio. Nevertheless, the institution's capital structure remained strong, with CET1 and AT1 capital growing significantly, as indicated in [4] and [6].\n\nThe changes in RWA components, particularly the increase in credit and market risk RWA, were balanced by the institution's ability to maintain and even enhance its TLAC capacity.

The comparable sales in the International Operated segment decreased by 15.0%, reflecting negative performance in most markets due to the ongoing impact of the virus [10].\n\n![{Revenue data for U.S. and International Operated Markets](image4)]  \nThe revenue data further highlights that the U.S. segment maintained a more resilient performance, with company-operated sales decreasing by 4% and franchised revenues decreasing by 2% in 2020. In contrast, the International Operated Markets segment faced more substantial declines, with company-operated sales dropping by 19% and franchised revenues declining by 14%. These reductions were partly offset by positive sales performance in the U.S. and marketing initiatives aimed at accelerating recovery, such as the free Thank You Meals provided to first responders and healthcare workers [8].\n\nThe financial structure of McDonald's also played a role in these changes. Franchised margins, which constitute a significant portion of the company's revenue, were affected by higher depreciation costs related to investments in the Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\") program and increased marketing expenses [5].

The company has expanded its presence across multiple regions, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, the United States of America, and various Middle Eastern countries. ![{Lovisa's international store expansion strategy}](image1) This growth is reflected in the increasing number of stores across different regions, with a notable rise from 250 stores in 2016 to 435 stores in 2020.\n\nA key achievement during this period was the successful operation of stores in diverse international territories, demonstrating Lovisa's ability to adapt and thrive in different markets. The company has also explored franchise opportunities in regions such as Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Vietnam, further broadening its footprint. ![{Business strategy for international expansion}](image2)\n\nHowever, the expansion was not without challenges. The fast fashion jewellery sector is highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry, which means that replicating Lovisa’s business model would require substantial resources and time. Additionally, the company faced risks related to competition, retail environment changes, and economic conditions in new markets. Despite these challenges, Lovisa remained nimble and opportunistic, adjusting its strategies based on market conditions and continuously evaluating new opportunities.\n\nLovisa's strategy involved securing quality retail store sites in high-traffic areas, which helped in maintaining a consistent brand image and customer experience. The company's ability to identify and secure leases in AA, A, or B grade shopping centres played a crucial role in its expansion success. ![{Store location and layout strategy}](image8)\n\nMoreover, the company has focused on streamlining its global supply chain to support its international growth. By optimizing its supply base in Asia and enhancing freight options, Lovisa has been able to maintain operating speed and efficiency. The consolidation of its supplier base and improvements in warehouse logistics have contributed to higher gross margins, as shown in the gross margin percentage over the years. ![{Gross Margin %}](image3)\n\nIn summary, Lovisa's international store expansion strategy from 2016 to 2020 has evolved through strategic market entry, efficient supply chain management, and a strong focus on brand proliferation and trend leadership.

For example, a $1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and a $1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would have an estimated impact of $163 million and $24 million on FY2021 profit after taxation, respectively. This demonstrates the direct relationship between commodity price changes and BHP's profitability.\n\nText quote [2] provides specific insights into coal's financial performance, noting that lower prices had a negative impact on Underlying EBITDA, with a decrease of $1.3 billion to $288 million, including a $0.7 billion impact from lower price effects, net of price-linked costs. Additionally, lower volumes further reduced EBITDA by $168 million. These impacts underscore the sensitivity of coal operations to both price and volume fluctuations.\n\nText quote [3] discusses the expected unit costs for Queensland Coal in FY2022, which are projected to range between $80 and $90 per tonne, influenced by higher diesel prices but partially offset by mine plan optimization and efficiency improvements. The uncertainty surrounding coal imports into China adds complexity to long-term cost and volume guidance, highlighting how external factors can influence coal-related financial outcomes.\n\nText quote [6] illustrates the impact of nickel prices on BHP's financials, mentioning that the average realised sales price for FY2021 was $16,250 per tonne, driven by positive investor sentiment and strong demand. However, a brief correction in March due to a major producer's shift in production strategy led to price volatility, demonstrating how market dynamics and strategic decisions affect nickel prices and, consequently, BHP's revenue.\n\nText quote [9] outlines the increased Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West, attributed to higher prices and volumes, along with reduced maintenance and contractor costs. However, unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse effects of a stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these gains, showing the multifaceted nature of nickel's financial impact.\n\n![{The table shows the financial impact of changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation from continuing operations and on underlying EBITDA, expressed in US$ million.}](image5)\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices significantly affect BHP's financial results, particularly for coal and nickel, with key drivers including global economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, exchange rates, and operational efficiencies."}

This not only improves the reliability of the battery system but also contributes to better overall vehicle performance.\n\nIn addition, the integration of battery control models with vehicle development efforts helps reduce power consumption, which in turn lowers the required battery capacity. This leads to significant cost savings, as highlighted in the text: \"Improved power efficiency leads to reduced requirements for battery capacity, which will result in a cost reduction\" [8]. Such advancements are critical for achieving Toyota's goal of reducing battery costs by 50% compared to the Toyota bZ4X in the second half of the 2020s [7].\n\nFurthermore, the development of next-generation lithium-ion batteries, including all-solid-state batteries, relies heavily on sophisticated control models that can handle the unique challenges posed by these new technologies. As noted in the image discussing future developments, the merits of all-solid-state batteries—such as high voltage tolerance and fast ion movement—can only be fully realized through advanced control systems that ensure safe and efficient operation [3].\n\nBy continuously refining battery control models alongside other innovations in materials and manufacturing processes, Toyota is positioning itself to lead in the development of next-generation BEVs that are not only more efficient but also more sustainable and cost-effective. \n\nThe evolution of battery control models contributes to the development of Toyota's next-generation BEVs by enhancing safety, extending service life, and optimizing energy efficiency, which are essential for achieving the company's long-term goals in electrification."}

According to the data, the ACL for loans and lending commitments rose from $533 million in 2019 to $1,130 million in 2020 [image2]. This increase was primarily driven by the adoption of the CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss) accounting standard, which resulted in an additional $58 million in provisions for credit losses [image2].

We monitor our investments for events or circumstances that could indicate impairment, including those that result from observable price adjustments. In fiscal 2021, we recorded impairment losses on other investments (which primarily related to our non-marketable equity investments) of $\\S33$ million, a decrease of $\\S372$ million compared to fiscal 2020. Significant evaluation and judgments were required in determining if the negative effects of COVID-19 indicated that such investments were impaired, and if so, the extent of such impairment. This included, among other items: (i) assessing the business impacts that COVID-19 had on our investees, including taking into consideration the investee’s industry and geographic location and the impact to its customers, suppliers and employees, as applicable, (ii) evaluating the investees’ ability to respond to the impacts of COVID-19, including any significant deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and cash flows, as well as assessing liquidity and/or going concern risks and (iii) considering any appreciation in fair value that has not been recognized in the carrying values of such investments. Based on this evaluation, certain of our investments were impaired and written down to their estimated fair values in fiscal 2020 (a significant portion of which related to the full impairment of our investment in OneWeb, who filed for bankruptcy in the second quarter of fiscal 2020). For a significant portion of the impairment losses recorded in 2020, the estimated fair values resulted in a full write-off of the carrying value. In fiscal 2021, there were no significant impairment losses or adjustments to our previous judgments and estimates recorded.  \n[2] In fiscal 2020, the rapid, global spread of COVID-19 and associated containment and mitigation measures negatively impacted the condition of economies and financial markets globally, which negatively impacted certain companies in which we hold non-marketable equity investments, including those accounted for under the equity method and, to a lesser extent, non-marketable debt securities. As a result, certain of our investments were impaired and written down to their estimated fair values in fiscal 2020 (a significant portion of which related to the full impairment of our investment in OneWeb, who filed for bankruptcy in the second quarter of fiscal 2020).  \n[7] Net gains on marketable securities for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the initial public offerings of certain QSI equity investments.

It illustrates that women in such environments are more likely to experience discrimination, sexual harassment, and perceive their gender as a barrier to success [3].\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination in STEM jobs is more prevalent among women compared to men, with women facing higher rates of pay inequity, perceived incompetence, and sexual harassment, especially in male-dominated environments and among those with advanced degrees."}

As Table A shows, Queens and Manhattan accounted for three-quarters of the City’s net gain in residential capacity. ![{Residential development capacity changes by borough](image7)]  \n[11] The net effect of these rezonings was to increase the City’s total residential development capacity “on paper” by about **1.7%**, which represents almost 100 million additional square feet of residential development capacity. ![{Net increase in residential development capacity](image7)]  \n[8] We estimate that in 2003, the Zoning Resolution allowed for approximately 6 billion square feet of residential development capacity citywide; Brooklyn had the highest capacity, followed by Manhattan, then Queens. Between 2003 and 2007, the City rezoned almost **18%** of the City’s total lot area. ![{Residential development capacity changes by borough](image7)]  \n[10] Even though most downzoned lots were located near transit stations, the overall impact of the rezonings we studied appears consistent with the City’s stated goal, because the upzonings near transit added much more capacity than the down zoning s near rail stations took away. Specifically, upzoned lots near transit gained about 181 million square feet of residential capacity and downzoned lots near transit lost only about 89 million square feet of capacity. ![{Impact of rezonings on residential capacity near transit](image7)]  \n[9] The 100 million square feet increase in residential capacity we calculated was the net result of upzonings and down zoning s in different types of neighborhoods and involving different types of zoning districts. In areas that were rezoned from various non-residential districts to residential-only districts, we identified an increase in capacity of about 40 million square feet. This increase was offset, however, by an approximately 40 million square feet decrease in traditionally residential areas (areas that were already zoned for residential only uses in 2003). ![{Net increase in residential capacity due to rezonings](image7)]  \n[2] Our analysis classifies as “contextual-only” any zoning change to a lot that does not increase or decrease its residential development capacity by more than **10%**. Most of the lots rezoned between 2003 and 2007 fall into this category (particularly in Staten Island and Queens). ![{Contextual-only rezonings](image2)]  \n[5] For example, the 2005 City-initiated rezoning of Cambria Heights in eastern Queens placed hundreds of mostly single-family homes into new zoning districts. While the maximum FAR remained the same, the rezoning imposed deeper front yard requirements, reduced the maximum height of the front-facing wall of homes, and capped total building height. ![{Example of a rezoning in Queens](image2)]  \n[6] We estimate changes in residential development capacity at the lot level. Accordingly, all estimates of capacity changes for the City, community districts, boroughs and other geographic areas, including area within and beyond a half mile walking distance from rail transit, are aggregations of lot-level data. ![{Residential development capacity changes at the lot level](image6)]  \n[12] Outside of the large-scale City-initiated rezonings that we analyze, there are dozens of other, smaller rezonings proposed every year, many of which successfully navigate the City’s complex land use process. Landowners propose rezonings in order to develop buildings that are larger or would be a different use than the current zoning district permits. Community groups or individual City council members also propose rezonings. While our focus is on the City-initiated rezonings, in order to provide some context, we estimated the impact of these other non-DCP actions. Between 2003 and 2007, we found that rezonings resulting from applicants other than DCP increased the City’s residential development capacity by less than one percent. ![{Impact of non-DCP rezonings](image2)]  \n[3] How have the rezonings changed the City’s capacity for new residential development? Where has new residential capacity been added? Where has existing capacity been lost? What are the characteristics of communities that gained capacity? Of those that lost capacity? How does the location of new/lost capacity relate to the City’s public transportation infrastructure? Does the location of new/lost capacity correspond to market demand and population growth? How likely is it that new capacity will be developed for residential use? ![{Key questions about rezonings](image1)]  \n[1] Sites in 2007, we see only a 25 million square feet increase in residential development capacity. Some soft sites disappeared during this period because they were the location of new development. More significantly though, a lot of the capacity being added through upzonings was not enough to make the affected lots soft. In other words, even after being upzoned, some of these lots were still already developed at close to their full capacity, so were unlikely to be redeveloped with new housing in the near future. At the same time, by removing development capacity, the City’s down zoning s made many other lots that had been soft in 2003 more or less fully developed as of 2007. ![{Changes in residential development capacity](image1)]  \n[7] We have looked at these changes at the community district level as well. As seen in Figure C, there was a significant range among community districts: those in South East Queens had the biggest gains in residential capacity and those in South West Brooklyn had the greatest declines. ![{Community district-level changes in residential capacity](image1)]  \n[10] If we exclude the Hudson Yards rezoning, the rezonings we studied actually resulted in a small net decrease in residential development capacity in areas further away from rail stations, consistent with the City’s goals. ![{Impact of rezonings on areas further from rail stations](image1)]  \n[11] Even though they made up only **14%** of all the rezoned lots in the City, the new residential capacity added to upzoned lots outweighed the capacity lost from lots that were downzoned or contextual-only rezoned.

This increase was offset, however, by an approximately 40 million square feet decrease in traditionally residential areas (areas that were already zoned for residential only uses in 2003). The 100 million square feet net gain, then, was effectively concentrated in areas that were rezoned from a commercial or manufacturing district to a mixed-use district. While permitting residential development in mixed-use areas is consistent with many planning principles and may be an attractive way for New York City to grow, not all zoning capacity in mixed use areas will be used for residential development. To the extent that City policymakers are depending on mixed-used districts to accommodate residential growth, it is important to recognize that the amount of residential space that actually will be built in those districts will depend in part upon how the different uses will compete for finite land area. ![{Net increase in residential capacity due to rezonings](image1)]  \n[11] Even though they made up only **14%** of all the rezoned lots in the City, the new residential capacity added to upzoned lots outweighed the capacity lost from lots that were downzoned or contextual-only rezoned.

While our focus is on the City-initiated rezonings, in order to provide some context, we estimated the impact of these other non-DCP actions. Between 2003 and 2007, we found that rezonings resulting from applicants other than DCP increased the City’s residential development capacity by less than one percent. ![{Impact of non-DCP rezonings](image1)]  \n[10] Even though most downzoned lots were located near transit stations, the overall impact of the rezonings we studied appears consistent with the City’s stated goal, because the upzonings near transit added much more capacity than the down zoning s near rail stations took away. Specifically, upzoned lots near transit gained about 181 million square feet of residential capacity and downzoned lots near transit lost only about 89 million square feet of capacity. As a result, rezoned lots near transit accounted for a vast majority of the citywide net increase in capacity. ![{Impact of rezonings on areas near transit](image1)]  \n[9] The 100 million square feet increase in residential capacity we calculated was the net result of upzonings and down zoning s in different types of neighborhoods and involving different types of zoning districts. In areas that were rezoned from various non-residential districts to residential-only districts, we identified an increase in capacity of about 40 million square feet. This increase was offset, however, by an approximately 40 million square feet decrease in traditionally residential areas (areas that were already zoned for residential only uses in 2003). The 100 million square feet net gain, then, was effectively concentrated in areas that were rezoned from a commercial or manufacturing district to a mixed-use district. While permitting residential development in mixed-use areas is consistent with many planning principles and may be an attractive way for New York City to grow, not all zoning capacity in mixed use areas will be used for residential development. To the extent that City policymakers are depending on mixed-used districts to accommodate residential growth, it is important to recognize that the amount of residential space that actually will be built in those districts will depend in part upon how the different uses will compete for finite land area. ![{Net increase in residential capacity due to rezonings](image1)]  \n[11] Even though they made up only **14%** of all the rezoned lots in the City, the new residential capacity added to upzoned lots outweighed the capacity lost from lots that were downzoned or contextual-only rezoned. As a result, the net effect of these rezonings was to increase the City’s total residential development capacity “on paper” by about **1.7%**. This represents almost 100 million additional square feet of residential development capacity—or enough space, at least “on paper,” for about 80,000 new units or 200,000 new residents. ![{Net increase in residential development capacity](image1)]  \n[10] If we exclude the Hudson Yards rezoning, the rezonings we studied actually resulted in a small net decrease in residential development capacity in areas further away from rail stations, consistent with the City’s goals. ![{Impact of rezonings on areas further from rail stations](image1)]  \n[12] Outside of the large-scale City-initiated rezonings that we analyze, there are dozens of other, smaller rezonings proposed every year, many of which successfully navigate the City’s complex land use process.

The share of partisan identifiers and leaners with unfavorable impressions of the opposition party has reached near all-time highs [1]. Moreover, the intensity of dislike for the opposing party has surged among partisans and has followed a similar trajectory among independents who lean toward either the Republican or Democratic parties [4].\n\n[3] Independents who do not lean toward a party are more likely to have unfavorable views of both parties, with $37\\%$ holding such views in recent years [10]. However, there has been a decline in the share of independents who view both parties negatively compared to 2015, when over a third ($36\\%$) held this view [8].\n\n[4] The ideological composition of American political parties has also shifted over time, with Republicans and Lean Republicans showing an increase in their conservative shares, while Democrats and Lean Democrats have seen a rise in their liberal shares [image1]. These shifts in ideology may contribute to the growing polarization and the increasing unfavorable views of the opposing party.\n\n[5] Additionally, public opinion on social issues such as the legalization of gay marriage and marijuana reflects these ideological divides, with significant differences in support between Republicans, Democrats, and independents [image2]. This further underscores the deepening divide in political attitudes and the corresponding unfavorable views of the opposing party.\n\n[6] Overall, the unfavorable views of both parties have evolved in tandem with the increasing polarization of American politics. While there has been some fluctuation in the percentage of independents who hold unfavorable views of both parties, the general trend indicates a growing divergence in political attitudes and perceptions of the opposing party."}

For instance, public confidence in Trump to handle an international crisis has risen from 35% in January to 43% in May 2018, indicating a slight improvement [8]. However, on several other issues, such as immigration policy, handling an international crisis, and working effectively with Congress, narrow majorities of the public say they have little or no confidence in Trump [9].\n\n![{Public confidence in Trump on key issues is mixed, with some areas showing higher confidence while others remain low}](image5)  \nThe image illustrates how public confidence in Trump has fluctuated over time for different tasks.

Initially, in 2004, the majority of Americans felt that the government's anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough to protect the country, with 49% expressing this concern compared to 29% who believed the policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties [8]. This trend continued into early 2010, when a historical high of 58% expressed concern that policies did not go far enough, following the failed Christmas-Day terrorist attack on an airliner en route to Detroit [1].\n\nBy 2015, the balance of opinion had shifted dramatically. According to the data, 56% of Americans now expressed greater concern that anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough to protect the country, while only 28% worried that these policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties [7]. This indicates a growing perception that the government’s measures were insufficient in addressing the threat of terrorism.\n\n![{Concerns about anti-terrorism policies not going far enough}(image8)]  \n\nAdditionally, the Pew Research Center survey highlighted that the share of Americans who rated the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism as \"not too well\" or \"not at all well\" increased significantly over time. In December 2015, 58% of respondents rated the government's efforts negatively, compared to just 35% who rated them positively [2]. This decline in positive ratings reflects a broader erosion of public confidence in the effectiveness of anti-terrorism strategies.\n\n![{Public ratings of government efforts against terrorism}(image2)]  \n\nThe shift in public sentiment was also evident across political affiliations. By 2015, a majority of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents shared similar concerns, with 71% of Republicans, 54% of Democrats, and 49% of Independents expressing greater concern that policies had not gone far enough to protect the country [1]. This suggests a bipartisan concern about the adequacy of anti-terrorism measures.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of ISIS as a major threat contributed to heightened public concern. In December 2015, 83% of respondents considered ISIS a major threat, which was a significant increase from August 2014, when only 67% held this view [3]. This underscores how external events influenced public perception of the necessity and effectiveness of anti-terrorism policies.\n\nIn summary, public opinion regarding anti-terror policies changed from 2004 to 2015, with increasing concern that policies had not gone far enough to protect the country and a decline in trust in the government’s ability to effectively combat terrorism."}

This rapid increase can be attributed to several historical factors, including the Homestead Act of 1862, which encouraged westward migration by offering land to settlers [5]. The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad also played a crucial role, transforming Nebraska into a hub for agricultural development [5].\n\n![{population growth}](image2)  \n\nAs the population expanded, so did the number of rural school districts, with over 98 districts established by 1885 [11]. However, this growth was not sustained. By the early 20th century, the population began to decline, and by 2000, it had stabilized at around 9,403 [2]. This trend reflects broader shifts in rural life, such as the mechanization of agriculture, which led to the consolidation of farms and a reduction in the number of small-scale farms [6]. \n\nThe establishment of communities like Aurora, which saw a steady population increase since 1940, contrasts with other towns that struggled due to economic changes and transportation patterns [8]. The reliance on railroads for town development is highlighted by the example of Hamilton, which declined after the county seat was moved to Aurora [10].\n\n![{map of hamilton county}](image3)  \n\nAdditionally, the cultural diversity of the region contributed to the formation of distinct ethnic enclaves, such as the Danish settlement in Kronborg and the Swedish community in Hordville [7].

The data also shows that political affiliation influences views, with Democrats more supportive of policies like a universal basic income, while there is little partisan difference in favoring limits on machines to dangerous jobs [9].\n\nAdditionally, those who have already been impacted by automation express even greater support for a universal basic income, with **45%** strongly favoring it, compared to **30%** among those not impacted [4]. However, despite these differences, the overwhelming consensus remains that limiting machines to dangerous jobs is the most favored policy.\n\nAmericans also show strong support for related measures, such as requiring human oversight in driverless vehicles, with **87%** favoring a requirement that all driverless vehicles have a human in the driver’s seat who can take control in an emergency [8]. This reflects a broader desire for increased human control over technology.\n\nIn comparison, support for other policies, such as paying extra to interact with humans instead of machines, is somewhat lower, with **62%** in favor [10]. Overall, the public’s preference for limiting machines to dangerous jobs stands out as the most widely supported measure in the context of automation.  \n\nThe most prominent differences in Americans’ views of these concepts relate to political affiliation. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are much more supportive than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents of both a universal basic income and a national service program [9]. On the other hand, there are no major partisan differences in support for limiting machines to dangerous and dirty jobs, or for giving people the option to pay extra to interact with a human rather than a robot in commercial transactions [9].\n\nIn conclusion, Americans overwhelmingly favor limiting machines to dangerous jobs compared to other automation policies."}

Despite these challenges, real performance metrics show that European VC is driving some of the best exit multiples globally [6], with Europe matching the US for successful exit values at around $350M [12]. \n\nThe structure and performance of European venture capital illustrate its potential as a matured industry, even within an inefficient market [9]."}

Conversely, in fields like Science, Health & Medicine, and Technology & Engineering, where tasks often involve intricate perception and complex reasoning, models exhibit lower performance.  \n\n[5] In this section, we present a comprehensive comparison of different LLMs and LMMs using the MMMU benchmark, detailed in Table 2. We summarize our key findings as follows: Challenging Nature of MMMU: The benchmark poses significant challenges to current models. Notably, GPT-4V, despite being an advanced model, achieves an accuracy of only $55.7\\%$, with ample headroom for improvement. This reflects the benchmark’s rigorous and demanding standards. Disparity between Open-source Models and GPT-4V: Leading open-source models such as BLIP2-FLAN-T5-XXL and LLaVA-1.5 reach an accuracy level of approximately $34\\%$, which is significantly lower than GPT-4V. This [9] open-source models, such as BLIP2-FLAN-T5-XXL and LLaVA-1.5, achieve approximately $34\\%$ in accuracy.\n\n[1] Different Image Types. We compare the performance of various models across top frequent image types in Figure 5. Across all types, GPT-4V consistently outperforms the other models by a huge margin. Open-source models demonstrate relatively strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings, which are more frequently seen during training. However, for less common image categories like Geometric shapes, Music sheets and Chemical structures, all models obtain very low scores (some are close to random guesses). This indicates that the existing models are generalizing poorly towards these image types.  \n\n[8] Text-only LLMs. For text-only LLMs, we consider the most capable ones including GPT-4 and several open-source LLMs, Llama2-7B [52], FLAN-T5-XXL and Vicuna-13B, which are adopted as the text encoder or decoder in the selected LMMs. To determine if an external image-to-text tool can enhance these LLMs’ performance on MMMU, we deploy OCR by MMOCR 1 or captioning by LLaVA-1.5 to provide the recognized text information to text-only LLMs. Evaluation. We adopt micro-averaged accuracy as the evaluation metric. For both open and multiple-choice questions, we design systematic, rule-based evaluation pipelines. Specifically, to mitigate the potential influence of any intermediate generations (e.g., reasoning steps, calculations) in the long response, we construct robust regular expressions and develop response-processing workflows. These are employed to extract key phrases, such as numbers and conclusion phrases, from the long responses for accurate answer matching. If there is no valid answer in the model’s response, we perform random selection as a remedy for multiple-choice questions or consider the response incorrect for open questions. For reference, we add Random Choice and Frequent Choice baselines: the former randomly selects an option, while the latter selects the most frequent option within each specific subject of the validation set, based on its frequency of occurrence in that subject.  \n\n[9] open-source models, such as BLIP2-FLAN-T5-XXL and LLaVA-1.5, achieve approximately $34\\%$ in accuracy.  \n\nThe performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in the 'Human & Social Science' category is generally higher compared to their overall performance, as this category involves relatively less complex visual data and requires less intricate reasoning."}

While this paper does not explicitly state the retrieval granularity, it implies a more refined and dynamic process than traditional methods.\n\nLooking further, [34] introduces a method titled \"Learning to Filter Context for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\" This paper focuses on improving the filtering of retrieved context in RAG systems. Although it doesn’t specify the granularity level, it aligns with efforts to refine retrieval processes, which may include phrase-level granularity as part of the filtering mechanism.\n\nThe image quote **image4** provides a table listing various retrieval methods, including their **retrieval granularity**.

In contrast, for the extremely low-resource languages, the gains are either quite small (A Z  and B E ) or very large, as in G L  which achieves a gain of up to 11 BLEU points. This ﬁnding is interesting in that it indi- cates that word embeddings may be particularly useful to bootstrap models that are on the thresh- old of being able to produce reasonable transla- tions, as is the case for G L  in our experiments. ![{pre-training boosts BLEU scores more for low-resource languages}](image4)  \n\n[10] We report the results in Table  5 . When applying pre-trained embeddings, the gains in each transla- tion pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with G L /P T  showing the largest gains, and B E /R U showing a small decrease. In addition, it is also interesting to note that as opposed to previous sec- tion, aligning the word embeddings helps to in- crease the BLEU scores for all three tasks. These increases are intuitive, as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a signiﬁcantly more compli- cated transform of the input if the word embed- dings for the languages were in a semantically sep- arate space. Pre-training and alignment ensures that the word embeddings of the two source lan- guages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language.  \n\n[7] Finally, we performed a comparison of the f- measure of target words, bucketed by frequency in the training corpus. As displayed in Figure  2 , this shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabu- lary, but particularly for words that are of low fre- quency in the training corpus.  \n\n[11] that for all three languages the gain in BLEU score demonstrates a similar trend to that found in G L  in the previous section: the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes ef- fect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective.  \n\n[7] Finally, we performed a comparison of the f- measure of target words, bucketed by frequency in the training corpus. As displayed in Figure  2 , this shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabu- lary, but particularly for words that are of low fre- quency in the training corpus.  \n\n[12] The results in Table  2  clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. Comparing the sec- ond and third columns, we can see the increase is much more signiﬁcant with pre-trained source lan- guage embeddings. This indicates that the major- ity of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sen- tence.  \n\n[9] From Table  3 , we can see that the BLEU scores of E S , F R , and I T  do generally follow this hy- pothesis. As we move to very different languages, R U  and H E  see larger accuracy gains than their more similar counterparts F R  and I T . This can be largely attributed to the observation from the pre- vious section that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; R U  and H E have very low baseline BLEU scores, so it makes sense that their increases would be larger.  \n\n[1] Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the translations from   ${\\mathrm{GL}}\\to{\\mathrm{EN}}$  , which showed one of the largest increases in quantitative numbers. As can be seen from Table  6 , pre-training not only helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammat- ically well-formed. As highlighted in the table cells, the best system successfully translates a per- son’s name (“ chris ”) and two multi-word phrases (“ big lawyer ” and “ patent legislation ”), indicat- ing the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing a better representations of less frequent concepts when used with low-resource languages.  \n\n[3] The previous experiment had interesting implica- tions regarding available data size and effect of pre-training. Our next series of experiments ex- amines this effect in a more controlled environ- ment by down-sampling the training data for the higher-resource languages to 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of their original sizes.  \n\n[7] Finally, we performed a comparison of the f- measure of target words, bucketed by frequency in the training corpus. As displayed in Figure  2 , this shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabu- lary, but particularly for words that are of low fre- quency in the training corpus.  \n\n[11] that for all three languages the gain in BLEU score demonstrates a similar trend to that found in G L  in the previous section: the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4.

For higher-resource languages, the gains are more consistent but smaller, around 3 BLEU points. The effectiveness of pre-training also depends on the similarity between source and target languages, with more significant improvements seen in less similar language pairs."}

As illustrated in the left graph of ![{the impact of demonstration samples on performance with and without logical constraints}](image1), increasing the number of demonstration samples from 1 to 5 leads to a notable improvement in Micro-F1 scores. However, further increases beyond 5 demonstrations yield diminishing returns, indicating that there is a point of diminishing marginal gains.\n\nWhen logical constraints are incorporated into the model's instruction, the improvements become more consistent and substantial, especially as the number of demonstrations increases. This suggests that logical constraints not only enhance performance but also stabilize it across varying numbers of demonstrations. For example, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints yields better results than using 10 demonstrations without them, highlighting the added value of combining both \"What\" (demonstrations) and \"How\" (logical constraints) in guiding the model.\n\nThe integration of logical constraints thus plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of large language models on reasoning tasks by reducing inconsistency and enhancing accuracy.

This approach enables more accurate and contextually aware classification predictions. ![{The RAR pipeline consists of two main components: a multimodal retriever and a retrieval-ranking process that uses MLLMs to refine results}](image1)\n\n[3] Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT4V represent a significant evolution in the landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual images as input tokens alongside textual information. However, our research uncovers a nuanced limitation: MLLMs tend to underperform in tasks requiring vast vocabularies, where distinguishing subtle differences among different categories is crucial. \n\n[9] The multimodal retriever is essentially responsible for querying a large multi-modal external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. In the process of multimodal retriever, the main challenge lies in efficiently encoding and storing a large volume of images/text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval. Recognizing the main challenge, as shown in Fig. 2, we have developed a multi-modal retriever that creates and stores multimodal embeddings, with a focus on optimizing retrieval speed through index construction techniques.\n\n[7] To enhance the speed of retrieval, we implement an index system that uses the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm. The adoption of the HNSW methodology facilitates a significant dimensionality reduction, thereby enabling the construction of a more condensed index. Specifically, vectors in a $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space of dimension $d$ are transformed into a reduced $\\frac{d}{9}$ dimensional space. This reduction in dimensionality plays a pivotal role in enhancing the speed of the retrieval process.\n\n[6] After successfully constructing memory $\\mathcal{M}$ by using our multimodal retriever, our next step is to integrate the memory with the retrieval process and use MLLMs to rank the retrieval results and enhance the performance in few-shot/zero-shot perception tasks.\n\n[5] In our RAR pipeline, the prompt primarily serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory. It guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity. Our prompt format is as follows:\n\n[2] Following the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside image embedding $e$ are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through our ranking prompt. The MLLMs, combining the internal knowledge and the retrieved information, make the final prediction of the image category. Our proposed inference process, using both the retrieval results from our memory bank and subsequent ranking by the MLLM, ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction.\n\n[11] To bolster the MLLMs’ ranking performance, we explore fine-tuning with ranking format data or in-context learning examples without training. By integrating our retrieval-augmented design, our approach seeks to bridge the gap between the broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization, offering a path forward that preserves the model’s extensive knowledge base while significantly boosting its performance on downstream tasks.\n\nThe main components of the RAR pipeline for multimodal retrieval are the **multimodal retriever** and the **retrieval-ranking process**. The multimodal retriever is responsible for efficiently encoding and storing large volumes of image and text embeddings for quick, accurate retrieval. The retrieval-ranking process integrates these retrieved results with MLLMs to refine and rank them, ultimately leading to more accurate and contextually aware classification predictions."}

As shown in Table 1, starting with 5.4M parallel English/German sentences, the number of N-way parallel sentences quickly decreases as more languages are added. We also found that 7-way parallel sentences lack linguistic diversity, and often appear in the first sentence or paragraph of articles. As a compromise between language-parallelism and both the number and diversity of parallel sentences, we use sentences that are 4-way parallel. This yields 385,396 parallel sentences (see Appendix A.6) which were sub-sampled to ensure parallel sentences were evenly distributed in paragraphs. We ensure that each language combination is equally represented, so that each language has many QA instances in common with every other language. Except for any rejected instances later in the pipeline, each QA instance will be parallel between English and three target languages.\n\n[8] Table 10 shows the number of mined parallel sentences found in each language, as function of how many languages the sentences are parallel between. As the number of languages that a parallel sentence is shared between increases, the number of such sentences decreases. When we look for 7-way aligned examples, we only find 1340 sentences from the entirety of the 7 Wikipedia. Additionally, most of these sentences are the first sentence of the article, or are uninteresting. However, if we choose 4-way parallel sentences, there are plenty of sentences to choose from. We sample evenly from each combination of English and 3 of the 6 target languages. This ensures that we have an even distribution over all the target languages, as well as ensuring we have even numbers of instances that will be parallel between target language combinations.\n\nAccording to Table 1, there are 5.4 million parallel sentences in English/German, while the number of parallel sentences in English/Spanish is 1.1 million.

This categorization ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of modalities and tasks, enabling it to perform well in both text-only and mixed-modal scenarios.\n\nThe statistics of these datasets are presented in Table 5, which provides the number of samples, tokens, and images for each category [5].

If there is a severe imbalance between pairings of modalities, the model might learn an unconditional prior of generating a specific modality, which can either mute or exaggerate the generation of a single modality [11]. This careful balancing helps maintain the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs across different modalities.\n\nThe training strategy also incorporates a cosine learning rate schedule starting at an initial rate of 1e-5, combined with a weight decay of 0.1, and a batch size of 128, accommodating sequences up to 4096 tokens [10].

When directly applying MLLMs to ranking the retrieved results, MLLMs may predict some errors such as beyond the given list or occasional misalignment. To fully exploit the ranking potential of MLLMs for downstream tasks, while avoiding the consumption of extensive computational resources for training MLLMs, we selected a small-scale classification dataset to fine-tune the MLLMs. The primary goal of fine-tuning was to enable MLLMs to improve their ranking ability such as following the format of prompts and returning results as required.  \n\n[5] In-Context Learning for Ranking. In-context learning presents a valuable alternative to fine-tuning with ranking examples, particularly due to its flexibility and lower requirement for specialized data preparation. While fine-tuning with ranking examples has proven to be highly effective, it necessitates a substantial amount of curated data and computational resources for training. In contrast, in-context learning uses the model’s existing knowledge by providing it with specific examples directly within the input prompt, guiding the model to understand and execute the task of ranking without the need for explicit re-training. Here we elaborate on the application of in-context learning with MLLMs to rank the retrieved results.  \n\n![{Fine-tuning improves ranking accuracy}](image2)  \n\n[10] Tab. 6 presents the results. We observe that RAR is not sensitive to changes in the fine-tuning dataset for ranking, thereby confirming its viability as a generalizable and reliable method for enhancing the performance of MLLMs. The consistency in results, irrespective of the fine-tuning data source, underlines the robustness of our fine-tuning strategy.

This figure shows that relation propagation achieves substantial improvements in sentences with more entities, where one might expect that using broader context could enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships among multiple entities.\n\n![{relation extraction performance with entities}](image7)\n\n[2] Relation propagation is a key component of the DyGIE framework, which enhances the model's ability to extract relations by leveraging information from broader contexts. Unlike many traditional information extraction frameworks, DyGIE does not require preprocessing with syntactic tools and has shown significant improvements across various IE tasks, including entity and relation extraction.\n\n[3] The addition of co-reference and relation propagation across sentences adds only a small computation cost to inference; the memory cost is controlled by beam search. These added costs are relatively minor compared to those of the baseline span-based model. The use of relation propagation allows the model to better handle scenarios where multiple entities are involved in different relations, thus improving the overall accuracy of relation extraction.\n\n[4] Relation propagation involves defining a beam $ B_R $ consisting of $ b_r $ entity spans that are most likely to be involved in a relation. For each iteration, a tensor $ \\mathbf{V}_R^t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b_R \\times b_R \\times L_R} $ captures scores for each of the $ L_R $ relation types. The relation update vector $ \\mathbf{u}_R^t(i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d $ is computed by aggregating neighboring span representations on the relation graph. This process helps refine the representation of entities and their relations through iterative updates.\n\n[5] Figure 3b shows the effect of the number of iterations for relation propagation in the relation extraction task. Our model achieves the best performance on the second iteration ($ M=2 $). This suggests that a moderate number of iterations is sufficient to capture the necessary relational information without introducing excessive noise or computational overhead.\n\n[6] The implications of utilizing relation propagation are evident in the improved performance of DyGIE on datasets with a high number of entities. As shown in Table 4, DyGIE achieves the highest Entity F1 score across all datasets, indicating that the model benefits significantly from the inclusion of relation propagation. This is particularly important in domains such as ACE05 and SciERC, where sentences often contain multiple entities and relations.\n\n![{relation propagation performance}](image8)"}

To be specific, we select users that 1) wrote product reviews for at least 10 different items they purchased, and where 2) each product review contains between 30 to 80 words. Table 3 shows the statistics after the filtration. For example, using these criteria, 1,791 active users are selected for the Amazon-music dataset.

This shows that utilizing all five personality traits is better than using the most salient personality trait in NCF.\n\n[10] In this work, we explore a new way of automatically extracting personality information from review texts and applying it to recommendation systems. We first construct two new datasets based on the Amazon dataset in the beauty and music domains and include OCEAN personality scores automatically inferred by the Recep ti viti API, a commercial service. We then analyze the accuracy of using texts to obtain personality profiles and output personality score distributions. To explore the effectiveness of using personality in current recommendation systems, we conduct a few experiments with the standard neural collaborative filtering (NCF) recommendation algorithm and our variants, finding that incorporating personality information improves recommendation performance by 3% to 28%. In terms of the relationship between personality and domain, we find that openness, extroversion, and agreeableness are helpful in music recommendation, while conscientiousness is most helpful in the beauty recommendation.\n\n[12] We further analyze the personality distribution for all users by plotting the score histograms for each personality trait in the Amazon-beauty dataset and the Amazon-music dataset in Fig. 2.\n\n[3] To improve the personality prediction process, we only analyze the personality traits for active users who bought many products and wrote a sufficient number of product reviews. To be specific, we select users that 1) wrote product reviews for at least 10 different items they purchased, and where 2) each product review contains between 30 to 80 words. Table 3 shows the statistics after the filtration. For example, using these criteria, 1,791 active users are selected for the Amazon-music dataset. Each user in the Amazon-music dataset has an average of 990.48 review words over all of his/her reviews, averaging 51.01 words for each review.\n\n[6] Aside from our constructed Amazon-beauty and Amazon-music dataset, we also include an existing dataset Personality 2018 in our study. Personality $2018^{7}$ [14] is a version of the MovieLens dataset that includes each user’s personality information obtained through questionnaires. It contains 21,776 movies, 339,000 ratings, and 678 users with the OCEAN personality questionnaire scores from 1 to 7. This dataset is included to study the difference between questionnaire-based personality trait scores with our review-based automatic personality trait detection scores.\n\n[11] We also examine the difference in personality distributions between the two domains. In the Amazon-music dataset, the average scores of extroversion and openness are higher than those in the Amazon-beauty dataset. This indicates that the personality characteristics of extroverts and open people are more obvious in the music domain than in the beauty domain.\n\n[8] Experiment Results. Table 5 shows the experimental results in the Amazon-beauty and the Amazon-music, and Personality 2018 datasets, respectively. In Amazon-beauty and Amazon-music, we find that the three personality-enhanced NCF models outperform the two baseline models, in terms of both NDCG and HR. Especially, the first three rows show that the NCF with the most salient personality label outperforms NCF with the same or random personality label.

When gold paragraphs are provided alongside distractors, the model's performance improves substantially. For example, in the open-domain setting, single-paragraph BERT achieves 39.12 F1 with 500 retrieved paragraphs but increases to 53.12 F1 when additional gold paragraphs are included [5]. This indicates that the failure to retrieve gold paragraphs is a critical factor in reducing model accuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of distractors can also impact performance. In the distractor setting, the model achieves a high F1 score of 67.08, which is comparable to state-of-the-art models [7]. However, when the same procedure is applied to adversarial distractors, the accuracy declines from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1, but re-training on these distractors allows the model to recover most of its original accuracy, reaching 60.10 F1 [2]. This suggests that while adversarial distractors challenge the model, they do not completely prevent it from recovering performance through re-training.\n\nThe implications for model performance are clear: the effectiveness of retrieval methods plays a crucial role in determining how well a model can handle multi-hop questions. Standard TF-IDF retrieval often fails to retrieve relevant gold paragraphs, especially in open-domain settings, where the model struggles due to the lack of appropriate evidence [5]. Therefore, developing better retrieval methods for multi-hop questions remains an important area for future research.\n\n![{The F1 scores for different settings show how the inclusion of gold paragraphs significantly improves performance compared to using only distractors.}](image4)"}

This sequence is passed through an RNN, predicting labels for each character (Figure 2). Character labels transformed into word labels via post processing.

In the context of LSTM models, which are designed to capture sequential dependencies, word-order plays a significant role in accurately predicting sentiment. For instance, the phrase \"not really good\" conveys a different sentiment than \"really not good,\" and such subtle differences in word order can significantly impact the model's ability to discern sentiment orientation [7]. This is where LSTM models excel, as they can capture these sequential patterns through their recurrent transition functions, unlike SWEM models that ignore word-order information [9].\n\n![{word-order affects sentiment analysis in LSTM models}](image4)  \nThis image highlights the performance difference between original and shuffled datasets for tasks like Yelp Polarity, indicating that word-order information significantly impacts sentiment analysis accuracy. When the training data is shuffled, removing word-order features, the accuracy on the Yelp dataset drops noticeably, further supporting the importance of word-order in sentiment prediction [11].\n\nIn contrast, for tasks such as topic categorization or textual entailment, word-order information may not contribute as significantly, as word embeddings alone provide sufficient semantic information [11]. However, in sentiment analysis, where the meaning of a sentence can be drastically altered by the arrangement of words, word-order remains a crucial factor.\n\nInterestingly, the performance of LSTM models on shuffled datasets suggests that the primary advantage of LSTMs over SWEM lies in their ability to capture word-order features, which are essential for sentiment analysis [12]. This aligns with the broader observation that while SWEM models are efficient and effective for many tasks, they fall short in scenarios where word-order plays a pivotal role, such as sentiment analysis [10].\n\nIn summary, word-order information significantly enhances sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models by enabling them to capture the nuanced relationships between words, which is vital for understanding sentiment orientation."}

These mechanisms include:\n\n- **Base Excision Repair (BER)**: This pathway is used to correct single-strand point mutations affecting one or few bases of a DNA strand. It involves the recognition and removal of damaged bases by glycosylase enzymes, followed by the addition of new bases by polymerase enzymes and the restoration of the DNA backbone by ligase enzymes [5].\n\n- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: A critical system that excises a wide range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. NER is highly conserved across species and plays a vital role in repairing damage that disrupts the DNA structure [6].\n\n- **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system identifies and corrects base-pair mismatches that occur during DNA replication. It involves the recognition of the mismatched strand, removal of the incorrect sequence, and the synthesis of the correct sequence by DNA polymerase, followed by ligation to restore the DNA double-stranded structure [12].\n\n- **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism addresses double-strand breaks, which are among the most severe forms of DNA damage. Recombination repair includes two main pathways: homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR uses an undamaged homologous DNA template for accurate repair, while NHEJ directly ligates the broken ends, potentially leading to genetic information loss [7].\n\nThese repair mechanisms collectively ensure the fidelity of genetic information and prevent the accumulation of harmful mutations. They operate through complementary and collaborative processes, each playing a specific role in maintaining the integrity of the genome.\n\n![{DNA repair mechanisms demonstrated in Figure 11}](image5)"}

We use a similar task, but our scalable data collection process allows for a significantly larger corpus. We also provide an interactive navigation environment, instead of only map diagrams. Unlike Map Task, our leaders and followers do not interact in real time. This abstracts away interaction challenges, similar to how the SAIL navigation corpus was collected ( MacMahon et al., 2006 ). C HAI instructions were collected using scenarios given to workers, similar to the ATIS collection process ( Hemphill et al., 1990 ; Dahl et al., 1994 ). Recently, multiple 3D research environments were released. L ANI has a significantly larger state space than existing navigation environments ( Hermann et al., 2017 ; Chaplot et al., 2018 ), and C HALET, the environment used for C HAI, is larger and has more complex manipulation compared to similar environments ( Gordon et al., 2018 ; Das et al., 2018 ).

As described in the text, the system comprises five key modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a question-answering module, a QA validator, and a reasoner. These components work together to guide the model through a structured reasoning process, ensuring that each step contributes to the final determination of the claim's veracity.\n\n![{A system diagram illustrating the architecture of QACHECK with its five modules}](image6)\n\n[2] One of the core components of QACHECK is the **claim verifier**, which determines whether the current context is sufficient to verify the claim. This module leverages the strong few-shot generalization ability of large language models like InstructGPT through in-context learning. By providing ten distinct in-context examples, the claim verifier can efficiently assess if additional information is needed before proceeding to the next step in the verification process. This ensures that the system avoids redundant reasoning and operates efficiently.\n\n[3] The **question generator** plays a crucial role in the QACHECK system by determining the next relevant question necessary to verify the claim. This component is essential for guiding the reasoning process and ensuring that each generated question leads closer to the final conclusion. The system dynamically adjusts its questioning strategy based on the available context, making the verification process both systematic and adaptable.\n\n![{A visual representation of the QACHECK system's workflow, highlighting the interaction between the claim verifier and question generator}](image1)\n\n[4] To evaluate the effectiveness of QACHECK, the system was tested on two fact-checking datasets: HOVER and FEVEROUS. These datasets contain complex claims that require multi-step reasoning, making them ideal for assessing the performance of the QACHECK system. The results demonstrated that QACHECK outperformed other models such as InstructGPT, Codex, and FLAN-T5, achieving higher macro-F1 scores on both datasets. Specifically, QACHECK achieved a macro-F1 score of 55.67, 54.67, and 52.35 on HOVER two-hop, three-hop, and four-hop claims, respectively, and a F1 score of 59.47 on FEVEROUS.\n\n![{A comparison of model performance on the HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets, showing QACHECK's superior results}](image7)\n\n[5] The QACHECK system also allows users to customize the underlying question-answering model, offering flexibility in how the system processes and verifies claims.

These developments reflect the evolution of methodologies and datasets used to study how word meanings change over time.\n\n- In **2010**, the introduction of the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" marked a significant step in conceptualizing distributional models for tracking semantic changes across time. This approach laid the groundwork for understanding how words evolve in meaning through different temporal contexts.\n  \n- By **2011**, researchers began leveraging the \"Google Ngrams corpus,\" which provided a rich source of data for analyzing semantic shifts. This period also saw early explorations into using distributional methods to detect changes in word usage and meaning.\n\n- The year **2012** brought attention to the challenge of \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" where systems were developed to identify the time spans during which specific contexts of a word underwent semantic shifts. This highlighted the complexity of accurately mapping word usage over time.\n\n- In **2013**, advancements in \"Prediction-based models\" emerged, offering more sophisticated ways to capture semantic changes. These models represented a shift from traditional frequentist approaches to more dynamic representations of language.\n\n- **2014** was pivotal with the adoption of \"Word embeddings,\" particularly the \"word2vec\" model, which enabled the representation of words in continuous vector spaces. This development allowed for more nuanced analyses of semantic drift and provided a foundation for subsequent research.\n\n- By **2015**, the concept of \"Models alignment\" gained traction, aiming to find equivalents for words across different time periods, such as identifying that \"Obama\" in 2015 corresponds to \"Trump\" in 2017. This demonstrated the potential of computational methods to track semantic evolution.\n\n- In **2016**, the use of the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" expanded the scope of diachronic studies, enabling researchers to trace subtle semantic shifts over extended periods. This period also saw the analysis of \"Laws of semantic change,\" providing insights into the statistical patterns underlying linguistic evolution.\n\n- Finally, **2017** witnessed further refinements in understanding semantic change, including the exploration of \"Local measures better for cultural shifts\" and the application of the \"Gigaword corpus\" for analyzing cultural semantic drift related to events like armed conflicts. Additionally, \"Joint learning across time spans\" became a focus, emphasizing the importance of integrating temporal information into models.\n\nThese milestones collectively illustrate the progression of methodologies and datasets that have shaped the field of diachronic semantic shifts research. The key milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to 2017 are the introduction of the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing,\" the use of the \"Google Ngrams corpus,\" work on \"Word epoch disambiguation,\" advancements in \"Prediction-based models,\" the adoption of \"Word embeddings,\" development of \"Models alignment,\" analysis using the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus,\" and insights into \"Laws of semantic change.\""}

Given the information from [9], which implies that ChatGPT has a high alignment score, and considering that the experiments in [3] used a temperature of 0.5, it is reasonable to infer that the temperature of 0.5 gives ChatGPT the highest alignment score."}

In addition, we compare with ToD-BERT ( Wu et al. ,  2020 ), which is a large pre-trained model based on several task-oriented dialogue datasets, and it also separately encodes dialog context and domain-slot pairs. We show the results in Table  3 .   3 We observe that our model is consistently much bet- ter than BERT-DST and BERT-DST-Picklist. More- over, our models based on BERT surpass the strong ToD-BERT. We conclude that our improvements come from the strong interactions between slots and dialog context. Therefore, it is important to \n\n![{DS-DST and DS-Picklist performance for specific slots}](image4) \n\n[9] Now that we have observed that DS-DST and DS- Picklist perform much better than DS-Span, we focus on where the accuracy improvement comes from. Table  4  shows the accuracy for each slot type on the MultiWOZ 2.1 test set, and we can observe signiﬁcant improvement over the DS-Span base- line for some slots, including  hotel-type ,  attraction- type ,  attraction-name ,  hotel-internet  and  hotel- parking . This is because their values usually have different expressions and cannot be extracted from the dialog context, which decreases the perfor- mance of the span-based methods. In contrast, their values can be predicted directly from the candidate- value lists. Compared with other slots, these slots still have space for improvements. \n\n[4] Error analysis To better understand the improve- ment, we conducted an error analysis and inspected actual examples on the MultiWOZ 2.1 validation set. Table  5  shows the top-10 slots, according to the ratio of ground-truth slot values which cannot be found through span matching. That is, for such examples, DS-Span cannot extract the ground-truth strings, resulting in the low joint accuracy. Here, we show how well our DS-DST and DS-Picklist can correctly predict the missing values in DS-Span. As we can see in this table, the two methods dra- matically reduce the errors for some slots such as attraction-type ,  hotel-internet  and  hotel-parking Hence, for these kinds of slots, it is better to treat them as categorical slots. Among the top-10 slots, the  time -related slots such as  taxi-leave at  and  train- arrive by , which are span-based slots in DS-DST, DS-Span and DS-DST cannot perform well as there are no span matching in the dialogue context, and only few values (i.e., ‘ none ’ and ‘ dontcare ’) can be correctly predicted by the slot-gate classiﬁcation. When the ontology is accessible, DS-Picklist can further reduce the error rates, since the predicted values can be found in the candidate-values lists. \n\nThe DS-DST model performs better than DS-Picklist for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' slots due to its ability to handle time-related information more effectively through direct interactions between the dialog context and the slot, even though these slots are span-based."}

For instance, when considering only warrants (W), BERT achieves a maximum accuracy of $71\\%$, which accounts for most of its peak performance. Adding reasons and warrants (R, W) provides an additional four percentage points, while including claims and warrants (C, W) adds two more percentage points, fully explaining the $77\\%$ peak performance [5]. However, when evaluated on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate spurious statistical cues, BERT's performance drops dramatically to $53\\%$ with a mean and median of $50\\%$, indicating that much of its earlier success was due to exploiting these cues rather than true argument comprehension [9].\n\n![{BERT's performance on adversarial dataset}](image4)  \nThe table in image4 shows that BERT's performance metrics—mean, median, and max—differ across various configurations.

In contrast, when considering only warrants (W), BERT's maximum score decreases to $0.712$, and further reductions occur when including reasons and claims [10].\n\nMoreover, the adversarial dataset effectively removes the spurious cues that BERT relied on, leading to a significant drop in performance and demonstrating that BERT has not truly learned argument comprehension but rather exploited statistical patterns in the data [7]. This highlights the importance of using robust evaluation methods like the adversarial dataset to assess model capabilities accurately.\n\nThe BERT model's test performance is primarily driven by its ability to exploit spurious statistical cues, and its peak performance on standard datasets does not reflect genuine understanding of argument comprehension."}

While this method offers control over specificity and breadth of information retrieval by adjusting depth and node selection, it tends to perform lower overall, especially when compared to the collapsed tree method [10]. The tree traversal method's F1 score increases steadily with context length but remains consistently lower than that of the collapsed tree [8].\n\nThe collapsed tree method is therefore more effective for tasks requiring a balance between granularity and comprehensiveness, particularly when using a token-based approach to ensure context does not exceed model constraints [5]. \n\nThe collapsed tree and tree traversal querying methods compare in terms of F1 score across different context lengths, with the collapsed tree generally outperforming the tree traversal method."}

This paper introduces a novel framework, L OGIC - LM, which integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical problem-solving. Our method first utilizes LLMs to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic formulation. Afterward, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the formulated problem. We also introduce a self-refinement module, which utilizes the symbolic solver’s error messages to revise symbolic formulations. We demonstrate L OGIC -LM’s effectiveness on five logical reasoning datasets: Proof Writer, PrOntoQA, FOLIO, Logical Deduction, and AR-LSAT. On average, L OGIC - LM achieves a significant performance boost of $39.2\\%$ over using LLM alone with standard prompting and $18.4\\%$ over LLM with chain-of-thought prompting.  \n\n[10] We showcase the adaptability and effectiveness of L OGIC -LM on five logical reasoning datasets: Proof Writer (Tafjord et al., 2021), PrOntoQA (Saparov and He, 2023), FOLIO (Han et al., 2022), AR-LSAT (Zhong et al., 2022), and the Logical Deduction dataset from BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022). These datasets cover a wide range of logical reasoning problems, including:  \n\n[9] We report the results of L OGIC -LM (without self-refinement) and baselines in Table 2.

We have three major observations.  \n\n[8] Logic-LM significantly outperforms standard LLMs and CoT across all datasets.

This progression begins with the collection of data, followed by analysis, and culminates in actionable insights that drive impact. According to quote [3], the value is only realized when data moves through the entire chain—from collection to action and finally to impact. A visual representation of this process can be seen in the flowchart, which shows how data is transformed into value through reporting, analysis, and action [![Data-Driven Process](image1)].\n\nAt the core of this transformation is the distinction between **reporting** and **analysis**, which are two critical phases in the analytics lifecycle. Reporting is descriptive, focusing on what has happened, while analysis is prescriptive, aiming to understand why and what should be done next [![Reporting vs. Analysis](image2)]. This differentiation highlights the importance of moving beyond mere data presentation to derive meaningful insights that inform decisions.\n\nThe **analytics value chain** emphasizes that partial progress along the chain does not yield value; it is the full cycle from data collection to impact that matters [3]. This aligns with the idea that analytics is about **impact**, not just insight [4]. For instance, if brilliant insights are generated but no actions are taken, there is no credit for the work [4].\n\nTo ensure this process is effective, strong **data leadership** is essential. Leaders must support the analytics organization by providing clear career paths and fostering a culture where data is deeply embedded in decision-making [6]. Additionally, **business units** need access to necessary data and analytical skills to drive insights, actions, and impact [7]. The **analytics org** must also be composed of individuals with diverse skills, including statistical analysis, experimental design, and training, to ensure the quality and relevance of insights [1].\n\nMoreover, the **levels of analytics** illustrate the increasing complexity and intelligence of the process, from standard reports to predictive modeling and optimization [8]. As one moves up the hierarchy, the focus shifts from understanding past events to predicting future outcomes and optimizing decisions [8].\n\nIn summary, the process of transforming data into business value progresses through structured levels of analytics and the full analytics value chain, ensuring that insights lead to impactful actions. ![Data-Driven Process](image1)"}

When these hybrids are self-fertilized, the alleles segregate during gamete formation, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles in the gametes [4]. This leads to a genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp in the F2 generation [image1]. The phenotypic ratio is 3:1, with three-quarters of the offspring showing the dominant purple phenotype and one-quarter showing the recessive white phenotype [image4]. This pattern aligns with Mendel's law of segregation, where each parent contributes one allele to the offspring [8]. ![{The F2 generation of pea plants shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white and a genotypic ratio of 1 PP: 2 Pp: 1 pp}](image1)"}

This approach ensures that the team continuously engages with stakeholders to refine and adapt the solution as needed [2]. The process also includes practices such as acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) and just-in-time (JIT) model storming, which help in aligning the development work with stakeholder expectations [2].\n\nOn the other hand, **Elicitation Methods** are specific techniques used to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders. These methods include practices like JIT model storming, look-ahead modeling, and all-hands demos. They are often employed during the **Needs Exploration** phase to translate stakeholder input into concrete requirements that can be implemented [4]. Elicitation methods are crucial for ensuring that the requirements captured are not only comprehensive but also aligned with the actual needs of the stakeholders.\n\nThe comparison between these two strategies highlights their complementary roles: **Needs Exploration** sets the foundation by identifying and prioritizing stakeholder needs, while **Elicitation Methods** provide the tools and techniques to extract and formalize those needs into actionable specifications. Together, they support a more effective and responsive agile management process.\n\n![{active stakeholder participation and elicitation methods}](image4)"}

One of the primary issues is the **siloed approach** within organizations, where different departments operate in isolation, leading to fragmented data and misaligned goals. This is supported by image6, which shows that **52%** of respondents identified the lack of a single ownership of the experience as a major challenge, resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals. ![{There is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals}](image6)\n\nAdditionally, many organizations struggle with **over-attribution** of marketing campaign performance to either the first or last click, as noted in text [10]. This flawed attribution model fails to capture the full customer journey, which is further emphasized in text [3], where it is stated that the traditional marketing funnel overlooks external influences such as peer recommendations and product reviews. Image3 illustrates this issue, showing that **52%** of respondents attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, highlighting the limitations of simplistic attribution models.\n\nAnother critical barrier is the **lack of a 360-degree view** of customer behavior and marketing activities. Text [2] points out that marketers often focus on tactical metrics in isolation, failing to integrate data across all touchpoints. This is corroborated by image4, which categorizes business topics, including **customer experience** and **sales and marketing**, indicating the need for cross-functional alignment. The chart suggests that while **44%** of respondents prioritize a customer-focused approach, the implementation remains inconsistent due to organizational silos.\n\nMoreover, the **complexity of measuring engagement** is a major hurdle. Text [1] explains that traditional metrics like reach and frequency do not capture sentiment, opinion, or brand affinity, which are essential for understanding true customer engagement. Text [7] reinforces this by advocating for a new measurement framework that includes both quantitative (e.g., site visits) and qualitative (e.g., social media sentiment) data. Image5, which displays a segmented bar chart with a percentage of **71%**, may reflect the proportion of efforts directed toward these complex engagement metrics, though the exact interpretation requires more context.\n\nFinally, the **lack of leadership commitment** and clear processes is a recurring theme. Text [8] emphasizes that sustainable adoption requires company-wide support across all business functions, from sales to finance. Text [11] also highlights that cultural and managerial barriers, rather than technological ones, are often the root cause of resistance to change. Image2, which shows that **44%** of respondents consider a customer-focused approach, underscores the gap between awareness and action.\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include siloed structures, flawed attribution models, limited data integration, and insufficient leadership and cultural support."}

Hollow items like cups and glasses should be loaded with the opening facing downwards to prevent water from collecting inside them [4]. Curved or recessed items should be loaded at an angle to allow water to run off, and all utensils must be stacked securely to avoid tipping over [4]. Additionally, it is important not to overload the dishwasher, as this can affect washing performance and energy consumption [4].\n\nImproper loading can lead to several issues. For instance, if the dishwasher is not level, it may not operate correctly, affecting wash performance [3]. Loading sharp items incorrectly can damage the door seal or pose a safety hazard [6].

As stated in [2], the ECU is a generic term for any embedded system that controls one or more of the electrical systems or subsystems in a motor vehicle. It reads values from various sensors, such as the Engine Temperature Sensor, Intake Air Temperature Sensor, Mass Air Flow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, HEGO Sensor, Crankshaft Sensor, and Camshaft Sensor, which provide critical data about the engine's state [image1]. \n\nBased on this information, the ECU determines the quantity of fuel to inject, as explained in [4], and adjusts ignition timing to enhance power and economy [5]. Additionally, it manages idle speed by using signals from the crankshaft position sensor [6]. The ECU also plays a vital role in regulating the opening and closing of injector valves through its interaction with the fuel injection system [7].\n\n![{The ECU monitors engine conditions and controls fuel injection and ignition timing}](image1)\n\nThe ECU's control functions are further illustrated in the block diagram of the fuel injection system, where it receives input from the Detecting System and sends control signals to the Fuel Metering System [image2].

During **Interphase**, the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for division. It is further divided into three sub-phases: **G₁ (growth phase)**, **S (DNA synthesis)**, and **G₂ (preparation for division)** [2]. In the **G₁ phase**, the cell increases in size and synthesizes proteins [2]. The **S phase** is when chromosomes duplicate, ensuring each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic material [1][7]. Finally, in the **G₂ phase**, the cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis [2].\n\nThe **Mitotic Phase (M)** involves the division of the nucleus (**Mitosis**) and the cytoplasm (**Cytokinesis**), resulting in two daughter cells [4]. Mitosis itself includes several stages: **Prophase**, **Metaphase**, **Anaphase**, and **Telophase**, although these are not explicitly mentioned in the text quotes. However, the image provides insight into these processes, such as the condensation of chromatin into visible chromosomes during **Prophase** [image4], the formation of the mitotic spindle [image6], and the separation of sister chromatids during **Anaphase** [image2].\n\n![{The cell cycle consists of Interphase and Mitotic Phase}](image1)  \nDuring **Interphase**, the cell undergoes growth and DNA replication, while in the **Mitotic Phase**, the nucleus and cytoplasm divide.
