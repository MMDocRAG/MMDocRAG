This belief is substantially more pronounced among Latino Democrats than Latino Republicans, of whom only 36% share similar perceptions (see `![People not seeing racial discrimination is a bigger problem for Democrats compared to Republicans](image3)`).\n\nMoreover, data suggests that 55% of Latino Democrats report having experienced racial discrimination—a figure higher than either Latino Republicans or Latino independents (see `![Racial discrimination by party affiliation](image4)`).

According to a survey conducted from April 25 to May 1, 2018, [8] only 41% of Americans believe the Republican Party has high ethical standards, with a nearly identical 42% saying the same for the Democratic Party. This suggests that perceptions of ethical standards are similar for both parties.\n\nHowever, when looking at critiques of these ethical standards, there is a divide among educational groups. As stated in [3], among those with at least a college degree, 31% believe that neither the GOP nor the Democratic Party has high ethical standards. This is a higher percentage than those who hold this belief among non-college graduates (17%).\n\nPolitical affiliation also plays a role in perceptions of ethical standards. As indicated in [7], about a third of independents (34%) believe that neither party has high ethical standards. This is significantly higher than the percentage of Democrats (18%) or Republicans (19%) who share this view.\n\nIn terms of perceptions of extremism, the Republican Party is generally viewed more negatively than the Democratic Party. According to [9], 48% of Americans view the Republican Party as too extreme, compared to 42% for the Democratic Party. This divide is consistent across different educational levels, as shown in [3].\n\nThe data also indicates that perceptions of political parties' ethics and extremism differ by political affiliation. According to [4], overwhelming shares of both Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (83%) and Democrats and Democratic leaners (85%) believe their own party has good policy ideas, while less than a quarter say this describes the opposing party. Similarly, only about two-in-ten Republicans or Democrats think their own party is too extreme (22% and 21%, respectively), but about three-quarters in each party think the other party can be described this way (77% and 76%, respectively).\n\nIn summary, perceptions of political parties' ethics and extremism differ among various educational and political affiliation groups. While perceptions of ethical standards are similar for both parties, there are divisions based on education level and political affiliation. The Republican Party is generally viewed as more extreme than the Democratic Party, and this perception is consistent across different educational levels. Lastly, partisans are more likely to view their own party favorably, and to critique the opposing party, on both ethics and extremism.\n\nEthics and Extremism Differences Among Educational and Political Affiliation Groups:\n- Similar perceptions of ethical standards for both parties, but critiques vary based on education level and political affiliation.\n- Higher percentage of college graduates believe neither party has high ethical standards, compared to non-college graduates.\n- Significantly higher percentage of independents believe neither party has high ethical standards, compared to Democrats and Republicans.\n- More Americans view the Republican Party as too extreme compared to the Democratic Party.\n- Perceptions of political parties' policy ideas and ethical standards are generally more positive within one's own party than the opposing party."}

However, preferences are more divided among voters who do not have a college degree ([2]).\n\nInterestingly, identical shares of Republicans and Democratic leaners (52% each) say they have been following news about the upcoming elections very or fairly closely ([3]). This suggests that political affiliations do not necessarily impact the level of engagement with election news.\n\nNow, let's consider the perceptions of ethical standards. Nearly a third of college graduates say neither party has 'high ethical standards' ([9]). Among those with at least a college degree, 31% share this view ([7]). This sentiment is higher among independents, with about a third (34%) stating that neither party has high ethical standards ([10]).\n\nIn terms of partisanship, Republicans (19%) and Democrats (18%) are less likely than independents to say neither party has 'high ethical standards' ([10]). However, majorities of Republicans (66%) and Democrats (64%) describe their party this way ([5]).\n\nIn summary, the perception of ethical standards and political party preferences does vary among different education levels and political affiliations. A notable number of people, particularly college-educated individuals and independents, believe that neither party has high ethical standards, while those with higher degrees of education or leaning towards either party are more likely to favor Democratic candidates.\n\n![College graduates and independents perceive neither party as having high ethical standards](image7), and college graduates lean towards Democratic candidates.\n![Both parties are perceived as having slightly more high ethical standards by the public, but the Democratic Party has a slight edge over the Republican Party](image2)"}

According to [3], 53% of Americans express at least some confidence in Trump, while 46% have little or no confidence. This is a mixed assessment, with a slight majority having some confidence in Trump's economic decision-making.\n\nHowever, when it comes to ethical standards, the perception is less favorable. As stated in [2], only 41% of Americans believe the GOP has high ethical standards, and a similar share (42%) say this about the Democratic Party. This suggests that the public may have reservations about the ethical standards of both major parties, not just the Republican Party.\n\nWhen we look at the Trump administration's ethical standards specifically, the assessment is even more critical. In [5], we learn that just 9% of Democrats rate the administration's ethical standards as high or excellent, while 86% rate them as poor. Among Republicans, the numbers are more favorable, but still mixed, with 75% giving the administration high marks and 36% of moderate and liberal Republicans expressing negative views.\n\nSo, while there is a slight majority confidence in Trump's handling of economic policy, perceptions of his ethical standards are more negative, especially among Democrats and to a lesser extent, among moderate and liberal Republicans. This suggests that while the public may see some competence in Trump's economic policies, they have concerns about the ethical standards of his administration.\n\n![Public confidence in Trump's handling of economic policy and mixed views on his ethical standards](image10)"}

On the other hand, public confidence in Trump's economic policy decision-making started lower, at 46% in January 2018, but then increased to 53% by May 2018 [3][image3].\n\nComparing these two aspects of Trump's presidency, we see that public confidence in his handling of an international crisis experienced a slight increase, rising from 35% in January to 43% by May 2018 [5][image3]. Meanwhile, the public's confidence in his economic policy decision-making increased more noticeably, from 46% in January to 53% in May 2018 [3][image3]. Thus, in the period observed, public confidence seemingly grew more in Trump's economic policy decision-making than his ability to handle international crises.\n\nIn general, it's worth noting that public perception can vary depending on the issue at hand. Some areas, like economic policy, may experience increased confidence over time, while others like international crisis management may show more fluctuation [3][5][image3].\n\nTo summarize, between January and May 2018:\n- Public confidence in Trump's ability to handle an international crisis increased from 35% to 43%.\n- Public confidence in Trump's economic policy decision-making increased from 46% to 53%.\n- Over this period, there was a greater percentage point increase in confidence related to Trump's economic policy decisions."}

Generally, higher ethical standards are associated with increased public trust and approval. The chart (image3) shows that the Democratic Party is rated slightly higher (42%) than the Republican Party (41%) regarding having high ethical standards [3]. This interlinkage between ethical standards and job performance approval may hold true for the Trump administration as well.\n\nIn summary, Trump's administration officials' ethical standards' approval ratings are lower than those of past administrations, and this may be related to the public approval of his job performance, given that higher ethical standards are often associated with increased public trust and approval."}

Quote [5] further highlights this division, stating that 87% of Clinton voters were surprised by Trump's victory, while 60% of Trump voters were surprised.\n\nThe image quotes also offer valuable evidence. Image1 shows a bar chart with emotions and their corresponding numerical values. The high numbers for emotions like unease, sadness, and fear among the general population suggest a sense of apprehension about Trump's victory. Image3 provides a more detailed breakdown of the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters. For Trump voters, the top responses include \"happy\" and \"surprised,\" while for Clinton voters, the top responses are \"shocked\" and \"disappointed.\"\n\nSynthesizing this evidence, it's clear that the emotional reactions to Trump's victory were quite different between Trump and Clinton voters. While a significant portion of Trump voters expressed happiness and surprise, Clinton voters were more likely to express shock and disappointment. This disparity suggests that Trump voters' expectations before the election were exceeded, while Clinton voters were left disillusioned by the outcome.\n\nDirect Answer: The emotional reactions to Trump's victory varied significantly between Trump and Clinton voters, with Trump voters more likely to express happiness and surprise, and Clinton voters more likely to express shock and disappointment. This divide suggests that Trump voters' expectations were exceeded, while Clinton voters were left disillusioned by the outcome.\n\nImage Citations:\n- `![The population was generally uneasy, sad, and scared about Trump's victory](image1)`\n- `![Trump voters were more likely to express happiness and surprise, while Clinton voters were more likely to express shock and disappointment](image3)`"}

This is reflected in the data showing that 79% of all voters hold this expectation [1]. However, the immediate reaction to Trump's victory differs markedly between the two groups.\n\nWhen voters were asked to summarize their feelings about Trump's victory in a word, \"happy\" was mentioned most often by Trump supporters. Interestingly, many Trump supporters also pointed to the unexpected or surprising nature of the result [2]. This sentiment is echoed in an image depicting levels of surprise among different voter groups, which indicates that 60% of Trump voters were surprised by his victory, compared to 87% of Clinton supporters [image1].\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton supporters were more likely to express feelings of shock and disappointment at the election outcome [2].

This sentiment was shared by 71% of conservative Republicans, 74% of moderate and liberal Republicans, and 67% of conservative and moderate Democrats as recently as 2021 [1]. \n\nHowever, more recently, Americans' ratings of the government's efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism have reached record lows since the September 11 attacks. As of 2022, only 46% of Americans believe the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, a stark contrast to the 72% who held this view in early 2021 [2]. This shift in perception is observed across the political spectrum, with both Democrats and Republicans expressing more negative assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism since 2015 [3][4].\n\nWhen examining the impact of age on perceptions, older Americans (50 and older) are more likely to give the government negative ratings for its efforts against terrorism. Specifically, 57% of Americans aged 50 and older believed the government was not doing well reducing the terrorist threat in 2022, compared to just 46% of those aged 18-29 [6].\n\nFurthermore, the line graph in image1 illustrates the varying trends in how Republicans, Democrats, and Independents have perceived government efforts to combat terrorism between 2004 and 2015. Both Democrats and Independents showed declining trust in government efforts over time, while Republican trust remained relatively stable, albeit at a lower level compared to Democrats [1].\n\nTo summarize, public perceptions of government efforts to combat terrorism have declined over time, and these perceptions differ by political affiliation and age group. The line graph (image1) displays the evolution of these perceptions from 2004 to 2015, highlighting the varying trends among political affiliations.

According to a survey, 43% of adults under 30 believe that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties, while 71% of those aged 65 and older prioritize the country's security [3, 10]. These concerns have shifted over time, with 49% of Americans feeling the country didn't go far enough to protect itself in 2004. This number increased to 56% by 2015, while those concerned about restrictions on civil liberties grew from 29% to 56% in the same period [5, 8].\n\n![Younger Americans focus more on potential government restrictions on civil liberties, while older Americans prioritize national security.](image5)\n\nPolitical ideology also plays a substantial role in shaping these perceptions [7].

However, Germans are more divided in their views on defense spending and hold varying opinions on the significance of U.S. military bases in their country."}

However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.'s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [3]. Similarly, there has been a more modest decline among Democrats in the same view [3].\n\nOn the other hand, in Germany, partisan gaps also emerge. Supporters of the CDU/CSU are on balance in favor of defense spending increases, while supporters of the Greens express more skepticism [5]. Members of the SPD fall in the middle [5]. Younger Germans especially doubt the importance of American military bases in their country, with roughly six-in-ten of Germans ages 18 to 29 thinking U.S. military bases in Germany do not contribute to German national security [6].\n\n![A higher percentage of U.S. respondents view the importance of defense spending as \"Very important\" compared to German respondents, who tend to view it as less important overall](image2)\n\nThe image2 clearly illustrates that a significantly higher percentage of U.S. respondents view defense spending as \"Very important\" compared to German respondents, who are more likely to consider it as \"Not too important\" or \"Somewhat important.\"\n\nRegarding the change in opinions over time, in the U.S., there is a partisan divide on the issue of increasing defense spending, though support for the American military presence in Germany is high among both Republicans and Democrats [2]. According to image1, the support for increasing defense spending in the U.S. has slightly decreased from 45% in 2017 to 35% in 2019. Meanwhile, in Germany, there has been a steady increase in support for increased defense spending, from 32% in 2017 to 40% in 2019 [1]. Despite this increase, the German public remains less likely to support defense spending increases compared to the American public [1, 7].\n\nIn conclusion, both American and German public opinions on increasing defense spending are influenced by political affiliations, and these opinions have changed slightly over time. In general, American respondents are more likely to support increased defense spending compared to German respondents."}

Both Republicans and Democrats show high support for the American military presence in Germany, but there is a partisan divide in terms of foreign policy priorities. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are keener on Israel as a partner (26%) than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (9%) [4][7]. This divide is also evident in a line graph showing trends over three years, from 2017 to 2019, for two political affiliations: \"Republican/Lean Rep\" and \"Democrat/Lean Dem.\" The graph provides a visual comparison of the two groups over the specified years, showing a decline in favorable views from both groups, but more pronounced among Republicans [2].\n\nIn terms of foreign policy partners, the image1 clearly shows that Germans are more likely to view the U.S. as an important partner compared to how Americans view Germany. For Germans of differing political stripes, the differences are less dramatic, with France and the U.S. being the top two choices [3]. In contrast, in the U.S., political affiliation dictates who people think is the most important foreign policy partner. While both Republicans and Democrats agree that the UK is their most important partner, Republicans are keener on Israel (26%) than Democrats (9%) [4].\n\nTo sum up, age differences in Germany and political affiliations in the U.S. significantly affect perceptions of the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany and foreign policy partners. Younger Germans are more skeptical about the importance of U.S. military bases in their country, while older Germans see them as important. Meanwhile, in the U.S., political affiliations drive different views on foreign policy partners, with Republicans showing more enthusiasm for Israel as a partner compared to Democrats.\n\n![Younger Germans are skeptical about the importance of U.S. military bases in Germany, while older Germans see them as important (image9).](image9)\n\n![Political affiliations drive different views on foreign policy partners in the U.S. (image1).](image1)"}

Moreover, confidence levels vary among different subsets of these groups, with conservative Republicans showing the least confidence (10%) compared to liberal Democrats (81%). In terms of gender, women (59%) have more confidence in Biden's ability than men (48%). Ethnic groups also differ in their confidence levels, with Black (82%) and Hispanic adults (70%) expressing more confidence than White adults (43%). Those with a college degree expect Biden to deal effectively with China at a higher rate (60%) than those with less schooling (50%) [6].\n\nAs for specific concerns about China, a significant proportion of Americans view several issues as very serious problems: cyberattacks from China (73% Democrats, 60% Republicans); the loss of U.S. jobs to China (53% of Americans); China's growing military power (52% of Democrats, 63% of Republicans); China's policies on human rights (54% of Democrats, 49% of Republicans); and China's growing technological power (57% of Republicans, 39% of Democrats). These percentages represent the views of both Democrats/Lean Democrats and Republicans/Lean Republicans for the year 2021 [2][5][9].\n\nIn summary, confidence in President Biden's ability to deal with China varies among different demographic and political groups, with Democrats generally expressing more confidence than Republicans. The most serious concerns about China, according to Americans, are cyberattacks, job losses, China's growing military and technological power, and its human rights policies.\n\n![Confidence in Biden's ability to deal with China varies among different demographic and political groups](image4)\n![Most serious concerns about China](image2)"}

On the other hand, 86% of conservative and moderate Democrats, as well as liberal Democrats (81%), express confidence in Biden's ability to handle China [3].\n\nWhen it comes to concerns about China, Americans express substantial worry regarding eight specific issues in the U.S.-China relationship. Approximately three-quarters or more of the population believe each of these issues is at least somewhat serious. However, four problems stand out as being very serious concerns for at least half of Americans: cyber attacks from China, the loss of U.S. jobs to China, China's growing military power, and China's policies on human rights [10].\n\n![Confidence in Biden's ability to deal with China across different demographic groups](image3)\n\nCyber attacks from China have seen the most significant increase in concern, with roughly two-thirds of Americans considering this a very serious problem, a 7 percentage point increase from 2020 [7].

For example, while the share of Republicans who say the loss of U.S. jobs to China poses a very serious problem increased by 14 percentage points, there was no significant change among Democrats [9].\n\nIn summary, confidence in Biden's ability to deal effectively with China varies among demographic groups, with Republicans expressing much less confidence than Democrats. The four major concerns Americans have regarding China are cyber attacks, the loss of U.S. jobs, China's growing military power, and China's policies on human rights. These concerns have seen increased attention in recent years, particularly among Republicans."}

This marked difference in device ownership is consistent with the broader trend of lower technology adoption rates among the senior population.\n\nSeniors' online activities also differ from those of the general adult population. According to a pie chart, 41% of seniors do not go online, 32% go online but do not use social networking services (SNS), and 27% use SNS (image2). These figures differ substantially from the general adult population.\n\nOver time, the gap in internet adoption rates between seniors and all adults has been narrowing.

Moreover, [3] reveals that seniors with low household incomes and those who have not attended college tend to be much more removed from online life. This is further corroborated by the image quote, which shows that e-book reader and tablet computer usage is significantly lower among seniors with lower income levels and less education [image1].\n\nIn terms of trends in device ownership, [2] explains that broadband adoption among older adults has more than doubled over a five-year period. However, [6] mentions that smartphones remain rare within the 65-and-older population and trail members of the general population at a similar income level. The provided image quote [image2] also shows that device adoption among older adults (65+) has been increasing, but not as rapidly as among the overall adult population (18+).\n\nIn conclusion, while internet and smartphone adoption rates among older adults have been increasing, they remain significantly lower than those of the general population, and these rates differ substantially based on income and education levels. Older adults with lower incomes and less education are less likely to adopt these technologies, and this trend persists across various categories of device ownership [image4].

Moreover, workers with varying levels of educational attainment express pronounced differences in their views of workplace technology [3].\n\nInterestingly, the survey finds that workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those who have not attended college to say that each of six common workforce technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers [4]. Roughly one-quarter (24%) of workers with high school diplomas or less say that not a single one of these six technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers, while for college graduates, that share is just 2% [5].\n\nThese trends are also reflected in the perceived impact of various technologies on different educational groups (image3). Across all six technologies, workers with at least a four-year college degree have markedly more positive views compared with those with high school diplomas or less. These differences are most pronounced in the case of office productivity tools such as word processing or spreadsheet software, with a 45-percentage-point difference between the share of workers with college degrees (90%) and those with high school diplomas or less (45%) who feel these technologies have had a positive impact on them professionally.\n\nAdditionally, workers with higher levels of education are more likely to say tech has increased their opportunities and made their jobs more interesting (image5). For instance, 64% of college graduates believe that technology has made their work more interesting, compared to only 38% of workers with a high school diploma or less [10].\n\nIn conclusion, workers with higher levels of educational attainment generally hold more positive views of the impact of workplace technology on their jobs and careers, particularly in terms of making work more interesting and increasing opportunities for career advancement."}

On the other hand, among those who have not heard anything about it, only 4% are enthusiastic, and 69% are worried [7].\n\nThis is further illustrated in the following chart:\n\n![Americans' levels of enthusiasm and worry about automation, categorized by their familiarity with the concept](image3)\n\nIn terms of expected outcomes from this change, larger shares of Americans anticipate negative consequences. Roughly three-quarters of Americans expect that widespread automation will lead to much greater levels of economic inequality than exist today [8]. Only 25% think that the economy will create many new, better-paying jobs for humans [1]. However, when asked about policies that might blunt or minimize the impact of widespread automation on human workers, the public responds most strongly to limiting machines to doing jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans, with 85% of Americans in favor of this type of policy [2].\n\nConsidering public opinion on various aspects related to automation, the following chart provides a more detailed view:\n\n![Public opinion on policies related to automation and human jobs](image2)\n\nLastly, when asked about a number of possible outcomes from a world in which machines can do many of the jobs currently done by humans, the public generally expects more negative than positive outcomes [5].

Furthermore, image1 displays that 85% of Americans generally support this policy, with 24% expressing strong support. This is visually represented as the first and largest blue segment in the image. The near-consensus on this issue is also noted in image5, with 47% of respondents strongly favoring and 38% favoring this policy, resulting in an overwhelming 85% total.\n\n shifting to other policy proposals, the differences between political affiliations become more pronounced. For instance, image3 illustrates that 77% of Democrats/lean Dems but only 38% of Republicans/lean Rep support a guaranteed basic income.\n\nIn summary, the public opinion polls indicate that—despite some differences between political affiliations—Americans prioritize maintaining limitations on machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans, as evidenced in image1, image3, and image5. The near-unanimous sentiment reflects the conviction that humans should not be exposed to jobs that pose substantial risks to their well-being, which machines can effectively handle.\n\nIn conclusion, a strong majority of Americans support limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, with 85% in favor, according to the evidence from image1, image3, and image5.

This partisan divide is also reflected in attitudes towards the government's obligation to take care of workers displaced by automation [3][5]. \n\nWhen it comes to education levels, there are variations in the support for limiting the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines. Americans with high school diplomas or less are more supportive of such limitations compared to those with four-year college degrees [10]. \n\nThe image below, **[Limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs](image1)**, shows that 47% of Americans strongly favor this policy, and there is a higher bar for favor in general (47%). This indicates a strong support for limiting the role of machines in certain jobs.\n\n![Public strongly favors limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs](image1)\n\nIn terms of the government's obligation to take care of workers displaced by automation, the public is evenly divided, but there is a slightly higher bar for those who believe the government should take care of these workers (50%) [4]. This is further broken down by education levels and political affiliations:\n\n- By education level: Those with higher education degrees are less likely to believe in the government's obligation, while those with high school diplomas or less show stronger support.\n- By political affiliation: Democrats/lean Democrat are more likely to believe in the government's obligation compared to Republicans/lean Republican.\n\nFor the second set of bars in [image4], addressing limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, we see that:\n\n- 58% of U.S. adults think there should be limits.\n- By education level: Those with higher education degrees are less likely to support limits, while those with high school diplomas or less show stronger support.\n- By political affiliation: Both Democrats/lean Democrat and Republicans/lean Republican show support for limits, but Democrats have a slightly higher percentage.\n\nIn conclusion, political affiliations and education levels significantly influence opinions on government obligations and automation limits related to job displacement.

Similarly, 66% of Democrats support a national service program, whereas only 46% of Republicans agree [2][10].\n\nOn the other hand, there are no major partisan differences in support for limiting machines to dangerous and dirty jobs, or for giving people the option to pay extra to interact with a human rather than a robot in commercial transactions [1].\n\nHowever, attitudes toward the government's obligation to take care of workers who are displaced by automation vary strongly by partisan affiliation. A majority of Democrats believe the government should take care of displaced workers even if that means higher taxes for others, while most Republicans think individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-beings even if jobs are automated [4][5].\n\nWhen it comes to limiting the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, both Democrats and Republicans have similar opinions, with a slight edge going to Democrats (60% vs. 54%) [6][10].\n\nEducation level also plays a role in shaping views on these issues.

Younger workers (18-24 years old) and those with lower household incomes are more likely to have been impacted by automation in this way. This aligns with image3, which shows a higher percentage of younger workers losing jobs or having reduced pay/hours compared to older age groups.\n\nIn general, workers with higher levels of education have more positive views of workplace technologies [3][7][8][9][10]. For example, workers with college degrees are more likely to say that software for word processing, smartphones, and email/social media have had a positive impact on their jobs or careers. On the other hand, workers lacking a college education are much less likely to express positive attitudes towards current workforce technologies [5].\n\nRegarding the broader impact of technology on workers' careers, college graduates are more likely to say that technology has made their work more interesting and provided increased opportunities for career advancement [8]. This contrasts with workers who have not been impacted by automation, where only 38% and 32% feel that technology has made their jobs more interesting and increased opportunities for advancement, respectively [10].\n\nWhen considering age groups, younger workers (18-24 years old) are more likely to have been impacted by workforce automation [2].

Contrastingly, workers without a college education are less optimistic; they are less likely to view technology positations in a positive light [1, 2, 5]. \n\nThis positive correlation between education level and the perceived benefits of technology is further supported by the image below, which illustrates the impact of education on perceiving work as more interesting and advantageous in terms of career advancement [4]. \n\n![Individuals with higher education levels are more likely to feel that their education made their work more interesting and increased their opportunities for advancement](image4)\n\nMoreover, the current generation of workforce technologies has had a relatively unequal impact on today's workers [6]. Those who have attended college are more likely to view technologies positively, while those who have not are less likely to do so [3, 5]. This trend is evident in various workforce technologies, including word processing/spreadsheet software, smartphones, email/social media, software to manage daily schedules or routines, customer self-serve technologies, and industrial robots [7]. \n\nFurther reinforcing this point is the fact that workers with college degrees are substantially more likely than those who have not attended college to report that each of these individual technologies has had a positive impact on their jobs or careers [7]. However, a more nuanced picture emerges from data on job losses and reduced wages due to automation technologies, as there seems to be a disparate impact on workers with different educational backgrounds [4].\n\nLastly, it is worth noting that only 38% of workers with high school diplomas or less indicate that technology, in general, has made their jobs more interesting, and only 32% feel that it has increased their opportunities for career advancement. These figures are substantially lower compared to those reported by workers with higher educational attainment [9]. \n\nIn conclusion, the perceptions of workforce automation and technology vary significantly depending on demographics and education levels.

This difference suggests a lack of trust in the fairness of this system despite its perceived effectiveness.\n- **Automated video analysis of job interviews**: This system is perceived as effective by `39%`, but only `33%` find it fair (`![Effective-fair difference of +6%](image3)`). The fairness perception is even lower than the personal finance score system, implying a potential lack of public trust in using this technology for job interviews.\n- **Automated resume screening of job applicants**: This system is perceived as effective by `47%`, and `43%` find it fair (`![Effective-fair difference of +4%](image3)`). While the difference is smaller than the previous systems, it still indicates a minor gap between perceived effectiveness and fairness.\n- **Automated scoring of people up for parole**: Perceptions of fairness (`50%`) are slightly higher than effectiveness (`49%`) for this system (`![Effective-fair difference of -1%](image3)`). This indicates a relatively higher level of trust in this system compared to the previous ones.\n\nThe `![Public trust differs based on the type of automated decision-making system](image4)` (image4) demonstrates varying levels of perceived fairness among these systems. For instance, the lowest perceived fairness is for the automated personal finance score system (`6%` very fair) and the highest perceived effectiveness is for automated scoring of people up for parole (`49%` effective).\n\nIn summary, the public harbors a significant amount of skepticism and mistrust when it comes to the fairness and effectiveness of various automated decision-making systems. Although some systems like automated personal finance scores and video interviews are perceived as effective, the perceived fairness of these systems is considerably lower, indicating a considerable trust gap."}

However, views of Trump administration officials are lower than those of officials in the previous five administrations, often measured at times of specific ethical controversies [7].\n\nPartisan views of Trump's economic policies have become more polarized since the fall of 2017.

Trump has the highest percentage of supporters who believe he will be a successful president (65%), while Obama, Bush, and Clinton all have lower percentages of supporters who think they will be successful (43%, 28%, and 8%, respectively).\n2.

This may be attributed to the fact that at comparable points in their presidencies, the percentage of Republicans who think their president's administration will be successful is higher, while the percentage of Democrats who think the same is lower. Additionally, the percentage of people who believe it's \"too early to tell\" which way the administration will turn is consistently low for both Trump and Bush among Republican voters.\n\nTo summarize, when comparing perceptions of Trump's presidency to those of Obama, Bush, and Clinton, it becomes apparent that Trump's supporters are more optimistic about his success than supporters of any previous president. The data supports this claim with higher percentages of Republicans believing in Trump's success when compared to his predecessors. This trend is also mirrored over time, as more Republicans are optimistic about the success of Trump and Bush's presidencies compared to Clinton and Obama.\n\nIn conclusion, 65% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think Trump will be a successful president [image1], which is the highest percentage for any president at this point in their term [image3]."}

The drop in approval for public health officials is more pronounced among Republicans, while for Donald Trump, the change is more significant among Democrats. Notably, there is a growing partisan divide in views regarding the performance of public health officials."}

According to a Pew Research Center survey, a majority of Americans (69%) are more concerned that state governments are lifting restrictions too quickly, as opposed to just 30% who think states have been too slow to lift restrictions (image2). These concerns about the speed of lifting restrictions coincide with an overall critical view of the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, with a growing number of Americans rating Trump's response poorly, currently at 48% (image1 and [4], [6]).\n\nAlthough Americans express concern about the pace of lifting restrictions, the continued COVID-19 outbreak is seen as the result of multiple factors, including insufficient adherence to social distancing guidelines and mask-wearing, as well as premature lifting of restrictions. These concerns are more prevalent among Democrats than Republicans, but both parties have divergent opinions about nearly all aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, including its response compared to other affluent nations (image3, [7], [8]).\n\nAs for the effectiveness of the response, only 37% of Americans give a positive rating to Donald Trump, while the public continues to express overwhelmingly positive views of the response of local hospitals and medical centers (image1, [3], [9], [10]). These ratings indicate that Americans in general have lower confidence in the federal response to the pandemic compared to their approval of local hospitals handling of the outbreak.\n\nIn summary, American perceptions of state government COVID-19 response differ from their views on Trump's handling of the pandemic, with the majority of Americans believing that state governments are lifting restrictions too quickly, leading to increasingly critical evaluations of the overall U.S. response. Conversely, the public has maintained positive views of their local hospitals' and medical centers' response, while expressing more skepticism toward Trump's handling of the crisis."}

A survey conducted from July 27 to August 2, 2020, shows that among the total respondents, 48% trust the federal government and 51% trust state and local governments. However, when breaking down the responses by political affiliation, a striking contrast emerges:\n\n- For Republicans/Lean Republicans, only 30% trust the federal government compared to 68% who trust state and local governments.\n- For Democrats/Lean Democrats, on the other hand, 64% trust the federal government whereas 35% trust state and local governments.\n![Trust in government by political affiliation](image4)\n\nIn terms of major reasons cited for the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak, a bar chart shows varying levels of perceived importance across different factors:\n\n1. **Not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing**:\n   - Major reason: 75%\n   - This reason is significantly more emphasized by Democrats/Lean Democrats at 89% compared to 57% of Republicans/Lean Republicans.\n![Percentage of respondents viewing social distancing as a major or minor reason for the spread](image5)\n\n2. **Restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places**:\n   - Major reason: 58%\n   - Again, Democrats/Lean Democrats are more likely to view this as a major reason (82%) compared to 31% of Republicans/Lean Republicans.\n\n3. **Inadequate response from the federal government**:\n   - Major reason: 53%\n   - Democrats/Lean Democrats are more concerned about inadequate response from the federal government (82%) than Republicans/Lean Republicans (21%).\n\n4. **Not enough timely testing**:\n   - Major reason: 49%\n   - Democrats/Lean Democrats are significantly more likely to see inadequate testing as a major reason (67%) compared to Republicans/Lean Republicans (30%).\n\nThese findings indicate that there are substantial differences in perceptions of government responsibility during the COVID-19 pandemic based on political affiliations.

We can see this from both text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that there's a significant partisan divide over which level of government is primarily responsible for policies to limit the spread of COVID-19 [1]. Most Americans, regardless of party, believe that insufficient social distancing is a major reason the outbreak has continued [3, 7, 8]. However, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to view an inadequate federal response [5, 9], lack of timely testing [4, 5], and lifting restrictions too quickly [5, 8] as major reasons for the continued outbreak.\n\nFrom image quotes, we observe that there are disparities in the perceived effectiveness of testing between political groups. For instance, Democrats are more likely to believe that there are more new infections, whereas Republicans are more likely to think more people are being tested [image3]. This difference in perception could influence how each group perceives the government's response to the pandemic.\n\nIn terms of trust in government, Republicans tend to trust state and local governments more than the federal government, while Democrats trust the federal government more [image2]. This variance in trust may affect how each group views the government's handling of the crisis.\n\nTo answer the question directly, political affiliations significantly influence perceptions about the main reasons for the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak. Democrats are more likely to criticize the federal government's response, testing capabilities, and speed in lifting restrictions, while Republicans tend to focus on insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the evidence from both text and image quotes, we can say:\n\n- Democrats are more likely than Republicans to view policy responses, testing, and speed in lifting restrictions as major reasons for the continued outbreak.\n- Republicans are more likely to perceive insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing as major reasons, with a higher trust in state and local governments over the federal government's response.\n\n`![Political affiliations significantly influence perceptions about the main reasons for the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak, with Democrats focusing on policy responses and Republicans concentrating on social distancing behaviors.](image3)`\n\n`![There are also differences in trust in government between political affiliations, which might impact perceptions of the government's handling of the crisis.](image2)`"}

However, there is a divide along party lines, with liberal Democrats more likely to hold this view compared to conservative and moderate Democrats ([4]).\n\nMeanwhile, text quotes [5]-[8] reveal a substantial partisan divide on whether the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases is due to more testing or more new infections. According to image1, the majority of Democrats attribute the rise in cases primarily to more infections, whereas a majority of Republicans, especially those who lean conservative, believe it is mostly due to increased testing. This divide is also visible in image5, which directly compares opinions between Democrats/Lean Democrat and Republicans/Lean Republican.\n\nFurthermore, image3 outlines several reasons for the spread of COVID-19, including not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing, restrictions being lifted too quickly, and inadequate response from the federal government. Here, we can see that the perception of insufficient social distancing and mask-wearing is more pronounced among Democrats, while the belief that restrictions are lifted too quickly is more prevalent among Republicans. Inadequate response from the federal government is seen as a major reason by both political groups, but it is particularly notable among Democrats.\n\nLastly, image4 demonstrates that the majority of respondents, especially among Democrats, prefer significantly reducing coronavirus infections before reopening stores, schools, and other workplaces.

Democrats are more likely to express concerns about lifted restrictions and attribute the rise in cases to more infections and insufficient social distancing. Meanwhile, Republicans, particularly conservatives, are more likely to attribute the increase in cases to more testing and believe restrictions have not been lifted quickly enough.

For women in particular, difficulties like discrimination in recruitment, hiring, and promotion, lack of encouragement from early ages, challenges with work-family balance in STEM jobs, and limited access to female role models contribute to the gender disparity. Less access to quality education, lower belief in the ability to succeed in STEM, and diminished interest in STEM topics further add to the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in these fields.\n\nIn conclusion, while men and women in STEM jobs value similar job characteristics, there are notable differences in what they prioritize.

The chart clearly indicates that STEM professions generally have a higher percentage of individuals with bachelor's and postgraduate degrees compared to non-STEM professions, which have more individuals with high school or less education.\n\nRegarding employment sectors over time, both STEM and non-STEM workers are largely employed in the private, for-profit sector. However, STEM workers are slightly more likely to be employed in this sector (66% compared to 65% for all employed adults) [4]. The image quote below illustrates this trend:\n\n![STEM and non-STEM workers are largely employed in the private, for-profit sector.

[Most women in STEM jobs who work in majority-male workplaces, in computer jobs or who have a postgraduate degree have experienced gender discrimination at work][2]. This is further echoed by a study which reveals that [women in STEM jobs are more likely than men to say they have experienced workplace discrimination due to their gender][6].\n\nVisually, the differences in gender-based discrimination can be seen in [image1](![A bar chart comparing the experiences of women and men in STEM jobs regarding workplace issues, segmented by gender composition within the workplace.

One such factor is language. As shown in image3, among self-identified Hispanics, 28% speak Spanish, while 71% do not. This trend, however, changes across generations. For instance, among foreign-born Hispanics, 41% speak Spanish, but this drops significantly to 15% for second-generation Hispanics and further decreases to 7% for third or higher generation Hispanics (image5). This suggests that language proficiency plays a significant role in self-identification, with later generations less likely to speak Spanish.\n\nAnother factor is the influence of a Spanish last name. Interestingly, the presence of a Spanish last name does not seem to strongly correlate with self-identification as Hispanic. According to image3, only 15% of self-identified Hispanics have a Spanish last name. This trend is consistent across generations, as shown in image5. Even among foreign-born Hispanics, only 20% have a Spanish last name. This suggests that while a Spanish last name can be a part of Hispanic identity, it is not a decisive factor.\n\nThe connection between Hispanic ancestry and self-identification is also complex. According to text quote [1], by the third generation, only 77% of U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents and immigrant grandparents identify as Hispanic. This percentage drops to 50% by the fourth or higher generation (text quote [1]). This indicates that the degree of connection to Hispanic culture and identity weakens over generations, despite the continued presence of Hispanic ancestry.\n\nIn conclusion, the factors that influence self-identification as Hispanic in the U.S. include language proficiency, the presence of a Spanish last name, and generational status, with each factor playing a different role across generations."}

Let's break down the information into language dominance, parental encouragement to speak Spanish, and participation in cultural celebrations.\n\n### Language Dominance\n\nLooking at the language dominance among self-identified Hispanics, we see a clear shift towards English dominance across generations. For foreign-born self-identified Hispanics, only 7% mostly use English, but this figure rises to 43% for the U.S.-born second generation and further increases to 75% for the third or higher generation Hispanics [5, 6, 10]. This trend indicates a growing assimilation into English-speaking society over generations.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant number of foreign-born self-identified Hispanics (61%) are Spanish dominant, meaning they are more proficient in Spanish than English [10]. In contrast, only 6% of the second generation and essentially none of the third generation is Spanish dominant [9, 10].\n\nAmong self-identified non-Hispanics having Hispanic ancestry, 90% are English dominant, reflecting a strong assimilation into English-speaking culture [7].\n\n### Parental Encouragement to Speak Spanish\n\nThe surveys reveal that childhood experiences with Spanish fade quickly across the generations, although there is wide support for the language among Hispanics [2, 4, 6, 8]. Among foreign-born self-identified Hispanics, 85% say their parents often encouraged them to speak Spanish while growing up, but this percentage decreases to 68% for the U.S.-born second generation and 26% for the third or higher generation [6]. For non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry, only 10% are bilingual, indicating minimal encouragement or need to maintain the Spanish language [7].\n\n### Participation in Cultural Celebrations\n\nParticipation in cultural celebrations also varies across generations. Among self-identified Hispanics, the majority (51%) say they often took part in Hispanic cultural celebrations when growing up [10]. However, this frequency declines across generations, from 57% for foreign-born self-identified Hispanics to 49% for the second generation, and further reduces to 35% for the third or higher generation [3, 10].\n\nSelf-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry have significantly lower rates of participation, with only 15% often attending cultural celebrations [3].\n\nIn conclusion, self-identified Hispanics experience considerable changes in language dominance, parental encouragement to speak Spanish, and participation in cultural celebrations as generations advance. These shifts evince a pattern of assimilation into the English-speaking culture and decreased connection to their Hispanic cultural heritage over generations."}

According to the image, the energy consumption per capita in the USA, China, and Germany is as follows:\n\n- USA: 8080 kg oil equivalent\n- China: 597 kg oil equivalent\n- Germany: 4017 kg oil equivalent\n\nThis indicates that the USA has the highest energy consumption per capita among these three countries, followed by Germany and then China. This suggests that the USA might have higher CO2 emissions per capita compared to China and Germany.\n\nNext, let's look at motor vehicle ownership. Image3 is a bubble chart comparing various countries based on their percent share in global motor vehicles demand and motor vehicles per 1,000 people. The USA has a significantly larger bubble than both China and Germany, indicating a larger share in global demand and a higher number of motor vehicles per 1,000 people. China also has a larger bubble than Germany, indicating a larger share in global demand but fewer vehicles per 1,000 people.\n\nThis high energy consumption per capita and motor vehicle ownership in the USA suggest that it might have a more significant environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions compared to China and Germany. However, it's important to note that these are just two factors and other factors like the efficiency of vehicles and energy production methods also play a crucial role in determining the environmental impact.\n\nIn conclusion, among the USA, China, and Germany, the USA has the highest energy consumption per capita and motor vehicle ownership, suggesting a potentially larger environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions. However, other factors also need to be considered for a comprehensive comparison.\n\n![The USA has the highest energy consumption per capita and motor vehicle ownership among the USA, China, and Germany, suggesting a potentially larger environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions.](image2)(image3)"}

Both rural and urban households show similar ownership of radios, at 45.3% and 46.1% respectively. However, a more significant disparity exists in other technologies. Urban households have considerably higher television ownership (79.5%) compared to rural households (42.3%). Mobile phones are the most common technology owned, with an overwhelming 86% of people having access to one. Computers, on the other hand, are less common, with 10% household ownership.\n\nRegarding technology usage outside the household, the infographic in image1 reveals that 68% of people do not utilize any of the listed technologies outside their homes. The most popular technology used outside the home is the mobile phone, with 20% usage, followed by television at 11% and radio at 4%.\n\nRadio listening habits across different demographics can be better understood with the help of image3. This infographic shows that 76% of respondents listen to the radio via a radio set, while 40% use a mobile phone for this purpose. Rural and urban regions display slight differences, with rural residents preferring radio sets over mobile phones and urban residents showing a slightly higher preference for mobile phones. Gender-based data indicates a minor difference in mobile phone use, with males slightly more likely to use mobile phones to listen to the radio than females.\n\nTo address the user question directly:\n\nWhen comparing technology usage inside and outside the household, there is a clear trend of lower usage outside the home. Despite having similar radio ownership within their households, only 4% of people use the radio outside their homes, as shown in image1. Image2 illustrates that mobile phones are the most prevalent technology owned by both rural (84.3%) and urban (92.5%) households, while radio ownership is lower at 45%. This may indicate that people prefer using mobile phones for various purposes, including listening to the radio, even when alternative technologies like radio sets are available.\n\nIn conclusion, technology usage within the household and radio listening habits demonstrate some distinctions across various demographics. By examining images 1, 2, and 3, we observe that mobile phone ownership is high (image2), and a significant portion of radio listening occurs via mobile phones (image3). Despite similar radio ownership within households (image2), there is low usage of radio outside the household, with mobile phones being the preferred technology for this purpose outside the home (image1 and image3)."}

First, the text quote [1] mentions that due to the increasing popularity of data-based Internet, messaging, and voice services like IM, VoIP, etc., there has been less usage of SMS and voice calls. This shift in user behavior could contribute to the decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, as reflected in text quote [9] and image1.\n\nSecondly, the text quote [2] states that CDMA operators, including Telkomsel, managed to force GSM operators to reduce their tariffs. This price war might have been another factor that led to the decrease in ARPU for Telkomsel.\n\nIn conclusion, during 2013-2014, Telkomsel's subscriber base increased while its ARPU decreased. The growth in subscribers might be attributed to strategic partnerships and the rising popularity of Android devices, but the decline in ARPU can be linked to changes in user behavior (favoring data-based services) and the competitive pricing environment influenced by CDMA operators.\n\n`![Subscriber count increases while ARPU decreases in 2013-2014](image5)` `![Prepaid ARPU decrease from 2008-2012](image2)`"}

This indicates a growth in smartphone users for both Telkomsel and XL during this period.\n\nAs for ARPU trends, the line graph in image2 shows a decline in Voice ARPU and SMS ARPU for the period from 2013 to 2017. However, Mobile Data ARPU initially declines, reaching its lowest point around 2015, before rising again towards 2017. This suggests that while Voice and SMS revenues have been decreasing, Data ARPU has been compensating for this decline, especially from 2015 onwards.\n\nThe increase in smartphone users and changing ARPU trends might be influenced by several factors. Firstly, the shift towards data-based IM and VoIP services, as mentioned in quote [4], has led to less usage of SMS and voice calls, affecting the Voice and SMS ARPU. Consequently, this has resulted in reduced ARPU, as highlighted in quote [5]. Additionally, CDMA operators have been forcing GSM operators to lower their tariffs (quote [3]), which also impacts the ARPU negatively.\n\nMoreover, the price war initiated by the government, as mentioned in quote [9] and followed by rock-bottom tariffs (quote [10]), may have also contributed to the reduced ARPU. However, tariffs have likely stabilized now, ending the price war.\n\nLastly, the growth in smartphone users for both Telkomsel and XL, as seen in the bar charts (image3 and image4), shows that people are increasingly using smartphones for data-based services. This further supports the notion that the shift towards data-based IM, VoIP, and increased data consumption has influenced the ARPU trends for Telkomsel and XL between 2013 and 2014.\n\nTo sum up, the number of smartphone users for both Telkomsel and XL increased from 2013 to 2014, while the ARPU trends show a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, compensated by an upward trend in Data ARPU from 2015 onwards. These changes can be attributed to several factors, including the shift towards data-based services, price wars, and stabilized tariffs.\n\n![Number of smartphone users for Telkomsel and XL increased from 2013 to 2014](image3)\n![Decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, compensated by an upward trend in Data ARPU from 2015 onwards](image2)"}

The model, when using FLAN-T5-small as sub-task solvers, achieves comparable performance to the significantly larger FLAN-T5-XXL model (11B parameters) with end-to-end reasoning for 4-hop claims. This can be attributed to the high-level reasoning plan, which alleviates the demands on subsequent sub-task solvers.\n\nDespite its advantages, ProgramFC encounters a higher computational cost than baseline end-to-end fact-checking models, approximately 4-5x, as it involves calling large language models for program generation and multiple sub-task models.

However, ProgramFC excels in generating explicit reasoning programs, which improves interpretability and debugging, unlike end-to-end models (quote [6]).\n\nIn terms of error types, quote [5] highlights that, as the complexity of the claims increases, semantic errors become more prevalent, especially structural errors that involve generating appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for long-chain inference tasks. The proportions of these error types across different hops for HOVER and FEVEROUS datasets are detailed in image3. It's important to note that there are no syntax errors in any of the hops, and the number of incorrect executions decreases as the hop count increases, which suggests models perform better with increased complexity to some extent.\n\nFor instance, consider the example from image5, where a claim about the location of Emery is broken down into a sequence of questions, verification steps, and a final prediction.

Among the tested models, InstructGPT-CoT tends to perform best for complex-claim fact-checking, while ProgramFC excels in generating explicit reasoning programs, which improves interpretability.

As more knowledge is removed, **precision** (blue line with circle markers) increases significantly, starting around 14 and reaching about 26. **Recall** (orange line with diamond markers) remains relatively stable, starting around 14 and ending slightly below 15. **F1-Score** (green line with triangle markers) shows a moderate increase, starting around 14 and ending around 18. This indicates that the models' ability to identify absent knowledge improves as the number of removed knowledge elements increases, but the overall performance in correctly citing the knowledge decreases.\n\nRetrieval analysis, as shown in image5, evaluates generated texts using knowledge graphs. As retrieval accuracy decreases, **precision** (blue circles) decreases, while **recall** (orange curve) also decreases. **F1 Score** (green inverted triangles) follows a similar downward trend. **Correctness** (red triangles) starts high and slightly decreases. This suggests that the models' precision in citing the correct knowledge decreases as retrieval accuracy worsens, but their ability to recall the relevant knowledge remains relatively stable.\n\nThese changes imply that the models struggle to handle absent knowledge when retrieval accuracy is low, and their precision in citing the correct knowledge is more affected than their recall.

According to the data presented in image1, we can see that incorporating logical constraints generally leads to a decrease in logical inconsistency (LI) for all models. For instance, the Llama2-13B model shows a significant reduction in LI when logical constraints are used, both in the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. This trend is consistent across different conditions, including using all logical constraints and retrieved logical constraints.\n\nOn the other hand, post-processing also proves to be effective in reducing logical inconsistency. As shown in image1, post-processing leads to a LI of 0% for all models across both datasets. This suggests that post-processing can be a powerful tool for ensuring logically consistent outputs from LLM models.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while both methods are effective in reducing logical inconsistency, they may have different impacts on the overall performance of the models. For instance, as shown in image3, while post-processing leads to a LI of 0% for both Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, it does not necessarily lead to the highest Micro-F1 score. In fact, the highest Micro-F1 score for Vicuna-13B-PT on this dataset is achieved with CoT and logical constraints, not post-processing.\n\nIn conclusion, both logical constraints and post-processing can be effective in reducing logical inconsistency in LLM models across the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. However, the choice between these methods may depend on the specific requirements of the task at hand, as they may have different impacts on the overall performance of the models.\n\n![Logical Constraints versus Post-processing in Reducing Logical Inconsistency](image1)\n![Case Study: Llama-2-13B Before and After Pre-Training](image2)\n![Performance of Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT with Different Methods](image3)\n![Evaluation of Different Models on Three Tasks](image4)\n![Impact of Logical Constraints and Demonstrations on Micro-F1 and Logical Inconsistency](image5)"}

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of RAG, its evolution, and its main components, as well as its downstream tasks and evaluation systems [2][4].\n\nIn the context of RAG, there are three stages of development: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG.

In the pre-processing stage, as depicted in image4(a), an image with multiple objects is first divided into separate bounding boxes for each object. These objects are then cropped and resized using an Image Encoder to create individual image embeddings.\n\nIn the embedding and retrieval stage (image4(b)), these image embeddings undergo a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search to determine possible labels for each bounding box. This process utilizes a memory storage system (Memory M) that contains the indexed image embeddings linked to relevant labels.\n\nWhen faced with more complex tasks, such as few-shot image classification, the multimodal retriever system employs ranking prompts to refine and identify the correct categories. Image1 illustrates this process, showing a ranking prompt example for Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan. The image on the left is the input image, while the right side displays a series of retrieved images, each with its own label. The sorted categories are then ranked based on their relevance to the input image, determining the top-k most likely correct class.\n\nIn zero-shot object recognition tasks, MLLMs (multi-label learning models) like the one depicted in image2, assist in accurate label selection. The table demonstrates the process using four rows as examples, highlighting the initially retrieved class names, with the correctly identified class names shown after reranking.\n\nTo further enhance recognition tasks, a two-part pipeline for the RAR process (image3) is implemented, combining multi-modal data retrieval and ranking processes. The Multimodal Retriever (a) follows these steps: image embeddings are extracted using an Image Encoder, stored and indexed in the Feature Index, and then compared to Memory ($\\mathcal{M}$). Utilizing k-NN, the Retrieving Process retrieves similar embeddings during the image-image and image-text retrieval.\n\nIn the Retrieving & Ranking (b) phase, categorical predictions are refined and ranked using MLLMs during the inference stage. The top-k categories with the highest similarity are then retrieved, and these categories are ranked to provide a final prediction.\n\nIn conclusion, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by leveraging pre-processing techniques, multimodal retrieval methods, and ranking prompts. This approach allows for more accurate recognition, especially in complex tasks such as few-shot image classification and zero-shot object recognition, as shown in image5 when comparing performance using datasets like Bird-200, Car-196, Dog-120, Flower-102, and Pet-37.

Cascading errors: Action generation relies entirely on the predicted goal, which may result in errors if the prediction is inaccurate.\n2. Reasoning about instructions: The model may struggle to account for intermediate trajectory constraints in instructions with specific constraints on the execution.\n\nTo further explore these factors, consider the following:\n\n- **Cascading errors**: Examine cases where the action generation's dependency on predicted goals fails. Identify the root causes of these errors, and investigate adding redundancy or alternative decision-making approaches.\n- **Reasoning about instructions**: Analyze instructions with execution constraints and observe how the model responds. Consider adding an instruction parsing module or additional constraints in the action generation component to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, 'Our Approach' shows improved performance on both the LANI and CHAI datasets in terms of Stop Distance and Task Completion.

The likely reason for this discrepancy is that News Crawl examples are individual sentences of 23 words on average, while Common Crawl examples are several sentences or 50 words on average.\n\nMoreover, [this table](image4) demonstrates that for certain tasks like CoLA and STS-B, the News Crawl dataset benefits the most from additional training data. This suggests that the influence of training data on the GLUE score can vary depending on the specific task and the nature of the dataset.\n\nIn conclusion, while increasing the amount of training data generally leads to better performance on the GLUE benchmark, as shown in [image5], the specific impact can differ based on the task and the dataset, as illustrated in [image1] and [image4]."}

Generally, more pretraining data leads to better performance on the GLUE benchmark, as shown in [image4](image4), which depicts a line graph with the amount of Common Crawl data (measured in tokens) on the x-axis and the average GLUE score on the y-axis. As the number of train data tokens increases, the average GLUE score also increases, indicating a positive correlation.\n\nWhen comparing modeling approaches, we see that the \"cloze\" and \"bilm\" methods have varying performance on different NLP tasks, and combining the two does not necessarily lead to improved performance. [Text quote 1](1) states that the cloze loss performs significantly better than the bilm loss, and their combination does not further enhance the performance. This finding implies that the learning signals between individual left and right context prediction tasks and center word prediction may not be complementary enough.\n\nFurthermore, [text quote 3](3) supports this observation by presenting a pretraining architecture based on a bidirectional transformer model designed to predict every token in the training data. The model, which uses a cloze-style objective to predict the center word given all left and right context, shows considerable improvements on the GLUE benchmark for pretraining on Common Crawl data.\n\nIn summary, the combination of increased pretraining data and the \"cloze\" modeling approach can significantly enhance performance on various NLP tasks. Using the \"cloze\" loss type for pretraining leads to better performance, and combining it with the \"bilm\" loss type does not further improve this result. Therefore, increasing pretraining data and using the \"cloze\" approach for modeling can effectively enhance performance on NLP tasks, as shown in [image4](image4) and explained by [text quote 1](1) and [text quote 3](3).\n\nIn conclusion, increasing pretraining data and employing the \"cloze\" modeling approach can significantly enhance performance on various NLP tasks.

This suggests that a-priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary for improving performance. However, it is interesting to note that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages can help increase BLEU scores, with a more significant increase observed when using pre-trained source language embeddings [6] (comparing the second and third columns). Additionally, as alignment between word embeddings helps increase BLEU scores for all three tasks in multilingual systems [7], it can ensure a more similar vector space for the model when training on multiple languages.\n\nAs an example, consider the translation from French (FR) to English (EN). With pre-trained embeddings, the BLEU score increases from 30.8 (unaligned) to 30.6 (aligned) [3]. However, the difference is not significant.\n\nOn the other hand, when applying pre-trained embeddings in multilingual systems, the gains are more substantial, as shown in Table 5 (cited in [7]). For instance, in the G L /P T translation pair, the BLEU score increases by the largest margin, indicating that a more similar vector space for the model allows it to learn more effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, while the alignment of word embeddings may not have a significant impact on BLEU scores, pre-training embeddings can help increase the BLEU scores in different language translation tasks. This effect is more pronounced in multilingual systems.\n\n`![Pre-training embeddings help increase BLEU scores, while alignment shows minor impact](image3)`"}

For more dissimilar language pairs like BE/RU, pre-training may result in a slight decrease [3].\n\nThe improvement from pre-training is more noticeable for language pairs with a larger gap in their baseline BLEU scores [8]. For instance, less similar languages, like RU → PT and HE → PT, initially have lower BLEU scores, allowing more room for improvement [8].\n\n![Pre-training improvements for various language pairs](image1)\n\nPre-training is particularly helpful in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating more grammatical and well-formed translations [7]. This effect can be observed in the translations from GL to EN [7]. The \"pre-align\" row (multi:pre-align) in the second image demonstrates more accurate translations than \"bi:std\" row (bi) for the same source text:\n\n- bi: `( laughter) around for ...`\n- multi:pre-align: `( laughter) Chris is a big lawyer who knows almost nothing about patent legislation and genetics`\n\nTraining set size plays a critical role in pre-training benefits. The gain in BLEU scores is more significant at smaller training set sizes [5]. This pattern can be seen in the image5's bottom graph, which highlights the improvement for each language pair (Pt→En, Tr→En, and Ru→En):\n\n![Impact of pre-training for different training set sizes](image5)\n\nLastly, a linguistic similarity between source and target languages could result in larger gains from pre-training. When translating into Portuguese, a more similar language, pre-training leads to improvements (image4, GL → EN). This is consistent with the main hypothesis that pre-training works better when the two languages have closer semantic neighborhoods [4].\n\nIn conclusion, pre-training enhances translation accuracy for various language pairs, particularly for low-frequency words and rarer vocabulary. The benefits of pre-training are more pronounced for language pairs with larger baseline BLEU score differences and smaller training set sizes. Additional linguistic similarity between source and target languages may also contribute to pre-training gains.\n\nPre-training benefits are evident in:\n- Improved BLEU scores for similar translation pairs\n- More accurate capturing of rarer vocabulary\n- Enhanced grammatical correctness in translations\n- Increased gains for smaller training set sizes\n\nThe specific effects of pre-training depend on the languages being translated and the size of the training dataset."}

This indicates that alignment can have a positive or negative impact on the translation quality, depending on the language pair.\n\nAdditionally, Image 2 displays a bar chart comparing F-measure scores of target words based on their frequency in the training corpus. Both \"std\" and \"pre\" F-measures increase with word frequency, and the \"pre\" (pre-trained) F-measure often outperforms the \"std\" (standard) F-measure in higher frequency ranges.

This impact is also visible when comparing the performance of GloVe with R-GCN and GloVe w/o R-GCN in image2, where the former significantly outperforms the latter.\n\nFurthermore, when relation types are not distinguished in the graph (No relation types in image1), the improvements compared to ELMo alone are marginal, suggesting that a GCN operating over a naive entity graph would not add much to the task. To further investigate the effect of different relations, testing the model with and without specific relation types (MATCH, DOC-BASED, COREF, and COMPLEMENT) is performed in image1. The results show that removing MATCH and DOC-BASED connections has a greater impact in the masked condition, while removing COREF and COMPLEMENT connections has a more significant effect in the unmasked condition.\n\nLastly, removing edges and their labels by replacing them with a model component that predicts them (Induced edges in image1) results in a performance drop compared to the 'No R-GCN' configuration. This suggests that the model cannot learn coreference dependencies on its own without these predetermined dependencies.\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types (e.g., MATCH, COREF) can have a substantial impact on a model's performance, particularly in distinguishing between unmasked and masked conditions. Careful consideration should be given when choosing which components to include in a model's architecture.\n\n![Performance drop after removing R-GCN](image1)\n![Comparison of different models](image2)"}

When inspecting samples where our model fails, we noticed two principal sources of failure: a mismatch between what is written in Wikipedia and what is annotated in Wikidata, and a different degree of granularity [4].\n\nNow, let's look at how different types of relations affect the performance of Entity-GCN. The R-GCN module processes various relations in the entity graph, and the following ablation experiment helps us understand their impact. The model makes better use of document-based connections (DOC-BASED) than match or coreference connections [6]. This is because most connections are between mentions in the same document, and without connecting mentions within the same document, important information is removed since the model is unaware they appear closely in the document [6].\n\nHowever, coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role. Though it may be surprising for coreference edges, recall that the match heuristic already captures the easiest coreference cases, and for the rest, the out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable [6].\n\nIn this table, we compare different models or configurations on some task, possibly related to natural language processing or machine learning. In the 'unmasked' and 'masked' columns, we find the corresponding values of performance metrics, possibly accuracy or F1 score, related to GloVe, R-GCN, and different components like MATCH, COREF [2].\n\n`![Entity-GCN with coreference outperforms Entity-GCN without coreference in the masked setting on the development set, while Entity-GCN without coreference performs better in the unmasked setting](image2)`\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of coreference information impacts the performance of Entity-GCN models in an ambivalent manner depending on the data setting.

This is evident as noticeable improvements in accuracy and Macro-F1 scores are seen when combining the components (see settings 1-3 versus 4-6 in image2).\n\nIn terms of trends observed when varying the percentage of document-level training examples, the table in image3 indicates that as the percentage of document-level training examples increases, the accuracy and Macro-F1 scores for all four models (D1, D2, D3, and D4) tend to improve when using the PRET + MULT method. This method consistently achieves high accuracy scores and the best Macro-F1 scores for D4 (image3 and image4).\n\nUltimately, the inclusion of different components and varying the percentage of document-level training examples leads to different performance outcomes. The Ours: PRET+MULT method frequently outperforms other methods in terms of Macro-F1 scores across all datasets, particularly when provided with a sufficient percentage of document-level training examples, as shown in image4 and image3.\n\nIn summary, integrating various components in the model and adjusting the percentage of document-level training examples influences the overall performance, with the Ours: PRET+MULT method being a top-performing choice when adequate document-level training examples are utilized."}

GEM, or Gradient Episodic Memory, keeps a small number of samples from the source domains and applies a constraint on the gradient to prevent the loss on the stored samples from increasing during the training process. This method has been shown to outperform EWC and naive fine-tuning in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting when pre-training followed by fine-tuning on a single domain [6, 9].\n\nEWC, or Elastic Weight Consolidation, uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer for adapting to the target domain data. This matrix is approximated using samples from the source domain [4, 8].\n\nOn the other hand, slot similarities can also affect performance. If slots have learned similar embeddings due to sharing similar or correlated values, it can impact the model's ability to differentiate between them. For example, in the MultiWOZ dataset, \"destination\" and \"departure\" or \"price range\" and \"stars\" show high correlation, suggesting that these pairs typically have related or shared attributes [5]. This correlation can lead to increased error rates in certain slots, such as \"restaurant-name\" having the highest error rate at 8.50% and \"taxi-arriveby\" recording the lowest error rate at 1.33% [4].\n\nTo summarize, GEM and EWC are both effective fine-tuning strategies for adapting a model to new domain data. Slot similarities, however, can affect performance by making it more difficult for the model to differentiate between slots with shared or correlated values.\n\n- GEM outperforms EWC in overcoming catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, as demonstrated in Table 3 [9].\n- EWC uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer for adapting to the target domain data [4, 8].\n- Slot similarities based on shared or correlated values can impact performance, as shown in the error rates for the MultiWOZ dataset slots in image4 [4].\n- The cosine similarity between pairs of slot embeddings illustrates the correlation between them in the MultiWOZ dataset [5].\n\n![GEM outperforms EWC in fine-tuning](image3)\n![Slot similarities and their impact on multiWOZ dataset](image5)"}

The analysis utilizes two recent coreference resolution datasets and an automatic gender bias evaluation method based on morphological analysis for eight target languages with grammatical gender.\n\nThe study reveals that all tested systems are significantly prone to gender-biased translation errors for all tested target languages. A challenge set and evaluation protocol for the analysis of gender bias in machine translation has been presented, and the data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/gabrielStanovsky/mt_gender.\n\nThe translation accuracy is evaluated using the overall gender accuracy ($Acc$) percentage and two differences: $\\Delta_G$ (indicating a specific type of change in the output, possibly related to grammatical or structural accuracy) and $\\Delta_S$ (representing another type of change, possibly related to semantic or syntactic accuracy).\n\nWhen it comes to gender bias, the differences in performance ($F_1$ score) between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical gender role assignments $\\Delta_S$ reveal higher numbers for most MT systems, indicating a stronger bias (Table 2, with bold indicating the best accuracy for the language across MT systems and underlined numbers indicating the best accuracy for each MT system across languages).\n\nIn terms of translation accuracy, most tested systems across eight tested languages perform poorly in preserving the gender of the entity from the original English sentence. The performance varies noticeably between languages, with three out of four systems achieving better performance on German translations, possibly due to the language's similarity to English.\n\nTo visually represent Google Translate's performance on gender translation, a bar chart (image3) displays the accuracy for stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations for various languages. The chart illustrates that the accuracy for stereotypical translations is consistently higher than non-stereotypical translations for all tested languages.\n\nAfter investigating translation accuracy and gender bias across various machine translation systems and languages, it has been determined that all tested systems exhibit gender bias, and most systems struggle with preserving gender in the translation, particularly for non-stereotypical gender roles.\n\n**To summarize, the translation accuracy and gender bias vary noticeably across different machine translation systems and languages, with most systems displaying stronger biases in gender role assignments and poor performance in retaining gender in non-stereotypical translations.**\n\n- **Translation Accuracy & Gender Bias**: ![Varying translation accuracy and gender bias across different machine translation systems and languages](image3)\n- **Detailed Metrics**: [Refer to the research paper's Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 (image1, image4) for more detailed information on translation services' performance.]\n- **Stereotypical vs Non-Stereotypical**: The chart illustrates the differences in translation accuracy between stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations using Google Translate across various languages.

This is evident in the results of an experiment where stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations were tested across eight languages (Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, and German) using Google Translate. The chart below (image1) shows the accuracy of gender translation for both stereotypical and non-stereotypical translations in these languages:\n\n![The image shows a bar chart with the title 'Comparison of Stereotypical and Non-Stereotypical Translations across Languages' displaying the accuracy of Google Translate's performance on gender translation for different languages.](image1)\n\nAs shown in the chart, the accuracy for stereotypical translations is consistently higher across all tested languages compared to non-stereotypical translations. For example, in Spanish translations, the stereotypical translations have an accuracy of 67%, while the non-stereotypical translations have an accuracy of 46%. This trend holds true for all other languages as well.\n\nMoreover, the text quotes also provide evidence of the impact of stereotype-based adjustments on gender bias accuracy. According to quote [8], adding stereotypical gender adjectives such as \"handsome\" and \"pretty\" to male and female entities, improved performance in some languages. This resulted in a significant reduction in bias in Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian (see Table 4 in Quote 8).\n\nIn conclusion, stereotype-based adjustments in machine translation can have varying impacts on gender bias accuracy across different languages. While these adjustments can improve gender bias accuracy in some languages, such as Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, they can still result in lower accuracy for non-stereotypical translations across all tested languages.

[1] states that the F1 score of a single-paragraph BERT model only degrades about 15 points when reducing a question to its first five tokens, indicating that the model is still able to perform reasonably well on questions that are missing critical information. This suggests that the way in which a model is trained can impact its ability to handle missing information in multi-hop and single-hop questions.\n\n[3] further states that question compositionality alone is not a sufficient condition for multi-hop reasoning, and that future datasets must carefully consider what evidence they provide in order to ensure that multi-hop reasoning is required. This suggests that the type of evidence provided during training can impact a model's ability to perform multi-hop reasoning.\n\n[4] provides more detail on the impact of the type of evidence provided during training. The authors found that when stronger distractors were used, 35% of bridge questions became multi-hop questions, indicating that the type of distractors used during training can impact whether a question is classified as multi-hop or single-hop.\n\n[5] states that the single-hop model struggles in the open-domain setting, and that this is largely due to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions. This suggests that the retrieval method used during training can impact a model's ability to perform on open-domain multi-hop and single-hop questions.\n\n[6] describes an experiment in which the initial list of 50 paragraphs was filtered to only include ones whose entity type matched that of the gold paragraphs. This helped to eliminate the entity type bias and led to an increase in the model's accuracy. This suggests that the way in which the training data is filtered can impact a model's performance.\n\n[7] states that many comparison questions are multi-hop or context-dependent multi-hop, and that single-paragraph BERT achieves near chance accuracy on these types of questions. This suggests that the type of question being asked can also impact a model's performance.\n\nNow, let's turn to the image quotes. The first image, ![A table presenting F1 scores for different models under two evaluation settings: Distractor and Open.](image1), shows variations in performance across different models and evaluation settings. The model with the highest Distractor F1 score is DecompRC (69.63), while the model with the highest Open F1 score is Cognitive Graph (48.87). This suggests that the evaluation setting (Distractor or Open) can impact a model's performance.\n\nThe second image, ![A table displaying F1 scores for various settings related to a task, presumably in the context of natural language processing or machine learning, judging by the terms used.](image2), shows how different experimental scenarios or configurations impact the F1 score. The \"Distractor\" setting has the highest F1 score (67.08), while the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting has a lower F1 score (39.12). When a \"Gold Paragraph\" is added to the \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" setting, the F1 score improves significantly to 53.12. This suggests that the amount and type of evidence provided during evaluation can impact a model's performance.\n\nThe third image, ![The table contains four columns with the following headers: Type, Question, %, and F1.](image3), provides more detail on the performance of a model on specific types of questions. The F1 score for multi-hop questions is 54.46, while the F1 score for single-hop questions is 70.54. This suggests that the type of question being asked can impact a model's performance.\n\nThe fourth image, ![The table shows a comparison of performance metrics (scores) for different combinations of evaluation and training data.](image4), compares the performance of a model trained on different types of data and evaluated on different types of data. When the evaluation data is \"Original,\" the score is 67.08 for \"Original\" training data and 59.12 for \"Adversarial\" training data. This suggests that the type of training data can impact a model's ability to generalize to different types of evaluation data.\n\nIn conclusion, the way in which a model is trained, the type of evidence provided during training and evaluation, the retrieval method used during training, the way in which the training data is filtered, and the type of question being asked can all impact a model's ability to perform multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. Specifically, the F1 score can vary depending on the evaluation setting, the amount and type of evidence provided, the type of question being asked, and the type of training data. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider these factors when training and evaluating models for multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks."}

In the adversarial scenario, BERT's maximum test set accuracy decreases to 53%, with mean and median accuracies at 50%, compared to its original performance on the ARCT dataset.\n\nThis substantial reduction in performance indicates that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminates the previously exploited statistical cues, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension. The BERT model, when faced with little to no understanding of the underlying reality of these arguments, cannot achieve good performance—as observed in the random accuracy reached on the adversarial dataset.\n\nThe authors in [8] find it surprising that BERT's peak performance only reaches three points below the average untrained human baseline on the original ARCT dataset. However, as shown, this result is attributable to the model exploiting spurious statistical cues. By analyzing the cues and constructing an adversarial dataset, the authors demonstrate that all models perform randomly, making the adversarial dataset a more reliable tool to assess argument comprehension in this context.\n\nOverall, the adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT, as it provides a more robust evaluation and reveals important insights about the limitations and susceptibility of models to exploit spurious statistical cues in argument comprehension tasks.\n\nInsights from the images:\n\n- The table in image4 displays a performance comparison of different BERT models. In the adversarial setting, BERT models' performance decreases, as indicated by lower metric values.\n- Image5 shows the test performance of various models, including BERT and its configurations. As observed, BERT's performance significantly deteriorates in the adversarial setup compared to its performance on other models and configurations.\n\nConclusion: The adversarial data setup substantially reduces BERT models' performance on the ARCT dataset, highlighting that machine comprehension models may still depend on statistical cues and underlining the necessity of robust testing, such as using adversarial datasets."}

This is evident in image1, which showcases the performance of various decoding methods in the COMET framework, evaluated against a human baseline on the ATOMIC dataset.\n\nOn the other hand, the model's metrics are affected by variations in training data percentages. By using different percentages of the available training data, one can still achieve coherent, adequate, and novel generations. When only 10% of the available training data is used, the model can generate knowledge that is comparable to using 100% of the training data with pre-trained weights. This demonstrates the efﬁciency of learning from seed tuples. More detailed results on the effect of varying the amount of training data can be found in image3.\n\nIn conclusion, while greedy decoding demonstrates the best performance among automated methods, it does not reach the performance level of human validation.

This suggests that the COMET model is highly confident in its predictions and generates high-quality knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the COMET model is able to generate novel tuples, which is an important aspect for completing knowledge graphs. As the edit distance between training tuples and novel tuples increases, the classifier's accuracy remains high, close to 100%, but slightly decreases as the edit distance increases [image2]. This implies that the COMET model is capable of generating new, relevant, and accurate tuples that can extend the size of the knowledge graph.\n\nTo evaluate the quality of generated knowledge, a pre-trained Bilinear AVG model is used [5]. This model achieved 92.5% accuracy on the test set, indicating that it is a strong proxy for automatically evaluating whether a generated tuple is correct. On the completion task, the COMET model achieves up to 91.7% precision at top 1 [3].

For closed vocabulary models, such as word-only models, the sensitivity is generally lower, but the WER can vary. On the other hand, open vocabulary models, like char-only, word+char, and word-piece models, tend to have higher sensitivity, especially in pass-through versions, as they treat every unique combination of characters differently.\n\nAs seen in image2, the closed vocabulary models (word-only) have lower sensitivity values compared to open vocabulary models (char/word+char/word-piece) for both pass-through, background, and neutral backoff strategies. The average sensitivity values for closed vocabulary models range from 17.5 to 19.7, while open vocabulary models range from 30.3 to 39.6. This difference can be attributed to the way these models internally handle out-of-vocabulary words.\n\nHowever, the WER values for closed and open vocabulary models can vary. Image4 illustrates a scatter plot demonstrating the relationship between sensitivity and WER for both word-only and char-only models. Here, we observe that for certain backoff strategies (Pass-through or Background), char-only models have a higher WER compared to word-only models. Nonetheless, in the Neutral backoff strategy, both word-only and char-only models have similar WER values. The bubble sizes in these plots represent robustness, which can be inferred to be related to the WER.\n\nTo elaborate on the relationship between error rates and sensitivity, let's consider image10. In the context of backoff strategies, a trade-off between WER and sensitivity can be observed. While an extremely low WER can sometimes be achieved by a model, it generally comes at the cost of higher sensitivity, as illustrated in figure2.\n\nLastly, image5 displays a table with various spell-correction methods and their performance against different types of spelling errors (Swap, Drop, Add, Key, and All). This further exemplifies the impact of different types of spelling errors and backoff strategies on the performance of the models, as seen in the text quotes as well.\n\nIn conclusion, sensitivity and WER differ between closed and open vocabulary models under various backoff strategies. While closed vocabulary models generally have lower sensitivity, open vocabulary models' sensitivity values can be substantially higher. The WER values, however, can change depending on the specific model type and backoff strategy used."}

However, in order to make the evaluation asymmetric and comparable with human assessments, the sign of error metrics' scores is reversed, as highlighted in quote [10]. Nevertheless, YiSi-1 and YiSi-1_srl still maintain their high performance and correlation with human assessments.\n\nRegarding image1, which showcases heatmaps for system-level metric significance test results, we can see that YiSi-1 (represented under various names due to different orientations of error metrics) displays green cells in multiple comparisons with other metrics, indicating its higher correlation in connection with human judgments. However, these heatmaps do not provide a comprehensive comparison across all language pairs.\n\nLastly, the mention of [YiSi-1](http://image2) in image2 does not contain correlation scores, but it does indicate that YiSi-1 measures the semantic similarity between machine translations and human references, further supporting its strong performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the YiSi-1 metric and its variant YiSi-1_srl generally show the highest correlation with human assessment across the most language pairs in the newstest2019 dataset."}

This increase can be attributed to various factors in different segments of the company.\n\nIn the \"Insurance and Other\" segment, liabilities grew by approximately $5,488 million due to increased unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity, and health insurance benefits, and other policyholder liabilities. Additionally, a $3,948 million rise in notes payable and other borrowings led to a higher total insurance and other liabilities for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe \"Railroad, Utilities, and Energy\" segment experienced an increase of $1,828 million in liabilities, which was mainly due to the surge in notes payable and other borrowings, and regulatory liabilities.\n\nMoreover, the company reported an increase in income taxes, principally deferred, by about $16,150 million from 2020 to 2021.\n\nRegarding shareholders' equity, it jumped by approximately $63,000 million, reaching $506,203 million at the end of 2021 – up from $443,203 million in the previous year. This growth can be broken down into two main components. Markedly, net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders enlarged by approximately $89,800 million year-over-year.

This decline can be attributed to several factors, primarily falling under \"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax.\"\n\nIn 2020, there were three significant contributors to this category:\n\n1. **Foreign currency translation adjustments**: The company experienced a loss of $46.0 million in 2020, compared to a gain of $127.5 million in 2019 and a loss of $453.6 million in 2018. This change resulted in a $17.1 million tax benefit in 2020.\n\n2. **Cash flow hedges**: McDonald's recognized a loss of $129.1 million in 2020, whereas in 2019 and 2018, it recognized a gain of $17.3 million and $46.5 million respectively. This change resulted in a $5.8 million tax expense in 2020.\n\n3. **Defined benefit pension plans**: The company recorded a loss of $43.5 million in 2020, which was worse than the losses in 2019 ($24.5 million) and 2018 ($27.0 million).

There were several adjustments applying to different segments:\n\n- **Amortization of intangible assets**: $236 million. This adjustment increased the operating income, leading to a core result of $2,064 million (image3).\n- **Impairments**: $34 million.

Comprehensive income, attributable to Accenture PLC, increased from $3,578,520 in 2018 to $5,386,579 in 2020, demonstrating a general growth trend. This increase in comprehensive income was driven by a rise in net income and other comprehensive income components.\n\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax, includes foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, cash flow hedges, and investments. From 2018 to 2020, the total other comprehensive income, net of tax, shifted from a negative value (-$481,387 in 2018) to a positive value ($278,740 in 2020). This change was mainly due to the foreign currency translation component, which turned from a negative figure in 2018 to a positive value in 2020.\n\nThe changes in comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components have influenced the overall shareholders' equity trends in Accenture. In 2020, shareholders' equity attributable to Accenture PLC was $17,499,173, as shown in image5, which depicts changes in Accenture plc Shareholders’ Equity. This value reflects the effect of comprehensive income on total shareholders' equity. Furthermore, other comprehensive income components like foreign currency translation, defined benefit plans, and cash flow hedges directly impacted total shareholders' equity through other comprehensive income, net of tax. Therefore, the changes in these components affected the equity allocations between Accenture PLC and noncontrolling interests during the fiscal years 2018 to 2020.\n\nTo summarize, Accenture's comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components showed variable trends over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, with a gradual increase in comprehensive income and a shift from negative to positive values in other comprehensive income. These changes influenced Accenture's shareholders' equity trends, as comprehensive income directly affects total shareholders' equity, and other comprehensive income components impact designated equity allocations between Accenture PLC and noncontrolling interests.\n\n![Accenture PLC displayed a growth trend in comprehensive income and other comprehensive income components during fiscal years 2018 to 2020, with changes influencing shareholders' equity trends](image4)"}

This has affected the net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. Let's examine the changes in different asset categories.\n\nFirst, we consider intangible assets. In 2020, a total impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized, mostly related to patents and licences (DKK 350 million). This amount was recognized in research and development costs, which predominantly comprises employee costs, execution costs, manufacturing costs, facility costs, amortization, depreciation, and impairment losses related to software and property, plant, and equipment used in the research and development activities. Impairment losses recognized on intangible assets not yet available for use related to research and development projects are presented in research and development costs.\n\nWhen it comes to property, plant, and equipment, the carrying amount is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (buildings: 12-50 years, plant and machinery: 5-25 years, and other equipment: 3-10 years). Plant and equipment with no alternative use developed as part of a research and development project are expensed; otherwise, they are capitalised and depreciated.\n\nThe following image summarizes the changes in property, plant, and equipment from 2019 to 2020:\n\n![An increase in balance from 2019 to 2020 in property, plant, and equipment, despite depreciation.](image2)\n\nIn conclusion, despite the increase in depreciation and impairment losses from DKK 4,192 million in 2019 to DKK 4,307 million in 2020, there was still an increase in net carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as observed in image4 and the above table.

KG; income tax payments had an offsetting effect.\n\nTo summarize, the total equity of Siemens Healthineers AG increased by €3,828 million and cash flows from operating activities grew by €1,005 million from 2020 to 2021.\n\n![Total equity increased by €3,828 million from 2020 to 2021](image5)\n![Cash flows from operating activities grew by €1,005 million from 2020 to 2021](image4)"}

The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) considered the impact of climate change on the Group's greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and scenarios, including those aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. This included the potential impact on impairment assessments, the expected timing and cost of closure activities, and how these factors are reflected in the Group's key judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the Group's FY2021 finance statements. The RAC confirmed that the 2021 Annual Report, which includes this information, is fair, balanced, and understandable (image3, image8).\n\nIn terms of director training, BHP has a comprehensive approach to training and developing its Directors. In FY2021, the company held briefings and development sessions on climate change, innovation, technology, and Health, Safety, Environment, and Community (HSEC) considerations, among others. Additionally, Directors participated in site visits to various assets and operations, which allowed them to gain a deeper understanding of the activities, environment, key issues, and direction of the assets, as well as HSEC and public policy considerations. Due to COVID-19, some site visits were held virtually, but physical visits were conducted where possible (image5).\n\nAs part of BHP's succession planning and appointment process, the Nomination and Governance Committee considers diversity, size, tenure, skills, experience, and the attributes necessary for effective governance and risk management, including climate change considerations. This process includes outlining role descriptions, selecting search firms, conducting interviews, performing background checks, and issuing letters of appointment detailing the terms for Non-executive Directors (image1, image4).\n\nIn conclusion, BHP's governance framework addresses climate change risks through dedicated financial statement disclosures, risk management oversight, and monitoring. Director training is addressed through comprehensive briefings, development sessions, and site visits. This approach enables BHP to manage climate change risks effectively and maintain a well-informed and skilled Board of Directors."}

The cost per pound also decreased slightly to $1.00 in FY2021 from $1.01 in FY2020. This positive trend can be attributed to improved concentrator throughput, lower deferred stripping costs, and higher by-product credits [8](image5). \n\nSimilarly, WAIO experienced a substantial increase in revenue and underlying EBITDA, reaching $34,337M and $26,270M in FY2021, compared to $20,663M and $14,508M in FY2020. The cost per tonne slightly increased to $14.82 in FY2021 from $12.63 in FY2020, but this was relatively insignificant considering the overall increase in revenue [2](image2).\n\nNow, let's examine the impact of commodity price changes on their financial performance. Commodity prices can significantly influence profitability. For instance, a US$1 per ton increase in the iron ore price impacts profit after taxation by $163 million and underlying EBITDA by $233 million [1](image1). Given the increase in average realized prices for iron ore from $77.36 in 2020 to $130.56 in 2021 [3](image3), it is reasonable to infer that this price increase had a substantial positive impact on WAIO's financial performance in FY2021.\n\nIn conclusion, both Escondida and WAIO reported improved financial and production metrics in FY2021, with commodity price changes, particularly the increase in iron ore prices, positively influencing their financial performance.\n\n![Improved financial and production metrics for Escondida and WAIO in FY2021, with commodity price changes positively impacting their financial performance](image5) ![Revenue, underlying EBITDA, and average iron ore prices increased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image3) ![Impact of commodity price changes on profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA](image1)"}

The discount rate, which significantly affects the defined benefit plans, has decreased slightly from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 in Germany and remained the same (2.4% to 2.4%) in the United States.\n\nNow, let's move on to the actuarial assumptions:\n\n**Actuarial Assumptions:**\n\nFor Germany, the assumptions used are the Siemens-specific tables Siemens Bio 2017/2021 and Siemens Bio 2017/2020 for 2021 and 2020 respectively, based on data from the German Siemens population and the Federal Statistical Office in Germany [image5].

There was a slight decrease in the discount rate for Germany for fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, but it remained unchanged in the United States.\n\nFor actuarial assumptions, there isn't adequate data comparing Germany and the United States directly. Additionally, specific information regarding the actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans in the United States isn't provided.\n\nIn conclusion, while the slight decrease in the discount rate in Germany and a stable discount rate in the United States between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are noticeable, we cannot establish a comprehensive comparison of the actuarial assumptions affecting the defined benefit plans between the two countries due to insufficient data.\n\n**Answer**: While the discount rate marginally decreased in Germany for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we can't directly compare the actuarial assumptions for Germany and the United States due to a lack of specific information."}

In 2020, the GBM division reported a net operating income of $15,303 million, compared to $14,869 million in 2019, representing a $434 million (3%) increase [image3]. However, the profit before tax decreased by $342 million (7%) in 2020, from $5,172 million in 2019 to $4,830 million [image3]. This decrease in profit before tax can be attributed to a few factors, primarily the significant increase in expected credit losses and other impairment charges. There was a $(1,056) million (>200%) increase in change in expected credit losses and other impairment charges in 2020 compared to 2019 [image3].\n\nDespite these challenges, the GBM division managed to achieve these figures with a decrease in RWAs (Risk-Weighted Assets) and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR) [1]. Unfortunately, the overall financial performance of the bank deteriorated in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant reduction in global interest rates [5][6].\n\nTo summarize, the GBM division's net operating income increased by 3% from 2019 to 2020, but profit before tax decreased by 7% during the same period due to higher expected credit losses and other impairment charges directly related to the impact of the pandemic [2][10].\n\n![An increase of $434 million (3%) in net operating income between 2019 and 2020](image3) ![A decrease of $342 million (7%) in profit before tax between 2019 and 2020](image3)"}

This commitment is part of a larger initiative to create a \"harmonious society\" and engage in \"community co-creation\" aimed at achieving the SDGs. Towards this end, Toyota has implemented several initiatives in different regions to support the development of its female employees.\n\nAt Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA (TME) in Belgium, for example, the company supports working couples through home-working, part-time regimes, and employment support for spouses. TME also promotes gender diversity through networking, mentorship and sponsorship systems, and active hiring of promising female candidates. Additionally, the company has set targets for employment and management positions, and provides training in unconscious bias.\n\nToyota Motor (China) Investment Co., Ltd. (TMCI) supports lactating female employees by allowing a breastfeeding break of up to one hour each day. Meanwhile, Toyota South Africa Motors (Pty) Ltd. (TSAM) has implemented leadership workshops to ensure acceptance and promotion of women in the workplace, and has set employment targets.\n\nThese initiatives are part of Toyota's broader commitment to creating a work environment that supports the development and advancement of all employees, regardless of gender. As stated in the Toyota Philosophy, the company's mission is \"Producing Happiness for All\" through corporate activities that promote the physical and mental health and safety of all employees, suppliers, and in-plant contractors.\n\nToyota also seeks to recruit and train employees who possess both the ability to act and empathy, and works to ensure the placement of the right person in the right position, regardless of nationality, gender, year of joining Toyota, form of recruitment, academic background, job type, and other factors. The company encourages its employees to reexamine their workstyles and hone their individual abilities, thereby enhancing the workplace structures.\n\nIn summary, Toyota supports female employee participation and diversity across its global operations through a variety of initiatives, including home-working, part-time regimes, leadership workshops, and employment targets.

This includes considering unforeseen departures and replacing current Board members, focusing on diversity, size, tenure, skills, experience, and the attributes necessary for effective governance and risk management within BHP [2]. The succession planning process is continuous, with a nine-year tenure as a guide for Non-executive Directors. The Board aims to maintain a balance between experience and new perspectives and ensure that the Board is equipped to adapt to changing external factors and BHP's specific circumstances [2].\n\nFor new appointments, the Nomination and Governance Committee outlines a role description, incorporating criteria and attributes specified in the Board Governance Document and section 2.1.7. An external search firm is selected to carry out a global search based on this role description [3]. The Board, supported by external consultants, performs background and reference checks on the candidate. Once a candidate is selected, a letter of appointment is produced, detailing the terms for Non-executive Directors [3].\n\nIn terms of director development, BHP provides briefings and development sessions to provide each Director with a deeper understanding of the activities, environment, key issues, and direction of the assets, along with HSEC (Health, Safety, Environment, and Community) and public policy considerations [1].

Let's analyze these changes in detail to understand their impact on the overall capital structure.\n\nFirst, let's examine the changes in Credit Risk RWA, which is a significant component of the Risk-Weighted Assets. Between 2019 and 2020:\n\n- Credit Risk RWA (Standardized) increased from $342,684 million to $387,066 million, a growth of $44,382 million.\n- Credit Risk RWA (Advanced) increased from $228,927 million to $284,930 million, an increase of $56,003 million.\n\nThese increases were primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures, Market volatility, Lending commitments, and Equity investments.\n\nNow, let's look at the changes in External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets:\n\n- At the end of 2019, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA was 49.9%.\n- At the end of 2020, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased slightly to 47.7%, despite the nominal increase in External TLAC from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020.\n\nThe reduced External TLAC as a percentage of RWA in 2020 signifies that, although the bank's total RWA has risen, they have been able to maintain a relatively stable TLAC to RWA ratio compared to the previous year. Moreover, the TLAC ratio still exceeds the regulatory requirement by a considerable margin.\n\nOverall, the bank experienced growth in Credit Risk RWA driven by various factors, while the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA slightly decreased. This implies that the bank has managed to maintain a healthy capital structure despite the increased RWA and higher credit risk exposures. However, it is essential to continually monitor and manage these risks to maintain long-term financial stability.\n\nIn summary, the bank's Credit Risk RWA increased in 2020 compared to 2019, but the External TLAC as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets slightly decreased, allowing the bank to maintain a relatively stable capital structure."}

This decline in interest income can be attributed to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, primarily due to the decrease in short-term interest rates that persisted throughout 2021 [6].\n\nOn the other hand, dividend income increased by 3.5% from 2020 to 2021, amounting to $5,060 million [2][10]. The increase in dividend income is primarily due to higher dividends from Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the investment in Occidental preferred stock [4].\n\nIn terms of asset composition, the table in image1 shows that the insurance business had a higher total in most categories of assets as of December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020:\n\n- Cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills: increased from $67,082 thousand to $90,688 thousand.\n- Equity securities: increased from $269,498 thousand to $334,907 thousand.\n- Fixed maturity securities: decreased from $20,317 thousand to $16,386 thousand.\n\nThe increase in cash holdings and equity securities might suggest that the insurance business is maintaining a larger liquidity buffer, while also having a higher exposure to equity markets. However, the decline in fixed maturity securities might indicate a shift towards other investment opportunities with potentially better returns or risk profiles.\n\nIn conclusion, the net investment income of the insurance business decreased by 5.0% from 2020 to 2021 due to reduced interest and other investment income. Nevertheless, dividend income increased during the same period. Moreover, the insurance business experienced growth in most asset categories compared to the previous year, implying changes in investment strategies and liquidity management."}

However, the credit worthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument, and other general market conditions can also affect the fair values of these contracts.\n\nNow let's analyze the differences in non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn 2020, non-U.S. denominated debt had a negative effect on net earnings, totaling $(764) million.

The cash inflow from this issuance is reflected in image1 under Cash Flows from Financing Activities. A value of $1,667 million is recorded as the net cash from the issuance of shares in 2020.\n\nLater in 2020, the company redeemed preferred shares, which decreased shareholders' equity and utilized cash. The redemption of preferred shares is reflected in the decrease of issued and outstanding preferred shares from 2,000 in 2020 to 0 in 2021 in image3. The cash outflow from this redemption is also shown in image1 under Cash Flows from Financing Activities. A value of $(1,666) million is recorded as the net cash used in the redemption of shares in 2020, which is the opposite value of the issuance recorded earlier in the year.\n\nIn 2021, the company again issued preferred shares, which brought in capital and increased shareholders' equity. This can be observed in image3 with the number of issued and outstanding preferred shares being 1,600 in 2021, compared to 0 in 2020. The cash inflow from this issuance is reflected in image1 under Cash Flows from Financing Activities. A value of $1,667 million is recorded as the net cash from the issuance of shares in 2021. No redemption of preferred shares occurred in 2021.\n\nTo summarize, the issuance and redemption of preferred shares had the following impact on cash flows and shareholders' equity:\n\n- 2020: The issuance of preferred shares increased shareholders' equity and resulted in a net cash inflow. The redemption of preferred shares decreased shareholders' equity and resulted in a net cash outflow.\n- 2021: The issuance of preferred shares increased shareholders' equity and resulted in a net cash inflow. There was no redemption of preferred shares, so no impact on cash flows.\n\nThis information is presented and evidenced by combining text quotes [1], [2], [3], and image1, image3 in a cohesive and interleaved format."}

In 2021, Chevron Corporation paid out $6,731 million in cash dividends [4], reducing the overall cash balance. However, this reduction in cash does not directly affect the equity structure. \n\nTreasury stock transactions, on the other hand, affect both the cash balance and the equity structure. When a company repurchases its own shares, it is recorded as a decrease in cash (financing activities) and a decrease in equity (treasury stock) [3]. Chevron Corporation's treasury stock increased by $6,807 million in 2021 [3], which means the company repurchased shares worth this amount. Since the treasury stock is at cost [3], we can assume that Chevron Corporation paid $6,807 million for its own shares in 2021, decreasing the cash balance on the balance sheet.

For consolidated operating income, the degree of attainment of the income in the current fiscal year is evaluated using the required income set in 2011 for Toyota’s sustainable growth.

The interest expense for the year ended 31 Dec 2020 was $2.7bn, down $2.9bn year-on-year and down $0.3bn compared to the previous quarter.

The proportion of service costs to total cost of revenues has slightly decreased from 89.3% in 2019 to 87.0% in 2021, while other costs of revenues have increased from 10.7% in 2019 to 13.0% in 2021. This increase in other costs of revenues is primarily attributed to higher agency fees and payment channel fees as seen in image2 and image4.\n\nRegarding operating expenses, the company has consistently allocated more than half of its total operating expenses to general and administrative expenses.

For nickel, a US¢1 per pound increase in the price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million.\n\n[image1](# \"A US$1 per ton increase in the metallurgical coal price impacts profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million, while a US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million.\")(image1)\n\nIn the context of BHP's financial results, [image2] shows a table with various financial and production data for the company for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020. \n\nFor coal, BHP's revenue decreased from $5,357 million in FY2020 to $4,315 million in FY2021, while underlying EBITDA fell from $1,935 million in FY2020 to $593 million in FY2021 as reported in [2]. This decrease in earnings is partly attributed to lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$0.7 billion and lower volumes decreasing Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million. Controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million due to increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and shiploader maintenance at Hay Point port, as well as increased stripping volumes. However, these increases in costs were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives at both Queensland Coal and NSWEC [2].\n\nIn terms of nickel, [1] states that underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs.\n\nIn summary, changes in commodity prices, especially for coal and nickel, can significantly impact BHP's financial results, as higher prices lead to increased earnings, while lower prices have the opposite effect. The key drivers behind these impacts include price variations, production volumes, cost reduction initiatives, and exchange rates.\n\nFluctuations in commodity prices, changes in production volumes, cost reduction initiatives, and exchange rates are key drivers that impact BHP's financial results, particularly for coal and nickel."}

Considering that this is part of the total long-term liabilities, let's add this amount as well. \n\nSo the total long-term liabilities for Costco in FY 2021 are $4,491 million (from Senior Notes) + $94 million (from Guaranteed Senior Notes) = $4,585 million, or $4.585 billion in millions.\n\nTo summarise, here's the answer citation:\n\n$4,585^{\\text{billion}}$ (Total long-term liabilities: $4,491^{\\text{million from Senior Notes in text quote [4] and image4,}} + $94^{\\text{million from Guaranteed Senior Notes in text quote [5]}}$)"}

This growth was primarily driven by an increase in Card Member spending, as mentioned in the same quote. Another quote, [7], further explains that the increase in discount revenue was also driven by an increase in the average discount rate, primarily due to a change in the mix of spending driven by increased levels of T&E-related volumes. Lastly, quote [5] adds that discount revenue increased primarily due to a 24% growth in worldwide network volumes, with both U.S. and non-U.S. volumes showing significant gains.\n\nTo visualize the financial data related to the increase in discount revenue, consider the summarized information from image4, which shows the increase in total revenues net of interest expense. While image4 does not directly connect to the discount revenue, it highlights the overall upward trend in revenue categories for the company in 2021 when compared to 2020, with net revenues surpassing 2019 levels.\n\n`![Discount revenue increased in 2021 due to higher Card Member spending and an increase in the average discount rate driven by T&E related volumes](image4)`\n\nIn conclusion, the discount revenue increased by 26% from 2020 to 2021 due to higher Card Member spending, an increase in the average discount rate, and higher worldwide network volumes.

At 17.5% compound growth, 40% of incentives are awarded, increasing to 60% at 20% compound growth, 80% at 22.5%, and reaching 100% at 25% compound growth.\n\nTherefore, EBIT growth directly affects the exercisable percentage of incentives over the performance period, with higher growth rates allowing for a greater percentage of incentives to be exercised.\n\n![Exercisable Incentives related to EBIT growth](image3)\n![Performance-based incentive structure based on EBIT growth](image4)\n\nThe exercisable percentage of incentives increases as the EBIT growth rate rises, encouraging executives to strive for higher performance levels to maximize their potential rewards."}

However, when it comes to actually availing of the leave, 1,025 females and 2,023 males have done so, meaning that more male employees choose to take parental leave.\n\nInterestingly, when looking at the number of employees who returned to work after taking leave, similar high percentages of females (94%) and males (96%) resumed their jobs after their leave. However, fewer females were still employed 12 months after returning to work (6% of the total female employees who took leave) compared to males (4% of the total male employees who took leave).\n\nThese statistics may reflect the gender diversity policies at HDFC Bank, as the organization has introduced various programs and policies promoting gender diversity. For example, they strive to provide equal and fair remuneration opportunities regardless of gender and have adopted a gender diversity target of increasing women's representation in their workforce to 25% by FY25. They also have a dedicated leadership program catering to women in middle-management positions, which indicates their focus on women's career progression and advancement [6].\n\nTo summarize, there are differences in parental leave entitlement, usage, and return rates for male and female employees at HDFC Bank, with more male employees taking advantage of parental leave benefits. However, high return-to-work rates suggest a positive approach to work-life balance in the organization.

For instance, the Company recognized an additional $52 million, $19 million, and $6 million in interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively [1]. Furthermore, the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which primarily affected customers, was reinstated in 2020, amounting to $3.0 billion for the Company [2].

This decrease in ENBREL sales is attributed to lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory. The text also indicates that ENBREL has continued to lose market share, with this decline being compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market due to the impact of COVID-19 [4].\n\nFor Prolia, the total sales increased by 3% from $2,672 million in 2019 to $2,763 million in 2020 [5][image5]. This increase is driven by higher unit demand and net selling price. It's important to note that the increase in Prolia sales experienced a deceleration in 2020 due to disruptions in patient visits resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption affected demand by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients [6].\n\nTherefore, while ENBREL sales decreased and Prolia sales increased, both were influenced by changes in net selling price, unit demand, market conditions, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient behavior and market dynamics.\n\nIn summary, sales of ENBREL saw a 4% decrease from 2019 to 2020, and this decrease was driven by lower unit demand, net selling price, and market share.

To answer your question regarding the quick ratio for Nike in FY2021, we need to identify the quick assets and current liabilities from the balance sheet provided in image3.\n\nFirst, let's find the quick assets for FY2021:\n- Cash and equivalents: $9,889 million\n- Short-term investments: $3,587 million\n- Accounts receivable, net: $4,463 million\n- Prepaid expenses and other current assets: $1,498 million\n\nTotal quick assets: $19,437 million\n\nNext, we'll find the current liabilities for FY2021:\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $0 million\n- Notes payable: $2 million\n- Accounts payable: $2,836 million\n- Current portion of operating lease liabilities: $467 million\n- Accrued liabilities: $6,063 million\n- Income taxes payable: $306 million\n\nTotal current liabilities: $9,704 million\n\nNow, we can calculate Nike's quick ratio for FY2021:\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = $19,437 million / $9,704 million\nQuick Ratio ≈ 2.00\n\nTherefore, Nike's quick ratio in FY2021 was approximately 2.00, indicating that the company had twice as much quick assets as current liabilities."}

This change can be attributed to a few factors:\n\n1. **Issuance of New Debt:** In March 2019, the company issued a principal amount of $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039 [1]. Similarly, in March 2020, another $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt was issued due in 2025 [7]. In September 2019, $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2029 was also issued [8]. Lastly, in May 2020, $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030 was issued [9]. These new issuances contribute to the increase in long-term debt.\n\n2. **Retirement of Maturating Debt:** In 2020, the company retired maturing debt of $500 million [3], which was less than the maturing debt retired in 2019 ($750 million) [3]. This difference in the amount of retired debt could also contribute to the increase in long-term debt.\n\n3. **Interest and Debt Expense:** The interest and debt expense in 2020 was $190 million, compared to $125 million in 2018 [2]. This increase in expense could also contribute to the rise in long-term debt.\n\nThe increase in long-term debt from 2019 to 2020 is mainly due to the issuance of new debt and the retirement of less maturing debt in 2020 compared to 2019. The higher interest and debt expense in 2020 could also be a contributing factor.\n\n![The long-term debt in 2020 was $6,248 million, compared to $5,303 million in 2019, indicating an increase of $945 million.](image5)"}

It is important to analyze these changes across different sectors to better understand the underlying factors.\n\nWhen comparing [Net Interest Income](image1) between 2021 and 2020, there is a decrease of $1,174 million, or approximately 19%. This decline can be attributed to several factors, such as lower loan balances due to weak demand, lower interest rates, elevated prepayments, refinancing activity, and the sale of the student loan portfolio. Additionally, higher securities premium amortization, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and lower interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt have also contributed to this decrease.\n\nRegarding [Total Loans](image2), the average loans in 2021 decreased by $30,199 million or 14% compared to 2020. Specifically, commercial and industrial loans decreased by $22,867 million or 16%, commercial real estate loans decreased by $5,202 million or 10%, and lease financing and other loans decreased by $2,130 million or 13%. These reductions in loan balances reflect lower demand, higher paydowns driven by client liquidity, and strength in the capital markets. However, there was modest loan growth in late 2021 due to higher line utilization, growth in customer numbers, and some increases in line utilization.\n\nWhen examining [Loans by Line of Business](image5) such as Home Lending, Auto, Credit Card, Small Business, and Personal Lending, it is crucial to compare both the dollar and percentage changes between 2020 and 2021. For instance, Home Lending decreased by $9,869 million or 31%, while Auto loans decreased by $2,841 million or 27%. On the other hand, personal lending increased by $2,485 million or 19%, illustrating the varying trends across these sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, between 2020 and 2021, the net interest income decreased by approximately 19%, and total loans decreased by 14%, with an evident decline in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and lease financing and other loans.

[7] As of January 28, 2023, the company does not have any future maturities of long-term debt within the next five fiscal years, and they had $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash with $500 million of debt that has been swapped to a floating rate. The net balance exposed to interest rate changes was $1.8 billion. A 50-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $9 million reduction in net interest expense.\n2. [6] The company utilizes \"receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate\" interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their $500 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028. These interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method, which results in offsetting changes to the carrying value of the debt without any impact on their Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n3. [8] As of January 28, 2023, a 50-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $9 million reduction in net interest expense, while conversely, a 50-basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $9 million increase in net interest expense.\n\nIn conclusion, the fair value of long-term debt decreased from $1,205 million to $1,019 million, and the carrying value decreased from $1,200 million to $1,143 million between January 29, 2022, and January 28, 2023.

In contrast, more Republicans continue to see the U.S. as the leading economy, but their confidence levels have experienced fluctuations over the years [1], [4].\n\nWhen comparing the two political affiliations, the gap between Democrats and Republicans regarding their perception of China as the world's leading economy narrowed over time, increasing from a 6% difference in 2012 to a 10% difference in 2019 and 2020 [5]. These shifts in perception are likely due to various factors, such as changing economic conditions and the rising global influence of China.\n\nIn conclusion, while the perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economy has remained stronger among Republicans compared to Democrats, the latter has seen a decline in this view from 2008 to 2020.\n\n![Democrats' waning confidence in the U.S. as the world's leading economy from 2008 to 2020](image6)"}

In 1870, the county had a population of 130. This number increased rapidly over the subsequent decades, reaching a peak of 14,096 in 1890 [3][5][9]. After this peak, the population began to decrease slowly, settling around 9,000 residents by the year 2000 [3][5][9].\n\nSeveral historical factors influenced these population changes. The Homestead Act of 1862 and the Transcontinental Railroad Act, also from 1862, significantly impacted the Nebraska landscape and spurred major population growth [9]. The Homestead Act allowed pioneers to claim 160 acres of land if they built a permanent residence and lived there for five years [9]. By 1900, nearly 69,000 people had acquired land in Nebraska this way, with almost half of them failing to secure title to their land [9].\n\nEthnic groups also contributed to the population trends in Hamilton County [8]. Early settlers primarily came from Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and the New England States. Later, immigrants arrived from Germany, Sweden, England, Russia, and other countries [8]. Geographically, these diverse groups settled in clusters across the county, with Danes settling in the northeastern part, Swedes in the northwestern part, Irish, Bohemians, and Germans in the southwestern part, and Russian Mennonites in the southeastern part [8].\n\nSpecific ethnic congregations formed strong religious communities, such as the Danish Lutheran Church in northeastern Hamilton County, which had approximately 200 families [7]. These ethnic groups played a crucial role in shaping the cultural landscape of the county [7][10].\n\nIn the late 1800s, Hamilton County's population grew rapidly, and numerous rural school districts emerged [5][6]. As the population increased, so did the number of organized school districts, with the first one established near Stockham in 1870 and ninety-eight districts in place by 1885 [5][6]. However, as time went on, widespread consolidation occurred, and few, if any, rural schoolhouses remain today [6].\n\nDespite popular notions that small towns are disappearing, Hamilton County's rural areas have shown recent population gains, with Aurora being the most notable example—peaking in population in 2000 at 4,225 citizens and steadily increasing since 1940 [2]. However, agricultural trends like farm consolidation might present challenges for maintaining population levels in towns outside Aurora [2][4].\n\nIn summary, the population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000 were characterized by growth, peaking around 1890, and then declining to approximately 9,000 residents. Factors contributing to these trends include the Homestead Act of 1862, the Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862, and the arrival of various ethnic groups. Agricultural trends and consolidation, however, might pose challenges for maintaining rural population levels in the future.\n\n![The population of Hamilton County, Nebraska steadily increased from 1870 to 1890 and then slightly decreased to approximately 9,000 residents by 2000.

Image2 shows that 40% of respondents are very confident.\n\nNext, let's find the percentage of people who are not confident at all in Trump's ability. Image2 shows that 58% of respondents express little or no confidence in Trump on immigration policy, and 45% of those say they are not at all confident in him on this issue.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage difference:\n\n((40% - 45%) / 45%) * 100% = (-11.11%)\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage difference between the proportion of people who are very confident and those who are not confident at all. So, we need to calculate it as follows:\n\n(40% - 58%) / (100% - 58%) * 100% = (-27.59%)\n\nTherefore, the percentage difference between the proportion of people who are very confident in Trump's ability to make wise decisions about immigration policy and those who are not confident at all is approximately -27.59%.

According to a [Pew Research Center survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/09/15/us-image-plummets-internationally-as most-say-country-has-handled-coronavirus-badly/), in March 2020, 59% of Americans believed the U.S. was the world's leading economic power, but this proportion slightly decreased to 52% by the time of the survey. Concurrently, the Chinese economy achieved positive growth in 2020, while the U.S. gross domestic product shrank, reflecting the shift in public opinion.\n\nThe Chinese economy had a brief surge between 2008 and 2011, peaking at 41%, but then experienced a steady decline. By 2020, 32% of Americans considered China the world's leading economic power (image1).\n\n![The U.S. is still seen as the world's leading economic power, but the perception of China's dominance has gradually increased since 2008, albeit with a decrease in 2020](image1)\n\nWhen comparing political affiliations, there have been notable differences in perceptions of Sino-U.S. economic relations. Specifically, Americans who view the relationship as poor are more likely to have no confidence (61%) in Chinese President Xi Jinping than those who think the relationship is good (44%) (image3).\n\n![Since 2012, there has been a significant difference in the perception of China as a political competitor or partner between Republicans (Rep/Lean Rep) and Democrats (Dem/Lean Dem)](image3)\n\nThe overall confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping related to world affairs is generally low among Americans. About three-quarters of them have not too much confidence (19%) or no confidence at all (55%) in Xi, marking a considerable increase from previous years (image4).\n\nThe low confidence in the Chinese president is significantly tied to dissatisfaction with China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Americans who hold an unfavorable view of China's efforts to control the pandemic are more likely to have no confidence (64%) in Xi, as compared to those who view China's attempts more favorably (39%) (image4).\n\nBetween March 2020 and September 2020, there has been a decline in the share of Democrats (54% to 44%) who see the U.S. as the world's leading economic power (image5) ([9], [7]).\n\nIn conclusion, Americans' perceptions of their country's status as the world's leading economic power have fluctuated, with a noticeable decline in positive sentiment during March-September 2020. Furthermore, there is a substantial difference between political affiliations, with Republicans more likely to view China as a competitor and with lower confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping. These trends are strongly associated with China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unfavorable public opinion of the Chinese leader."}

The image shows a bar graph highlighting the percentage of ad impressions on various devices, with mobile apps accounting for the majority of impressions at 84%.

According to a study, an approximate half of Americans (50%) believe that the United States holds this position, whereas a greater proportion of Germans (53%) name China as the leading economic force [1][2]. This divergence in perceptions reflects the general trends in each country's perspectives regarding global economics and international relations.\n\n![Germans are more likely to see China as the world’s leading economic power compared to Americans](image2)\n\nIn addition, these differing viewpoints can be better understood within the context of each country's political ideologies. For instance, in both countries, conservative citizens are less likely to perceive international entities favorably compared to their more liberal counterparts. In the United States, only 38% of conservatives view the UN favorably, compared to 66% of moderates and 80% of liberals [9]. Meanwhile, in Germany, 61% of individuals from the right view the UN favorably, compared to 71% from the center and 77% from the left. Similar tendencies can be seen in their views on the EU and Russia [9].\n\nThis disparity in perceptions might be driven by differences in media consumption, cultural influence, and educational backgrounds. It's also important to consider the political climate of each country, including the role of influential figures, which may shape their citizens' views on global economic leadership.\n\nIn summary, Americans and Germans hold contrasting views on the world's leading economic power with Americans leaning more towards the United States, and Germans towards China. These differences can be better understood by examining political ideologies and their influence within each society."}

In 1880, there were 1,597 farms, which increased to 2,039 by 1890 [3]. This growth can be attributed to the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which transformed Nebraska's landscape, promoting agricultural development and attracting pioneers to the region [2].\n\nHowever, from 1900 to 1950, the number of farms began to decrease. There were 2,049 farms in 1900, but by 1910, the number had dropped to 1,944. This trend continued, with 1,882 farms in 1920 and 1,766 farms in 1930. By 1950, the number of farms had fallen further to 1,453 [3]. This decline in the number of farms can be linked to the consolidation trend, where the number of acres per farm increased, and the scale of farming in the United States changed dramatically [1].\n\nIn summary, the number of farms in the U.S. decreased from 1,597 in 1880 to 1,453 in 1950, with some fluctuations during this period. This change can be associated with the mechanization of agriculture, increased costs of operation, and the shift towards larger, more efficient farming operations.\n\n![The number of farms in the U.S. decreased from 1,597 in 1880 to 1,453 in 1950, with some fluctuations during this period.

Therefore, we can infer that a considerable number of Republicans might not be fully confident in Trump's ability to separate his business interests.\n\nHowever, to find the exact number of Republicans who are not confident at all in Trump's ability to keep his business interests separate from his presidential decisions, we must turn to the [9th text quote].

According to a survey conducted from April 25 to May 1, 2018, both parties are rated equally when it comes to having good policy ideas (50% for both the Republican and Democratic parties) [3].

It's been observed that pre-training can lead to significant improvements in BLEU score for certain language pairs. For instance, in the case of GL→EN, there's a substantial increase in BLEU score when using pre-trained word embeddings [1][6][10]. \n\nThis trend is consistent across different experimental setups. When the baseline system is moderately effective, pre-training tends to be most effective, often resulting in the highest gain in BLEU score [4][6]. This is likely due to the fact that pre-training can help capture the basic characteristics of a language once there's enough data [1][4].\n\nHowever, the gain from pre-training can decrease as the size of the training set increases. This is evident in the second and third columns of image2, which shows that the gain from pre-training is more significant at smaller training set sizes for Portuguese (Pt), Turkish (Tr), and Russian (Ru) to English (En) translations [2].\n\nAdditionally, pre-training can improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [8]. \n\nIn the context of multilingual translation systems, pre-training can also help to increase BLEU scores when the same encoder or decoder is shared between multiple languages [5].\n\nTo summarize, pre-training can significantly improve BLEU scores for certain language pairs, especially when the baseline system is moderately effective and the training data is limited. However, the gain from pre-training tends to decrease as the size of the training set increases.

Quote [5] states that Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to struggle on fine-grained datasets, such as MAVEN and RAMS, with 168/139 labels, compared to simpler datasets like CONLL, which has only 4 labels. This suggests that LLMs might not perform as well when dealing with a larger number of labels.\n\nImage1 further supports this notion by comparing the performance of different language models on various NLP tasks, including FewNERD, TACREV, and ACE05. This image shows the F1 scores for each dataset under different \"shot\" conditions (i.e., the number of examples provided) for both LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs). We can observe that, in general, the LLMs' performance lags behind the SLMs across all datasets and shot conditions. Specifically, for the FewNERD dataset, which has a relatively large number of labels (168), the LLMs' F1 scores are significantly lower than those of the SLMs.\n\nTaking these insights into account, I can conclude that LLMs might struggle with the FewNERD dataset due to its larger number of labels, leading to lower micro-F1 performance, especially when compared to SLMs.\n\nSummary and Conclusion: LLMs tend to perform worse on fine-grained datasets with a larger number of labels, such as FewNERD, which has 168 labels. This is evident in image1, where LLMs' F1 scores for FewNERD are lower than those of SLMs across all shot conditions.

The SFT dataset is separated into various categories, namely Text, Code, Visual Chat, Image Generation, Interleaved Text/Image Generation, and Safety, with each containing a different number of samples and tokens [6][7][10]. The 'Interleaved Text/Image Generation' category, with 16.9 thousand samples and 35.8 million tokens, is of particular interest here, as it relates to Chameleon's ability to handle prompts requiring interleaving, mixed-modal responses [7].\n\nBalancing modalities within the SFT stage is essential for achieving high-quality alignment [5]. If there is a significant imbalance between pairings of modalities, the model learns an unconditional prior of generating that specific modality, which can either mute or exaggerate its generation. Keeping this in mind, the creators of the Chameleon model carefully curated a high-quality 'Image Generation' SFT dataset to avoid unwanted prioritization of image generation and ensure effective interleaving with textual content [6]. This dataset includes aesthetically pleasing images, selected using an aesthetic classifier and a specific size and aspect ratio [6].\n\n![Chameleon model's ability to incorporate visually relevant images in its mixed-modal text generation, making documents with interleaved text and images more appealing to users.](image7)\n\nThe Chameleon model's inference strategy encompasses a range of different types of data, while maintaining a lightweight alignment stage based on supervised fine-tuning on carefully curated, high-quality datasets [3][5]. Through this approach, Chameleon achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image captioning, outperforms Llama-2 in text-only tasks, and competes with models like Mixtral 8x7B and Gemini-Pro [4]. Furthermore, Chameleon performs non-trivial image generation and matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, as assessed by human judgments on a new long-form mixed-modal generation evaluation [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the SFT datasetstats relating to the 'Interleaved Text/Image Generation' category and the fine-tuned 'Image Generation' dataset significantly influence the Chameleon model's capability to interleave mixed-modal responses effectively.

The pipeline is designed to be versatile and can handle various categories of organisms, not limited to a specific one. The pipeline works by first using a multimodal retriever to extract image feature embeddings and store them in memory. Then, given a new image as input, the model retrieves the top-k categories from memory based on similarity and uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to refine and rank these categories. Finally, the model outputs the predicted label as the final prediction. Here's an interleaved response using the provided quotes and images:\n\nThe RAR model is a retrieving-augmented solution that combines retrieving and ranking with multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to revolutionize perception tasks such as fine-grained recognition, zero-shot image recognition, and few-shot object recognition [7]. More specifically, the pipeline consists of two main components: multimodal retriever and retrieving & ranking [5][10].\n\nIn the multimodal retriever component, an Image Encoder extracts image feature embeddings from a dataset, and the embeddings are stored in a Feature Index [10]. For retrieval, the model utilizes k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) for image-image and image-text retrieval [5]. The images to be retrieved and ranked are stored in an external storage called Memory (M) [10].\n\nThe retrieving & ranking component is responsible for handling the input image and producing the final prediction. In the inference stage, an input image is encoded into embeddings and navigated through the previously constructed memory index, which is ranked by similarity to identify the top-k related images [1].\n\nAs for the user question about the type of organism used as the input case in the pipeline diagram, the diagram does not specify a particular organism [5]. In fact, the pipeline is versatile and can handle various categories of organisms, not limited to a specific one.\n\nIn summary, any type of organism can be used as the input case in the RAR model's pipeline diagram, which enhances recognition tasks by combining multi-modal data retrieval and ranking processes.\n\n![The RAR model's pipeline enhances recognition tasks by combining multi-modal data retrieval and ranking processes, where any type of organism can be used as the input case](image5)"}

The decoder attends to the output of the transformer encoder to refine its predictions [3,5].\n4. **Prediction Heads**: For each output embedding of the decoder, a shared FFN predicts either the class and bounding box of a detected object or classifies it as “no object.” The predictions are visualized as bounding boxes with associated class labels overlaid on an image, showing the model's capability to detect objects in the scene [3].\n\nThe object queries are vital for the DETR model's operation, allowing it to reason about the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel [7]. The flexibility and simplicity of this approach enable the DETR model to achieve performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset [7].

It iterates a specified number of times or until a threshold is met. The process can be summarized as: Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge → (Repeat or Response). This approach is helpful in scenarios where the user's needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. An example of this process can be found in the recursive retrieval method used by IRCoT [61], which guides the retrieval process and refines the CoT (Chain-of-Thought) with the obtained retrieval results.\n\n![Iterative Retrieval](image5)\n\nThe Recursive retrieval process, on the other hand, **gradually refines the user query and divides problems into sub-problems**. It continuously solves complex problems through retrieval and generation using query transformation/decomposition. The process is as follows: Query → Retrieve → Generate → Judge → Query Transformation → (Repeat or Response). This technique is particularly useful in addressing specific data scenarios and delving deeper into graph-structured data sources, extracting interconnected information. An example of this process can be found in the recursive retrieval and multi-hop retrieval techniques described in the text, which process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner and delve deeper into interconnected information sources.\n\nThe Adaptive retrieval process enables the RAG system to **decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed**. It can autonomously determine when to stop retrieval and generation, using special tokens. The process is as follows: Query → Judge → Retrieve (on demand) → Generate → Query Transformation → Judge → (Repeat or Response). This approach enhances the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced by refining the RAG framework, allowing the language model to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval. An example of this process can be found in the adaptive retrieval methods exemplified by Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25].\n\nIn summary, the Iterative retrieval process aims to provide richer context from the knowledge base, the Recursive retrieval process gradually refines the user query and divides problems into sub-problems, and the Adaptive retrieval process enables the RAG system to decide when external knowledge retrieval is needed. Each process enhances the retrieval and generation tasks differently to improve the system’s performance and flexibility."}

In these models, the presence of gold paragraphs and distractors can have a substantial impact on the F1 scores.\n\nIn a study, the F1 score for the Distractor setting is reported as 67.08 [4] [9]. When gold paragraphs are added to the Open-domain 500 Paragraphs setting, the F1 score significantly increases from 39.12 to 53.12 [5]. This shows that the inclusion of gold paragraphs in open-domain settings can considerably enhance the model's performance.\n\nOn the other hand, when the distribution of distractors changes, as observed when using adversarial selection rather than just TF-IDF, the model might initially struggle [8]. However, after retraining the model on the distractors from the new distribution, it can recover a significant portion of its original accuracy.\n\nIn Table 4 [4] [9], it can be observed that when single-paragraph BERT is trained on adversarial distractors in the training set, the accuracy increases from 46.84 to 60.10 F1 on the adversarial distractors, pointing to the importance of considering such adversarial settings during training.\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of gold paragraphs can significantly improve the F1 scores and the performance of multi-hop question answering models.

According to quote [2], for sentiment analysis tasks, both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, likely due to their ability to capture word-order features that SWEM ignores. This observation is consistent with the findings of Pang et al. (2002), who hypothesized that positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial for predicting sentiment.\n\nThis idea is further supported by the image description (image2), which highlights the difference in sentiment between two text sequences with the same words but different orderings. The LSTM model, by capturing word-order information, can distinguish such variations and provide a more accurate sentiment prediction.\n\nIn summary, for sentiment analysis tasks, LSTM models which can capture word-order information via recurrent transition functions can perform better than those which don't, such as SWEM.\n\nDirect Answer: Word-order information affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models by providing the necessary context for word positioning, thus allowing LSTM models to better distinguish the sentiment of different text sequences compared to models that don't capture word-order information."}

Specifically, with `z=10` in the repetition-controlled model, the question-asking rate is reduced to 79.67% compared to the 97.72% rate when repetition control is not used. This decrease in question-asking rate is primarily due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances, preventing the model from producing bigrams that commonly occur in many questions, such as \"do you\" and \"what is\" (see [4] for more details).\n\n![The question-asking rate at the highest control level with repetition control is 79.67%](image4)\n\nFurthermore, with the extra setting `z = 10 (b o o s t).` in the conditional training method, which does not use the feature `extrep bigram` for weighted decoding during beam search but employs it to rerank the candidates after beam search, the model can produce necessary question-asking bigrams. With this setting, the question-asking rate is increased to 99.54% (see [4]), but this comes at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition (refer to Appendix F).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that conditional training is a more reliable method than weighted decoding for controlling question-asking as it allows the achievement of (close to) 0%, 100%, or any rate in-between without introducing the risk of degenerate output (see [5]). In contrast, increasing the `weight` in weighted decoding does not yield better model responsiveness; rather, lower `weight` values tend to make the model a better listener (see [9]).\n\nTo conclude, the introduction of repetition control reduces the question-asking rate at the highest control level (`z=10`), primarily due to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`. While an extra setting can help achieve a higher question-asking rate, conditional training is a more reliable method for controlling question-asking."}

These mechanisms include base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair. The selection of the appropriate repair mechanism depends on the type, site, and extent of the mutation-induced damage and the stage of the cell cycle affected by the mutation.\n\n**Direct Reversal Repair** (image1): This repair mechanism is capable of directly reversing UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylating adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl-transfer proteins, respectively. Unlike other repair mechanisms, direct reversal repair does not require incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA, as the changed or mutated bases are directly reverted to their original states.\n\n**Base Excision Repair (BER)** (image3): BER is primarily employed to correct damage induced by oxygen radicals, alkylating agents, and replication errors via the removal of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, followed by addition of new normal bases by a specific polymerase enzyme, and finally the restoration of the phosphodiester bonds and the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand by DNA ligase.\n\n**Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)** (image4): NER is one of the most important DNA repair systems, conserved among species, and it can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA. It is much more complicated in higher eukaryotes than in prokaryotes.\n\n**Mismatch Repair (MMR)** (image3): MMR recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases resulting from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins, and signal discrimination factors, collaborating with the proofreading system to recognize the mutated strand and locate the site of the mismatched pair.\n\n**Transcription-Coupled Repair (TCR)** (image1): TCR is a sub-pathway of NER that rapidly repairs lesions on the template strand of actively transcribed genes. When a lesion occurs on the transcribed strand of DNA, RNA polymerase stalls, which then triggers TCR to initiate the repair process, enhancing the cell's ability to maintain genetic stability and prevent diseases.\n\n**Recombination Repair** (image2): Recombination repair mechanisms aim primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA, the most devastating mutation-induced lesions of DNA, leading to loss of genetic information and chromosomal instabilities with pathological alterations. Double-strand breaks can be caused endogenously during DNA replication due to replication errors, or exogenously by ionizing radiation.\n\nIn conclusion, Figure 11 demonstrates the existence of six nuclear DNA repair mechanisms, namely base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair (MMR), transcription-coupled repair (TCR), and recombination repair. These mechanisms collaborate to maintain genomic stability, prevent diseases, and preserve the integrity of genetic information."}

Word-level embeddings provide a semantic representation of each word, while character-level embeddings, derived from a Char Bi-LSTM layer, capture character-level features and create character embeddings for each word. This combination allows the model to consider context from both directions, which is useful for understanding the sentence’s overall meaning, especially when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words, morphological variations, and capitalization patterns.\n\nAs described in [1], the hierarchical CRF model consists of a character-level neural network, which is either an RNN or a CNN, that allows the model to capture subword information. The word-level neural network, usually an RNN, then consumes word representations and produces context-sensitive hidden representations for each word. The model can then effectively learn word embeddings that capture the nuances of language, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. Using character-level and word-level embeddings as inputs, the model can improve its understanding of the input sentence, leading to enhanced performance in tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER).\n\nTo further illustrate the importance of character-level embeddings, [8] introduces a new lexical mapping approach that combines the advantages of both discrete dictionary-based methods and continuous embedding-based methods. By first projecting embeddings of different languages into a shared BWE space, then learning discrete word translations by looking for nearest neighbors in this projected space, the method inherits the benefits of both methods – its resource requirements are low as in the former, but it suffers less from misalignment of the embedding spaces and has access to character-level information like the latter. The use of character-level embeddings in this method allows for more accurate translations and improved performance in cross-lingual applications.\n\nIn summary, merging both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs to the model offers several benefits:\n\n- Enhanced context and linguistic features capture, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns\n- Improved performance in tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n- Better handling of out-of-vocabulary words\n- More accurate translations in cross-lingual applications, particularly when using advanced methods like the one presented in [8]\n\nTo visualize the character-level and word-level embeddings flow, you can refer to the Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model architecture depicted in [5]:\n![An architecture of a Self-attentive Bi-LSTM-CRF model that highlights the use of both character-level and word-level embeddings as inputs (image derived from [5])](image5)\n\nAdditionally, you might find the illustration of word embeddings translation in [2] insightful, particularly in understanding how word embeddings are aligned in a shared embedding space:\n![An illustration of word embeddings translation using a shared embedding space (image derived from [2])](image2)"}

The significance of this score is that it is higher than many other models in the \"Open\" setting, indicating that the Cognitive Graph model may perform better in more complex scenarios where irrelevant information is present. However, it is essential to note that other models like DFGN + BERT and DecompRC also achieve high Distractor F1 scores, meaning they are better at handling complex questions with multiple compositional parts.\n\nAdditionally, the user question asks about the significance of the highest Open F1 score. In this context, the Cognitive Graph model's higher Open F1 score may signify that it is better suited for open-domain question answering tasks, where irrelevant or misleading information can often impact model accuracy. It is crucial, though, to comprehensively compare all models across various datasets and evaluate their robustness before deciding which model is best for a particular application.\n\nIn summary, the Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score of 48.87, which may indicate its superiority in open-domain question-answering tasks. However, further analysis and evaluation of other models are necessary for a well-informed decision.\n\n![The Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score of 48.87 in the \"Open\" evaluation setting, suggesting its potential superiority in open-domain question-answering tasks.](image10)![The Cognitive Graph model achieves the highest Open F1 score of 48.87 in the \"Open\" evaluation setting, suggesting its potential superiority in open-domain question-answering tasks.](image4)"}

[This table](image1) provides a clear overview of how each data source (crowd-sourced, head data, and entity linking) affects the performance metrics for the Ultra-Fine category, specifically the Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1).\n\nWhen the crowd-sourced data is excluded from the training (– Crowd), there is a considerable drop in performance for the Ultra-Fine category across all three metrics. Excluding the head portion of the dataset (– Head) also results in decreased precision and F1-score but a slightly increased recall. The most significant decline is seen when entity linking data is excluded (– EL).

The Venn diagram (image2) illustrates the overlaps between Engineering, Java, and a third category (possibly Manager, as indicated by the caption text). This diagram showcases how various combinations of skills can intersect, allowing recruiters to construct more targeted and accurate Boolean search strings.\n\nAs a fundamental skill for talent acquisition professionals, understanding Boolean search strings enables recruiters to make the most of the LinkedIn Recruiter platform.

Place two fingers (index and middle fingers) on the wrist, at a distance of approximately 2.5-3 cm from the wrist joint, where the radial pulse can be easily found [image3]. This helps you identify the correct position on your wrist for taking the measurement.\n\n2. Using a ruler or a measuring tape, wrap it around the wrist at the spot where you've placed your fingers, ensuring it's level with the bone protrusion on the side of your wrist [image5]. \n\n3. Adjust the ruler or tape so that it's not too tight or too loose, but comfortably snug against your skin. \n\n4. Record the measurement indicated by the arrow in the ruler or tape [image1 and image5]. This is your wrist's circumference.\n\n5. Once you have the measurement, you can then select a strap size accordingly. Match the wrist circumference measurement to the appropriate strap size, as suggested by the manufacturer's guide, to ensure a proper fit [1, 4, 8, 9].\n\nTo sum up, the key to properly measuring your wrist circumference for selecting a strap is finding the correct position on your wrist, using a snug yet comfortable measuring tool, and comparing the measurement with the recommended strap sizes by the manufacturer."}

This discrepancy suggests there are opportunities for improvement in optimizing the funnel progression from MQLs to SALs.\n\nTo address this challenge, marketers may consider refining the lead scoring and qualification process based on the pre-determined scoring methodology mentioned in text quote [2]. This could help ensure that MQLs are of higher quality and more sales-ready, leading to an improved conversion rate.\n\nFurther, customizing marketing communications to match leads' sales readiness and characteristics can help move leads more effectively through the funnel. As described in text quote [2], this could occur through employing segmented lead nurturing, refining the hand-off process between the marketing and sales team, and offering ongoing training to the marketing team to improve customer experience and increase conversion rates. As indicated in text quote [4], such training would cover topics such as basing custom scorecards on site goals and diagnosing metrics to measure marketing opportunities across the organization.\n\nIn conclusion, with the MQL to SAL conversion rate being 1.50% and falling significantly below the industry average of 45-75%, it's essential to refine the process using techniques like optimizing lead scoring and qualification, enhancing lead nurturing strategies, and offering ongoing training to the marketing team to better understand and address leads' sales readiness.\n\n![MQL to SAL conversion rate at 1.50%, which is below the industry average of 45-75%](image3)"}

In the CTBT program, participants are grouped according to their institutional affiliations [4]. On the other hand, the weekend activity data from 2005 and 2010 group activities by percentage of time spent [3]. However, the grouping in the CTBT program is based on institutional affiliations, which does not directly reflect the focus of the training program, whereas the weekend activity data is based on an applicable grouping method – time allocation.\n\nSecond, the use of visual elements for representation varies between the two sets of data. The CTBT program infographic [4] employs various visual elements including a world map, pie charts, and text to convey the data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the program's impact. The weekend activity data uses a combination of pie charts [3] and text to showcase the changes between 2005 and 2010 but lacks a direct visual comparison of the two time periods. Nonetheless, both infographics incorporate some form of visual representation to convey their respective data effectively.\n\nLastly, the distribution of participants and time allocation varies in complexity. The CTBT program infographic [4] indicates a wide distribution of participants, with 425 individuals from 105 countries, demonstrating successful global reach. Meanwhile, the weekend activity data from 2005 and 2010 [3] illustrates shifts in time allocation across various leisure activities in two specific years. The 2005 data set has activities with slightly higher time percentages than those seen in 2010, suggesting a gradual change in how people spend their leisure time.\n\nIn summary, both the CTBT training program participation statistics and the changes in weekend activities from 2005 to 2010 display data employing grouping and visual representation methods.

In this process, each stage builds upon the previous one, culminating in valuable business outcomes only when the complete chain is effectively utilized.\n\nThe Levels of Analytics [2], on the other hand, provides a hierarchy of analytical techniques, starting from basic reporting to advanced predictive modeling and optimization, each increasing the degree of intelligence and business value gained.\n\nBy combining these two concepts, we can visualize a more comprehensive flow of transforming raw data into valuable actions. To begin, data is collected and integrated (Data Collection in [5]) feeding into the initial stages of the Analytics Value Chain. This data then goes through standard and ad-hoc reporting (image2 Level 1-2), which enables the business to ask questions like \"What happened?\" and \"How many, how often, where?\"\n\nAs data moves through the Analytics Value Chain, the organization performs query drilldown (image2 Level 3) to pinpoint specific problems and utilize statistical analysis (image2 Level 5) to investigate \"Why is this happening?\". These stages help answer crucial questions in the analysis process, pushing data further along the Analytics Value Chain.\n\nFurther along the Levels of Analytics, we observe forecasting techniques (image2 Level 6), allowing the business to consider \"What if these trends continue?\". Meanwhile, predictive modeling (image2 Level 7) anticipates \"What will happen next?\". This stage enables informed decisions before events occur, such as predicting customer churn or demand forecasting, which can highly impact organizational success.\n\nFinally, at the pinnacle of both concepts lies optimization (image2 Level 8), in which an organization evaluates \"What's the best that can happen?\". Combining the Analytics Value Chain with the Levels of Analytics provides a comprehensive guide for data-driven companies to extract valuable insights, allowing them to take informed actions leading to increased value.\n\nIn conclusion, both the Analytics Value Chain and Levels of Analytics concepts are essential to guide organizations in deriving actionable insights and value from their data effectively. By integrating these two methodologies, organizations can streamline their processes and increase the potential for informed decision-making, transforming data into an invaluable business asset.\n\n![The Analytics Value Chain complements the Levels of Analytics in transforming data into actionable insights and value, transitioning from data storage to increased value.](image4)"}

This is a descriptive, backward-looking approach, focusing on data to information conversion [5]. The outputs are typically reports, dashboards, and alerts [5].\n\nAs we move up the hierarchy to BA, the degree of intelligence and business value increases [3]. Query drilldown and OLAP techniques allow users to answer questions about the exact location of issues, while alerts help determine \"what actions are needed\" [3]. These techniques enable a more targeted, action-oriented approach.\n\nIn the BA stages, statistical analysis, forecasting, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques are applied [3]. These methods go beyond data to information transformation, generating insights from data and information [5]. The outputs of BA are findings and recommendations, which provide more actionable and forward-looking guidance compared to BI [5].\n\nTo illustrate, let's examine the provided image1, which showcases the load average on server14. Although this data can be useful in BI to understand \"what happened\" and \"how many, how often, where?\" it doesn't provide insights into \"why\" or \"what if\" questions. Applying BA techniques, such as statistical analysis, forecasting, and predictive modeling, could provide deeper insights into the root causes of the spikes, potential future trends, and the best actions to mitigate the issues - generating more value from the data.\n\nIn conclusion, the transition from BI to BA not only enhances the business value and degree of intelligence [3] but also transforms data handling and insights generation, as depicted in the flowchart of data-driven value transformation in image4 [4]. The shift moves from data to information conversion in BI to data, information, and insights integration in BA [5].\n\nSo, the transition from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics significantly enhances data handling and insights generation, ultimately leading to more informed decisions and actions.\n\nSummary:\n- BI and BA transformation process: [image4](image4)\n- BI vs. BA data handling and insights: [image5](image5)\n- Transition from BI to BA enhances data handling and insights generation:\n\n> The transition from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics significantly enhances data handling and insights generation, ultimately leading to more informed decisions and actions."}

Engine Temperature Sensor: Monitors the engine temperature to help manage the engine's ignition timing, fuel injection, and valve timing.\n2. Intake Air Temperature Sensor: Measures the temperature of the air coming into the engine. Cold air is denser, allowing the engine to burn more fuel and generate more power.\n3. Mass Air Flow Sensor: Measures the mass flow rate of air into the engine.\n4. Throttle Position Sensor: Monitors the position of the throttle valve. The throttle is opened when the driver presses the accelerator, allowing more air into the engine, which increases its power output.\n5.

According to the diagram you provided (image1), Needs Exploration consists of:\n\n- Active stakeholder participation: Encouraging direct involvement from stakeholders in the development process.\n- High-level requirements specification and Detailed requirements specification: Defining the project's scope and specifics at different levels.\n- Split (A/B) testing: Comparing two versions of a product to determine which one performs better.\n- Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD): Collaborating with stakeholders to define tests that the solution must pass.\n- Just-in-time (JIT) model storming and Look-ahead modeling: Techniques to strategize and plan the architecture and design.\n\nOn the other hand, Elicitation Methods, as depicted in image5, are specific strategies used during Needs Exploration to gather information and requirements from stakeholders. The options include:\n\n- Just-in-time (JIT) model storming\n- Look-ahead modeling\n- All-hands demos\n- Iteration demos\n\nThese Elicitation Methods align with the Needs Exploration strategies mentioned above. For example, JIT model storming and Look-ahead modeling are part of Needs Exploration, and they also serve as Elicitation Methods. Similarly, All-hands demos and Iteration demos provide opportunities for active stakeholder participation, another technique in Needs Exploration.\n\nIn conclusion, Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods are complementary strategies for addressing stakeholder requirements in agile management. They both focus on understanding and catering to stakeholder needs and involve several interconnected techniques to achieve this goal.\n\nBy employing Needs Exploration strategies and Elicitation Methods, teams can effectively gather and integrate stakeholder requirements throughout the agile development process. This comprehensive approach helps ensure a successful and collaborative project outcome.\n\n![Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods comparison (images 1 and 5 interleaved)](image1%20and%20image5)"}

Breaking down silos and ensuring that all teams are aligned in their customer-centric efforts is crucial for successful adoption.\n2. **Insufficient resources and technical infrastructure**: A significant portion of businesses (36% and 28%, respectively) reported not having sufficient resources or technical infrastructure to support an integrated customer management approach (image1). Investing in the right tools and resources is essential to enable successful adoption.\n3. **Inability to measure the influence of activities on customer behavior**: A considerable number of businesses (27%) struggle to measure the influence of their activities on customer behavior (image1). Developing a robust measurement strategy that tracks both quantitative and qualitative metrics is necessary for adopting an integrated customer management approach.\n4. **Ineffective marketing attribution**: Far too much performance attribution of marketing campaigns is being given to the first or last click (quote [4]), which can result in incorrect insights and misguided decisions. Marketers need a new approach to understanding customers and prospects, combining quantitative and qualitative metrics and accounting for the complexities of the customer journey (quote [5]).\n5. **Lack of taxonomy and poor processes**: Failing to use a consistent and relevant digital marketing taxonomy and not establishing clear roles, responsibilities, and skilled resources are major barriers to adoption (quote [6]). Implementing standardized processes and establishing clear roles and responsibilities will facilitate a smoother adoption.\n6. **Over-engineering solutions**: Understanding the specific data needed to answer critical questions is crucial to implementing a simple solution that meets the business's needs (quote [8]). Avoiding over-engineered solutions and focusing on data-driven insights that inform actions and support decision-making will contribute to successful adoption.\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include misaligned goals, insufficient resources, inability to measure impact, ineffective marketing attribution, lack of taxonomy and poor processes, and over-engineering solutions.

However, there is an increase in access to patient clinical information (from 45% to 53%) and physician access for clinical orders (from 44% to 57%). Moreover, the chart shows a significant decrease in organizations that do not have an intranet system (from 7% to 1%).\n\nWhen we look at the current website functions, it is essential to highlight that Consumer Health Information and Patient Access to Medical Records have experienced a decline between 2005 and 2006. This could indicate that healthcare organizations are focusing more on internal communication and processes rather than patient-focused information.\n\nRegarding technology adoption, we can observe the increasing trend in specific technologies between 2005 and 2006, such as Single Sign On/Identity Management (from not available to 79%), Bar Code Technology (from 59% to 69%), Speech Recognition (from 59% to 65%), and VoIP (from not available to 59%).\n\nIn conclusion, the projected changes in intranet functions show a growing focus on internal communication, particularly access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders. This trend seems to align with the observed growth in the adoption of technologies like Single Sign On/Identity Management and Bar Code Technology. However, the decrease in website functions catering to patients could indicate a need for healthcare organizations to reassess their balance between internal communication and patient-oriented features in the next two years.\n\n![Projected reduction in posting policies and procedures and staff communication.

Each letter or pair of letters in the word represents a specific Gestalt principle. \n\nFor instance, the letter 'G' is isolated, demonstrating the principle of **Segregation (Segregação)**. This principle is about our tendency to perceive distinct objects or groups, even when they are in close proximity [2, 9]. \n\nThe letters 'G' and 'E' together form a closed shape, illustrating the concept of **Closure (Fechamento)** [10]. This principle suggests that we tend to perceive objects as whole, even when parts of them are missing or occluded.\n\nThe letter 'E' is designed as a series of small rectangles placed closely together, representing the principle of **Proximity** [2]. This principle states that elements that are close to each other tend to be perceived as belonging to the same group.\n\nThe 'S' follows a continuous contour line, exemplifying the principle of **Continuity** [4]. This principle indicates that elements with continuous or smooth transitions are perceived as belonging together.\n\nThe letters 'T' and 'A' share a similar striped pattern, reflecting the principle of **Similarity** [5]. This principle asserts that similar elements tend to be grouped together, including similarity in color, shape, size, or texture.\n\nLastly, the consistent use of patterns and colors across the entire word demonstrates the principle of **Unity** [9]. This principle underlines that when elements share characteristics, they are perceived as a coherent whole.\n\nIn summary, the principles of Gestalt psychology—Segregation, Closure, Proximity, Continuity, Similarity, and Unity—manifest in the design of the word 'GESTALT' through specific visual cues, highlighting the way we perceive and group visual elements.\n\n![The word 'GESTALT' is designed using various principles of Gestalt psychology, including Segregation, Closure, Proximity, Continuity, Similarity, and Unity](image1)"}

This suggests a growing need for staff who specialize in managing and securing sensitive patient data, and maintaining the systems that facilitate access to this information.\n\nAdditionally, the usage of intranets is expected to become nearly universal, with only 1% of organizations not having an intranet in two years, down from 7% today. This indicates that having an intranet will become a standard requirement for healthcare organizations, rather than an optional feature.\n\nIn terms of staffing needs, the trend towards increased use of technology will likely require healthcare organizations to hire additional staff with expertise in network support, clinical informatics, process/workflow design, application support, and clinical transformation. These roles are critical to the implementation and management of healthcare IT systems, and will become even more important as these systems become more widespread and complex.\n\nFurthermore, as the use of patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders increases, there will be a growing need for staff who are trained to ensure the security and privacy of patient data. This may include staff with experience in data analytics, as well as those with expertise in regulatory compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the trends in web and intranet functions projected in the coming years, healthcare organizations should consider staffing needs in the following areas:\n\n- Network support\n- Clinical informatics\n- Process/workflow design\n- Application support\n- Clinical transformation\n- Data analytics and regulatory compliance\n\nBy investing in these areas, healthcare organizations can ensure that they have the expertise and resources necessary to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the growing use of technology in healthcare.\n\n![The chart shows a significant projected reduction in organizations without an intranet in the coming years](image3)\n\n![The chart shows several trends in web and intranet functions projected in the coming years, including an increase in access to patient clinical information and physician access for clinical orders, and a near-universal adoption of intranets](image3)"}

This indicates that the network likely consists of multiple layers to create these hierarchies.\n\nNext, let's analyze the image quotes:\n\n- Image 1, described as visualizations of a convolutional neural network (CNN), demonstrates varying layers. It visually suggests the network has multiple layers, consisting of simple feature layers, more complex feature layers, and final layers capturing complete features.\n\nAlthough the provided text quotes lack explicit information on the total number of layers in the network, the visualization in Image 1, combined with the text quote [6], implies that the neural network utilized for distinguishing faces likely has multiple layers. These layers include, but are not limited to, the convolutional layer, ReLU layer, and pooling layer mentioned in quote [6]. By combining the visualizations in Image 1 and quote [7], it can be inferred that the neural network has several hidden layers.\n\n**In conclusion, the neural network used for distinguishing faces has several layers, including input, hidden, and output layers.** `![Multiple layers of a convolutional neural network, including simple feature layers, complex feature layers, and final layers capturing complete features.](image1)`"}

Let's break down the information step-by-step to answer your question.\n\nFirst, let's examine image1, which you described as an image containing three maps—Public libraries in The Netherlands, Dutch national heritage sites, and Big cities. This image serves as a great starting point for our quest to find websites that offer information on these three topics.\n\n1. **Public Libraries in The Netherlands** - The left map in image1 (Public libraries in The Netherlands) contains red dots representing library locations. You can refer to this map to explore the distribution of libraries within the country, but it does not directly address the URL providing additional information. However, the [link for the map](https://w.wiki/6dx) provides access to more data on Dutch public libraries, although the exact content is not specified in the quote.\n\n2. **Dutch National Heritage Sites** - The center map in image1 (Dutch national heritage sites) shows red dots marking the locations of such historically and culturally significant locations. Though, like the libraries map, it doesn't have an explicit URL, the [link for the map](https://w.wiki/6dy) may offer more context and information on these heritage sites.\n\nRegrettably, image1 does not explicitly contain a \"Big cities\" map. It does, however, feature a third map highlighting some major cities, mainly in Asia, which could be what you had in mind when referring to \"Big cities.\"\n\nNow that we've exhausted the leads from image1, let's examine some other text and image quotes. Text quote [1] includes a link to a map of Dutch Public Libraries, and text quote [9] includes a link to a heat map of the public libraries in the Netherlands. You can utilize both of these resources to find more information specifically related to Dutch libraries.\n\nIn summary, the websites that provide information on public libraries in the Netherlands, Dutch national heritage sites, and big cities include:\n\n- [Public libraries in The Netherlands map](https://w.wiki/6dx)\n- [Dutch National Heritage Sites map](https://w.wiki/6dy)\n- [Netherlands Public Libraries Heat Map](http://okezelig.github.io/Wiki data Map Making Workshop/Netherlands Public Libraries Heat map.html)\n- [Dutch Public Libraries Map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data:Dutch_Public_Libraries.map)\n\nExploring these websites in depth should offer you valuable insights related to your original question."}

This is known as diminishing marginal utility [4](image4). As shown in the table, consuming the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, while consuming the second hot dog gives +4. By the time an individual consumes the third hot dog, there is no increase in utility; instead, it remains at 0. After the third hot dog, consuming additional hot dogs actually decreases the utility, to -1 for the fourth hot dog, -4 for the fifth, and -10 for the sixth.\n\nThis pattern of diminishing marginal utility is further emphasized in the concept of differential outcome [5](image5). Here, utility jumps dramatically at 64 hot dogs, increasing from -50 to +5000. This illustrates the idea that, at some point, consuming additional quantities of the same item can bring about a significantly different outcome.\n\nIn relation to consumption behavior, this implies that, as enjoyment drops with each additional unit consumed, people should switch to another choice or engage in a different activity. In other words, as the utility of consuming a hot dog decreases, people may find more enjoyment in a different food item or activity instead. This is also in line with [9], which suggests that variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences.\n\nIn short, the utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, suggesting that consumption behavior should shift towards other options as enjoyment wanes."}

The fuel pump increases the pressure of the fuel, which is then passed through a fuel filter to remove impurities [2]. High pressure fuel is then transmitted to the fuel rail, which distributes fuel to the individual fuel injectors [2, 3]. \n\nAdditionally, there are supporting subsystems for fuel supply. A cold start system enhances fuel delivery when starting the engine under cold conditions [4, 5]. A fuel pressure regulator maintains the correct pressure in the fuel rail and returns excess fuel back to the fuel supply through the return line [2]. These connections within the fuel supply system demonstrate the essential role that fuel plays in engine operation and the precise control required to ensure appropriate fuel delivery to the engine.\n\nAs for the image response, it highlights a fuel injection system with a fuel supply path:\n\n![The image is a diagram of a fuel injection system, showing the fuel supply path from the FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM through FUEL FILTER to FUEL PUMP, HIGH PRESSURE, FUEL RAIL, FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR, and finally to FUEL INJECTORS.](image2)\n\nTo sum up, the fuel supply system is connected to the electrical fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel rail, fuel pressure regulator, and fuel injectors, along with the cold start system to ensure appropriate fuel delivery to the engine."}

Its function is to raise questions based on data turned into information. The outputs of reporting include reports, dashboards, and alerts, presented without context. In the context of the analytics value chain, reporting plays a vital role in the initial stages of data collection and preparation.\n\nOn the other hand, analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, and focused on why things happen, providing answers to raised questions. By combining data, information, and context, analysis generates findings, recommendations, and insights. As shown in image4, analysis is the critical step in the data-driven process that transforms data into value, leading to informed actions and, ultimately, increased value.\n\nIn the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics (image3), reporting and analysis evolve in terms of business value and the degree of intelligence applied. Reporting starts at standard reports, addressing \"What happened?\" and moves on to ad-hoc reports, answering \"How many, how often, where?\" and query drill-downs, determining \"Where exactly is the problem?\". Analysis then follows, progressing from alerts that determine \"What actions are needed?\" to predictive modeling that predicts \"What will happen next?\".\n\nThus, the concepts of reporting and analysis contribute to the analytics value chain by preparing data and providing insights, which are leveraged to create impact throughout the organization (as mentioned in quote [2]). They play essential roles in the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, with reporting focusing on raising questions and analysis concentrating on answering them in deeper, more insightful ways.\n\nIn conclusion, reporting and analysis are both essential elements of the analytics value chain, with reporting initiating the process by turning data into information and analysis driving insights from information to ultimately create value and inform decisions in the business analytics stages."}

This is because our desire or enjoyment for that good or service tends to decrease as we consume more of it.\n\nIn standard consumption, such as consuming hot dogs, we can observe this concept in action. As shown in image4, the utility gained from consuming the first hot dog is high, but it decreases as more hot dogs are consumed. By the time we reach the sixth hot dog, the utility has dropped to -10. This is a clear illustration of diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption.\n\nHowever, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can differ significantly in a competitive context, as illustrated by the same hot dog consumption example. Image5 shows a table that compares diminishing marginal utility with differential outcome, with the latter showing a dramatic increase in utility at 64 hot dogs consumed. This jump in utility can be attributed to the competitive element, where consuming 64 hot dogs ties the individual with a competitor for a championship in 2007.\n\nIn summary, while the concept of diminishing marginal utility is present in both standard consumption and competitive contexts, the latter can generate a differential outcome, reversing the declining utility curve. In the hot dog consumption scenario, consuming 64 hot dogs leads to a substantial positive utility in a competitive context, while the same quantity of hot dogs consumption results in negative utility in a standard consumption setting.\n\n![In a competitive context, consuming more of a good can result in a positive utility, whereas in standard consumption, consuming more of the same good tends to decrease the utility.](image5)\n\nThe importance of focus in achieving mastery in a particular area is still a relevant and interesting question. While mere repetition of an activity will not automatically result in improvement, focus can lead to increased utility due to improved activity experience and improved activity outcome. As the initial text quote states [1], larger school athletes may hone their abilities at a specific position and spend more time with coaches, increasing their focused practice hours and refining their skills. When enjoyment drops in standard consumption, as outlined [3], variety is essential, and focused practice is vital for competitive mastery [5]. However, as text quote [9] highlights, the improvement may be minimal even for highly motivated subjects, meaning that focus, enjoyment, and outcomes are interconnected. When focus pays off, it can make the game more fun to play [3] and increase the chances of winning. Over time, this focus and dedication can lead to mastery in the chosen area.\n\n![Focus is important when trying to achieve mastery in some area as it leads to increased utility through improved activity experience and improved activity outcome.](image1)"}

The Zhaolanyuan Supermarket operates from 9:00am to 8:00pm (image1). These consistent hours allow students to plan their shopping schedules conveniently.\n\nOn the other hand, off-campus supermarkets like Lotus Supermarket, BHG Supermarket, and Carrefour in the Wudaokou and Zhongguancun areas may have different opening hours. For example, Lotus Supermarket and BHG Supermarket are open from 9:00am to 9:00pm, while Carrefour operates from 8:30am to 10:00pm on weekdays (image5). This discrepancy in off-campus supermarket hours might affect students' shopping schedules if they plan to purchase items outside the campus during weekends or late at night.\n\nIn summary, on-campus supermarkets offer more consistent and often longer opening hours, which can be more convenient for students with limited time availability. Off-campus supermarkets might have more variable hours, which could impact students' shopping schedules, particularly if they rely on these external stores for specific items or extended operating hours.\n\n![On-campus supermarkets have more consistent and longer opening hours](image1)"}

This includes the metering modes and focus modes.\n\nFor metering modes, there are three options: Matrix, Center, and Spot Metering. Matrix Metering Mode measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for shooting natural landscapes as it provides an average light measurement of the entire scene [5]. Center Metering Mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is beneficial when shooting portraits as it ensures the subject is well-exposed [5]. Spot Metering Mode focuses on light from a specific region, allowing you to highlight a particular area such as a subject's eyes [5].\n\nIn terms of focus modes, AF-S (single), AF-C (continuous), and MF (manual) are available. AF-S (single) is ideal for stationary subjects, ensuring sharp focus in still shots [1]. AF-C (continuous) is designed for moving subjects, continuously adjusting focus to keep up with movement [2]. MF (manual) gives you the freedom to manually select the focus point, useful when you want to specifically pinpoint what part of the image should be in sharp focus, such as a subject's face [3].\n\nTo adjust these settings, you can touch the corresponding icons in the Pro mode interface. For instance, you can touch 'M' to select a metering mode or touch the location on the viewfinder to adjust focus [6]. The interface also provides other manual adjustments like ISO sensitivity, shutter speed, EV exposure compensation, and white balance [2].\n\nSo, understanding and effectively using these metering and focus modes in Pro Mode can significantly enhance photography under various scenarios.\n\n![Enhancing Photography with Pro Mode's Metering and Focus Modes](image5)\n\nIn summary, understanding and effectively using these metering and focus modes in Pro Mode can significantly enhance photography under various scenarios."}

This comparison is based on [4] and [5].\n\nIn the dataset from quote [4], the MQL to SAL conversion rate is 1.50%. Meanwhile, the cross-industry average conversion rate at this stage, as presented in quote [5], is 4-8%. This difference could imply that the company described in quote [4] may need to enhance its marketing and sales alignment or lead qualification processes, as their MQL to SAL conversion rate falls significantly below the cross-industry average.\n\nThe lower conversion rate out of the MQL stage might result in missed opportunities for the sales team, as they might not be engaging with enough potential customers. Additionally, marketing efforts could be sub-optimized, as they might not be focusing enough on generating high-quality, sales-ready leads. Ultimately, improving the MQL to SAL conversion rate could lead to more effective sales and marketing teams and enhanced revenue generation.\n\nTo address this issue, the organization can consider investing in improved marketing automation tools and strategies, such as lead scoring and nurturing campaigns, to ensure a smoother transition from MQL to SAL. Moreover, fostering stronger collaboration between marketing and sales teams can help better define the criteria for sales-ready leads and create a more efficient hand-off process, enhancing the overall MQL to SAL conversion rate.\n\n - MQL to SAL conversion rate, as per quote [4]: 1.50%\n - Cross-industry average MQL to SAL conversion rate, as per quote [5]: 4-8%\n\n![Conversion Rates from MQL to SAL](image5) ![Marketing and Sales Metrics](image1)\n\n(The first image displays cross-industry average conversion rates at various stages of a sales funnel, while the second image shows marketing and sales metrics, including the MQL to SAL conversion rate ratio within the context of other marketing performance measures.)"}
