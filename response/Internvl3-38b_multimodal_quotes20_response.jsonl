This concern is reflected in their anticipation of negative outcomes, such as increased inequality (76% think it's likely) and difficulty finding meaningful work (64%) [image1]. However, there is also a belief in potential positive outcomes, with 43% seeing the economy becoming more efficient and 40% expecting new, better-paying jobs [image1].\n\nA majority (85%) of Americans are familiar with the concept of automation impacting jobs, with 24% having heard a lot about it [2]. Among those most aware, 48% find it extremely realistic and 47% express enthusiasm, though worry remains high at 76% [image6]. This suggests that awareness correlates with both realism and heightened concern.\n\nAmericans strongly favor limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs (85% of Democrats and 86% of Republicans agree) [image2]. They are also supportive of a universal basic income (66% of Democrats, 38% of Republicans) and national service programs for displaced workers (77% of Democrats, 46% of Republicans) [image2].

According to text [2], nearly six-in-ten Republicans (59%) believed GOP leaders should work with Obama, while 36% wanted them to \"stand up\" to him. This sentiment was even stronger among Obama's own supporters: 78% of Obama voters and 76% of McCain voters felt Democratic leaders should collaborate with Republicans, even if it disappointed their base [6]. Image5 supports this, showing that 60% of all voters, 52% of Obama voters, and 69% of McCain voters favored cooperation. This indicates a relatively high level of bipartisanship and optimism about the potential for cross-party collaboration.\n\nIn contrast, by 2016, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically. Text [1] highlights that most Democrats wanted their leaders to stand up to Trump rather than work with him, with Democratic support for cooperation being significantly lower than GOP support for working with Obama in 2008. Image8 illustrates this stark difference: only 32% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted leaders to work with Trump, while 65% preferred standing up to him. This is a marked change from 2008, where 86% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted leaders to work with Obama. Additionally, text [12] emphasizes that 65% of Democrats felt leaders should stand up to Trump on important issues, even if less gets done in Washington.\n\nThe 2016 election was also characterized by heightened negativity. Text [7] notes that 92% of voters felt there was more \"mudslinging\" than in past elections, a sentiment reflected in image1, which shows a peak in perceived mudslinging in 2016. This negativity likely contributed to the reluctance among Democrats to cooperate with Trump. Image3 further underscores this division: while 84% of Clinton voters wanted Democratic leaders to stand up to Trump, only 26% of Trump voters felt the same about working with Democratic leaders.\n\nMoreover, image4 reveals that both parties received low grades for their conduct during the 201"}

According to the text quotes, almost all voters (92%) felt there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared to past elections, marking a substantial increase from previous years [2, 12]. This sentiment is visually reinforced by image1, which shows a sharp rise in the percentage of voters perceiving more mudslinging in 2016 compared to previous elections.\n\nThis pervasive negativity influenced how voters graded various political actors. Both major parties received their lowest grades ever, with only 22% of voters giving the Republican Party and 26% giving the Democratic Party an A or B [3]. Image4 illustrates these low grades, showing the Republican Party and Democratic Party receiving average grades of D+ and C-, respectively. Similarly, the press and pollsters were harshly criticized, with only 22% and 21% of voters awarding them A or B grades, respectively [7], and image4 confirms these low ratings.\n\nVoters also reflected on their own role, with only 40% giving themselves an A or B, the lowest percentage since 1996 [11]. This self-criticism aligns with the overall negative tone of the campaign, suggesting a collective dissatisfaction with the political process.\n\nThe emotional responses to the election results further highlight the impact of campaign negativity. Image5 shows that 53% of all voters felt uneasy, while 51% felt hopeful, indicating a divided emotional landscape. Image8 provides a detailed breakdown, with Trump voters expressing positive emotions like happiness (67%) and relief (46%), while Clinton voters predominantly felt shocked (101%), disappointed (68%), and disgusted (45%). This stark contrast underscores the polarizing effect of the campaign's negativity.\n\nIn summary, the heightened perception of negativity in the 2016 campaign led to widespread dissatisfaction with political entities, including the parties, press, and even voters themselves, and contributed to deeply divided emotional reactions among voters. The evidence from both text and images consistently points to a campaign that left a lasting negative impression on the electorate. \n\n**Answer:** Voter perceptions of political entities in the 2016 election were overwhelmingly negative, driven by the highly negative campaign tone, leading to low grades for parties, the press, and even voters themselves, and resulting in polarized emotional responses."}

According to the data, a majority of Trump voters felt positive emotions such as \"happy\" (67%) and \"surprised\" (60%), with many also expressing relief (46%) and hope (26%) [2][5][8][12]. In contrast, Clinton voters predominantly felt negative emotions, with \"shocked\" (101%), \"disappointed\" (68%), and \"disgusted\" (45%) being the most common responses [10][12]. This division highlights the polarized reactions to Trump's victory.\n\nThe overall perception of Trump's performance and the level of mudslinging in the election further contextualize these emotional responses. A significant majority of voters (92%) believed there was more mudslinging than in past elections, marking a record high [7][6]. This negative campaigning likely contributed to the heightened emotions, particularly among Clinton voters who felt uneasy (90%), sad (77%), and scared (76%) [5][6]. The low grades given to Trump (30% A/B) and the Republican Party (22% A/B) reflect the dissatisfaction and unease among Clinton supporters [11][12].\n\nDespite the negative perceptions, a substantial portion of voters (53%) still felt uneasy about Trump's election, while 51% felt hopeful, indicating a mix of apprehension and optimism [6]. This ambivalence is further underscored by the fact that 79% of all voters believed the election results would have a lasting impact on the country, with Clinton voters (81%) more likely to feel this way than Trump voters (78%) [5][8].\n\nIn summary, the emotional divide between Trump and Clinton voters is evident, with positive emotions dominating among Trump supporters and negative emotions among Clinton supporters. This divide is closely tied to the highly negative campaign and the significant mudslinging, which influenced voters' perceptions of Trump's performance and the election's impact.\n\n![Trump and Clinton voters' emotional reactions](image2)  \n![Grades given to campaign actors](image1)  \n![Mudslinging perceptions over time](image6)  \n![Impact of election results](image5)  \n![Emotional reactions to Trump's election](image8)  \n\n**Answer:** Trump voters predominantly felt"}

This is further supported by image8, which shows that \"Happy\" was the most frequent reaction among Trump voters, with 67 mentions, followed by \"Surprised\" (60 mentions) and \"Relieved\" (46 mentions).

This high level of surprise underscores a significant gap between voter expectations and the actual outcome.\n\n**Comparison and Expectations:**\n- The stark contrast in reactions—Trump voters being predominantly happy and relieved, while Clinton voters were shocked and disappointed—reveals a deep divide in expectations. The high percentage of surprise among both groups (60% of Trump voters and 87% of Clinton voters) suggests that the election result was unexpected for many, regardless of their candidate preference. This indicates that the election was highly unpredictable, with both sides experiencing a mix of emotions that reflect the unprecedented nature of the campaign and its outcome.\n\nIn summary, Trump voters were largely positive but also surprised, while Clinton voters were overwhelmingly shocked and negative, highlighting a significant mismatch in pre-election expectations and the unexpected nature of Trump's victory. \n\n![Trump voters were mostly happy but also surprised](image8) ![Clinton voters were shocked"}

Younger Germans are notably more skeptical about the role of these bases in their national security. According to the data, roughly six-in-ten Germans aged 18 to 29 believe that U.S. military bases do not contribute to Germany’s defense [10]. This contrasts sharply with older Germans, particularly those aged 65 and older, where 61% view the bases as important for national security [10]. This generational divide highlights a shift in attitudes, with younger Germans being more likely to question the necessity of the U.S. military presence.\n\n![Younger Germans are more skeptical of U.S. military bases](image8)\n\n### Political Affiliations in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., political affiliation plays a crucial role in shaping views on foreign policy partners and the importance of military bases in Germany. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to prioritize Israel as a foreign policy partner compared to Democrats, with 26% naming Israel as a top partner, compared to 9% of Democrats [9][11]. Democrats, on the other hand, place greater emphasis on Canada and Mexico [9]. Despite these differences, both parties in the U.S. strongly support the presence of American military bases in Germany, though Republicans are slightly more supportive. For instance, 63% of Republicans and 75% of Democrats believe these bases are important to U.S. security interests [8][12].\n\n![Republicans and Democrats differ on foreign policy partners](image1)\n\n### Foreign Policy Partners in Germany\n\nGerman political affiliations also influence views on foreign policy partners. Supporters of the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens predominantly name France as a top partner, followed by the U.S. [3]. The CDU/CSU has the highest percentage (51%) favoring France, while the Greens are the least likely (28%) [3][image2]. This indicates a consensus among major German parties on prioritizing France, though with varying degrees of emphasis.\n\n![German political parties prioritize France](image2)\n\n### Summary\n\nIn Germany, younger individuals are less likely to see U.S. military bases as important, while older Germans hold a more positive view. In the U.S., Republicans and Democrats differ in their top foreign policy partners, with Republicans favoring Israel and Democrats leaning towards Canada and Mexico, yet both groups strongly support the military presence"}

According to the text, more than half of Americans (54%) say China has done a bad job dealing with the outbreak, with 28% considering it \"very bad\" [2]. This sentiment is reflected in image1, which shows that 45% of Americans rate China's pandemic response as \"very bad\" and 34% as \"somewhat bad,\" totaling 79% with a negative view. In comparison, only 16% think China has done a \"somewhat good\" job, and a mere 2% rate it as \"very good\" [8].

Text [9] states that 90% of U.S. adults hold this view, a perspective shared across demographic groups. Image6 confirms this, showing that 90% say China does not respect personal freedoms, while only 8% believe it does. This perception is influenced by events like crackdowns in Hong Kong and the treatment of ethnic minorities, as highlighted in text [9].\n\n**Priorities for U.S. Relations with China:**\n\nDespite these negative perceptions, Americans prioritize economic relations over human rights issues. Image6 illustrates that 70% of Americans believe the U.S. should prioritize economic relations with China, even if it means not addressing human rights issues, compared to 26% who advocate promoting human rights at the expense of economic ties. This preference is consistent across political leanings, though liberals (76%) are slightly more supportive of prioritizing human rights than conservatives (72%) [5].\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmericans are highly critical of China's COVID-19 response and its respect for personal freedoms, yet they prioritize economic relations over human rights concerns in U.S.-China interactions.

According to the text, ratings of personal finances improved among most Latino groups, with a 17 percentage point increase overall, from 23% in 2008 to 40% in 2015 [10]. This improvement was more pronounced among younger Latinos (ages 18 to 29), who saw a 27 percentage point increase, doubling their positive financial assessments [2]. Similarly, U.S.-born Hispanics and those with less than a high school education also reported significant gains, with increases of 17 and 12 percentage points, respectively [6].\n\nHowever, perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living remained largely unchanged for Hispanics between 2014 and 2015. About half of all Hispanic adults felt their income was falling behind the cost of living, similar to the U.S. public as a whole [4]. This is reflected in image1, which shows that in 2015, 53% of Hispanics felt they were falling behind financially, compared to 53% in 2014, indicating stability in this perception despite overall improvements in personal finance ratings.\n\nImage6 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes across different Latino subgroups. For example, U.S.-born Latinos saw a 17 percentage point increase in positive financial assessments, while foreign-born Latinos had a 14 percentage point increase. Education levels also played a role, with high school graduates and those with some college education showing substantial gains of 16 and 17 percentage points, respectively [6].\n\nImage3 highlights the overall improvement in financial perceptions among all Hispanics, with a 14 percentage point increase from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015, outpacing the general public's 6 percentage point increase over the same period.

According to the text, 24% of men say they more often see people trying to be deceptive, compared to 13% of women [1]. This is further illustrated in image4, which shows that men are more likely to encounter deceptive content (24%) than women (13%). In contrast, women are slightly more likely to see attempts to correct misinformation, with 17% of women pointing out inaccurate information compared to 17% of men, though the majority of both groups (63%) see an equal mix [1]. This suggests that men might be more exposed to or more likely to notice deceptive content, which could influence how platforms prioritize fact-checking and correction mechanisms.\n\n### Perceptions of Bullying and Supportive Behavior\nMen are also more likely to encounter bullying behavior. The text indicates that 29% of men more often see mean or bullying content, compared to 19% of women [3]. Image4 confirms this, showing that men (29%) are more likely than women (19%) to see bullying behavior, while women (24%) are more likely to see kind or supportive behavior than men (17%) [3]. This disparity implies that platforms might need to focus more on anti-bullying measures and support systems for male users, while leveraging supportive content to engage women.\n\n### Emotional Responses to Social Media\nEmotional responses to social media vary by gender. Image1 shows that while both genders frequently feel amused (88%), men are more likely to feel angry (71% vs. 69% for women) and less likely to feel connected (69% vs. 71% for women). Women are slightly more likely to feel inspired (69% vs. 69% for men) and less likely to feel depressed (49% vs. 31% for men). These differences suggest that platforms could tailor content to mitigate negative emotions in men, such as anger, and enhance positive emotions like connection and inspiration for women.\n\n### Acceptance of Data Use for Recommendations\nMen and women differ in their comfort with data use for recommendations.

This polarization underscores the impact of political leadership and economic conditions on public sentiment.\n\nRegarding views on Wall Street's impact on the economy, Republicans and Democrats have consistently held opposing views. In 2019, 55% of Republicans believed Wall Street helps the economy more than it hurts, while 46% of Democrats thought it hurts more than it helps [8][12][image8].

Additionally, 29% of STEM workers hold a master's, doctorate, or professional degree, significantly higher than the 12% of non-STEM workers [6]. This higher educational attainment is reflected in the sectors they work in, with STEM workers being more concentrated in private, for-profit sectors. For instance, 66% of STEM workers are employed in private, for-profit settings, similar to the overall workforce, but with notable concentrations in fields like engineering (82%) and computer work (77%) [7]. In contrast, non-STEM workers are more likely to be self-employed (11% vs. 6% for STEM workers) [3]. Furthermore, STEM workers with associate degrees are more likely to have jobs closely related to their education (77%) compared to non-STEM workers (28%) [9]. This alignment of education with job relevance suggests that STEM workers' higher education levels contribute to their employment in sectors that require specialized knowledge, such as private industries, while non-STEM workers with lower educational attainment may be more prevalent in self-employment or government roles. \n\n![STEM workers are more likely to work in private, for-profit sectors compared to non-STEM workers](image4)  \n![STEM workers have higher educational attainment compared to non-STEM workers](image6)  \n![STEM workers with associate degrees have jobs closely related to their education](image3)"}

This suggests that European VC funds are more efficient in generating returns relative to their investments.\n- **Image4** visually supports this by showing that the median multiple of cash invested in Europe is **7.2**, compared to **4.5** in the USA. This indicates that European VC investments, on average, return more than double the cash invested compared to their US counterparts.\n\n### Exit Values\n- **Text Quote [9]** also mentions that although average exit values in Europe are approximately 25% smaller than in the USA, the higher capital efficiency and lower entry valuations in Europe compensate for this disadvantage.\n- **Image4** further illustrates this by showing that the median exit valuation in Europe is **$173M**, whereas in the USA it is **$236M**. However, the percentage of exits with a multiple of cash invested ≥ 5 is higher in Europe (57.26%) compared to the USA (47.27%), indicating a higher success rate in achieving significant returns.\n\n### Additional Insights\n- **Text Quote [6]** highlights that European VC is driving the best exit multiples globally, reinforcing the notion of superior performance in terms of returns.\n- **Image8** provides a historical perspective, showing that since 2004, the proportion of exits in Europe with multiples greater than 10x invested capital has been increasing, with 59% of exits achieving this, compared to 36% in the USA. This trend underscores Europe's strength in generating high-return exits.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile European VC funds have smaller average exit values, their higher capital efficiency and better performance in achieving high multiples make them more effective in generating returns relative to their investments. This is evidenced by the higher median multiple of cash invested in Europe (7.2) compared to the USA (4.5), despite smaller exit values.\n\n**Answer:** European VC funds achieve higher investment multiples and better performance in generating returns relative to their investments compared to the USA, despite having smaller average exit values."}

This encoding, along with the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM to maintain the dialogue state [3]. The dialogue state is then used by the dialogue state tracker to update the user's goal, represented by slot-value pairs [10]. The policy network, which takes the dialogue state, slot value logits, and query results encoding as inputs, emits a system action (image1). This action is used to generate a natural language response via a template-based natural language generator (NLG), where delexicalized tokens are replaced with values from the user's goal or knowledge base entities [6].\n\nFor example, if the user requests a movie for \"the day after tomorrow,\" the system's dialogue state tracking identifies the date as \"Thursday\" (image6). The policy network then formulates a system action, such as \"request(time),\" which prompts the user for a preferred time. The NLG module generates the response \"Ok, what time do you prefer?\" by combining the dialogue state and query results.\n\nThe system's end-to-end architecture ensures that each component, from utterance encoding to response generation, is fully differentiable and trainable together, optimizing the entire pipeline for task-oriented dialogue [4].\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, tracking the dialogue state, selecting an appropriate action via the policy network, and producing a natural language output using the NLG module."}

They experiment with various combinations of fixed and learned encodings, both in the encoder and decoder. The results show that removing spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, while passing them in the decoder only results in a minor drop. The baseline configuration uses fixed sine positional encodings passed at every attention layer in both the encoder and decoder, achieving the highest AP.\n- [5] describes the detailed architecture, noting that positional encodings are added to queries and keys at every multi-head self-attention layer in the encoder, and output positional encodings (object queries) are always learned.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **image3** presents a table comparing different configurations of spatial and output positional encodings. The baseline configuration (fixed sine at attention in both encoder and decoder, learned at attention in decoder) achieves the highest AP of 40.6 and AP50 of 61.6.

It found that different instruction strategies yield comparable results, indicating that the format's influence on performance is minimal. This is supported by image7, which shows box plots for F1 scores across various instruction formats (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). The performance variation is relatively small, suggesting that the choice of instruction format does not significantly affect the outcome for models like ChatGPT and Codex.\n\n**Demonstration Selection:**\n- The selection strategy for demonstrations is crucial. Image7 illustrates that both ChatGPT and Codex benefit from non-random selection strategies (e.g., embedding-based selection) over random selection, with a noticeable performance boost. The box plot for demonstration selection shows that embedding-based selection (labeled \"embed\") outperforms random selection, aligning with text quote [2], which states that sentence embedding surpasses random sampling.\n\n**Demonstration Numbers:**\n- Increasing the number of demonstrations does not always enhance performance. Image7 shows that for Codex, performance peaks at around 32 demonstrations and then plateaus, while ChatGPT sees a slight decline after 16 demonstrations. This aligns with text quote [11], which notes that NER tasks reach a stable or degraded performance with increased demo numbers, suggesting limitations in leveraging additional examples.\n\n### Comparison with Other Models\n\n**FewNERD Dataset Performance:**\n- Image1 compares F1 scores across different models (ChatGPT, Codex, InstructGPT, LLaMA, Vicuna) on the FewNERD dataset. Both ChatGPT and Codex perform competitively in low-shot settings (1-shot, 5-shot) but are outperformed by fine-tuned models (dashed lines) as the number of shots increases. This trend is consistent with text quote [5], which highlights that SLMs demonstrate marked performance enhancement with more samples, while LLMs plateau.\n\n**Confidence Score Analysis:**\n- Image3 shows Micro-F1 scores for FewNERD with and without LLM reranking.

However, for \"Task fulfillment,\" there is more variability, with a significant number of cases where only two annotators agree or no agreement at all.\n\n### Relative Evaluations\nFor relative evaluations, annotators compare responses from Chameleon against baseline models (Gemini+ and GPT-4V+) and indicate their preference. The text [6] states that in about 28% to 35% of cases, all annotators have unanimous judgments, while in 55% to 60% of cases, one annotator differs from the other two. This suggests that while there is some consistency, there is also a notable level of disagreement, making relative evaluation challenging.\n\nImage **image1** provides specific data on inter-annotator agreement for relative evaluations. It shows the percentages of cases where all three annotators agree, two annotators agree, or there is no agreement. For example, when comparing Chameleon vs. Gemini+, all annotators agree in 31.5% of cases, two annotators agree in 58.1%, and there is no agreement in 10.3%. Similar patterns are observed for comparisons with GPT-4V+, Gemini, and GPT-4V, indicating moderate agreement levels.\n\n###"}

This improvement highlights RAR's ability to refine classification decisions using nuanced context and detail, particularly beneficial for datasets with large vocabularies [12].\n\nIn zero-shot object recognition, RAR also shows strong performance but faces challenges in aligning regions with textual class descriptions due to the complexity of distinguishing subtle differences among fine-grained items [2].

As described in [5], cropping involves extracting image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates and resizing them to a fixed proportion. This is crucial because object detection datasets often contain multiple objects of varying sizes, and cropping ensures that the model focuses on the regions of interest. Blurring is then applied to non-target areas to direct the MLLMs' attention toward the relevant objects, facilitating their identification. This pre-processing is visually demonstrated in `![Pre-processing for object detection](image7)`, where bounding boxes are used to isolate objects like a flower arrangement, saltshaker, and vase, which are then encoded and retrieved from memory.\n\nNext, the system retrieves the top-k category labels using the multimodal retriever, as shown in [10]. The retrieved labels are dynamically generated and sent to the MLLMs for ranking. The MLLMs use their linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, as highlighted in [4]. This ranking process is illustrated in `![Retrieved and reranked categories](image2)`, where initial retrieval results are reranked to provide more accurate predictions (e.g., \"earring\" and \"glove\" are correctly identified from the retrieved options).\n\nFinally, the ranking prompt example in `![Ranking prompt example](image4)` demonstrates how the MLLMs sort retrieved categories based on relevance. For instance, given categories like \"Mercedes-Benz S-Class Sedan\" and \"2010 BMW M5 Sedan,\" the MLLMs rank them to identify the most accurate match, such as \"Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan.\"\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system enhances object recognition in detection datasets by preprocessing images to focus on relevant regions, retrieving potential categories, and leveraging MLLMs to rank these categories for precise identification. This approach is supported by empirical results showing improved performance in object detection tasks, as evidenced by the AP metrics in `![Object detection performance](image3)` and `![Detection performance](image5)`, where RAR outperforms baselines like CLIP with box and mask."}

According to the text, the model's performance varies when different categories are present or absent, as shown in Table 6 [2]. The image8 provides a detailed breakdown of these effects, highlighting that categories like \"Temporal coordination\" and \"Co-reference\" have a notable impact on goal prediction error. Specifically, when \"Temporal coordination\" is present, the mean error is 11.38, compared to 8.24 when absent, with a p-value of .015, indicating statistical significance. Similarly, \"Co-reference\" increases the error to 12.88 when present versus 8.59 when absent, with a p-value of .016, also significant. This suggests that instructions involving temporal coordination and co-reference are more challenging for the model to interpret accurately.\n\nOur approach, however, outperforms previous methods like Janner et al.

This improvement is further supported by image5, which shows our approach's superior performance in task completion (TC) and stop distance (SD) metrics.\n\nIn terms of human performance, image2 illustrates that humans generally rate the generated paths higher than our approach, with a higher percentage of ratings in the 4-5 range. This indicates that while our model performs well, there is still a gap compared to human-level performance, particularly in more complex scenarios. The text also notes that inherent ambiguities in instructions make exact goal identification difficult, as demonstrated by imperfect human performance [10]. Despite this, our model's separation of goal prediction and action generation significantly improves instruction execution, as shown in image5, where our approach outperforms baselines like STOP and RANDOMWALK in both LANI and CHAI datasets.\n\nIn summary, the presence of linguistic categories like temporal coordination and co-reference increases goal prediction error, but our approach still outperforms previous methods.

According to the text quotes and images provided, BERT models generally achieve higher scores across various tasks, indicating their robustness in language understanding. For instance, BERT_LARGE achieves an average GLUE score of 81.9 [5, 11], which is higher than the CNN models' scores. The CNN Base model has an average score of 77.7, while CNN Large and BPE Large have scores of 78.6 and 78.1, respectively [image5].

However, BERT_LARGE shows superior performance on some tasks involving sentence pairs, such as MRPC and RTE [6]. This is further supported by image2, which provides a detailed comparison of different models on GLUE tasks. The table in image2 shows that BERT_LARGE achieves higher scores on tasks like CoLA (60.5 vs. 52.8), SST-2 (94.9 vs. 94.6), and RTE (70.1 vs. 63.7) compared to the CNN Large model. However, the CNN Large model performs better on QNLI (89.8 vs. 91.1) and QQP (71.2 vs. 72.1). The average performance of BERT_LARGE is slightly higher (81.9 vs. 78.6), indicating its overall stronger performance.\n\n### Implications of Increasing Training Data Size on Average GLUE Score\n\nThe text and images provide insights into how increasing training data size affects the average GLUE score. According to [5], more training data can significantly increase accuracy, and this is visually confirmed by image7, which shows a clear upward trend in the average GLUE score as the number of training tokens increases from 562M to 18B. The graph in image7 demonstrates that the average GLUE score improves steadily with more data, reaching higher scores with larger datasets. This aligns with the findings in [4], which state that pre-training continues to improve performance up to 18B tokens and likely beyond.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe CNN Large model generally performs well but is outperformed by BERT_LARGE on several GLUE tasks, particularly those involving sentence pairs. Increasing the training data size leads to a consistent improvement in the average GLUE score, highlighting the importance of large-scale data in enhancing model performance.\n\n**Answer:** The CNN Large model performs comparably to BERT_LARGE on some tasks but is outperformed on others, especially sentence-pair tasks.

Here's a detailed analysis based on the provided evidence:\n\n1. **Pretraining Data**:\n   - **Common Crawl vs. News Crawl**: According to [3], Common Crawl, which retains paragraph structure, performs better than News Crawl, which consists of individual sentences. This is evident in image6, where Common Crawl (ccrawl) shows higher GLUE scores compared to News Crawl, especially for tasks like RTE.\n   - **BooksCorpus and Wikipedia**: As mentioned in [1], BooksCorpus and Wikipedia perform well on QNLI and MNLI but less well on other tasks. The strategy of concatenating examples into blocks (BWiki-blck) did not outperform using data as individual sentences (BWiki-sent), as seen in image6.\n\n2. **Modeling Approaches**:\n   - **Cloze vs. BiLM Loss**: The cloze loss outperforms the BiLM loss, as shown in image1. The cloze loss alone achieves an average GLUE score of 80.9, while combining cloze and BiLM slightly reduces performance to 80.4.\n   - **Model Architectures**: Larger models like CNN Large and BPE Large (image2) generally perform better than CNN Base, as seen in image3.

In multilingual training scenarios, as shown in image2, alignment significantly improves BLEU scores, especially for language pairs like GL+PT, where the BLEU score increases from 20.8 to 22.4. This suggests that aligning embeddings helps when multiple languages are involved, as it simplifies the learning process by placing word embeddings in a similar vector space, as explained in [2]. However, in bilingual scenarios, the impact is less pronounced. Image3 shows that for most language pairs, alignment leads to minimal or slight improvements, with some cases even showing a decrease (e.g., GL→EN and PT→EN). This aligns with [7], which indicates that a priori alignment may not be necessary in bilingual settings. Image4 provides a qualitative example, showing that multilingual pre-alignment improves translation quality, capturing nuances better than standard bilingual training. Image7 further supports this by demonstrating that pre-training alone boosts BLEU scores across all tasks, but alignment provides additional gains in multilingual contexts. Thus, while alignment is beneficial in multilingual systems, its effect is less critical in bilingual setups. \n\nIn summary, word embedding alignment is more effective in multilingual systems, enhancing BLEU scores by simplifying the learning of correspondences between languages, but its impact is limited in bilingual scenarios."}

This suggests that pre-training is particularly beneficial when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, typically with baseline BLEU scores in the range of 3-4 [4]. The text also indicates that pre-trained embeddings are more effective for more linguistically similar translation pairs [3], [11]. For instance, the gain from pre-training is highest for language pairs like ES → PT and FR → PT, which are more linguistically similar, compared to RU → PT and HE → PT, which are less similar [1].\n\nThe images provide visual evidence supporting these observations. Image1 shows that language pairs with higher linguistic similarity, such as ES → PT (West-Iberian) and FR → PT (Western Romance), exhibit larger BLEU score improvements with pre-training compared to RU → PT (Indo-European) and HE → PT (No Common). This aligns with the hypothesis that more similar languages benefit more from pre-training due to more consistent semantic neighborhoods [3].\n\nImage2 illustrates the relationship between training set size and BLEU score improvements. The graph shows that the largest gains from pre-training occur when the training set size is moderate (around 0.4-0.6), confirming the \"sweet spot\" where pre-training is most effective [4]. For example, PT → EN and TR → EN show significant BLEU increases in this range, while RU → EN benefits less as the training set size grows, indicating diminishing returns with larger datasets.\n\nImage3 provides training set sizes for various language pairs, which helps contextualize the results in Image2. For instance, RU → EN has a much larger training set (208,106 sentences) compared to GL → EN (10,017 sentences), explaining why RU → EN sees smaller relative gains from pre-training as the training set size increases.\n\nImage4 further supports the role of training set size by showing that pre-training improves F-measure for low-frequency words, which are more critical in low-resource scenarios [7].

This alignment helps in putting the word embeddings of different languages into similar vector spaces, facilitating easier learning for the model [7]. However, in bilingual scenarios, a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary [6].\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n\n- **Image4** shows the BLEU scores for different language pairs with and without alignment. For GL→EN, alignment slightly decreases performance (12.8 to 11.5), while for BE→EN, it slightly increases (3.0 to 3.0). For RU→EN, alignment improves performance (21.1 to 21.4). This suggests that alignment benefits vary by language pair, with more significant gains in some cases.\n\n- **Image8** provides BLEU scores for multilingual systems.

The red bars (pre-trained) consistently outperform the blue bars (standard) across all frequency ranges, especially for low-frequency words (0-9). This visual evidence confirms that pre-training enhances the model's ability to handle rare vocabulary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlignment of word embeddings improves translation performance in multilingual systems, particularly when languages are dissimilar, as seen in Image4 and Image8.

The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through experiments on four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) from SemEval 2014, 2015, and 2016. The text highlights that both pretraining and multi-task learning are beneficial, and combining them (PRET+MULT) achieves significant improvements over LSTM+ATT models trained only on aspect-level data [7].\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n\n- **image1** shows the performance comparison of various methods across the four datasets. The combined approach (PRET+MULT) achieves the highest accuracy and macro-F1 scores on all datasets, indicating that both components contribute positively to the model's performance.

The key observations are:\n  - Transfer is helpful in all settings, with improvements observed even when only one layer is transferred.\n  - Transfers of the LSTM and embedding layers are more useful than the output layer, especially for D3 and D4, where the embedding layer transfer is more beneficial due to the unbalanced label distribution [8].\n\n### Varying the Percentage of Document-Level Training Examples\n\nThe text mentions that increasing the percentage of document-level training examples leads to stable improvements in accuracy across all datasets and stable improvements in macro-F1 scores for D1 and D2. For D3 and D4, there are sharp increases in macro-F1 scores when the percentage changes from 0 to 0.4, likely due to their extremely large datasets and the need for more training examples to capture sentiment patterns [4].\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n\n- **image3** illustrates the changes in accuracy and macro-F1 scores as the percentage of document-level training examples increases. \n  -"}

The company's hedging strategies and the impact on comprehensive income and cash flow hedges can be analyzed through several key points:\n\n1. **Foreign Exchange Risk Management**:\n   - Novo Nordisk primarily hedges its foreign exchange risk using forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options [5]. The majority of its sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD, and GBP, with the most significant risks in USD, CNY, and JPY due to Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy with EUR [3]. The company hedges up to 24 months forward, aiming to reduce short-term impacts on earnings and cash flow [1].\n\n2. **Impact of Exchange Rate Changes**:\n   - The exchange rates for major currencies showed notable changes in 2020. For instance, the USD decreased by 9.3% against the DKK, while the CNY decreased by 3.1%, and the JPY decreased by 3.8% ![Exchange rate changes](image3). These fluctuations directly affected the company's financial results, as foreign exchange risk is a critical factor in its financial risk management [12].\n\n3. **Hedging Activities**:\n   - The total derivative financial instruments amounted to DKK 63,390 million at year-end 2020, with a positive fair value of DKK 2,332 million and a negative fair value of DKK 1,365 million ![Derivative financial instruments](image2).

This significant shift from a liability to an asset was influenced by several key factors:\n\n1. **Income/(Charge) to the Income Statement**: There was a charge of DKK 1,107 million, primarily due to deferred tax adjustments recognized for prior years, which reduced the net deferred tax asset. This is evident from the deferred tax adjustments recognized for prior years amounting to DKK 1,107 million in 2020, as shown in image2.\n\n2. **Income/(Charge) to Other Comprehensive Income**: A charge of DKK 577 million was recorded, which further impacted the net deferred tax position.

This change can be attributed to several factors, including the adoption of new lease accounting standards and potential growth in the company's leasing activities.\n\n**Evidence and Analysis:**\n\n1. **Operating Lease Liabilities Overview:**\n   - In 2019, the total operating lease liabilities were $797 million, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 7 years and a discount rate of 3.1% [image8].\n   - By 2020, these liabilities increased to $974 million, with a slightly reduced weighted average remaining lease term of 7 years and a lower discount rate of 2.8% [image8].\n\n2. **Adoption of New Lease Accounting Standards:**\n   - The increase in operating lease liabilities from 2019 to 2020 is likely due to the adoption of ASC 842, which requires companies to recognize operating leases on the balance sheet. This change in accounting standards would have led to the recognition of previously off-balance-sheet leases, thereby increasing the reported liabilities [image8].\n\n3. **Lease Expense Analysis:**\n   - The total operating lease expense increased from $241 million in 2019 to $262 million in 2020, with fixed operating lease expenses rising from $196 million to $216 million. This suggests an expansion in the company's leasing activities or higher lease costs [image1].\n\n4. **Impact of Acquisitions:**\n   - The Cytiva Acquisition in 2020 may have contributed to the increase in lease liabilities, as acquisitions often involve taking on new lease obligations [11].\n\n5. **Maturity of Lease Liabilities:**\n   - The maturity schedule shows that a significant portion of the lease payments are due in the near term (2021: $213 million), indicating that the company has committed to substantial lease obligations in the short term, which could be a result of strategic expansion or new lease agreements [image8].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe company's operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 842 and potential growth in leasing activities, possibly influenced by acquisitions like Cyt"}

Specifically, in 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards. This is further supported by [5], which reiterates the same points. \n\n![Effective tax rate increased from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, with net discrete tax benefits decreasing from $475 million to $122 million](image5)\n\nThe effective tax rate rose from 18.3% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2020, as shown in image5. The net discrete tax provisions (benefits) decreased significantly from $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020. This reduction in tax benefits contributed to the higher effective tax rate.\n\nIn terms of compensation expenses, [1] indicates that compensation and benefits expenses increased by 11% in 2020, reaching $20,854 million, primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation and formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives, driven by higher revenues and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. This increase is also reflected in image1, which shows that the total recognized compensation expense rose from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020.\n\n![Total recognized compensation expense increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020](image1)\n\nThe higher compensation expenses in 2020, partly driven by increased earnings and investment performance, likely contributed to the higher effective tax rate. The lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020, primarily from reduced conversions of employee share-based awards, further exacerbated the tax rate increase.

According to image6, the balance of total financial debt at the beginning of fiscal year 2021 was €5,503 million.

In fiscal year 2020, the changes in financial assumptions contributed to actuarial gains of €72 million, as shown in image7. However, in fiscal year 2021, these changes resulted in actuarial losses of €26 million. This shift from gains to losses indicates a negative impact on the defined benefit plans due to adverse changes in financial assumptions.\n\nThe actuarial valuations for the defined benefit obligation rely on key assumptions, including discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression, as mentioned in text quote [4]. The discount rate, a critical factor, increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021, as seen in image2. This increase in the discount rate typically reduces the present value of future benefit obligations, which could contribute to the actuarial losses observed in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, image1 illustrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the discount rate. A half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate led to a decrease of €242 million in the defined benefit obligation in 2021, compared to a decrease of €227 million in 2020. This sensitivity highlights how changes in financial assumptions, particularly the discount rate, directly affect the actuarial calculations and the resulting gains or losses.\n\nIn summary, the adverse changes in financial assumptions, particularly the increase in the discount rate, led to a significant shift from actuarial gains in 2020 to losses in 2021, impacting the financial health of Siemens Healthineers' defined benefit plans.\n\n![Actuarial gains and losses due to changes in financial assumptions](image7)  \n![Discount rate changes](image2)  \n![Sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to discount rate](image1)"}

The significant rise in shareholders' equity is driven by retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\n**Net Earnings and Comprehensive Income (2020 to 2021):**\n\nFrom [image2], we see:\n\n- **Net Earnings:** Increased from $43,253 million in 2020 to $90,807 million in 2021.\n- **Comprehensive Income:** Increased from $44,272 million in 2020 to $91,041 million in 2021.\n\nThe substantial increase in net earnings is reflected in the growth of retained earnings, which is a component of shareholders' equity. Additionally, comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on investments, which also impact accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\n**Relationship Between Changes:**\n\nThe rise in shareholders' equity is directly linked to the higher net earnings and comprehensive income. The increase in liabilities, particularly in insurance-related items, aligns with the higher earnings, as more funds are retained and invested, leading to higher liabilities from investments and operations. The strong performance in net earnings and comprehensive income contributes to the overall increase in equity, enhancing Berkshire's financial strength.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity from 2020 to 2021 is closely tied to the significant growth in net earnings and comprehensive income, reflecting improved operational performance and investment gains.\n\n![Total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased from 2020 to 2021](image4)\n![Net earnings"}

Specific focus was given to portfolio impacts, demand for commodities, decarbonization costs, and Scope 3 emissions [2]. The Board routinely discussed climate change as a material governance and strategic issue, involving the Sustainability Committee in overseeing climate performance and governance responsibilities [6]. The Risk and Audit Committee assisted in climate-related risk management, with the Board retaining overall accountability [6]. The Committee acknowledged global trends in climate disclosure and considered requests for Paris-aligned financial statements [3]. Climate change risks and their financial implications were a focus area for the Committee [9]. The Board also monitored performance against HSEC targets, including emissions targets, and reviewed climate-related disclosures in financial statements [image2].\n\n**Director Training:**\n- Directors received briefings on climate change as part of their development sessions, alongside other strategic topics like innovation and technology [image5]. The Board's training and development program included updates to committee terms of reference and training for members [image2]. Succession planning involved a rigorous approach, ensuring new appointments aligned with the Board's evolving needs and included climate-related skills [image6]. The Board's governance practices emphasized the independence of Non-Executive Directors and addressed potential conflicts, ensuring they could apply objective judgement [8]. Training and development programs were part of the Board's continuous improvement efforts, with specific sessions on climate change and other critical areas [image5, image8].\n\nIn summary, BHP's governance framework in FY2021 integrated climate change risks into strategic and financial planning while providing directors with targeted training to address these challenges effectively."}

This decrease was due to strong concentrator throughput, lower deferred stripping costs, and higher by-product credits, despite challenges like COVID-19 impacts and a decline in copper concentrate feed grade.\n- **Production**: Text [3] indicates that Escondida's production in FY2022 is expected to be between 1,000 and 1,080 kt, reflecting ongoing mine development catch-up from FY2021.\n- **Financial Performance**: Image1 shows Escondida's revenue increased to US\\$9,470 million in FY2021 from US\\$6,719 million in FY2020, with Underlying EBITDA rising to US\\$6,483 million from US\\$3,535 million.

This increase was primarily driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for legal provisions, as noted in the financial statements. However, this was partly offset by a USD 650 million upfront payment for the in-license of tislelizumab from BeiGene, Ltd.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n1. **Higher Operating Income Adjusted for Non-Cash Items:**\n   - The operating income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items increased from USD 17,952 million in 2020 to USD 18,719 million in 2021. This adjustment included depreciation, amortization, and changes in provisions, contributing positively to the free cash flow [8][9][10][11][12].\n\n2. **Lower Payments for Legal Provisions:**\n   - The decrease in payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year, positively impacted the cash flows [3][5][9].\n\n3. **Offset by Upfront Payment for In-License:**\n   - The USD 650 million payment for the in-license of tislelizumab reduced the free cash flow [3][9].\n\n**Financial Statement Evidence:**\n\n- **Image5** shows the reconciliation of net cash flows to free cash flow, highlighting the increase from USD 11,691 million in 2020 to USD 13,282 million in 2021.\n- **Image8** details the adjustments for non-cash items and net cash flows, illustrating the significant increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items.\n- **Text Quote [3]** and **[9]** emphasize the role of higher operating income and reduced legal provisions in driving the increase.\n\nIn summary, the free cash flow improved due to enhanced operational performance and reduced legal expenses, despite the substantial upfront payment for the in-license."}

This was primarily driven by a decrease in financial assumptions, which contributed to a loss of €26 million, compared to a gain of €72 million in the previous year. The decline in financial assumptions reflects a negative impact on the funded status of the pension plans, likely due to adverse market conditions or changes in actuarial assumptions, such as a reduction in the discount rate. \n\nThe discount rate, a critical factor in determining the present value of future pension obligations, increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021, as indicated in image6. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of future liabilities, which can lead to actuarial losses if the plan assets do not grow sufficiently to offset this reduction. This is consistent with the negative impact observed in the financial assumptions.\n\nIn contrast, fiscal year 2020 saw total actuarial gains of €67 million, with positive changes in financial assumptions contributing €72 million, as seen in image1. This suggests that the funded status of the pension plans benefited from favorable financial market conditions or more optimistic actuarial assumptions in that year.\n\nThe interplay between these financial assumptions and discount rates highlights the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to economic conditions and actuarial judgments. The management's liability-driven investment approach, as mentioned in text quote [2], aims to mitigate these risks, but the adverse changes in 2021 underscore the ongoing challenges in aligning plan assets with obligations.\n\nIn summary, the adverse changes in financial assumptions and the increase in discount rates in fiscal year 2021 led to significant actuarial losses, contrasting with the gains experienced in 2020 due to more favorable conditions.\n\n![Total actuarial gains and losses for fiscal years 2021 and 2020](image1)\n![Discount rate changes for fiscal years 2021 and 2020](image6)"}

Image4 provides a detailed view of the selected balance sheet data, showing that total assets increased by $74,089 million in 2021 compared to 2020, a 10% increase. This growth in total assets suggests that Wells Fargo was actively managing its balance sheet to enhance liquidity and interest rate risk management, as mentioned in [1]. The increase in debt securities and other assets indicates a strategic shift to bolster the company's financial position and meet potential funding needs.\n\n**WFAM Assets Under Management:**\n\nText [5] and [11] indicate that Wells Fargo sold its Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) business, which significantly impacted assets under management. Image8 shows that WFAM assets under management decreased by $587.1 billion from the beginning to the end of 2021, primarily due to the sale on November 1, 2021. This sale resulted in net gains of $674 million, as noted in [5], which positively affected the company's financial performance. The reduction in AUM reflects a strategic decision to divest non-core assets, focusing on core banking operations and improving capital efficiency.\n\n**Impact on Financial Strategy:**\n\nThe increase in total assets allowed Wells Fargo to better manage liquidity and interest rate risk, aligning with its risk management objectives. The sale of WFAM, despite reducing AUM, provided immediate gains and streamlined the company's operations, enhancing focus on core business areas. This strategic divestiture and asset management adjustments reflect a broader financial strategy aimed at optimizing capital structure and improving profitability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe increase in total assets and the divestiture of WFAM assets under management from 2020 to 2021 allowed Wells Fargo to strengthen its liquidity position and focus on core banking activities, while the sale of WFAM provided financial gains and improved capital efficiency.\n\n![Total assets increased by $74,089 million in 2021](image4)\n![WFAM assets under management decreased by $587.1 billion due"}

This is supported by text quote [10], which states that after-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased by 4.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, negatively affected by declines in interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. Additionally, image7 shows that interest and other investment income dropped from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a decrease of 44.4%, while dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million to $5,060 million, reflecting a 3.5% increase. The overall pre-tax net investment income decreased by 5.0% from $5,949 million in 2020 to $5,649 million in 2021.\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes, as seen in image6, which indicates a substantial increase in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This shift towards holding more cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, despite lower interest rates, aligns with the company's strategy to prioritize safety over yield, as mentioned in text quote [12]. The decrease in fixed maturity securities from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021 further supports the focus on liquidity and safety, as lower interest rates reduced the attractiveness of these investments. The increase in equity securities from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021 suggests a strategic reallocation to potentially higher-yielding assets to offset the decline in interest income.\n\nIn summary, the decline in net investment income was driven by lower interest rates affecting short-term investments, and the asset allocations shifted towards increased cash holdings and equity investments to manage the impact of declining interest income.\n\n![Interest and other investment income decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021](image7)\n![Cash,"}

This increase is consistent with the information in [6], which states that the discount rate impacts plan obligations and expenses, and a higher discount rate generally reduces the present value of future liabilities.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits**: The discount rate increased from 3.1% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 [image2]. This aligns with [6], indicating that higher discount rates can lead to lower benefit obligations.\n\n### Expected Return on Plan Assets Changes\n- **Pension Benefits**: The expected return on plan assets decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022 [image2]. This reduction is significant as it affects the defined benefit expense, as noted in [4], where a 100 basis point change impacts annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $125 million.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits**: The expected return on plan assets remained constant at 8.4% for both years [image2]. This stability suggests a consistent impact on the OPRB expense, as per [4], where a 100 basis point change would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $10 million.\n\n### Impact on Net Amount Recognized\n- **Pension Benefits**: The net amount recognized in 2022 was $(2,435) million, compared to $(5,428) million in 2021 [image8]. The increase in the discount rate and decrease in expected return on assets likely contributed to this change. Higher discount rates reduce the present value of obligations, while a lower expected return increases the expense, potentially affecting the net amount recognized.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits**: The net amount recognized improved from $(2,238) million in 2021 to $(3,819) million in 2022 [image8].

This indicates that the valuation and recognition of goodwill are contingent on the profitability and cash flow potential of acquired entities.\n\nExamining the image quotes, image1 provides a detailed breakdown of the goodwill components for the years 2020 and 2021. The balance at the beginning of 2021 was 380 million euros, composed of 329 million euros in guarantees and 51 million euros in other components. By the end of 2021, the balance decreased to 340 million euros, with 290 million euros in guarantees and 50 million euros in other components. The changes include disposals of 54 million euros, acquisitions of 8 million euros, and foreign exchange translation differences of 3 million euros.\n\nIn summary, the key differences are:\n- A decrease in the total goodwill balance from 380 million euros at the end of 2021 to 340 million euros at the end of 2022.\n- A reduction in the guarantees component from 329 million euros to 290 million euros.\n- A slight decrease in the other components from 51 million euros to 50 million euros.\n- Significant disposals of 54 million euros offset by smaller acquisitions and foreign exchange adjustments.\n\n![Goodwill components for 2021 and 2022](image1)\n\nThe primary driver of the change is the disposals, which significantly reduced the goodwill balance, while acquisitions and foreign exchange effects had a smaller impact."}

This significant increase indicates strong demand and expansion in this segment.\n\n**Cost of Revenues Changes:**\n- Image4 shows that the total cost of revenues increased from $3,451 million in 2019 to $4,235 million in 2020, with a variance of $784 million. While the specific breakdown for 'Salesforce Platform and Other' is not provided, the overall increase in cost of revenues suggests higher expenses associated with supporting the growing revenue base.\n\n**Impact on Financial Performance:**\n- The substantial revenue growth in 'Salesforce Platform and Other' contributes positively to the overall financial performance, as highlighted in image7, where total revenues increased by 29% from $12,413 million in 2019 to $16,043 million in 2020. This growth is a key driver of the company's financial health.\n- However, the increase in cost of revenues by 25% (from 26% to 25% of total revenues) indicates that while revenue is growing, costs are also rising, which could affect gross margins. The slight decrease in the percentage of total revenues for cost of revenues (from 26% to 25%) suggests some efficiency gains, but the absolute dollar increase remains significant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category saw a substantial revenue increase, significantly boosting overall revenues. While costs also rose, the company managed to slightly improve its cost efficiency.

This decline was primarily due to higher expected credit losses (ECL) and lower global interest rates, which negatively impacted revenue [4].

This decline is evident in the detailed breakdown in image2, which shows a net decrease in interest income of $19,747 million from 2019 to 2020, compared to a net increase of $1,939 million from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was largely due to lower rates affecting various segments, such as loans and leases, and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other banks.\n\n### Net Interest Expense Changes\n\nThe net decrease in interest expense from 2019 to 2020 was $5,245 million, as shown in image2, compared to a net increase of $2,379 million from 2018 to 2019. This reduction in 2020 was influenced by lower funding costs, reflecting the organization's ability to manage its liabilities more efficiently during the economic downturn caused by COVID-19.\n\n### Organizational Structure Reflection\n\nBank of America's organizational structure, as depicted in image1, includes segments like Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets. The Consumer Banking segment, for instance, saw a decrease in net interest income due to lower rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances [9]. This is consistent with the overall trend of lower interest rates impacting net interest income across the organization.\n\nThe detailed breakdown in image6 highlights the impact on specific segments, such as Consumer Lending and Deposits, which aligns with the broader organizational strategy to manage interest rate risk and optimize capital allocation. The efficiency in managing interest-bearing liabilities and assets, as seen in image6, reflects the integrated approach across segments to mitigate the effects of declining rates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe major differences in net interest income and expense"}

For example:\n- **Americas (AMS)**: The image shows a distribution of factories across countries like the United States, Brazil, and Canada, with the U.S. having the highest number (72 factories) [image1].\n- **Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa (AOS)**: The Greater China Region has 23 factories, indicating a significant presence [image3].\n- **Europe, Middle East, and North Africa (EMENA)**: Countries like France and Germany have multiple factories, with France having 15 and Germany 12 [image5].\n\nThese distributions highlight Nestlé's efforts to have a broad geographic spread, which can help mitigate supply chain risks by diversifying production locations and reducing dependency on any single region. This aligns with the mitigation strategy of having business continuity plans for key sites and ensuring supply chain resilience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNestlé's supply chain disruption mitigations, such as health and safety policies and business continuity plans, are supported by a widespread factory distribution across regions, as shown in the images. This geographic diversification helps in managing risks associated with supply chain disruptions.\n\n![Distribution of factories in the Americas](image1)\n![Distribution of factories in Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa](image3)\n![Distribution of factories in Europe, Middle East, and North Africa](image5)"}

This increase is primarily due to growth in current assets, particularly cash and cash equivalents, which rose from $9,352 million to $9,254 million, and receivables, which increased from $7,317 million to $8,477 million. Additionally, inventories grew from $1,185 million to $1,204 million. These increases suggest that the company has enhanced its liquidity and working capital position, which can support operational needs and investment opportunities.\n\n**Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n- **Text [1]** and **image2** show that the net cash provided by operating activities for the consolidated segment increased from $3,003 million in 2020 to $6,493 million in 2021. This significant rise is attributed to higher profit adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation. However, this was partially offset by increased working capital requirements, particularly in accounts receivable and inventory. The favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses also contributed positively to the cash flow.\n\n**Implications:**\n- The increase in total assets and operating cash flow indicates a stronger financial position, enabling the company to fund operations, invest in growth, and potentially reduce debt. The higher cash flow can also provide flexibility for strategic initiatives, such as capital expenditures or acquisitions, as seen in the increased capital expenditures from $(13,002) million in 2020 to $(1,265) million in 2021 (image2). The improved liquidity and cash flow suggest enhanced operational efficiency and financial health, which are crucial for sustaining business operations and pursuing expansion opportunities.\n\nIn summary, the consolidated segment experienced a notable increase in total assets and operating cash flow from 2020 to 2021, reflecting improved financial stability and operational performance, which can positively impact future business operations and strategic flexibility."}

The net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased by 53 basis points to 1.90 percent for 2020.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n\n- **Image1** shows a detailed breakdown of the changes in interest income and expense from 2019 to 2020. The net decrease in interest income was $19,747 million, mainly due to lower rates, while the net decrease in interest expense was $5,627 million. This resulted in a net decrease in net interest income of $14,120 million.\n- **Image8** provides average balance sheets and interest income/expense details. The net interest spread decreased from 1.90% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020, indicating a narrowing spread.\n\n**Main Contributing Factors:**\n\n1. **Lower Interest Rates:** As mentioned in text [6], the primary driver of the decrease in net interest income was lower interest rates. This is reflected in image1, where the rate change contributed significantly to the decrease in interest income across various categories like loans and leases, and deposits.\n2. **Reduced Deposit and Funding Costs:** Despite lower interest rates, the decrease in interest expense was less pronounced, as seen in image1, which shows a net decrease of $5,627 million. This suggests that the bank managed to reduce its funding costs, partially offsetting the impact on net interest income.\n3. **Deployment of Excess Deposits:** The deployment of excess deposits into securities, as noted in text [6], likely helped mitigate some of the yield compression, though the overall impact was still negative on net interest income.\n4. **Additional Day of Interest Accrual:** The additional day of interest accrual in 2020 (a leap"}

This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual.\n- **Total Revenue**: Image1 shows that total revenue for Consumer Banking decreased from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020, a decline of 12%. This decline is attributed to lower net interest income and noninterest income, as detailed in the image.\n\n### Wealth Management Sector:\n- **Net Interest Income**: Image6 indicates that net interest income for the wealth management sector decreased from $6,504 million in 2019 to $5,468 million in 2020, a 16% decrease. This decline is consistent with the broader trend of lower interest rates impacting net interest income.\n- **Total Revenue**: Image6 also shows that total revenue for the wealth management sector decreased from $19,538 million in 2019 to $18,584 million in 2020, a 5% decrease. This reduction is partly due to lower net interest income, as seen in the image.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Consumer Banking**: Net interest income decreased by $5.5 billion, and total revenue decreased by 12%.\n- **Wealth Management**: Net interest income decreased by $1,036 million, and total revenue decreased by 5%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth sectors experienced declines in net interest income and total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates, with consumer banking seeing a more significant revenue decline.\n\n![Net interest income and total revenue for Consumer Banking decreased in 2020](image1)\n![Net interest income and total revenue for Wealth Management decreased in 2020](image6)"}

This amount is reflected in the \"Cash dividends\" line under the \"Common Stock Share Activity\" section, reducing retained earnings by $10,179 million.

This transaction reduces the number of outstanding shares and decreases the equity by the cost of the repurchased shares. The \"Treasury Stock\" line shows a decrease from $41,498 million to $41,464 million, reflecting the repurchase activity.\n- **Impact on Cash Flow:** Image6 reports a net cash outflow of $10,179 million under \"Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares\" in financing activities. This represents the cash used to repurchase shares, further impacting the company's cash reserves.\n\n**Combined Impact:**\n- **Equity Structure:** Both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions reduce the equity structure. Dividends decrease retained earnings, while treasury stock purchases reduce shareholders' equity by the cost of shares repurchased.\n- **Cash Flow:** Both activities are significant uses of cash, with dividends and treasury stock purchases totaling $20,358 million in cash outflows in 2021, as seen in image6. This substantial outflow affects the company's net cash provided by (used for) financing activities, which was a net use of cash of $23,113 million in 2021.\n\nIn summary, cash dividends and treasury stock transactions in 2021 reduced Chevron's equity and utilized a significant portion of its cash flow, impacting both the equity"}

This is a significant increase from the $36 million credit in 2019 due to the sale of the manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [9].\n- The restructuring accrual balances, which are part of accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities, reflect these charges [12]. The restructuring charges in 2020 were $25 million, while in 2019, there was a credit of $36 million [9].\n\n**Inclusion in Operating Profit:**\n- The restructuring charges are included in operating profit. In 2020, the restructuring charges/other were $24 million, as seen in the quarterly breakdown [image5]. This contrasts with 2019, where restructuring charges were not present in the same period, indicating a negative impact on operating profit in 2020.\n- The restructuring charges in 2020 reduced operating profit, whereas in 2019, the credit from the sale of the manufacturing facility positively impacted operating profit.\n\n**Financial Statement Impact:**\n- The restructuring charges in 2020 negatively affected operating profit, leading to a decrease in net income.

The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in these assumptions is crucial. For instance, a 10% reduction in mortality rates would increase the obligation by €110 million as of September 30, 2021 [4]. The text also mentions that changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly discount rates, can significantly affect the funded status [8][12].\n\nIn image4, we see the total actuarial gains and losses for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. In 2021, the total actuarial losses were €22 million, compared to gains of €67 million in 2020. This change is broken down into:\n- Changes in demographic assumptions: -€8 million (2020: -€3 million)\n- Changes in financial assumptions: -€26 million (2020: €72 million)\n- Experience gains and losses: €12 million (2020: -€2 million)\n\nThe significant negative impact in financial assumptions in 2021, particularly the decrease in discount rates (as seen in image2, where discount rates increased from 1.5% to 1.7% for the Euro), led to a higher defined benefit obligation. Image7 further illustrates the sensitivity: a half-percentage-point increase in the discount rate would decrease the obligation by €242 million in 2021, while a decrease would increase it by €271 million. This indicates that higher discount rates in 2021 increased the obligation.\n\n**Plan Assets:**\n\nImage6 shows the total plan assets increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021.

This decrease is attributed primarily to a reduction in operating earnings due to COVID-19. The text also mentions that free cash flow decreased by $1.1 billion or 19% to $4.6 billion in 2020. This indicates a significant impact on the company's operational cash flow, likely due to the economic challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\n**Number of Systemwide Restaurants:**\n\nImage4 provides a detailed breakdown of the number of restaurants at the end of 2020 and 2019.

This decrease was partly offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by $170.1 billion or 8.8% [9]. The decrease in net interest income was also influenced by the impact of lower market interest rates, particularly in Asia and North America, although growth in AIEA, notably short-term funds and financial investments, helped mitigate some of this decline [3, 8]. The net interest margin (NIM) for 2020 was 1.32%, which was 26 basis points lower than in 2019, mainly due to the reduction in the yield on AIEA of 84 basis points, partly offset by lower funding costs [2]. The NIM for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 1.22%, down 34 basis points year-on-year, driven by lower market interest rates in Asia [12]. \n\n**Interest Expense:**\n- Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased by $2.9 billion year-on-year, primarily due to lower market interest rates, although this was partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts, which increased by $142.9 billion [11]. The overall interest expense for 2020 was $(14,178) million, a decrease from $(24,233) million in 2019, reflecting the reduction in funding costs [image1].\n\n**Impact on Net Operating Income and Profitability:**\n- The decrease in net interest income and the reduction in interest expense both contributed to the overall financial performance. The net operating income before expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges was $30,462 million in 2020, a decrease from $30,489 million in 2019 [image5].

This suggests improved efficiency in user acquisition and brand promotion strategies [12][image2].\n- **General and Administrative Expenses**:\n  - Increased from RMB2,703 million in 2019 to RMB4,009 million in 2021, rising from 57.0% to 60.0% of total operating expenses. The rise is attributed to higher R&D investments and administrative costs, aligning with the company's focus on innovation and operational expansion [5][6][10][image2].\n- **Total Operating Expenses**:\n  - Grew from RMB4,744 million in 201"}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million in 2020, primarily driven by deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets, while long-term debt decreased by $1,361 million. These changes, along with shifts in cash flows and equity, reflect a strategic adjustment in IBM's financial structure.\n\n**Noncurrent Assets:**\n- **Increase in Noncurrent Assets:** The increase in noncurrent assets was mainly due to deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets, as noted in [9]. Deferred taxes rose by $4,060 million, and prepaid pension assets increased by $745 million, partially offset by a decrease in long-term financing receivables and net intangible assets. This suggests that IBM benefited from tax-related adjustments and improved pension fund performance, enhancing its long-term asset base. ![Noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million in 2020, driven by deferred taxes and prepaid pension assets](image8).\n\n**Long-term Debt:**\n- **Decrease in Long-term Debt:** Total debt decreased by $1,361 million, primarily from early retirements and debt maturities, partially offset by new issuances, as stated in [12]. This reduction in debt aligns with IBM's strategy to manage its debt levels efficiently. ![Total debt decreased by $1,361 million in 2020](image6).\n\n**Cash Flows:**\n- **Financing Activities:** Financing activities used $9,721 million in 2020, a significant change from a net source of $9,042 million in 2019, driven by reduced cash from acquisitions and increased purchases of marketable securities, as explained in [2] and [4]. This indicates a shift towards more conservative financing practices. ![Financing activities used $9,721 million in 2020](image5).\n\n**Equity:**\n- **Equity Changes:** Total equity decreased by $258 million, primarily due to dividends and foreign currency adjustments, offset by net income and stock issuance, as detailed in [6]. This reduction in equity reflects dividend payouts and currency impacts, balancing with income and stock activities. ![Total equity decreased by $258 million in 202"}

This decline was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, with spending for travel and entertainment remaining lower compared to 2019. However, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion, indicating a shift in consumer spending behavior towards debit cards.\n- **Outstandings**: As stated in [11], outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased by $18.9 billion to $78.7 billion in 2020, attributed to lower retail spending and higher payments. This suggests that consumers were either paying down their credit card balances more aggressively or reducing their spending.\n- **Net Charge-offs**: Net charge-offs decreased by $599 million to $2.3 billion in 2020, partly due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19, which helped consumers manage their debts better.\n\n### Home Equity Metrics:\n- **Outstandings**: From [1], the home equity portfolio's outstanding balances decreased by $5.9 billion in 2020, primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. This indicates that consumers were either paying off their home equity loans more quickly or were less inclined to draw on these lines of credit.\n- **First Mortgage Originations**: [4] mentions that first mortgage loan originations decreased by $6.0 billion in Consumer Banking, driven by a decline in nonconforming applications. This could reflect a more cautious approach to borrowing or a reduced need for new mortgages.\n\n### Image Evidence:\n- **Image2** shows that home equity outstandings in Consumer Banking decreased from $9,755 million in 2019 to $6,930 million in 2020, and for the total Corporation, from $11,131 million to $8,160 million.

The decline in coal prices negatively affected earnings, with lower price impacts net of price-linked costs amounting to US$0.7 billion. Additionally, lower volumes reduced Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million.\n- **Cost Drivers**: Controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by higher maintenance costs at Queensland Coal, including earth-moving equipment and shiploader maintenance at Hay Point port, as well as increased stripping volumes. However, cost reduction initiatives partially offset these increases.\n- **Future Outlook**: Text [3] indicates that Queensland Coal unit costs are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by higher diesel prices. Despite efforts to optimize mine plans and improve efficiency, uncertainty regarding coal import restrictions into China complicates medium-term volume and cost guidance.\n- **Price Sensitivity**: Text [4] highlights that a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and US$1 per barrel decline in oil price would impact FY2021 profit after taxation by US$163 million and US$24 million, respectively. This sensitivity underscores the significant role commodity prices play in financial performance.\n\n### Nickel:\n- **Price Impact**: Text [6] notes that the average realized sales price for nickel in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020. Positive investor sentiment and strong demand, along with supply disruptions and falling London Metal Exchange stocks, supported higher prices.\n- **EBITDA Improvement**: Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance and contractor costs. However, unfavorable exchange rate movements and increased third-party concentrate purchase costs partially offset these gains (text [9]).\n- **Market Dynamics**: The announcement of a major nickel producer converting nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia briefly corrected prices in March but did not deter"}

However, since we need the interest expense for FY 2020, we refer to image1, which shows the interest expense for January 30, 2021 (FY 2020) as $3,270 thousand (or $3.27 million).\n\n2. **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**: This can be derived from the net earnings and interest expense. From image7, the net earnings for January 30, 2021 (FY 2020) were $1,798 million. To find EBIT, we need to add back the interest expense and taxes. However, the exact EBIT is not directly provided. We can approximate EBIT by using the net earnings and adding back the interest expense and taxes. From image7, the income tax expense for FY 2020 was $579 million.

In 2020, there were losses of $457 million on available-for-sale securities and $457 million in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes [image3].\n- The text mentions that despite challenges in 2020, total revenues increased by 9% to a record $25.4 billion, driven by various factors [8]. However, this growth in revenue was not fully reflected in net income due to increased operating expenses and other factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe decrease in both net income and comprehensive income from 2018 to 2020 suggests that while the company managed to increase revenues, it faced challenges in translating that growth into net income, possibly due to higher operating expenses and significant losses in other comprehensive income components. This indicates that while the company's top-line growth was positive, its bottom-line performance was impacted by external factors and operational costs.\n\n![Net income and comprehensive income decreased from 2018 to 2020](image3)"}

This aligns with image5, which shows that 'Gains on strategic investments, net' increased from $542 million in 2019 to $427 million in 2020, a decrease of $115 million. The decrease is attributed to a reduction in gains from publicly traded securities, as mentioned in text quote [11], which noted a significant drop from $345 million in 2019 to $138 million in 2020.\n\n**Other Expense:**\n- Text quote [1] explains that 'Other expense' primarily consists of interest expense on debt and operating/finance leases, offset by investment income. Interest expense decreased from $154 million in 2019 to $131 million in 2020, while investment income increased by $61 million due to higher interest income from larger cash equivalents and marketable securities. Image5 confirms this, showing 'Other expense' decreased from $(94) million in 2019 to $(18) million in 2020, a favorable change of $76 million.

This change was primarily due to the issuance of new fixed-rate, long-term debt and the repayment of maturing debt.\n\n**Evidence and Analysis:**\n\n- **Text [12]**: In 2020, the company received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. This indicates that the issuance of new debt was a significant factor in the increase.\n- **Image1**: The table shows the issuance of various notes in 2020, including $550 million due in 2021, $500 million due in 2022, and $750 million due in 2025, among others, totaling $1,500 million in new debt. The total debt increased from $5,850 million in 2019 to $6,850 million in 2020, with the current portion decreasing from $500 million to $550 million, resulting in a net increase in long-term debt.\n- **Text [9]**: In March 2020, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025, contributing to the increase.\n- **Text [7]**: In May 2020, the company issued $750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030, further adding to the debt.\n- **Text [5]** and **Text [10]**: Issuances in 2019 and 2018 also contributed to the baseline debt levels, but the 2020 issuances were the primary drivers of the increase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe increase in long-term debt from 2019 to 2020 was mainly due to the issuance of new fixed-rate, long-term debt totaling $1.5 billion, offset by the repayment of $500 million in maturing debt.

This substantial rise is primarily due to a significant increase in intangible assets, which grew from DKK 5,835 million in 2019 to DKK 20,657 million in 2020. This growth is attributed to acquisitions, such as Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. and Emisphere Technologies Inc., as mentioned in text quote [5], which involved a purchase of intangible assets amounting to DKK 16.3 billion. The increase in intangible assets reflects the company's strategic investments in research and development, aiming to enhance its product portfolio and future cash flows.\n\n**Total Equity:**\n- Image7 shows that total equity increased from DKK 57,593 million in 2019 to DKK 63,325 million in 2020. This increase is driven by a higher net profit of DKK 42,138 million in 2020 compared to DKK 38,951 million in 2019, as seen in image4. Additionally, the equity statement in image3 indicates a net profit contribution of DKK 42,071 million and other comprehensive income adjustments, leading to a total comprehensive income of DKK 41,528 million in 2020. The company also managed its reserves effectively, with a transfer of cash flow hedge reserve to retained earnings, as noted in text quote [2], which adjusted the reserve for cash flow hedges and retained earnings without impacting total equity.\n\n**Overall Financial Position:**\n- The increase in non-current assets, particularly intangible assets, suggests a focus on long-term growth and innovation. The rise in total equity indicates improved financial stability and profitability. These changes collectively enhance the company's financial position by strengthening its asset base and equity, providing a solid foundation for future investments and operations.\n\nIn summary, the company's financial position improved from 2019 to 2020 due to significant growth in non-current assets, driven by strategic"}

According to the text quote [3], treasury shares are shares held by the Lovisa Holdings Limited Share Trust for issuing under Long Term Incentive Plans. When shares are repurchased, the amount paid is recognized as a deduction from equity, and these shares are classified as treasury shares. The issuance of these shares subsequently increases equity.\n\nFrom the image8, we can see the detailed impact:\n- **Number of Ordinary Shares**:\n  - In 2019, the number of shares issued to the Employee Share Trust was 550,000, increasing the total number of shares on issue from 105,016,000 to 105,566,000.\n  - In 2020, the number of shares issued to the Employee Share Trust was 1,894,000, increasing the total number of shares on issue from 105,566,000 to 107,460,000.\n\n- **Value of Ordinary Shares**:\n  - In 2019, the value of shares issued to the Employee Share Trust was $6,045,000, increasing the total value from $208,526,000 to $214,571,000.\n  - In 2020, the value of shares issued to the Employee Share Trust was $19,594,000, increasing the total value from $214,571,000 to $234,165,000.\n\nThus, the share issue to the Employee Share Trust in 2020 more than tripled the number of shares issued compared to 2019, from 550,000 to 1,894,000, and significantly increased the value of shares issued from $6,045,000 to $19,594,000.

This reduction is primarily due to decreases in loss and other carryforwards ($1,030 million to $914 million) and accrued interest and taxes ($569 million to $409 million). However, there were increases in capitalized research & development ($358 million to $646 million) and pension and other retiree benefits ($424 million to $420 million).\n- The text [12] explains that deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using enacted statutory tax rates and adjusted for changes in these rates. The decrease in deferred tax assets could indicate a reduction in future tax benefits, potentially affecting the company's ability to offset future taxable income.\n\n**Deferred Tax Liabilities:**\n- Image7 shows that total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 million in 2021 to $9,288 million in 2022. Significant increases were observed in goodwill and intangible assets ($5,761 million to $5,783 million), other retiree benefits ($645 million to $1,031 million), and lease right-of-use assets ($191 million to $179 million). The increase in other retiree benefits is particularly notable, reflecting changes in pension and postretirement obligations.\n- Text [9] discusses the assumptions used in estimating postretirement benefits, which can affect deferred tax liabilities. The increase in deferred tax liabilities suggests higher future tax obligations, which could impact cash flows and financial flexibility.\n\n**Impact on Financial Position:**\n- The net change in deferred tax positions (assets minus liabilities) shows a more significant increase in liabilities compared to assets, leading to a higher net deferred tax liability. This indicates that the company expects to pay more taxes in the future, which could affect its cash flow and financial planning.\n- Text [6] mentions ongoing audits and uncertain tax positions, which could further adjust these deferred amounts.

In contrast, Democrats and Democratic-leaning individuals are more pessimistic, with 45% expecting a decline in influence. This partisan divide is evident in the text [7], which states that Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to believe the U.S.'s international influence will strengthen, while Democrats are four times more likely to foresee a decline.\n\nLooking at the demographic breakdown, older Americans (ages 65 and older) are more likely to believe the U.S. will have less influence, with 59% holding this view, as shown in image4.

Initially, the population grew rapidly, peaking in 1890, followed by a gradual decline. This pattern can be attributed to several key events and developments.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1890, the population surged from 130 to 14,096, as shown in [1] and image2. This growth was driven by the Homestead Act and the Transcontinental Railroad, which facilitated westward expansion and agricultural development. The Homestead Act provided settlers with land, encouraging immigration, while the railroad improved transportation and economic opportunities. The influx of settlers from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including Danes, Swedes, Germans, and others, contributed to the population boom, as noted in [2] and [7]. These groups settled in clusters, creating distinct cultural communities, such as the Danish settlement in Kronborg and the Swedish settlement in Hordville, as depicted in image3.\n\nHowever, after 1890, the population began to decline, reaching 9,403 by 2000, as seen in image2. This decline was influenced by farm consolidation and mechanization, which reduced the need for small farms and led to fewer people required for agricultural work. The number of farms decreased from over 2,000 in 1900 to 603 by 2002, with average farm sizes increasing significantly, as detailed in [6] and image8. Rural school districts consolidated, reflecting the changing agricultural landscape, as mentioned in [11].\n\nAdditionally, the role of railroads and towns evolved. While railroads initially spurred growth, the decline of smaller towns without rail connections, as described in [10], contributed to population shifts. Aurora, the county seat, saw steady population increases, contrasting with other towns that struggled, as highlighted in [8] and [9]. The presence of religious and cultural institutions, like the Zion Lutheran Church (image5 and image6), remained focal points for communities but did not halt the broader population decline.\n\nIn summary, Hamilton County's population trends were shaped by initial growth due to settlement acts and railroads, followed by decline due to agricultural changes and urbanization. The interplay of these factors created a dynamic demographic history, with cultural and economic shifts influencing the county's development.\n\n![Hamilton County population data from"}

This is further supported by image5, which shows that 62% of blacks in STEM jobs have experienced discrimination due to their race/ethnicity, while only 13% of whites report the same.\n\nBlacks also believe that their race/ethnicity has made it harder to succeed in their job, with 40% holding this view, compared to 5% of whites and 4% of Asians [5, image5]. Additionally, 57% of blacks feel their workplace pays too little attention to increasing racial/ethnic diversity, highlighting concerns about inclusivity [image5].\n\nWhen it comes to perceptions of fairness in hiring and promotions, 43% of blacks in STEM jobs believe they are usually treated fairly during recruitment, and 37% think the same about promotions, whereas most white STEM workers (78% for hiring and 75% for promotions) believe blacks are treated fairly [6, image5].

This trend is evident in the data showing that Hispanics have consistently been more optimistic about their financial prospects than the general public, with the gap widening over the years.\n\n![Hispanics and general public financial expectations from 2004 to 2015](image2)\n\n[1] This analysis shows that all of the increase among Hispanics in perceptions about their family’s finances has occurred since 2011 when, two years after the Great Recession officially ended, 67% of Latinos said they expected their finances to improve “a lot” or “some.” That share then grew by 6 percentage points to 73% in 2012, and now stands at 81%.\n[3] ten Hispanic adults (81%) say they expect their family’s financial situation to improve in the next year, up from 67% who said the same in 2008. By comparison, the U.S. public is not as upbeat – 61% say they expect their family’s financial situation to improve, up from 56% who said this in 2008.\n[6] Looking back to before the recession reveals another striking difference between Hispanic economic perceptions and those of the U.S. population as a whole. Latino views of their financial situation are more positive now than they were in 2004, when roughly a third (31%) rated their financial condition as excellent or good. By contrast, the public’s view of its finances is lower now than in 2004, when about half (51%) had a positive view.\n[12] Since 2004, the Pew Research Center’s National Survey of Latinos has found that Latinos are consistently more optimistic about their next year’s finances than the general public.

According to the text, 74% of women in computer jobs report experiencing gender discrimination at work, compared to only 16% of men [4][5][10]. This disparity is evident in various forms of discrimination, such as earning less than men for the same job (46% of women vs. 29% of all women in STEM jobs) and being treated as if they were not competent (40% of women vs. 29% of all women in STEM jobs) [9]. Additionally, women are more likely to feel their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job (31% vs. 6%) and to experience sexual harassment (30% vs. 7%) [12]. They also perceive less fairness in opportunities for promotion and advancement (43% vs. 77%) and in the recruitment and hiring process (67% vs. 83%) [7][11].\n\nThe images further illustrate these differences. Image1 shows that 22% of women in STEM jobs have experienced sexual harassment, compared to 7% of men, and 36% of women believe sexual harassment is a problem in their workplace, compared to 28% of men. Image7 highlights that 74% of women in computer jobs have experienced gender discrimination, compared to 16% of men, and 31% of women feel their gender has made it harder to succeed, compared to 6% of men. Image4 indicates that 50% of women in STEM jobs have experienced discrimination, compared to 19% of men. These visual data reinforce the significant gap in experiences between men and women in computer jobs.\n\nIn summary, women in computer jobs face a higher prevalence of gender discrimination, including pay inequities, competence doubts, and workplace harassment, compared to their male counterparts."}

According to the text quote [10], about half of Democratic-leaning independents (48%) said they voted, compared with 59% of Democrats. Similarly, 54% of GOP leaners said they voted, compared with 61% of Republicans. This indicates that partisans are more likely to vote than their leaning counterparts.\n\nThe image7 provides a visual representation of these differences. It shows that among registered voters:\n- **Republicans**: 61% voted.\n- **Lean Rep**: 54% voted.\n- **No Lean**: 33% voted.\n- **Lean Dem**: 48% voted.\n- **Democrats**: 59% voted.\n\nThis data suggests that while a majority of registered partisans (Republicans and Democrats) voted, independents, especially those without a party lean, had significantly lower turnout rates. The chart clearly illustrates that both Republican and Democratic identifiers had higher voting rates than their respective leaners, and non-leaning independents had the lowest turnout.\n\nIn summary, voter turnout is highest among registered Republicans and Democrats, followed by their leaning counterparts, with non-leaning independents having the lowest turnout.\n\n![Voter turnout among different political affiliations](image7)"}

Initially, the population was very low, with only 130 residents in 1870 [2]. However, it surged dramatically in the late 19th century, reaching 8,267 by 1880 and peaking at 14,096 in 1890 [2]. This rapid growth was likely due to the influx of settlers and the establishment of new towns, as seen in the founding of Hamilton and other communities [3]. Following this peak, the population began a slow decline, dropping to 13,330 in 1900 and continuing to decrease through the mid-20th century, with a low of 8,778 in 1950 [2]. The decline was attributed to factors such as farm consolidation and changing economic conditions [5]. By 2000, the population had slightly rebounded to 9,403, showing a modest recovery [2]. \n\nThe population trends of individual towns within Hamilton County also reflect these broader changes. For example, Aurora, the largest town, saw steady growth, reaching 4,225 residents by 2000 [5]. In contrast, smaller towns like Giltner and Stockham experienced declines, with Giltner dropping from 430 in 1890 to 389 in 2000, and Stockham from 211 in 1890 to 60 in 2000 [1].

However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains are more variable. Galician to English (Gl→En) shows a substantial increase of up to 11 BLEU points, highlighting the utility of pre-trained embeddings in low-resource scenarios [2]. \n\nIn multilingual systems, pre-training and embedding alignment further enhance performance.

Additionally, adding logical constraints to LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. For example, using 5 demonstrations with logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE achieves a 25.7% Micro-F1, surpassing 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%).\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence supporting these findings.

As stated in [5], a Reasoning Error occurs when the model makes mistakes in the intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. This aligns with the findings in [12], which indicate that more than 90% of errors happen during the Reasoning step, with Reasoning Error and Math Error being the major contributors.\n\n2. **Factual Error**: This error type occurs when the model recites incorrect factual knowledge. While not the most prevalent, it still contributes to the overall error rate.\n\n3. **Math Error**: This involves mistakes in mathematical calculations during the reasoning process. It is a critical error type, especially in tasks requiring complex reasoning, as noted in [12].\n\n4. **Context Loss**: This error happens when the model loses context from the question, deviating from addressing the original query. It is less frequent compared to Reasoning and Math Errors.\n\n5. **Principle Error**: This error occurs during the Abstraction step when the first principles generated are wrong or incomplete. It is the least common, as highlighted in [12], comprising only a small fraction of errors.\n\nComparing these error types, Reasoning Errors dominate, followed by Math Errors, with Factual Errors, Context Loss, and Principle Errors being less frequent. The images provide visual evidence of these distributions:\n\n- **image6** shows a bar chart where Reasoning Error is the highest (0.55), followed by Math Error (0.25), Context Loss (0.07), and Principle Error (0.04), confirming the dominance of Reasoning Errors.\n- **image7** further illustrates that Reasoning Errors are the primary issue, with a significant bar height compared to other error types.\n\nIn summary, the main error types in Step-Back Prompting on TimeQA are predominantly Reasoning Errors, followed by Math Errors, with Factual Errors, Context Loss, and Principle Errors being less common.

This involves parsing the text to understand the variables and their interactions, as shown in image2 and image6. For example, in image2, the causal graph is parsed to identify confounding effects.\n\n2. **Determine the Query Type**: Classify the type of causal query being asked, such as Average Treatment Effect (ATE), as seen in image2 and image6. This step is crucial for guiding the subsequent formalization and inference.\n\n3. **Formalize the Query**: Translate the natural language query into a symbolic form, such as \\( E[Y | do(X=1)] - E[Y | do(X=0)] \\), as demonstrated in image2 and image6. This step ensures precise representation of the causal question.\n\n4. **Gather Relevant Data**: Collect all necessary data from the prompt, including probabilities and conditional statements, as shown in image2 and image6. This data is essential for performing causal calculations.\n\n5. **Deduce the Estimand**: Use causal inference techniques like do-calculus to derive the estimand, as illustrated in image2 and image6.

For Torso entities, accuracy improves by 18.8%, from 19.1% to 22.7%, with hallucination rates dropping by 4.4%, from 80.9% to 77.3%. The most significant improvement is observed in Tail entities, where accuracy jumps by 85.3%, from 6.8% to 12.6%, and hallucination rates decrease by 6.2%, from 93.2% to 87.4%. This demonstrates that RA is particularly effective in addressing the challenges posed by long-tail entities, which are less frequent and thus harder for models to handle accurately without additional knowledge support.\n\nIn summary, retrieval augmentation markedly enhances both accuracy and reduces hallucination rates, with the most substantial improvements seen in Tail entities, effectively addressing the long-tail entity challenge."}

It then considers the children of these nodes at the next layer, repeating this process until reaching the leaf nodes. This method progressively narrows down the search from broader to more specific information.\n- The text [9] explains that by adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer, tree traversal offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved. It starts with a broad outlook and focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers.\n- Image3 illustrates this process, showing a hierarchical tree structure where nodes are selected layer-by-layer, with retrieved context being concatenated from the selected nodes.\n\n**Collapsed Tree Retrieval**:\n- The text [10] describes the collapsed tree approach as flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer, allowing all nodes to be compared simultaneously. This method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.\n- Image3 also depicts this approach, where all nodes are treated at the same level, enabling a more flexible search that isn't constrained by hierarchical layers.\n- The text [3] supports this by stating that the collapsed tree approach performs better due to its flexibility, as it retrieves information at the correct level of granularity for a given question, unlike the fixed ratio of information levels in tree traversal.\n\n**Performance Comparison**:\n- Image4 shows a graph comparing the F1 scores of both methods across different context lengths. The collapsed tree consistently outperforms tree traversal, especially as context length increases, indicating its effectiveness in handling varying levels of detail.\n- Image6 visually compares the retrieval nodes selected by RAPTOR and DPR for two questions, highlighting that RAPTOR's tree structure allows it to choose nodes from different layers, matching the question's detail level, whereas DPR selects leaf nodes, which may not capture the necessary granularity.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTree Traversal Retrieval follows a hierarchical, layer-by-layer approach, progressively focusing on more specific information, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval treats all nodes equally, allowing for a more flexible and comprehensive search across different levels of abstraction. The collapsed tree method generally performs better, as evidenced by higher F1 scores and its ability to adapt to"}

This is followed by the use of incorrect approximation words, which make up 33.3% of the refuted claims. These findings highlight the challenges models face in accurately interpreting and processing numerical data within scientific tables.\n\n![Refuted and NEI Reasons](image1)\n\n[9] One potential risk of model-generated claims is that they may lack diversity and exhibit the same pattern. For example, in the Sci-Fact (Wadden et al., 2020) dataset where the refuted claims are generated by flipping the meaning of the original true claims, we found that out of 100 randomly sampled refuted claims, 85 simply negated the original claim by adding negation words such as “not” (more details in Appendix C). To evaluate the diversity of claims for our SCITAB dataset, we randomly select 60 refuted claims and then manually annotate their reasons for refutation. Results are shown in Table 3 (top half). We find that SCITAB exhibits a greater diversity in refuted claims compared to Sci-Fact. Besides common error types such as “incorrect calculation results” (41.7%), there are also unique types of errors that are more reflective of the complexities in real-world scientific claims. For example, 33.33% of the refuted claims contain “incorrect approximation words,” and 10.0% are cases where “the claim is partially right,” consistent with the fact that ambiguity and half-truths are common phenomena in scientific discourse. Additional examples of refuted claims are in Appendix E.\n\n![Error Types](image3)\n\n[10] The NEI claims (bottom half; Table 3) also exhibit diverse reasoning patterns. The two most common features for unverifiable claims are insufficient evidence in the table and the lack of background knowledge. The lack of closed-domain knowledge is another reason for NEI, where additional information in the paper is necessary to verify the claim. Other reasons include the use of vague pronouns (e.g., “it,” “this”) brings ambiguity to the claim. These distinct refuted and NEI reasoning types highlight the unique features of SCITAB, making it a more comprehensive and realistic representation of the challenges faced in real-world scientific fact-checking."}

The system message defines the desired tone and style of the generated instruction-response pairs, while visual annotations include essential image information such as bounding boxes and descriptions. This step sets the foundation for the quality and context of the generated pairs [4].\n\n2. **Generate Instruction-Response Pairs (Step 2)**:\n   - Using the system message and visual annotations, ChatGPT generates initial instruction-response pairs. This step leverages the language model's capabilities to create relevant and contextually appropriate pairs based on the provided visual content [4].\n\n3. **Filtering (Step 3)**:\n   - The generated pairs undergo a filtering process to ensure quality and relevance. This step is crucial for maintaining the standard of the dataset and involves refining the pairs to align with the desired criteria [4].\n\n4. **Translation (Step 4)**:\n   - The final step involves translating the instruction-response pairs into multiple languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, Korean, and Arabic. This ensures the dataset's multi-lingual support, enhancing its applicability across different linguistic contexts [4].\n\nThe process is designed to be scalable and automated, combining human expertise with the capabilities of large language models like GPT-4 or ChatGPT to efficiently produce high-quality, diverse instruction-response pairs.

As shown in image4, when repetition control is introduced alongside question-asking control (Question-controlled CT w/ rep ctrl), the percentage of utterances containing questions decreases compared to the question-controlled model without repetition control. This is because the repetition control feature, specifically the `extrep bigram` penalty, discourages the use of bigrams that are common in questions, such as \"do you\" or \"what is,\" to prevent repetition. To mitigate this, a `boost` setting is used, which allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams during beam search but applies the repetition penalty afterward, achieving a higher question-asking rate (99.54%) at the cost of slightly increased external bigram repetition [10].\n\nIn image1, the question-asking control (CT) model with repetition control (dark gray bar) shows a lower engagingness score compared to the model without repetition control (light gray bar), indicating that repetition control impacts the model's ability to ask questions effectively. However, the boosted setting (10 boost) helps recover the question-asking rate, as seen in the dashed line in image4, aligning closer to the target percentage.\n\nThe text [10] explains that without the `boost`, the model struggles to produce questions due to the repetition penalty, but with the boost, it can generate questions more freely. This demonstrates that while repetition control is crucial for improving conversational quality, it can inadvertently suppress question-asking, necessitating adjustments like the `boost` to maintain balance.\n\nIn summary, repetition control reduces question-asking frequency by penalizing common question bigrams, but a `boost` setting helps restore it, balancing repetition and question-asking effectively."}

Here's a detailed comparison:\n\n### Iterative Retrieval\n- **Process**: Iterative retrieval involves multiple rounds of retrieval and generation, where the output from one iteration is used to refine the query for the next retrieval step. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a threshold of relevance.\n- **Purpose**: It aims to provide more context information by iteratively improving the query based on previous retrieval results, enhancing the depth and breadth of the retrieved information.\n- **Example**: ITER-RETGEN [14] uses a synergistic approach where retrieval and generation enhance each other iteratively, improving response quality over multiple rounds.\n\n### Recursive Retrieval\n- **Process**: Recursive retrieval breaks down complex queries into simpler sub-queries, addressing each part step-by-step. It involves hierarchical processing, often summarizing sections of documents before refining the search within those sections.\n- **Purpose**: It is designed to handle complex, multi-step problems by decomposing them into manageable parts, ensuring that each retrieval step builds on the previous one to achieve a comprehensive understanding.\n- **Example**: IRCoT [61] uses a chain-of-thought approach to guide the retrieval process, refining queries based on intermediate results to systematically optimize ambiguous parts.\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval\n- **Process**: Adaptive retrieval dynamically determines the necessity and timing of retrieval based on the query and context. It involves flexible control over when and how retrieval is performed, often using judgment criteria to decide if additional retrieval is needed.\n- **Purpose**: It enhances efficiency and relevance by retrieving information only when necessary, reducing redundancy and improving response accuracy.\n- **Example**: Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25] enable models to actively decide optimal moments for retrieval, streamlining the process and focusing on relevant information.\n\n### Visual Representation\n![Comparison of Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive Retrieval Processes](image2)\n\n### Summary\n- **Iterative**: Repeated cycles of retrieval and generation to refine context.\n- **Recursive**: Hierarchical breakdown of queries for complex problem-solving.\n- **Adaptive**: Dynamic control over retrieval based on context and necessity.\n\nThese processes highlight different strategies to improve the retrieval and generation synergy in RAG systems, each addressing specific challenges and enhancing the overall performance in different scenarios."}

For instance, [1] notes that TF-IDF often fails to retrieve gold paragraphs even with 500 candidates, leading to lower F1 scores. This is further illustrated in [5], where the model achieves only 39.12 F1 with 500 retrieved paragraphs but improves to 53.12 F1 when additional gold paragraphs are provided, demonstrating the critical role of gold paragraphs in enhancing performance.\n\nThe image quotes provide concrete examples of this effect. Image4 shows that in the distractor setting, the F1 score is 67.08, but it drops to 38.40 in the open-domain setting with 10 paragraphs and 39.12 with 500 paragraphs. However, adding a gold paragraph boosts the score to 53.12, underscoring the importance of having relevant gold paragraphs for better performance.\n\nMoreover, the text and images indicate that adversarial distractor selection can mitigate some performance declines. [2] and [8] show that while accuracy drops when using adversarial distractors, re-training on these distractors can recover much of the original accuracy. Image2 illustrates this with F1 scores improving from 46.84 to 60.10 when re-trained on adversarial distractors, and from 40.73 to 58.42 with type-matched distractors.\n\nThe implications for model performance are clear: gold paragraphs are essential for maintaining high F1 scores, and the quality of distractors significantly affects model robustness. Models need better retrieval methods to handle multi-hop questions effectively, as highlighted in [5] and [11]. The analysis suggests that future work should focus on developing improved retrieval techniques and distractor selection methods to enhance multi-hop reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of gold paragraphs substantially improves F1 scores, while the quality and type of distractors can either hinder or help model performance, depending on how well they are selected and used for training.

[7] highlights that CNN and LSTM models perform better than SWEM models on sentiment analysis because they can capture word-order information, which is important for understanding sentiment orientations. For example, phrases like \"not really good\" and \"really not good\" convey different sentiments due to word order. [10] further supports this by showing that SWEM models, which ignore word order, perform worse on sentiment analysis datasets compared to LSTM and CNN models. Additionally, [11] and [12] indicate that shuffling words in the training set for sentiment analysis tasks like Yelp Polarity significantly impacts performance, suggesting that word-order features are essential for these tasks.\n\nThe image quotes provide empirical evidence. Image4 shows that shuffling the training set for the Yelp Polarity dataset results in a noticeable drop in accuracy for the LSTM model, from 95.11% to 93.49%, indicating that word-order information is important for sentiment analysis. In contrast, the Yahoo and SNLI datasets, which are not sentiment-focused, show minimal impact from shuffling, aligning with the text's assertion that word-order is less critical for these tasks.\n\nIn summary, word-order information is vital for sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as it helps capture the nuances in sentiment conveyed by the sequence of words.\n\n![Word-order information significantly impacts sentiment analysis accuracy](image4)"}

The input for each token is a concatenation of the character representation, GLoVe (Pennington et al., 2014) word embeddings, and ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018). The output token representations are obtained by stacking the forward and backward LSTM hidden states.\"\n\nThis indicates that the BiLSTM processes the input tokens to produce contextualized representations by combining character, word, and contextual embeddings. These token representations are then used to enumerate all possible spans in the document, which are further refined through the dynamic span graph mechanism.\n\n![Sentence-level BiLSTM generates token representations for input tokens](image1)\n\nThe image1 illustrates the role of the sentence-level BiLSTM in the overall architecture, showing that it processes the input document to produce token representations, which are then used for span enumeration and subsequent iterative inference for coreference and relations. This foundational step is crucial for enabling the model to capture local context before propagating information through the dynamic span graph."}

The energy consumption and associated costs for training various models are detailed in image4, which shows that training the Transformer big model on P100 GPUs results in 274,120 hours of GPU usage. \n\nTo estimate the CO2e emissions, we need to consider the carbon intensity of the electricity source. Image2 provides the energy mix for different regions and companies, indicating the percentage of renewable, gas, coal, and nuclear energy. For example, Google's energy mix is 56% renewable, 14% gas, 15% coal, and 10% nuclear. \n\nUsing the energy consumption data from image4 and the carbon intensity from image2, we can calculate the CO2e emissions. However, the exact CO2e value is not directly provided in the quotes. Instead, we can infer that training the Transformer big model on GPUs would result in significant emissions, as indicated by the substantial energy usage (274,120 hours) and the carbon intensity of the energy sources.\n\nFor a rough estimate, if we assume an average carbon intensity of 0.5 kg CO2e per kWh (a common estimate for grid electricity), and using the power consumption formula from [11], we can calculate the emissions. However, the exact figure would depend on the specific energy mix used during training.\n\nIn summary, training a Transformer (big) model on GPUs incurs substantial CO2e emissions due to the high energy consumption, but the precise value requires specific carbon intensity data for the training location.\n\n![Energy consumption and cost for various models](image4)  \n![Energy mix for different regions and companies](image2)  \n\n**Answer**: Training a Transformer (big) NLP model on GPUs results in significant CO2e emissions, estimated to be substantial due to high energy consumption, though the exact value depends on the carbon intensity of the electricity source."}

This is highlighted in [6], which states that the model uses BERT to encode the dialogue context \\(X_t\\) along with each domain-slot pair in \\(S\\), obtaining contextualized representations. The architecture, as shown in `![BERT encodes dialog context and domain-slot pairs](image8)`, illustrates how BERT processes both the candidate-value list and the recent dialog context, producing representations that are then used for matching.\n\nFor categorical slots, the model uses cosine similarity to match the aggregated representation of the dialogue context with candidate values. As described in [1], the relevance score is calculated using cosine similarity between the aggregated representation and a reference candidate. This is visualized in `![Cosine similarity matching](image8)`, where the candidate-value list is compared to the context embeddings to determine the most plausible values.\n\nFor non-categorical slots, the model utilizes a two-way linear mapping to find text spans within the dialogue context. This is mentioned in [6], where it is noted that non-categorical slots are handled by locating spans in the context. The architecture diagram in `![Span matching](image8)` shows the start and end vector distributions, indicating the model's ability to identify spans directly from the context.\n\nThe effectiveness of these interactions is supported by the performance improvements shown in `![DS-DST outperforms BERT-DST](image2)`, where DS-DST achieves higher joint accuracy compared to BERT-DST, demonstrating the benefit of strong interactions between slots and context. Additionally, the slot-specific performance in `![Slot-wise accuracy](image6)` shows significant gains for both categorical and non-categorical slots, further validating the model's approach.\n\nIn summary, the DS-DST model leverages BERT to encode both context and slots, using cosine similarity for categorical slots and span matching for non-categorical slots, ensuring robust and accurate dialog state tracking."}

For Amazon-AWS, the renewable energy percentage is 17%, natural gas is 24%, coal is 30%, and nuclear is 26%. For Microsoft, the renewable energy percentage is 32%, natural gas is 23%, coal is 31%, and nuclear is 10%.\n\n**Interleaved Answer:**\n\nFrom the data in image3, we observe that Amazon-AWS and Microsoft have different energy consumption distributions. Amazon-AWS relies more heavily on coal (30%) compared to Microsoft (31%), with a slightly lower percentage of renewable energy (17% vs. 32%). This means Microsoft uses a higher proportion of renewable energy, which generally results in lower CO2 emissions per kWh of energy consumed. The higher coal usage by Amazon-AWS implies that their operations may have a greater carbon footprint due to coal's higher emissions compared to renewables.\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for CO2 emissions. Since coal is a major source of CO2 emissions, Amazon-AWS's higher coal dependency could lead to higher overall emissions compared to Microsoft, assuming similar energy consumption levels. This highlights the importance of energy source composition in determining the environmental impact of cloud services. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMicrosoft uses a higher proportion of renewable energy (32%) compared to Amazon-AWS (17%), and both have similar coal usage (30% vs. 31%). This suggests that Microsoft's operations may have a lower carbon footprint due to its greater reliance on renewables, which typically emit less CO2 than coal. \n\n![Energy sources comparison for Amazon-AWS and Microsoft](image3)"}

The text mentions that D1 has a relatively balanced number of neutral examples in the training set, whereas D3 and D4 have extremely unbalanced label distributions, particularly with very few neutral examples. This imbalance affects the performance metrics, especially the macro-F1 scores, as noted in quotes [1], [4], [5], and [10].\n\n![Distribution of neutral examples across datasets](image1) shows the exact counts of positive (Pos), negative (Neg), and neutral (Neu) examples in each dataset. For D1, there are 637 neutral examples in the training set and 196 in the test set. In contrast, D3 has only 50 neutral examples in the training set and 35 in the test set, and D4 has 88 neutral examples in the training set and 38 in the test set. D2, while having fewer neutral examples than D1, still has more balanced numbers compared to D3 and D4, with 464 neutral examples in the training set and 169 in the test set.\n\nThis imbalance is further highlighted in the performance results. As seen in ![Performance comparison](image4), the macro-F1 scores for neutral classification are notably lower in D3 and D4 compared to D1 and D2, reflecting the challenge posed by the scarcity of neutral examples in these datasets. The text also explains that the improvements in macro-F1 scores are more significant for D3 and D4 when using document-level knowledge transfer, as seen in quote [8], because the small number of neutral examples makes it difficult for models to learn effectively without additional data.\n\nIn summary, D1 has the most neutral examples, while D3 and D4 have the fewest, leading to greater challenges in accurately predicting neutral sentiments in the latter datasets. This distribution is crucial for understanding why certain methods perform better on these datasets when leveraging document-level knowledge.\n\n**Answer:** D1 has the most neutral examples, while D3 and D4 have significantly fewer, leading to greater challenges in neutral sentiment prediction."}

The character-level embeddings help capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which are crucial for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER). Meanwhile, word embeddings provide contextual and semantic information.\n\nAdditionally, [12] mentions that the hierarchical CRF model includes a character-level neural network to capture subword information and a word-level neural network to model contextual dependencies. This dual approach allows the model to leverage both fine-grained character-level details and broader word-level context, enhancing its ability to recognize named entities accurately.\n\nThe image quotes further support this. Image3 illustrates the model architecture, showing how character Bi-LSTMs and word Bi-LSTMs are used to generate embeddings that are then fed into a masked self-attention mechanism and a CRF layer. This visual representation confirms that both character and word embeddings are integral components of the model, working together to improve performance.\n\nIn summary, the model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to capture comprehensive linguistic features, combining semantic information from word embeddings with subword details from character embeddings, which is essential for effective NER.\n\n**Answer:** The model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings to capture comprehensive linguistic features, combining semantic information from word embeddings with subword details from character embeddings, which is essential for effective NER.\n\n![Model architecture showing character and word Bi-LSTMs](image3)"}

Blurring the non-target areas further directs the model's focus, reducing distractions and enhancing the clarity of the objects to be detected. This approach is particularly beneficial in object detection tasks where objects vary in size and position, as it helps maintain the prominence of the foreground objects while preserving enough contextual information.

These slots are span-based, and the values are often not directly extractable. However, DS-Picklist can perform better if the ontology is accessible, as it relies on candidate-value lists.\n\n[9] highlights that DS-Picklist shows improved performance when the full ontology is available, but in real scenarios, access to the full ontology might be challenging. This suggests that while DS-Picklist can outperform DS-DST in some cases, it depends on the availability of the ontology.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n\n- **image4** provides a detailed comparison of the performance of DS-Span, DS-DST, and DS-Picklist for various slots. For 'taxi-leave at', DS-Span has a 2.21% accuracy, DS-DST has 0.00%, and DS-Picklist has 41.44%. For 'train-arrive by', DS-Span has 9.60%, DS-DST has 67.23%, and DS-Picklist has 79.20%. This indicates that DS-Picklist significantly outperforms both DS-Span and DS-DST for these slots when the ontology is accessible.\n\n- **image7** and **image8** show dialogue examples where DS-Span and DS-DST struggle with 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' slots, often failing to extract the correct values. DS-DST sometimes predicts 'none' or incorrect values, while DS-Picklist is not shown but would likely perform better with access to the ontology.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDS-Picklist outperforms DS-DST for 'taxi-leave at' and 'train-arrive by' slots when the ontology is accessible, as it can leverage candidate-value lists to predict values not explicitly mentioned in the dialogue. DS-DST, relying on span extraction, struggles with these slots due to the lack of explicit mentions in the context.\n\n![DS-Picklist outper"}

It offers greater flexibility by searching through all nodes simultaneously, retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question.\n- [10] The tree traversal method offers control over specificity and breadth by adjusting depth and nodes selected at each layer, but the ratio of higher-order thematic information to details remains constant regardless of the question.\n\n**Image Evidence:**\n- ![Collapsed tree consistently outperforms tree traversal across context lengths](image8)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe image (image8) shows a graph comparing the F1 scores of the collapsed tree and tree traversal methods across varying context lengths. The collapsed tree method (green line) consistently achieves higher F1 scores than the tree traversal method (blue line) across all context lengths tested (from 500 to 2500 tokens). For example, at a context length of 500 tokens, the collapsed tree has an F1 score of approximately 50, while tree traversal is around 45. As the context length increases, the collapsed tree maintains a higher F1 score, peaking at around 55 for 2000 tokens, whereas tree traversal peaks at around 50.

However, MMMU's focus is on quality and diversity rather than sheer volume [6].\n\n**Image Types**: MMMU features 30 diverse image types, including diagrams, tables, charts, photographs, and medical images, as shown in image1. This breadth is unmatched by other benchmarks, which typically cover fewer formats. For instance, ScienceQA includes only 5 types, while VisWiz and MM-Vet use a mix of visual and optical character recognition (V+OC) images but do not specify the variety [6].\n\n**Reasoning Depth**: MMMU requires expert-level reasoning, often involving college-level knowledge and complex problem-solving, such as applying Fourier Transform or Equilibrium Theory.

It notes that head word supervision is particularly helpful for predicting ultra-fine labels. Additionally, [11] describes the setup where these data sources are combined and sampled equally during training.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image3 provides a detailed breakdown of performance metrics when different training data sources are excluded. The table shows the impact on precision (P), recall (R), and F1 scores for the Ultra-Fine category:\n\n- **All Data**: P = 42.8, R = 8.8, F1 = 14.6\n- **Excluding Crowdsourced Data**: P = 54.4, R = 4.6, F1 = 8.4\n- **Excluding Head Words**: P = 46.2, R = 4.7, F1 = 8.5\n- **Excluding Entity Linking (EL)**: P = 41.4, R = 9.9, F1 = 16.0\n\nFrom these results, we can see that excluding head words leads to a slight decrease in precision but a significant drop in recall and F1 score compared to using all data. Excluding crowdsourced data results in a higher precision but a lower recall and F1, indicating that while it might reduce false positives, it also misses more true positives. Excluding entity linking data (EL) results in the highest recall and F1 among the exclusions, suggesting that EL is less critical for ultra-fine labels compared to head words.\n\nIn summary, the exclusion of head words has the most detrimental effect on ultra-fine label performance, highlighting its importance for this category.\n\n![Performance metrics for Ultra-Fine category when excluding different data sources](image3)"}

These components are highlighted in both text and image quotes, providing a comprehensive overview of the skills and tools necessary for success in recruiting.\n\nFirstly, the toolkit emphasizes the importance of **LinkedIn Recruiter Certification**. This certification validates and showcases a recruiter's ability to find, engage, and manage talent effectively [10]. The certification is designed to cover the entire recruiting lifecycle, ensuring that recruiters are proficient in various aspects of the process [9]. The certification is valid for two years, and while the LinkedIn Recruiter tool may change, the core subjects and objectives remain consistent [5]. This is visually represented in image1, which shows a LinkedIn Certified Professional Recruiter card, symbolizing the formal recognition and credibility gained through certification.\n\nSecondly, the toolkit includes **advanced search techniques**, such as Boolean searching, which are crucial for effectively leveraging LinkedIn's network [3]. This is further supported by image7, which illustrates a Venn diagram, likely representing the complexity and precision required in search strategies to identify the right talent.\n\nThirdly, **building and managing a talent pipeline** is a critical component. Recruiters need to become experts in using tools like Talent Pipeline to ensure they can react quickly to business needs [4]. This is reinforced by image8, which outlines the process of building a talent pipeline as a key part of the certification, alongside other essential skills.\n\nAdditionally, the toolkit focuses on **best practices** for using LinkedIn Recruiter, ensuring that recruiters understand the optimal methods for performing actions within the platform [7]. This is complemented by image2, showing a professional engaged in learning, highlighting the importance of dedicated training and preparation.\n\nThe toolkit also covers **posting jobs and engaging talent** through LinkedIn presence and InMail. These skills are vital for attracting and communicating with potential candidates [8]. Image4 provides a comparative analysis of recruiters' performance metrics, such as InMail response rates, underscoring the importance of effective communication strategies.\n\nLastly, the toolkit includes **maximizing efficiency** through organizational and collaboration tools. This ensures that recruiters can work collaboratively and efficiently within their teams [10]. Image3, with the \"How to Prepare\" section, suggests that structured preparation and access to the certification curriculum are essential for mastering these tools.\n\nIn summary, the Ultimate Toolkit for Recruiters includes LinkedIn Recruiter Certification, advanced search techniques, talent pipeline management, best practices, job posting and engagement strategies, and efficiency tools"}

According to the provided images and text quotes, we can determine which chemical elements are present in the hard disk and whether they exceed the limit requirements.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Image1** and **Image2** show a table listing restricted substances in various components, including the hard disk. The table indicates the presence of lead (Pb) in the hard disk, marked with an \"X\" under the Pb column, while other substances like mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), hexavalent chromium (Cr VI), polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are marked with \"O,\" indicating their absence.\n\n2. **Image3** provides a similar table in a different language, confirming the absence of mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and PBDE in the hard disk, but does not explicitly mention lead (Pb). However, since Image2 clearly marks lead as present, we can infer that lead is the only restricted substance in the hard disk.\n\n3. **Text Quote [4]** mentions that batteries and accumulators must be recycled due to the potential presence of hazardous substances like lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd). While this does not directly address the hard disk, it highlights the importance of lead as a restricted substance.\n\n4. **Text Quote [5]** states that the product complies with the RoHS directive, which restricts the use of hazardous substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, PBB, and PBDE.

According to the quotes and images provided, the journey from data to value is systematic and involves multiple steps, each building on the previous one to ensure that insights are actionable and impactful.\n\nFirst, data is collected and reported, as shown in image1, which depicts the flow from data to reporting, analysis, action, and finally value. This initial stage involves descriptive reporting, which is backward-looking and focuses on what happened, as detailed in image2. Reporting provides the foundation by converting raw data into information through reports, dashboards, and alerts, but lacks context and prescriptive insights [2][3][5][10].\n\nNext, the data moves into the analysis phase, where it is transformed into insights. Image2 highlights that analysis is prescriptive, forward-looking, and answers why something happened. This stage involves deeper investigation, using data and information to derive actionable recommendations and storytelling, which is crucial for decision-making [2][3][5][10]. The analytics value chain emphasizes that merely analyzing data is insufficient; it must lead to action and impact [3][4].\n\nThe progression continues with action, where insights are implemented. Image1 shows that action is a critical step before value is realized. This aligns with the quote from Zynga, which stresses that insights must lead to changes in behavior to be credited [4]. Strong data leadership and a data-driven culture ensure that insights are acted upon, as mentioned in quotes [6][7][8][11].\n\nFinally, the value is realized when actions lead to measurable business outcomes. Image8 illustrates the hierarchy of business intelligence to analytics, showing that higher levels of analytics (e.g., predictive modeling, optimization) increase business value. This progression from standard reports to advanced analytics ensures that the organization not only understands past performance but also anticipates and shapes future outcomes [8][10][12].\n\nIn summary, the transformation of data into business value progresses through reporting, analysis, action, and impact, with each stage building on the previous to ensure that data insights drive meaningful business decisions and outcomes. \n\n![Data to Value Process](image1) ![Reporting vs Analysis](image2) ![Analytics Levels](image8)"}

This involves understanding the initial scope through various modeling techniques such as usage modeling, domain modeling, and process modeling, as highlighted in image5. These strategies help in creating a light specification that is goals-driven, ensuring that the initial requirements are well-defined and aligned with the project's objectives [5].\n\nSecondly, the framework advocates for **active stakeholder participation** to gather and refine requirements. This is depicted in image2, where active stakeholder participation is a key component of the disciplined agile approach, ensuring that stakeholder needs are continuously addressed and integrated into the development process [3].\n\nThirdly, the framework supports the use of **executable specifications** over traditional documentation, as seen in image2. This approach aligns with the principle that on advanced teams, requirements are often represented as executable acceptance tests rather than static documents [5].\n\nAdditionally, the framework includes **test-first development (TFD)** as a technique to ensure that development is driven by tests, which is part of the broader strategy to produce a potentially consumable solution. This is illustrated in image8, where test-first programming is highlighted as a key development strategy [6].\n\nThe framework also emphasizes the importance of **just-in-time (JIT) modeling** and **look-ahead modeling** to keep the scope flexible and responsive to changing needs.

This alignment is facilitated by the spindle fibers, which attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. The image6 illustrates this alignment, showing chromosomes lined up at the metaphase plate with microtubules attached to their kinetochores. This arrangement ensures that each daughter cell will receive one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n\nSecondly, the chromosomes are in a tetrad form, where each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. This is evident in image6, which depicts tetrads with attached kinetochores. The centromeres of the sister chromatids are still joined, and the homologous chromosomes are held together by chiasmata formed during crossing over in prophase I.\n\nAdditionally, the nuclear envelope has already broken down, allowing the spindle fibers to interact with the chromosomes. Image6 also highlights the presence of centrosomes and the spindle apparatus, which play a critical role in organizing the chromosomes at the metaphase plate.\n\nThe alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate is a key feature of Metaphase I, ensuring that the homologous chromosomes are correctly positioned for their separation in Anaphase I. This process is distinct from Metaphase II, where sister chromatids align individually.\n\nIn summary, Metaphase I involves the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores, and the presence of tetrads, all of which are essential for the reductional division characteristic of meiosis.\n\n![Homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate](image6)"}

According to the text and image quotes, this phase is crucial for laying the groundwork for effective development.\n\nFrom the text quotes, [3] highlights Test-First Development (TFD) as a technique where you write a single test and then just enough production code to fulfill that test, which aligns with the agile principle of writing executable specifications. This approach is further supported by [1], which mentions that on advanced teams, requirements \"specifications\" are executable acceptance tests over specification documents. Additionally, [5] notes that techniques like TFD can be performed at the requirements level with acceptance tests and at the design level with developer/unit tests.\n\nImage3 provides a detailed breakdown of the 'Needs Exploration' phase, emphasizing several key activities:\n- **Active stakeholder participation**: Engaging stakeholders directly to ensure their needs are understood and incorporated.\n- **High-level requirements specification**: Defining broad requirements to guide the development process.\n- **Split (A/B) testing**: Testing different versions to determine the best approach.\n- **Detailed requirements specification**: Refining high-level requirements into specific, actionable items.\n- **Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)**: Writing acceptance tests to drive the development process.\n- **Look-ahead modeling**: Planning future work to anticipate needs and challenges.\n\nImage5 further elaborates on addressing changing stakeholder needs, which is a critical aspect of 'Needs Exploration'. It includes strategies like prioritization, change acceptance, and stakeholder interaction, ensuring that the solution remains relevant and adaptable.\n\nIn summary, the key components of the 'Needs Exploration' phase include active stakeholder involvement, defining and refining requirements, using test-driven approaches, and planning for future needs.

This is illustrated in image2, where the nuclear envelope is shown forming around the daughter chromosomes. Additionally, the chromosomes begin to decondense, becoming less visible under a microscope. The nucleolus, which was absent during mitosis, reappears as it starts to form again, as depicted in image2 with the label \"Nucleolus Forming.\"\n\nCytokinesis follows telophase and involves the division of the cytoplasm. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms at the cell's equator, as shown in image2, which deepens and eventually pinches the cell into two separate daughter cells. This process is driven by a contracting ring of microfilaments, as illustrated in image6, where the \"Contracting ring of Microfilaments\" is highlighted, leading to the formation of two distinct daughter cells.\n\nIn plant cells, cytokinesis occurs differently. A cell plate forms at the center of the cell, as shown in image5, and grows outward to divide the cell into two. This is supported by vesicles containing cell wall material, which fuse to form the new cell wall between the daughter cells. Image4 shows plant cells with a visible cell plate forming, indicating the progression of cytokinesis.\n\nOverall, telophase and cytokinesis ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes and organelles, completing the cell division process.\n\n**Answer:** During telophase, the nuclear envelope reforms around the chromosomes, and the nucleolus reappears.

The F1 generation all exhibited purple flowers, indicating that the purple allele (P) is dominant over the white allele (p) [11]. This is shown in image4, where the P generation (true-breeding parents) with purple and white flowers produce an F1 generation with all purple flowers.\n\nWhen the F1 generation (heterozygous Pp) self-fertilizes, the alleles segregate during gamete formation, resulting in a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (PP:Pp:pp) and a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (purple:white) in the F2 generation [11]. This segregation is illustrated in image1, which shows the genetic makeup of the gametes and the resulting F2 plants. The dominant purple allele masks the presence of the recessive white allele in heterozygous individuals (Pp), leading to the observed phenotypic ratio.\n\nThe genotypic ratio is explained by the combination of alleles from the gametes. Each parent produces gametes with either P or p alleles, leading to four possible combinations in the F2 generation: PP, Pp, Pp, and pp. The phenotypic ratio arises because both PP and Pp express the dominant purple phenotype, while only pp expresses the recessive white phenotype [11].\n\nImage3 depicts dominant and recessive alleles on a chromosome, reinforcing the concept that dominant alleles mask recessive ones. Image8 further clarifies the genotypes, showing homozygous dominant (PP), homozygous recessive (aa), and heterozygous (Bb) conditions, which are analogous to the Pp and pp combinations in Mendel's experiment.\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance predicts the observed ratios by the segregation of alleles and the dominance of one allele over another, resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio and a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\n![Genetic makeup and phenotypic ratio in F2 generation](image"}

When enjoyment drops, we should switch to another choice. This suggests that as we consume more of the same item, the additional satisfaction (utility) we get from each unit decreases, which aligns with the concept of diminishing marginal utility.\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image2 and image4 provide detailed tables showing the utility derived from each hot dog consumed. Image2 illustrates two scenarios: one where utility decreases steadily with each hot dog, eventually becoming negative, and another where utility spikes dramatically at a certain point (64 hot dogs) before dropping again. Image4 shows a simpler version where utility decreases from +10 to -10 as more hot dogs are consumed.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility and differential outcome](image2) shows that initially, consuming hot dogs provides positive utility, but this utility diminishes with each additional hot dog, eventually turning negative. This implies that consumers should switch to other choices before reaching the point of negative utility to maximize overall satisfaction. Similarly, ![Utility from each hot dog](image4) demonstrates a clear decline in utility, reinforcing the idea that variety is beneficial to maintain positive consumption experiences.\n\nIn summary, the utility from each additional hot dog consumed decreases, eventually becoming negative, which implies that consumers should diversify their choices to avoid diminishing returns and maintain higher overall satisfaction.\n\n**Answer:** Utility decreases with each additional hot dog consumed, eventually becoming negative, implying that consumers should diversify their choices to avoid diminishing returns and maintain higher satisfaction."}

The process occurs in two stages: meiosis I and meiosis II, each with distinct phases and outcomes.\n\n**Meiosis I:**\n- **Chromosome Separation:** During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. This is depicted in image5, which shows the stages of meiosis I, including prophase I, metaphase I, and anaphase I. In anaphase I, homologous chromosomes are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell, as illustrated in image4, where homologous chromosomes are shown separating.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis I results in two haploid cells, each with a single set of chromosomes. Image6 shows the progression from anaphase II to telophase II, but the separation of homologous chromosomes in anaphase I is a critical step leading to this reduction.\n\n**Meiosis II:**\n- **Chromosome Separation:** In meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. This is shown in image2, where sister chromatids are depicted separating during anaphase II, leading to the formation of haploid daughter cells. Image3 illustrates sister chromatids as part of a duplicated chromosome, emphasizing their role in this stage.\n- **Cell Division:** Meiosis II is similar to mitosis, where sister chromatids are divided into individual chromosomes. This results in four haploid cells, each with a single set of chromosomes. Image6 also shows the final stages of meiosis II, including telophase II, where the cells complete their division.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n- **Meiosis I** involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number from diploid to haploid, as described in [1] and [3]. This is visually represented in image4 and image5.\n- **Meiosis II** involves the separation of sister chromatids, akin to mitosis, but without chromosome duplication beforehand, as noted in [11]. Image2 and image3 highlight this process.\n\nIn summary, meiosis I reduces chromosome number by separating homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II separates sister chromatids to produce four genetically distinct haploid cells.

This method calculates zones based on your heart rate reserve (HRmax - HRrest).\n\n[3] After you start a workout, swipe on the watch screen to check your real-time heart rate and heart rate zone.\n\n[11] During the workout, press the Up button to pause or end the running course, lock the screen, or adjust the volume for prompts during the workout. Press the Down button to switch between screens and view different workout data. (Take Outdoor Run mode as an example. During the workout, you can view a range of data displayed next to Heart rate, Pace, Distance, Time, Steps, Cadence, Total calories, and Total climbing.)\n\n### Image Evidence:\n![Heart rate display showing \"Aerobic\" zone](image2)\n\n### Answer Construction:\nThe heart rate zone color display on the fitness tracker corresponds to the intensity of your workout, as indicated by your heart rate. When you start a workout, the watch will show your real-time heart rate and the corresponding zone, which is color-coded. For example, during an outdoor run, if your heart rate falls into the \"Aerobic\" zone, the display will show this zone in a specific color, as seen in ![Heart rate display showing \"Aerobic\" zone](image2). The watch uses the **HRR percentage** method by default for running, which divides zones based on your heart rate reserve. You can swipe the screen to check your heart rate and zone during the workout, and the display will update in real-time. The watch also allows you to switch between different data screens using the Up and Down buttons, ensuring you can monitor your heart rate alongside other metrics like pace, distance, and time.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe heart rate zone color on the fitness tracker visually represents your workout intensity, updating in real-time based on your heart rate during the activity."}

It reads values from sensors to adjust fuel injection and ignition timing based on engine conditions [3][4][5]. For instance, when the throttle pedal is pressed, the ECU injects more fuel to match the increased air intake, and it also adjusts ignition timing for better power and economy [4][5]. Additionally, the ECU controls idle speed by monitoring engine RPM and adjusting the throttle or air bypass [6].\n\nIn the provided images, image1 illustrates the ECU as the central hub receiving input from various sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, and others. These sensors provide real-time data to the ECU, which then sends control signals to the injectors and other components.

The Zhaolanyuan Supermarket operates from 9:00am to 8:00pm. These stores are conveniently located within the campus, making them easily accessible for students throughout most of the day and early evening. [8]\n- **Zhaolanyuan Market** (image7): Located in the Zhaolanyuan area, open from 8:30am to 7:00pm. This market provides additional shopping options during the day. [7]\n\n**Off-Campus Supermarkets:**\n- **Lotus Supermarket, BHG Supermarket, and Carrefour** (image4): These supermarkets are located in the Wudaokou and Zhongguancun areas. They operate from 9:00am to 9:00pm (Lotus and BHG) and 8:30am to 10:00pm (Carrefour). These stores are open slightly later than some on-campus options but require students to travel off-campus. [4]\n\n**Impact on Students' Shopping Schedules:**\n- **Convenience:** On-campus supermarkets like Tmall stores and Zhaolanyuan Supermarket offer extended hours, allowing students to shop during late evenings, which is beneficial for those with busy schedules or late-night study sessions. The proximity to dormitories and teaching buildings means students can quickly grab essentials without leaving campus.\n- **Off-Campus Options:** While off-campus supermarkets like Carrefour stay open until 10:00pm, students need to factor in travel time, which might be less convenient for late-night shopping. The earlier closing times of on-campus options like Zhaolanyuan Supermarket (8:00pm) could limit evening shopping, but the extended hours of Tmall stores compensate for this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOn-campus supermarkets generally offer more flexible hours, especially in the evenings, which is advantageous for students' schedules. Off-campus options, while available, may require additional time for commuting, potentially affecting how students plan their shopping trips.\n\n![On"}

[4][6][10][image4]\n- **AF-C (Continuous)**: Suitable for moving subjects. [4][6][10][image4]\n- **MF (Manual)**: Allows manual focus by touching the subject of interest, such as a subject's face. [6][10][image4]\n\n### Metering Modes\n- **Matrix**: Measures light across the entire frame, ideal for natural landscapes. [8][image5]\n- **Center**: Focuses on light near the center, ideal for portraits. [8][image5]\n- **Spot**: Focuses on a specific region, such as a subject's eyes. [8][image5]\n\n### Pro Mode Features\n- **Pro Mode** provides full control over settings like ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation, enhancing flexibility. [7][9][image3]\n\n### Practical Application\n- **Wide Aperture Mode**: Achieves a blurred background with sharp focus on the subject. [1]\n- **Zoom and Focus Adjustment**: Pinch or drag to zoom; touch to focus. [2][5][10][image3]\n- **ISO Sensitivity and Shutter Speed**: Adjust based on lighting conditions. [7][image3]\n- **Exposure Compensation**: Adjust EV value for optimal brightness. [7][image3]\n\n### Conclusion\nBy selecting appropriate focus and metering modes in Pro Mode, photographers can adapt to different scenarios, ensuring accurate focus and exposure. For example, use **AF-C** for moving subjects and **Matrix** metering for landscapes, while **MF** and **Spot** metering are useful for detailed portraits.\n\n![Focus modes for different scenarios](image4) ![Metering modes for different scenarios](image5)"}
