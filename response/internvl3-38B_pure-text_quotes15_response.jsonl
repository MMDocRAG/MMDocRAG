From the text quotes, we know that both parties are rated equally at 50% for having good policy ideas [2], and the Democratic Party is slightly higher at 42% for high ethical standards compared to the Republican Party at 41% [4][10].

Text quote [5] states that 6% of those younger than 30 followed the news very closely, but this is not specific to Democrats. However, text quote [9] mentions that Democrats are about as likely as conservative Republicans to follow the news fairly closely, but it doesn't specify the \"very closely\" percentage. \n\nImage1 provides a breakdown by political affiliation, showing that Liberals (who are likely to be Democrats) follow the subject most closely at 62% NET, which includes both \"very closely\" and \"fairly closely.\" However, the exact \"very closely\" percentage for Democrats isn't specified in the image description. \n\nGiven the available data, the most precise information comes from text quote [1], which states that 19% of Americans follow the news very closely.

This aligns with the text noting that younger users find it more acceptable for platforms to use personal data for recommendations [4].\n\nWhen it comes to automated decision-making, the survey reveals skepticism. For example, 68% find personal finance scores using consumer data unacceptable, while only 31% find it acceptable [![Acceptability of automated processes](image2)].

About 66% of Americans believe that the U.S. and its allies will either definitely or probably succeed in their efforts against Islamic militants, marking an 11-point increase from July of the same year [2]. This uptick in optimism is reflected in the comparison of survey results from July 2015 to December 2015, where the percentage of those who think the campaign will fail dropped from 36% to 27%, while those expecting success rose from 55% to 66% ![Optimism increased from July to December 2015](image1). \n\nHowever, when it comes to the current assessment of how well the campaign is progressing, a majority of 58% say it is not going well, with only 35% expressing a positive view ![Current ratings remain negative](image2). This persistent negativity about the campaign's progress contrasts with the growing confidence in its eventual success. The public's approval of the military campaign remains steady at 64%, with little change throughout 2015 [3]. \n\nAdditionally, the recent terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino did not significantly alter public opinion on the military effort, indicating that while the immediate effectiveness is doubted, there is a sustained belief in the long-term success of the campaign against ISIS [7]. This nuanced perspective suggests that while the public is critical of the current execution, they remain hopeful about the ultimate outcome. \n\nIn summary, despite skepticism about the current state of the military effort, a majority of Americans still believe that the U.S. and its allies will ultimately succeed in their campaign against ISIS by the end of 2015."}

However, the exact percentage of Republicans who are Hispanic is not directly provided in the text quotes. The text quotes do mention that among those who lean Republican, 13% are Hispanic [2], but this is for leaners, not identified Republicans.\n\nFor those with no lean (independents with no party affiliation), 55% are male [2]. The text quotes also state that less than 10% of Americans have no partisan leaning [6], and image4 confirms that in 2018, 7% of Americans have no lean [3].\n\nTo estimate the population, we need to consider the overall percentages of each group. The text quotes indicate that 26% of Americans call themselves Republicans [7], and 7% have no lean [3]. Assuming the Hispanic percentage for identified Republicans is similar to leaners (13%), the number of Hispanic Republicans would be approximately 26% of the population multiplied by 13%, which is about 3.38% of the total population. For those with no lean, 55% of 7% (the no lean group) are male, which is about 3.85% of the total population.\n\nThus, the group of no leans who are male is slightly larger than the group of Republicans who are Hispanic.\n\n![Demographic breakdown showing higher percentage of males among no leans](image2)\n\n**Answer:** In 2018, the group of no leans who are male is greater in population than Republicans who are Hispanic."}

This level of awareness is reflected in image2, which shows that 24% of respondents have heard a lot, 61% a little, and 14% nothing at all about the concept. Among those who are most familiar, nearly half (48%) find it extremely realistic that machines might one day perform many human jobs [6], aligning with image5 where 48% of those who have heard a lot believe the concept is extremely realistic.\n\nDespite this familiarity, Americans express more worry than enthusiasm. Overall, 72% are worried compared to 33% who are enthusiastic [9], as illustrated in image4, where 25% are very worried and 48% somewhat worried, while only 6% are very enthusiastic and 27% somewhat enthusiastic. This concern is particularly pronounced when considering specific outcomes: 76% believe inequality between rich and poor will worsen, and 64% think people will struggle to find purpose without work, as shown in image3. Conversely, only 25% expect the economy to create new, better-paying jobs.\n\nWhile many anticipate negative impacts, a significant portion also sees potential benefits. For instance, 43% believe the economy could become more efficient, and 42% think people might focus more on meaningful activities [3].

A significant majority of Americans, regardless of party affiliation, favor policies that restrict machines to performing dangerous and dirty jobs. This is evident from the text, which states that 85% of Americans support limiting robots and computers to jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans [9]. This sentiment is further reinforced by image4, which shows that 47% strongly favor this policy, with an additional 38% favoring it, indicating a strong consensus on this issue.\n\nWhen it comes to businesses replacing human jobs with machines, the public is divided. Text [7] highlights that nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) believe there should be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines, while 41% think businesses are justified in doing so if machines can perform better at a lower cost. This division is visually represented in image2, where 58% of respondents believe in placing limits, while 41% support the idea of businesses replacing workers with machines for efficiency and cost savings.\n\nPartisan differences emerge in other policy preferences. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support a universal income and national service programs in the event of widespread automation [3]. However, both parties largely agree on limiting machines to dangerous jobs, with 60% of Democrats and 54% of Republicans in favor [3]. This alignment suggests a shared concern about the ethical and safety implications of automation.\n\nDespite these concerns, the public remains cautious about the immediate adoption of technologies like driverless vehicles. Text [1] notes that more than half of the public would not want to ride in a driverless vehicle today, citing worries about life-or-death decisions being made by machines.

This highlights a gap between theoretical support for automation and practical acceptance.\n\nOverall, the public is supportive of policies that protect human workers from displacement by machines, particularly in dangerous roles, while being wary of the broader implications of automation. The consensus on limiting machines to hazardous tasks underscores a desire to balance technological advancement with human safety and job security. \n\nIn summary, the public strongly favors limiting machines to dangerous and dirty jobs, with 85% in support, and is divided on whether businesses"}

The Seed stage remained relatively stable around €2M, while the First, Second, and Later stages saw more pronounced fluctuations, with the Later stage peaking above €8M before dropping to just above €6M by 2009. This suggests a cyclical pattern influenced by broader market conditions, possibly reflecting the economic downturn around 2008.\n\nIn Europe, the trend is somewhat similar but with distinct regional characteristics. The line graph in image5 shows that European investments also peaked around 2007-2008, particularly for the Later stage, which aligns with the U.S. pattern. However, the other stages (Seed, First, Second) in Europe exhibited less variation compared to the U.S., indicating a more stable investment environment or perhaps a slower response to market changes. The Seed stage in Europe remained relatively consistent, while the First and Second stages showed modest fluctuations, peaking around 2007 before stabilizing.\n\nThese trends highlight that both regions experienced a boom in investment activity mid-decade, likely driven by post-bubble recovery and increased confidence in venture capital performance [7]. However, the U.S. saw more pronounced fluctuations, possibly due to its larger and more volatile market dynamics. In contrast, Europe's more stable trends could reflect its smaller, more selective venture capital environment, where capital efficiency is higher due to the scarcity of VC money [1]. This scarcity has driven European firms to be more capital-efficient, as evidenced by lower average capital invested prior to exit compared to the U.S. [4], as shown in image4, where Europe's average capital invested is $44 million versus $79 million in the U.S.\n\nOverall, while both regions saw investment peaks around 2007-2008, the U.S. experienced more significant volatility, whereas Europe maintained relative stability, particularly in early-stage investments.

Similarly, the press and pollsters were also harshly criticized, with only 22% and 21% respectively receiving A or B grades, and a majority giving them failing grades [3][4]. This widespread negativity likely influenced voter emotions, as 53% of all voters felt uneasy about Trump’s election, while 51% felt hopeful [6]. Among Clinton voters, feelings of unease (90%), sadness (77%), and fear (76%) were prevalent, contrasting sharply with the 96% of Trump voters who felt hopeful [1].

Today, more Americans believe that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%) than those who think these policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%) [10]. This reflects a broader trend where evaluations of the government’s job in reducing the terrorist threat are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 attacks, with 52% saying the government is doing not too well or not at all well, compared to 46% who rate it positively [2]. This decline is evident across the political spectrum, with Democrats being the only group where a majority (64%) still view the government’s efforts favorably, down from 85% in January [3].

This contrasts with older age groups, who are more concerned about insufficient action against Islamic militants. Similarly, when it comes to balancing civil liberties and security, younger adults are split: 43% believe policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties, while 44% think they do not go far enough to protect the country [3]. In contrast, majorities in older age groups prioritize security over civil liberties, with 71% of those 65 and older expressing this concern [3].

According to the text, 41% of Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues, and national security or ISIS as the most important problem, while fewer independents (28%) and Democrats (23%) cite these issues [6]. This partisan divide is further highlighted by the fact that Republicans more commonly mention immigration as the most important problem (14%) than do independents (7%) or Democrats (3%), whereas Democrats are more likely to cite partisan gridlock and division in the country (8% of Democrats vs. 2% of Republicans) [2]. \n\nThese differing priorities are reflected in their perceptions of government efforts to address the terrorist threat. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well, though this is a significant drop from 85% in January [4]. Independents’ positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%, and just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year [4]. This indicates a widespread decline in confidence across the political spectrum, with Republicans showing the most dramatic drop in positive ratings.\n\nThe image3 table supports this by showing that Republicans prioritize terrorism and related issues more than Democrats and Independents, with a clear Republican-Democratic difference highlighted in red for these categories. Additionally, the image5 data shows that concerns about terrorism and national security have increased significantly from 2014 to 2015, rising from 4% to 29%, which aligns with the text's observation that positive ratings of government efforts have fallen 26 points since January, with more Americans now saying the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat (52%) than those who say it is doing well (46%) [7].\n\nOverall, the partisan divide in prioritizing terrorism correlates with varying levels of satisfaction with government performance, with Republicans expressing the least confidence in the government's efforts to combat terrorism.

This partisan divide is evident in how these groups evaluate the U.S.'s current handling of the pandemic. For instance, fewer than half (44%) of those who think the U.S. can learn from abroad say the country is doing an excellent or good job, compared to 63% of those who believe the U.S. can't learn much from overseas [1]. This suggests that trust in international learning is linked to a more critical view of domestic handling.\n\nThese perceptions also correlate with trust levels in international organizations. Trust in the WHO and EU is notably higher among those with higher education levels and liberal Democrats. For example, 70% of postgraduate degree holders trust WHO information at least a fair amount, with about one-third trusting it a great deal [2][3]. Similarly, 78% of Americans with a postgraduate degree trust information from the EU [3]. However, trust in these organizations is starkly divided along partisan lines. While 62% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the WHO has done at least a good job, only 28% of Republicans and GOP leaners agree [9].

This stark division is further illustrated by the image showing that among Hispanic registered voters, 54% disapprove of Trump, while 45% approve, with Democrats/Lean Democrats showing a strong approval (65%) and Republicans/Lean Republicans a strong disapproval (92%) [image2].\n\nRegarding racial discrimination, Hispanic Democrats are more likely to believe that people not seeing racial discrimination where it really does exist is a bigger problem. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of Latino Democrats and Democratic leaners hold this view, compared to about six-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners who think it's a bigger problem that people see racial discrimination where it does not exist [1]. The image highlights that among all Latinos, 61% do not see existing discrimination, but this drops to 36% among Republicans/Lean Republicans, while 73% of Democrats/Lean Democrats do not see existing discrimination [image5]. Additionally, two-thirds of Hispanics who consider being Hispanic important to their identity (66%) say not seeing racial discrimination is a significant problem, compared to 54% of those for whom it is less important [4]. This underscores the role of identity in shaping these perceptions.\n\nIn summary, Hispanic Democrats and Republicans have divergent views on Trump's political future and the perception of racial discrimination, with Democrats more critical of Trump and more concerned about underrecognition of racial discrimination."}

This suggests that Democrats have a broad appeal across various Latino subgroups. However, the perception of Republicans is markedly different; only about one-in-five Latinos (19%) feel that Republicans work hard to earn their votes, with Latino Republicans being more likely (40%) to agree compared to Latino Democrats (13%) [3].

The image data further illustrates these disparities: in male-dominated workplaces, 78% of women report gender-related discrimination, compared to 44% in more balanced or female-dominated environments [image1]. Additionally, women in STEM jobs are more likely to feel their gender hinders success and perceive a lack of attention to gender diversity [image1][image3].\n\nComparing the two, while racial discrimination disproportionately affects Black individuals in STEM, gender discrimination is widespread among women, particularly in male-dominated fields. Both forms of discrimination highlight systemic issues within STEM workplaces, with racial discrimination being more pronounced for Black employees and gender discrimination affecting women across various contexts. The data and images collectively emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address these inequalities.\n\nIn summary, racial discrimination in STEM is most severe for Black employees, with 62% reporting experiences, while gender discrimination affects 50% of women in STEM jobs, particularly in male-dominated environments."}

According to the data, 78% of women in majority-male workplaces report experiencing gender discrimination, which is substantially higher than the 44% of women in majority-female or evenly mixed workplaces [6]. This disparity is further highlighted by the fact that 48% of women in male-dominated settings believe their gender has made it harder to succeed, compared to just 12% in majority-female workplaces [8]. \n\nThe image1 illustrates these statistics, showing that women in male-dominated STEM environments are more likely to face discrimination and perceive gender as a barrier to success. Additionally, women in these settings are more likely to feel they need to prove themselves to be respected by coworkers, with 79% feeling this pressure, compared to 52% in more balanced workplaces [4]. This aligns with the text, which notes that women in majority-male workplaces perceive more gender inequities and often feel they must work harder to earn appreciation [10].\n\nMoreover, the image4 provides a detailed comparison, indicating that women in male-dominated environments are more likely to experience sexual harassment and feel their workplace pays too little attention to gender diversity. For instance, 27% of women in male-dominated settings have experienced sexual harassment, compared to 21% in mixed-gender workplaces, and 43% feel their workplace neglects gender diversity, compared to 15% in more balanced settings. These findings underscore the challenges women face in male-dominated STEM environments, where gender balance is a critical factor in their experiences of discrimination and inequity [7].\n\nIn summary, women in STEM jobs in male-dominated environments face significantly more workplace discrimination and gender inequities than those in more gender-balanced settings, with higher rates of perceived barriers to success and greater feelings of needing to prove themselves."}

By the third generation, the share of U.S.-born individuals with U.S.-born parents and immigrant grandparents who self-identify as Hispanic drops to 77%, and by the fourth generation or higher, only half of those with Hispanic ancestry identify as Hispanic [1]. This decline reflects a shift in how identity is perceived over generations, with later generations often feeling more connected to their American identity than their Hispanic heritage [8].\n\nGenerational experiences play a crucial role. Immigrant Hispanics are less likely to see themselves as typical Americans (36%), but this perception increases to 63% among second-generation Hispanics and 73% among third or higher generation Hispanics [7]. This trend is evident in the image showing generational differences in self-identification, where the \"Third or higher generation\" group has a higher percentage in the \"American\" category compared to earlier generations [image1]. \n\nLanguage is another key factor. While speaking Spanish is not a requirement for Latino identity, the ability to speak Spanish decreases with each generation. Among third or higher generation Latinos, 92% say speaking Spanish is not necessary to be considered Latino, aligning with the image data showing that only 7% of this group speak Spanish [6][image5]. Similarly, having a Spanish last name is not a defining characteristic, with 84% of self-identified Hispanics not having one [4][image5].\n\nPersonal identity and cultural links also influence self-identification. For those with Hispanic ancestry who do not identify as Hispanic, reasons include mixed backgrounds (27%), limited contact with Hispanic relatives (16%), and lack of cultural ties (15%) [10][image2]. The image illustrating these reasons highlights the diversity of factors, with \"Mixed background/Hispanic ancestry too far back\" being the most common [image2].\n\nIn terms of preferred self-identification, 50% of self-identified Hispanics prefer terms related to their country of origin or heritage, while 23% each prefer \"Hispanic/Latino\" and \"American\" [image3].

This demographic is also highly engaged with social media, with 92% of Indonesian Facebook users accessing the platform via mobile [5]. The image2 highlights that social media accounts for 24% of mobile internet activities, making it a crucial channel for engagement.\n\nMoreover, the image2 also shows that games and apps are the most downloaded mobile content, with 70% of downloads falling into this category. This aligns with the text [3], which notes that WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), and LINE are the top three instant messaging apps installed on mobile devices, with LINE alone reporting 30 million users in Indonesia. The preference for social media and messaging apps suggests a strong opportunity for businesses to leverage these platforms for marketing and e-commerce.

This indicates a strong presence in the market. However, the ARPU trends for Telkomsel, like other operators, were affected by the shift in consumer behavior towards data usage. The line graph in ![ARPU trends for Voice, SMS, and Mobile Data from 2013 to 2017](image1) shows that Voice and SMS ARPU declined, while Mobile Data ARPU initially fell but began to rise after 2015. This aligns with the text stating that \"Voice ARP U will continue to flatten in the medium term. SMS ARP U will continue to decrease, because majority of users will be on smartphones eventually Data ARp U will fall in short term, but will pickup later as users data consumption increases\" [7]. The decline in Voice and SMS ARPU was partly due to reduced usage as people increasingly used data-based services like IM and VoIP [1], which also led to lower overall ARPU [9]. Additionally, the competitive pricing strategies, such as CDMA operators forcing GSM operators to reduce tariffs [2], likely impacted Telkomsel's ARPU. The initial reduction in ARPU was also driven by a government-initiated price war [3]. By 2014, Telkomsel's focus on data services, as seen in the high number of data users, was a strategic move to counter declining voice and SMS revenues, anticipating future growth in data consumption [7]. The overall trend suggests that while Telkomsel maintained a large subscriber base, its ARPU was under pressure due to these market dynamics, but with potential for recovery as data usage grew. \n\nIn summary, Telkomsel's subscriber base remained robust, but ARPU faced pressure from declining voice and SMS usage, with data ARPU expected to recover as data consumption increased."}

This indicates Telkomsel's stronger market presence and higher adoption of data services. The trend in ARPU, as shown in the line graph, reflects a decline in Voice and SMS ARPU, while Mobile Data ARPU initially fell but began to rise after 2015. This shift aligns with the increasing use of data-based services like IM and VoIP, which reduced reliance on traditional voice and SMS, leading to lower ARPUs for these services [2][4][5].\n\nThe decline in Voice and SMS ARPU is evident in the line graph, where both show a consistent downward trend from 2013 to 2017, while Mobile Data ARPU starts to recover post-2015. This recovery is likely due to increased data consumption and the adoption of larger data plans as users engage more with mobile internet [2]. Additionally, the initial reduction in ARPU was partly due to a government-initiated price war, which forced operators to lower tariffs, impacting revenue [9]. However, tariffs have since stabilized, suggesting that further price wars are unlikely [10].\n\nTelkomsel's partnership with Samsung to boost smartphone penetration and the growing Indonesian social media communities, as highlighted in the text, also played a role in driving smartphone adoption and data usage [7]. The consistent decline in prepaid ARPU from 2008 to 2012, as seen in the bar chart, further supports the trend of decreasing revenue per user due to these shifts in consumer behavior and market dynamics [image5].\n\nIn summary, the changes in smartphone users and ARPU for Telkomsel and XL were driven by increased data usage, reduced reliance on voice and SMS, and market competition, with Telkomsel maintaining a stronger position in data services.

Recent studies have found that LLMs occasionally make unfaithful reasoning, where the derived conclusion does not follow the previously generated reasoning chain. In contrast, symbolic inference engines, such as expert systems, are faithful and transparent because the reasoning is based on symbolic-represented knowledge and follows well-defined inference rules [1]. The paper introduces a novel framework, LOGIC-LM, which integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical problem-solving [3]. \n\nThe framework decomposes a logical reasoning problem into three stages: Problem Formulation, Symbolic Reasoning, and Result Interpretation [9]. During the Symbolic Reasoning stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation [2]. For deductive reasoning, the paper incorporates the Pyke expert system, which makes inferences based on the logic programming language [5]. Pyke first creates a knowledge base, populating it with known facts and rules, and then applies forward- and backward-chaining algorithms to infer new facts and substantiate the goal [5].\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the LOGIC-LM framework includes a Symbolic Reasoner component that utilizes different solvers depending on the task [9]. For deductive reasoning, the Pyke expert system is specifically mentioned as the solver used [5].

This conclusion is supported by several pieces of evidence from both text and image quotes.\n\nFrom the text, it is noted that VAAL tends to be biased towards certain classes, particularly in datasets with imbalanced distributions. For instance, in Organ AM NIST, VAAL prefers selecting data from the femur-right and platelet classes while largely ignoring others like lung and liver [6]. This bias is further highlighted in Table 7, where VAAL's performance is compared across different datasets, showing that it struggles to maintain label diversity, especially in low budget scenarios [4]. The text also emphasizes that VAAL's selection bias is a common issue among active querying strategies, which can lead to poor class coverage [8].\n\nThe image quotes provide visual confirmation of this bias. In image1, the bar charts for OrganAMNIST and BloodMNIST show that VAAL's class distribution is highly unbalanced, with significant underrepresentation of minority classes compared to other strategies. Similarly, image5 illustrates that VAAL has the lowest entropy (2.800) on the PathMNIST dataset, indicating a less balanced class distribution. The bar graph clearly shows VAAL's preference for the muscle class while neglecting others like mucus and mucosa, which are better covered by the proposed \"Ours\" strategy.\n\nIn summary, VAAL's tendency to focus on majority classes and neglect minority ones results in poor label diversity, making it the querying strategy with the worst performance in this regard across the datasets examined.\n\n![VAAL shows high bias towards certain classes, neglecting others](image1)\n![VAAL has low entropy, indicating poor class balance](image5)\n\n**Answer**: VAAL generally yields the worst label diversity across all datasets."}

Initially, the user's natural language input is encoded into a continuous vector using a bidirectional LSTM utterance encoder [4]. This encoding, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state [4]. The dialogue state is crucial as it captures the ongoing conversation's context and updates after each turn [7].\n\nNext, the dialogue state tracker updates its estimation of the user's goal, represented by slot-value pairs, and generates a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot [7]. This information is used to formulate a query command, which is sent to a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information [4]. The query results are then encoded and combined with the dialogue state and the estimated user goal to determine the next system action via the policy network [4][9]. The policy network, which is a deep neural network, selects the next system action based on the current dialogue state, the log probabilities of candidate values, and the encoding of the query results [1][9].\n\nFinally, the selected system action is used to generate a natural language response through a template-based natural language generator (NLG). The NLG replaces delexicalized tokens in a template with values from the estimated user goal or the retrieved knowledge base entities, depending on the action [6]. This process ensures that the system's response is contextually appropriate and informative, addressing the user's request effectively.\n\n![Proposed architecture for an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system](image2)\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, tracking the dialogue state, querying a knowledge base, determining the next action, and generating a natural language output based on these components."}

For instance, training models like BERT on GPUs is estimated to emit roughly the same amount of CO₂ as a trans-American flight, which is about 1,984 lbs of CO₂e [10]. This comparison highlights the environmental impact of model training. Additionally, the energy consumption for training these models is often derived from non-renewable sources, as seen in the energy distribution of major companies and countries, where coal and gas are predominant [image1]. For example, China relies heavily on coal (65%), and even companies like Amazon-AWS and Microsoft have significant coal usage (30% and 31%, respectively), contributing to higher emissions.\n\nFurthermore, the cost and emissions escalate dramatically with the number of models trained. Training a single model might cost between $52 and $175 in cloud compute, but training 4,789 models could cost up to $350k and emit a considerable amount of CO₂ [image3]. This scale underscores the environmental burden of extensive experimentation and development in NLP research. The table in image5 quantifies everyday activities, showing that a trans-American flight emits 1,984 lbs of CO₂e, similar to training a model like BERT, while an average American life produces 36,156 lbs annually.

This suggests that models can identify and locate absent knowledge more accurately when more knowledge is missing, highlighting the effectiveness of the 'Conscious Incompetence' setting in addressing coverage issues [5]. However, the stability of recall indicates that models still struggle to retrieve the necessary knowledge when it is absent, as recall is less affected by the model's ability to filter out incorrect information compared to precision [10].\n\nIn the retrieval analysis, as retrieval accuracy decreases, both precision and recall decline, but recall is more significantly impacted [10]. This implies that while models can filter out incorrect knowledge to some extent, the inability to retrieve relevant knowledge leads to a substantial drop in recall, as knowledge cannot be cited if it is not provided [10]. The 'Conscious Incompetence' setting becomes increasingly crucial as the coverage problem worsens, enabling models to better handle absent knowledge by identifying what is missing [5].\n\nThe line graph in image3 illustrates this relationship, showing precision increasing as more knowledge is removed, while recall remains stable.

For instance, when logical constraints are added, the performance on tasks like event relation extraction improves, especially with more demonstrations [2]. The text also highlights that post-processing can guarantee the absence of logical conflicts, resulting in a Logical Inconsistency (LI) of 0%, but it may affect the quality of the generated answers due to random selection and candidate set size limitations [8]. Additionally, pre-training models like Llama2-13B and Vicuna-13B on a synthesized dataset (LLM-LR) enhances their performance, with Llama2-13B-PT surpassing some larger models [9].\n\n![Comparison of model performance with different conditions](image1) shows that models like Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2 exhibit lower LI percentages when logical constraints are applied. For example, Llama2-13B-PT achieves 0% LI with post-processing on both datasets, indicating a complete elimination of logical inconsistencies. However, the Micro-F1 scores vary, with Llama2-13B-PT achieving higher scores when using logical constraints compared to vanilla ICL.\n\n![Performance of Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT](image3) further illustrates that while post-processing achieves 0% LI, the Micro-F1 scores are optimized when logical constraints are combined with chain-of-thought (CoT).

The left graph shows that logical constraints consistently improve performance across MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank (CTB) as the number of demonstrations increases.

According to the text, the RAR approach enhances the few-shot and zero-shot recognition abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by integrating retrieval and ranking mechanisms. This synergy addresses the limitations of CLIP, which struggles with fine-grained distinctions, and the context window constraints of MLLMs, which decline in performance with increasing category numbers [8]. The RAR method retrieves top-k similar results from a memory store and uses MLLMs to rank and refine predictions, effectively pooling relevant information for rare class identification and ensuring attention to lesser-represented classes [7].\n\nIn terms of specific metrics, the RAR models show notable gains across various datasets. For instance, on the LVIS dataset, RAR achieves a 6.4% improvement in zero-shot object recognition performance over the baseline [5]. On the V3Det dataset, which has 13,204 distinct classes, RAR surpasses the CLIP baseline by 1.5 percentage points in overall average precision (AP_all) [9]. This improvement is particularly significant given the complexity of V3Det, highlighting RAR's ability to handle extensive and fine-grained categories [9].\n\nThe image quotes further illustrate these improvements. ![The RAR models show improvements over the baseline models (CLIP variants) in various metrics](image2) highlights that RAR models, especially InternLM-XC2, achieve higher AP_r, AP_c, AP_f, and AP_all scores compared to CLIP variants. The delta values indicate these improvements, with RAR (InternLM-XC2) displaying the highest gains.

For example, RAR (InternLM-XC2) improves AP_all by 1.5 percentage points over the baseline.\n\nFurthermore, ![The image presents a visual summary of the research study on enhancing the performance of CLIP and MLLM using RAR](image3) visually summarizes the improvements in both classification and detection tasks.

Initially, the system employs a pre-processing stage where images are cropped and resized based on bounding box coordinates to focus on the objects of interest. This is crucial because objects in detection datasets often occupy small and varied regions within an image, as illustrated in ![Pre-processing for object detection datasets](image4). The image shows how bounding boxes are used to isolate objects like flowers and a vase, which are then resized to create embeddings that can be effectively analyzed by the model.\n\nFollowing pre-processing, the system retrieves relevant category information using CLIP’s image-text interaction capabilities, as mentioned in [6]. Instead of image-to-image retrieval, which is less effective for small, low-resolution sub-images, the system retrieves the top-k category labels with the highest similarity to the processed image embeddings. This retrieval phase is optimized for speed and accuracy, leveraging index construction techniques to efficiently store and query multimodal embeddings, as described in [3] and depicted in ![Multimodal retriever pipeline](image3).\n\nOnce the top-k categories are retrieved, the system uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rank these candidates. The MLLMs assess the contextual appropriateness of each label with the input image, as highlighted in [4]. This ranking process is further enhanced by fine-tuning the MLLMs on small-scale datasets to improve their ranking performance, ensuring they adhere to the required format and reduce errors, as noted in [7]. The final prediction integrates both the retrieved information and the MLLM’s internal knowledge, as outlined in [5], resulting in a more accurate and contextually aware classification.\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in ![Reranking process for zero-shot object recognition](image2), where initially retrieved class names are reranked to correctly identify objects such as \"earring\" and \"glove.\" This reranking ensures that the system can handle fine-grained distinctions, addressing the limitations of broad association models like CLIP, as discussed in [2]. The overall pipeline, combining retrieval and ranking, is designed to enhance recognition tasks by leveraging both the extensive knowledge of MLLMs and the precision of fine-grained retrieval, as shown in ![RAR pipeline](image3). This method significantly boosts performance in zero-shot recognition settings, as evidenced by the improved scores of the RAR model in ![Performance comparison](image5) across various datasets."}

The self-attention mechanism in both models aids in capturing contextual relationships, but the 'Translation' model's focus on direct translation benefits high-resource settings, while the 'Combined + self-att.' model's resource integration is advantageous in low-resource contexts.\n\nIn summary, the 'Translation' model excels in high-resource languages due to its translation-focused approach, while the 'Combined + self-att.' model performs well in low-resource settings by integrating additional resources and self-attention, demonstrating the adaptability of these methods to different linguistic environments."}

The LANI dataset, as described, consists of 6,000 sequences with an average of 4.7 instructions per sequence, each requiring an average of 24.6 actions and 12.1 tokens [10]. In contrast, the CHAI dataset has 1,596 sequences with an average of 7.7 instructions per sequence, each involving 54.5 actions and 8.4 tokens [10]. This indicates that CHAI instructions are more complex, requiring more actions and potentially more nuanced understanding due to the combination of navigation and manipulation tasks [9]. \n\nThe performance metrics used also reflect these differences. For LANI, the primary metrics are stop distance (SD) and task completion (TC), while for CHAI, they are stop distance (SD) and manipulation accuracy (MA) [6]. The human performance on LANI shows a stop distance error of 5.2 and a task completion rate of 63%, highlighting inherent ambiguities in the task [2]. On CHAI, the human stop distance error is lower at 1.34, but the manipulation accuracy is perfect at 100%, suggesting that while navigation is more precise, manipulation tasks are challenging for automated systems [2].\n\nComparative analysis of methods reveals that baseline approaches like STOP, RANDOMWALK, and MOSTFREQUENT perform poorly on both datasets, underscoring the complexity of the tasks [3].

According to the text, aligning embedding spaces between source and target languages was hypothesized to help the NMT system learn correspondences more easily [4]. However, the results were mixed. For instance, in Table 3, languages like Russian (RU) and Hebrew (HE) showed larger accuracy gains when using aligned embeddings, likely because they had lower baseline BLEU scores and thus more room for improvement [5]. This suggests that alignment benefits languages with significant differences and lower initial performance.\n\nIn contrast, Table 5 indicates that aligning embeddings helped in multilingual systems, where a single encoder processes multiple languages, ensuring embeddings are in similar vector spaces [7]. However, Table 4 showed that alignment was not beneficial for training in other cases, with negligible gains or losses [8]. This implies that a priori alignment might not always be necessary.\n\nExamining the image data, image3 shows that for GL→EN, alignment slightly decreased the score (−1.3), while for RU→EN, it increased slightly (+0.3). For BE→EN, there was no change. This aligns with the text's finding that alignment benefits vary by language pair and baseline performance. Image2 further illustrates that alignment generally improves scores, especially for language pairs like GL and AZ, where the \"align\" column shows the highest values. Image4's graphs also support the idea that pre-training (which includes alignment) boosts BLEU scores more at smaller training sizes, though the impact of alignment specifically isn't detailed here.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of word embeddings can enhance BLEU scores, particularly for dissimilar languages or those with lower baseline performance, but its effectiveness isn't universal across all language pairs.

According to the study, pre-trained embeddings improve the f-measure for target words, especially those with low frequency in the training corpus [1]. This is visually supported by Figure 2, which shows that pre-training boosts accuracy across the entire vocabulary, with notable gains for rare words. The effect is more pronounced in low-resource scenarios, where a \"sweet spot\" exists where pre-trained embeddings are most effective—when there is enough data to train a moderately effective system but not so much that the system is already optimized [4][9].\n\nLanguage similarity also plays a crucial role. The study found that pre-training yields larger gains for more linguistically similar translation pairs. For instance, in Table 5, the G L /P T pair shows the largest improvements, while B E /R U shows a slight decrease [3]. This aligns with the hypothesis that semantically similar languages benefit more from pre-training due to closer semantic neighborhoods [10]. Image1 illustrates this by showing that language pairs with common families (e.g., ES → PT, FR → PT) have significant improvements, with ES → PT (+7.0) and FR → PT (+5.7), while RU → PT (+6.2) and HE → PT (+8.9) show gains despite being less similar, likely due to their low baseline BLEU scores [8].\n\nTraining set size further modulates these effects. Image5 demonstrates that pre-training provides the most substantial gains at smaller training set sizes, with diminishing returns as the dataset grows. The top graph shows that pre-trained models outperform standard models, especially at lower proportions of the dataset, while the bottom graph highlights the gain in BLEU scores, which is highest when training data is limited. This suggests that pre-training is particularly beneficial when data is scarce, helping to bridge gaps in vocabulary and grammar, as seen in the qualitative analysis of GL → EN translations [7]. Image2 shows that pre-trained models better capture rare terms like \"chris\" and \"patent legislation,\" resulting in more grammatically accurate translations.\n\nIn multilingual systems, aligning embeddings is beneficial, especially when sharing an encoder.

This is particularly useful when a single encoder is used for multiple languages, as it reduces the complexity of learning transformations between semantically separate spaces [7]. \n\nHowever, in bilingual scenarios, the necessity of alignment is less pronounced. The study found that while alignment can be beneficial in multilingual setups, it may not be as critical in bilingual systems, where the NMT system can already learn reasonable projections during training [2][3]. For example, in the GL → EN translation, aligning embeddings resulted in a slight decrease in performance (from 12.8 to 11.5), indicating that alignment might not always be advantageous for every language pair [image4]. Similarly, for PT → EN, the change was minimal (−0.2), suggesting that the benefits of alignment vary depending on language similarity and system architecture.\n\nRegarding F-measure scores for target words based on their frequency, pre-training generally improves accuracy across the entire vocabulary, with notable enhancements for low-frequency words. The bar chart in Figure 2 shows that \"pre\" (pre-trained embeddings) consistently outperforms \"std\" (standard embeddings) in higher frequency ranges, highlighting the effectiveness of pre-training in capturing rare vocabulary [8][image2]. This is further supported by the qualitative analysis, where pre-trained embeddings successfully translated less frequent concepts like \"chris\" and \"big lawyer\" in low-resource languages [4][image1].\n\nIn summary, alignment of word embeddings enhances translation performance in multilingual systems by providing a unified vector space, while pre-training boosts the accuracy of translating low-frequency words, especially in low-resource scenarios. The observed differences in F-measure scores underscore the utility of pre-trained embeddings in improving translation quality for less common terms [5][8][image2].\n\n**Answer:** Alignment of word embeddings improves translation performance in multilingual systems by unifying vector spaces, while pre-training enhances accuracy for low-frequency words, particularly in low-resource languages."}

When R-GCN is removed, as seen in the \"No R-GCN\" row of the table in ![The table shows model performance with and without R-GCN, indicating a significant drop in accuracy when R-GCN is absent.](image1), the model's accuracy drops to 62.4 (unmasked) and 63.2 (masked), compared to the full model's 68.5 (unmasked) and 71.6 (masked). This aligns with the text stating that R-GCN enhances performance by updating mention representations based on their relations [2]. Without R-GCN, the model loses the ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, which is essential for tasks like WIKIHOP [4].\n\nNext, the absence of relation types also affects performance. The \"No relation types\" row in ![The table shows model performance with and without relation types, showing minimal improvement over ELMo alone.](image1) shows only marginal improvements over ELMo alone, suggesting that a naive entity graph without relation types does not add much value [9]. This indicates that distinguishing between different relation types is important for effective graph construction.\n\nRemoving specific relation types like MATCH and COREF has varying effects. The \"No MATCH\" row in ![The table shows model performance with and without MATCH, indicating a slight decrease in accuracy.](image1) shows a slight decrease to 64.3 (unmasked) and 67.4 (masked), while \"No COREF\" results in 64.8 (unmasked) with no masked value provided. The text explains that MATCH captures easy coreference cases, and COREF may not be reliable, especially on harder test sets [1]. Interestingly, removing COREF slightly improves performance, possibly because the coreference system struggles with test documents [1].\n\nIn the masked condition, the model relies more on exact matching, making it more effective in recovering coreference links [8].

In the unmasked setting, coreference links are crucial for connecting mentions that refer to the same entity, even when they have different surface forms. However, the coreference system may not always be reliable, especially in the unmasked setting where mentions can vary (e.g., \"US\" vs \"United States\"). This variability can lead to errors if the coreference system fails to link these mentions correctly [2][4][6]. The performance analysis shows that while coreference links are beneficial, their effectiveness depends on the reliability of the coreference system. In the masked setting, coreference links are more effective because all mentions of an entity are labeled with the same identifier (e.g., MASK1), simplifying the task [2][10].\n\nIn the unmasked setting, removing coreference links (No COREF) slightly improves performance, suggesting that the coreference system might introduce noise or errors [6]. This is further supported by the observation that the model performs better without coreference links on the test set, indicating that the test documents may be more challenging for the coreference system [6]. Conversely, in the masked setting, coreference links are more consistently beneficial, as the uniform labeling of entities reduces ambiguity [2][10].\n\nThe table in ![Performance comparison of different model configurations](image2) illustrates this effect. The \"No COREF\" configuration shows improved performance in the unmasked setting (64.8) compared to the full model with coreference (65.3), while the masked performance is not provided, implying that coreference links are more critical in this setting. The ensemble model (Entity-GCN*) achieves the highest scores, highlighting the overall benefit of coreference when integrated effectively [4][6][10].\n\nIn summary, coreference information enhances Entity-GCN performance in the masked setting by simplifying entity identification but can introduce variability in the unmasked setting, where the coreference system's reliability is more critical. The model's performance is optimized when coreference links are used judiciously, leveraging their strengths in masked contexts while mitigating potential errors in unmasked contexts."}

This is supported by the text, which notes that slots like \"people,\" \"area,\" and \"price range\" are successfully transferred across domains, while unique slots like \"parking\" and \"food\" are harder to track [7]. The bar charts in image2 further illustrate this, showing successful transfer for common slots but challenges with domain-specific ones.\n\n![Slot similarities aid in knowledge transfer](image5)\n\nIn summary, GEM is more effective than EWC and naive fine-tuning in adapting to new domains by better preserving performance on original domains and leveraging slot similarities to enhance tracking accuracy."}

According to the findings, all tested systems, including Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and SYSTRAN, exhibit better accuracy when translating pro-stereotypical gender roles compared to anti-stereotypical ones. For instance, Figure 2 in the text [1] and the corresponding image ![Google Translate's higher accuracy for stereotypical translations across languages](image3) show that Google Translate's accuracy is consistently higher for stereotypical translations across languages like Spanish, French, and Hebrew. This trend is evident in the image, where stereotypical translations (purple bars) outperform non-stereotypical ones (red bars) in all tested languages.\n\nThe evaluation metrics, such as accuracy (Acc), Δ_G (difference in performance between masculine and feminine scores), and Δ_S (difference in performance between pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical roles), further highlight these biases. Image ![Accuracy and error metrics for different translation services across languages](image2) illustrates that while some systems like Microsoft Translator achieve higher accuracy in German (74.1%), they still show significant Δ_S values, indicating gender bias. For example, Microsoft Translator has a Δ_S of 30.2 in German, suggesting a notable bias towards stereotypical translations.\n\nAdditionally, the study's challenge set and evaluation protocol, as described in text [5], used datasets like Winogender and WinoBias to assess gender bias. Image ![Breakdown of data across Winogender, WinoBias, and WinoMT by gender classification](image1) shows the distribution of these datasets, emphasizing the importance of evaluating non-stereotypical roles.

For instance, the study found that machine translation systems perform better on stereotypical gender role assignments, as evidenced by the higher accuracy in translating pro-stereotypical roles compared to anti-stereotypical ones. This trend is illustrated in the bar chart showing Google Translate's performance, where stereotypical translations consistently have higher accuracy across languages like Spanish, French, and Hebrew ![Stereotypical translations have higher accuracy than non-stereotypical ones across multiple languages](image1). For example, in Spanish, stereotypical translations achieve 67% accuracy, while non-stereotypical ones drop to 46% [2].\n\nHowever, the addition of stereotypical adjectives can sometimes correct biased translations. In the example provided, adding \"pretty\" to the sentence \"The doctor asked the nurse to help her in the operation\" results in a more accurate translation in Spanish, French, and Ukrainian, as shown in the table where the accuracy improves from 53.1% to 63.5% for Spanish, 37.7% to 48.9% for Russian, and 38.4% to 42.9% for Ukrainian ![Adding stereotypical adjectives improves translation accuracy in some languages](image2). This suggests that explicit gender cues can help systems overcome biases, though this approach is not practical for general use due to its reliance on coreference resolution [8].\n\nMoreover, the table in image3 highlights specific instances where gender bias manifests. In the first row, the Spanish translation incorrectly assigns a male inflection to \"baker\" despite the female pronoun \"ella\" in the source text, demonstrating a bias towards male professions. However, adding \"pretty\" corrects this bias, aligning the translation with the source's gender indication ![Adding adjectives can correct biased translations](image3).

This suggests that while the model retains some capability, critical information is lost, affecting performance. However, when trained on adversarial distractors, the model's accuracy improves, indicating the importance of robust training data [9]. \n\nIn multi-hop reasoning, the text notes that comparison questions often require multi-hop or context-dependent reasoning, and single-paragraph BERT struggles with these, achieving near chance accuracy [7][8]. This aligns with the image quotes, where adversarial training shows a recovery in performance from 46.84 to 60.10 F1 when evaluated on adversarial distractors [image4]. \n\nMoreover, the text emphasizes the challenge of selecting strong distractors, as even 500 distractors are insufficient for multi-hop questions, leading to lower F1 scores in open-domain settings [4][5]. Image2 supports this by showing that adding a gold paragraph in the open-domain setting boosts the F1 score from 39.12 to 53.12, underscoring the need for effective retrieval methods [image2].\n\nFor single-hop questions, the text indicates higher F1 scores, with image3 showing a 70.54 F1 for single-hop questions compared to lower scores for multi-hop and context-dependent questions [image3]. This highlights that single-hop questions are more straightforward for models, whereas multi-hop tasks require more sophisticated reasoning and data strategies.\n\nIn summary, adversarial training and improved distractor selection enhance F1 scores, particularly in multi-hop tasks, while single-hop questions generally perform better due to their simpler structure. The interplay between training data quality and evaluation settings significantly influences model performance.\n\n**Answer**: Different training and evaluation strategies, such as adversarial training and the inclusion of gold paragraphs, improve F1 scores in multi-hop tasks, while single-hop questions inherently achieve higher scores due to their simpler nature."}

Initially, BERT achieved a peak performance of 77% on the original ARCT dataset, which was just three points below the average untrained human baseline [8]. However, when evaluated on the adversarial dataset, BERT's performance dropped to a maximum of 53%, with mean and median scores at 50% [6]. This reduction indicates that the adversarial setup successfully neutralizes the cues that BERT relied on, leading to performance that is essentially random [3][6][7].\n\nThe adversarial dataset was constructed by negating claims and inverting labels, ensuring that the distribution of statistical cues is mirrored across both labels. This approach eliminates the signal that models could previously exploit, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [2][3]. The results show that BERT, despite being a strong learner, has not genuinely learned argument comprehension but rather relied on spurious statistics present in the original dataset [5][7].\n\n![BERT's performance metrics on adversarial dataset](image4) illustrates that even with different configurations (BERT, BERT (W), BERT (R, W), BERT (C, W)), the performance remains around 50%, confirming the effectiveness of the adversarial setup in mitigating cue exploitation. In contrast, ![performance metrics on original dataset](image5) shows higher scores for BERT on the original dataset, highlighting the difference in performance when spurious cues are present.\n\nThe conclusion is that the adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard for future work on ARCT, as it provides a more accurate assessment of models' true comprehension abilities [3][8][10]. This shift underscores the need for models to rely on genuine understanding rather than statistical artifacts, pushing research towards more robust and meaningful advancements in argument comprehension."}

According to the results in ![Greedy decoding performs best among automated methods but still does not reach the performance level of human validation](image1), greedy decoding achieves an average score of 77.53 across various commonsense relations, which is notably higher than other methods like beam search and random sampling. For instance, beam search with 2 beams yields an average of 63.29, while top-5 random sampling results in 53.27. However, human validation of the gold ATOMIC dataset remains the benchmark, with an average score of 86.18, indicating that while greedy decoding approaches human performance, it still falls short.

This reduction can be attributed to several factors. First, the gross carrying amount of developed technology increased slightly from $291 million in 2019 to $302 million in 2020, but the accumulated amortization also rose from $72 million to $111 million, leading to a net decrease in the net carrying amount from $220 million to $194 million. Similarly, the favorable contracts and leases saw an increase in accumulated amortization from $24 million to $32 million, reducing their net carrying amount from $89 million to $81 million. Additionally, the \"Other\" category experienced a decrease in net carrying amount from $22 million to $21 million due to higher accumulated amortization. These changes reflect increased amortization expenses over the year, which are consistent with the depreciation and amortization expenses reported in the text quotes. For instance, the text mentions that depreciation and amortization expenses were $232 million in 2020, up from $227 million in 2019 [1], indicating a higher amortization rate that would impact the net carrying amounts of intangible assets. Furthermore, the introduction of new assets or changes in their useful lives could also contribute to these fluctuations. \n\n![Comparison of finite-lived intangible assets between 2019 and 2020](image5)\n\nIn summary, the decrease in net carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to increased amortization expenses, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization costs reported in the financial statements."}

Foreign exchange risk, identified as a high financial risk for the company [1], significantly influenced these areas. Novo Nordisk employs financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts and currency options, to hedge against currency exposure [7][9]. This hedging strategy aims to mitigate the short-term negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, contributing to more predictable financial results [3][8].\n\nIn 2020, a hypothetical immediate 5% increase in certain currencies versus EUR and DKK would have negatively impacted the company's other comprehensive income by 1,893 DKK million, while the income statement would have seen a positive impact of 299 DKK million, resulting in a total effect of (1,594) DKK million. Conversely, a 5% decrease would have positively affected other comprehensive income by 1,893 DKK million, with the income statement experiencing a negative impact of (299) DKK million, leading to a total effect of 1,594 DKK million [10]. This illustrates the sensitivity of Novo Nordisk's financials to exchange rate movements and the effectiveness of its hedging strategies in offsetting these impacts.\n\nThe company's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges are also reflected in the detailed financial data over the years. For instance, the reserve at 31 December 2020 shows adjustments from exchange rates and cash flow hedges, contributing to the total comprehensive income [image2]. Additionally, the credit exposure data, categorized by ratings, indicates prudent risk management practices, with a focus on counterparties with satisfactory credit ratings to minimize financial losses [4][5][image4].\n\nOverall, Novo Nordisk's comprehensive income and cash flow hedges in 2020 were influenced by both the actual exchange rate fluctuations and the company's proactive risk management strategies, which helped mitigate potential adverse effects on financial performance.\n\n![Exchange rate impacts on financial metrics](image3)"}

According to the data, the AUM across various categories saw substantial growth. For instance, Equity AUM increased from $111 billion in 2018 to $174 billion in 2020, Fixed Income rose from $71 billion to $86 billion, and Alternative/Other grew from $131 billion to $145 billion. This expansion in AUM was driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows, as highlighted in text [9], which noted a 15% increase in asset management revenues in 2020 due to higher average AUM. The total AUM surged from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020, reflecting a robust growth trajectory. \n\nHowever, despite this growth, the fee rates across most categories declined over the same period. The fee rates for Equity remained constant at 76 basis points (bps), but Fixed Income dropped from 33 bps in 2018 to 29 bps in 2020, Alternative/Other fell from 66 bps to 58 bps, and Long-term AUM decreased from 62 bps to 60 bps. The overall Total AUM fee rate also reduced from 47 bps in 2018 to 42 bps in 2020. This trend is evident in the table presented in image1, which shows a general decline in fee rates except for the Equity category.\n\nThe combination of increased AUM and declining fee rates suggests a potential pressure on revenue margins. While higher AUM can lead to greater absolute revenue due to the larger base, the reduction in fee rates could offset some of these gains. The firm's asset management revenues, however, still increased by 15% in 2020, primarily due to the strong performance and positive net flows, as mentioned in text [9]. This indicates that the growth in AUM volume more than compensated for the lower fee rates, contributing to the overall revenue increase. The impact on the firm's revenues is thus a balance between the positive effect of higher AUM and the negative effect of reduced fee rates, with the former appearing to dominate in 2020"}

The table in ![Operating lease assets and liabilities increased from 2019 to 2020](image2) shows that both current and long-term operating lease liabilities saw increases, with current liabilities rising from $158 million to $189 million and long-term liabilities increasing from $639 million to $785 million. The weighted average remaining lease term remained constant at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% to 2.8%, which could have affected the present value of future lease payments. Additionally, the company's acquisition activities, such as the Cytiva Acquisition mentioned in [2], likely contributed to the expansion of lease commitments, as new facilities and equipment were acquired, necessitating additional operating leases.

According to the text, excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to an increase in average revenue per customer relationship, reflecting the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets, and rate increases in the United Kingdom [5]. Additionally, the text mentions that Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue [7]. This aligns with the image data, which shows that direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 2.0% in actual terms and 2.6% in constant currency terms from 2020 to 2021, rising from $15,223 million to $16,455 million [image2].\n\nRegarding the average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship, the image data indicates a significant increase from 2020 to 2021. The average monthly revenue per customer relationship rose from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, representing an actual increase of 8.7% and a constant currency growth of 2.6% [image1].

In 2020, the Corporation's Capex was $21.4 billion, a substantial decrease from the previous year, as it prioritized cost reductions and focused on maintaining capital spending within a range of $16 billion to $19 billion for 2021 [3]. This reduction in Capex was part of broader efforts to strengthen liquidity amid lower global project spending, particularly in the Downstream and Chemical segments, which saw decreases of $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively [6]. The financial implications of these cuts were evident in the overall reduction of expenditures, with total expenditures dropping from $5,245 million in 2019 to $4,476 million in 2020, as shown in the table in image3. This decrease in spending was driven by both capital and other expenditures, aligning with the company's strategy to manage costs in response to industry conditions [4].\n\nOn the tax front, ExxonMobil's total taxes on the income statement decreased from $38.5 billion in 2019 to $22.8 billion in 2020, a reduction of $15.7 billion [10]. This decline was largely due to asset impairments recorded in 2020, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $5.6 billion, compared to an expense of $5.3 billion in 2019. The effective tax rate also dropped from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, reflecting changes in the mix of results across different jurisdictions with varying tax rates [10]. The tax data in image4 highlights these shifts, showing a significant drop in both income taxes and total taxes, which contributed to improved net income despite lower revenues.\n\nThe decrease in Capex and taxes had notable financial implications. By reducing Capex, ExxonMobil aimed to conserve cash and manage its debt, which stood at $68 billion by year-end 2020, with plans to reduce it over time [4].

Insurance investment income, however, declined from $5,530 million in 2019 to $4,807 million in 2021 due to lower interest rates [9]. The railroad segment saw earnings rise from $5,481 million in 2019 to $5,990 million in 2021, driven by higher freight volumes and productivity improvements [7]. Utilities and energy earnings also increased, from $2,840 million in 2019 to $3,495 million in 2021, benefiting from acquisitions and tax benefits [7].

According to the text, total revenues decreased by 10% in 2020, primarily due to declines in the International Operated Markets segment, driven by COVID-19-related closures and limited operations [6]. This decline is reflected in the detailed revenue breakdown, where company-operated sales decreased by 14% and franchised revenues decreased by 8% [image2]. The International Operated Markets segment saw a 19% decrease in company-operated sales and a 14% decrease in franchised revenues, while the U.S. experienced a 4% decrease in company-operated sales and a 2% decrease in franchised revenues [image5]. These declines contributed to a reduction in operating income from $9,070 million in 2019 to $7,324 million in 2020 [image1].\n\nThe decrease in revenues, combined with higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, which increased by 14% to $2,546 million in 2020, further pressured earnings [7]. Additionally, strategic gains, such as the $268 million from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, were offset by increased expenses and lower revenues [2]. The strategic gains per share were $0.26 in 2019 but turned into a charge of $0.26 in 2020, impacting both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings [image3].

These factors are crucial for determining the fair value of stock options, reflecting the company's financial and market conditions at the time of grant. For instance, risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields, while expected volatilities consider both historical and implied volatility from traded options [4]. The expected life of options is estimated using historical exercise patterns, and the forfeiture rate is set at 5.0% for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, as shown in the image [image4].\n\nIn contrast, the future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, are detailed in the image, which lists payments totaling $5,046 million, reduced to $4,447 million after imputed interest [image2].

In 2021, the company reported a net income attributable to Chevron Corporation, which was a marked improvement from the previous year. This improvement can be attributed to several factors, including higher realizations and the absence of impairments and write-offs in both U.S. and international upstream operations. For instance, U.S. upstream earnings rose to $7.3 billion in 2021 from a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020, driven by higher realizations of $6.9 billion and the absence of $1.2 billion in impairments and write-offs [5]. Similarly, international upstream earnings increased to $8.5 billion from a loss of $825 million in 2020, primarily due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion and the absence of $3.6 billion in impairments and write-offs [6]. These improvements contributed to a stronger overall net income for the company.\n\nRegarding return on stockholders' equity, Chevron's financial highlights indicate a focus on equity metrics, including return on stockholders' equity and return on average capital employed [2]. While specific numerical values for these metrics are not provided in the text, the company's actions to manage debt and improve operational efficiency likely supported a positive change in these ratios. For example, Chevron redeemed bonds and repaid bank loans, which helped in lowering future interest expenses and improving financial stability [3]. Additionally, the company's strategic investments in lower carbon initiatives, with plans for $10 billion in lower carbon capital investment between 2021 and 2028, suggest a commitment to sustainable growth, which could positively impact long-term equity returns [7].\n\nThe image data also provide context.

This reduction in net income is a significant contributor to the lower comprehensive income. The decrease in net income is likely due to the impact of COVID-19, as mentioned in text quote [1], which negatively affected revenues and operating income.

The 2020 loss was influenced by foreign currency translation adjustments, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit pension plans. Specifically, foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in a net loss of $63.1 million in 2020, compared to a gain of $174.3 million in 2019. This shift indicates adverse currency movements affecting the company's international operations.

In 2018, the total provision was $3,562 million, which rose to $3,742 million in 2019, and further increased to $4,973 million in 2020 [5]. This trend is influenced by several factors, including changes in federal, state, and foreign tax provisions, as well as the impact of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the federal tax provision increased significantly, from $2,897 million in 2018 to $4,098 million in 2020, while the state and local provision also rose from $219 million to $392 million over the same period. The foreign provision, however, decreased from $404 million in 2018 to $491 million in 2020, indicating a shift in the composition of tax liabilities [image5]. Additionally, the health insurance tax, which was $552 million in 2018, increased to $626 million in 2020, contributing to the overall rise in the tax provision [1].\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities play a crucial role in these trends. As of 2020, the company's deferred income tax assets were $3,391 million, up from $2,868 million in 2019, primarily due to increases in accrued expenses, lease liabilities, and nondeductible liabilities [image3]. Conversely, deferred income tax liabilities also increased from $5,861 million in 2019 to $6,758 million in 2020, driven by higher amounts in U.S. federal and state intangible assets, capitalized software, and lease right-of-use assets. The net deferred income tax liabilities grew from $2,993 million in 2019 to $3,367 million in 2020, reflecting a larger gap between liabilities and assets [image3].\n\nThe deferred income tax provision or benefit, which generally reflects the net change in these assets and liabilities, showed a benefit of $(8) million in 2020, compared to a provision of $230 million in 2"}

This growth is largely attributed to increases in deferred revenue, cross-currency swap derivative liabilities, and other liabilities. Noncurrent liabilities also increased from $5,351 million in 2019 to $7,789 million in 2020, an increase of $2,438 million, driven by higher taxes, income, and other liabilities, as well as operating lease liabilities. \n\n![The table shows a financial breakdown of liabilities for the years 2020 and 2019, divided into current and noncurrent categories.](image2)\n\nThis increase in liabilities aligns with the changes in total debt reported in the text. As of December 31, 2020, total debt was approximately $21.2 billion, slightly lower than the $21.7 billion in 2019, but the company's ability to incur additional indebtedness increased due to the availability under the Five-Year Facility. The text notes that the company classified certain borrowings as long-term debt, supported by the Five-Year Facility, which allowed for refinancing. This strategic classification and the use of the facility to backstop commercial paper programs contributed to the observed changes in liabilities and debt structure.\n\n![This table lists various financial instruments, mainly senior unsecured notes and bonds, with their due dates and principal amounts.

This increase is primarily attributed to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 compared to the prior year [1][8]. In 2019, the net discrete tax benefits were $475 million, mainly due to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest from tax examinations and benefits from employee share-based awards [3][5]. However, in 2020, these benefits decreased to $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [1][8].\n\nThe reduction in net discrete tax benefits in 2020 contributed to the higher effective tax rate. Additionally, the overall compensation expenses increased from $1,878 million in 2019 to $2,119 million in 2020, as seen in image1 and image5. This increase was driven by higher discretionary incentive compensation, formulaic payouts to Wealth Management representatives due to higher revenues, and expenses related to deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance [9]. The table in image1 highlights that Wealth Management compensation expenses rose significantly from $760 million in 2019 to $1,000 million in 2020, while Institutional Securities and Investment Management also saw increases. The deferred cash-based awards and returns on referenced investments also grew, with returns increasing from $645 million in 2019 to $856 million in 2020, further impacting compensation expenses [5].\n\nThe timing differences in recognizing gains and losses on investments versus compensation expenses, as mentioned in [2], may have influenced reported ratios, though they are generally not material to income before taxes. The Firm's hedging strategies for employee notional investments, as noted in [6], aimed to mitigate price risk, but changes in market conditions and investment performance still affected compensation expenses [10]. The projected future compensation obligation, detailed in image3, indicates expected recognition of $1,601 million over future periods, reflecting ongoing commitments.\n\nIn summary, the rise in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 was due to lower discrete tax benefits, while increased compensation expenses were driven by higher earnings and performance-based incentives, both of which are"}

This increase was driven by higher paydown rates and improved portfolio quality, partially offset by a reserve release due to a better macroeconomic outlook [4]. The reserve for credit losses on card member loans decreased in 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic conditions, despite an increase in outstanding loan balances [7]. The ending balance of credit loss reserves for card member loans was $3,305 million in 2021, reflecting a net benefit from a $2.5 billion reserve release compared to the prior year [4].\n\nFor card member receivables, the total increased from $43.7 billion in 2020 to $53.6 billion in 2021, a rise of 22.7%. The reserve for credit losses on receivables also increased, driven by the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook in 2020, partially offset by declining outstanding receivable balances [2]. The ending balance of credit loss reserves for receivables was $64 million in 2021, with a net write-off rate of 0.3% [5].\n\nComparing these changes to network volumes and card member spending, network volumes saw a significant increase of 24% worldwide in 2021, following a 18% decrease in 2020 [image4]. This rebound in network volumes aligns with the growth in card member loans, indicating a recovery in spending activity. Average proprietary basic card member spending also increased, with worldwide spending averaging higher in 2021 compared to 2020 [image3]. The growth in card member spending is reflected in the 26% increase in discount revenue, driven by higher spending [9].\n\nThe increase in card member loans and receivables, alongside rising network volumes and spending, suggests a recovery in consumer and commercial activity post-pandemic.

According to the financial statements, net income decreased by 22% in constant currencies to $4.7 billion in 2020 [4]. This decline was influenced by a reduction in operating earnings, partly offset by strategic gains from the sale of McDonald's Japan stock, which contributed $268 million in net gains [6]. Additionally, the write-off of impaired software and other charges impacted the results [7]. The decrease in net income was also reflected in diluted earnings per share, which fell to $6.31, though this was slightly mitigated by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding due to the suspension of the share repurchase program [8].\n\nComprehensive income saw a more pronounced decline, dropping to $4,626.4 million in 2020 from $6,152.2 million in 2019 [image4]. This change was largely driven by foreign currency translation adjustments, which showed a gain of $63.1 million in 2020 compared to $174.3 million in 2019, and significant losses in cash flow hedges, amounting to $123.3 million in 2020 versus a gain of $20.4 million in 2019. The defined benefit pension plans also contributed to the decrease with a net loss of $43.9 million in 2020, compared to $27.1 million in 2019.

According to the text, operating profit in 2020 included pre-tax charges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected various divisions differently [1]. The primary performance obligation involves distributing and selling beverage and food/snack products, with net revenue split between these categories [2]. The text also highlights that operating profit increased by 24% primarily due to net revenue growth, productivity savings, and lower restructuring charges, though this was partially offset by higher costs and expenses [6]. Conversely, operating profit decreased by 2% in another context, driven by cost increases but offset by revenue growth and savings [9].\n\nExamining the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories across regions, as shown in image3, provides insight into how these changes might correlate with financial performance. For instance, LatAm consistently had a 10% beverage and 90% food/snack split, while Europe saw a slight increase in beverage revenue from 50% to 55% [image3]. AMESA showed a decrease in beverage revenue from 45% to 30%, and APAC remained stable at 25% beverage. PepsiCo's overall split was consistent at 45% beverage and 55% food/snack. These percentages suggest that regions with higher beverage sales, like Europe, might have benefited from trends favoring beverage consumption, potentially impacting their net revenue positively.\n\nLooking at the financial performance in image4, which details net revenue and operating profit for each division over the years, we can see fluctuations. For example, PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America) likely saw significant changes due to its focus on beverages, which might have been influenced by the pandemic's impact on consumer behavior. The table in image1 shows percentage data across divisions, indicating shifts in allocation or performance metrics, which could reflect changes in revenue streams.\n\nAdditionally, image2 provides a breakdown of specific expenses, such as allowances and employee costs, which might have affected operating profit margins. For instance, PBNA had substantial employee compensation and protection costs, which could offset revenue gains [image2]. The consistent food/snack dominance in LatAm might indicate stable revenue but could also mean less profitability if food/snack margins are lower compared to beverages.\n\nIn summary, the changes in net revenue"}

In 2021, cash inflows from financing activities increased dramatically to €11,839 million, up from a negative €249 million in 2020. This surge was largely due to the financing of the Varian acquisition, which included borrowings of €10 billion and additional financing of €850 million from the Siemens Group, as well as the issuance of new shares to raise capital [5][8]. Additionally, the repayment of matured loans totaling €730 million and €300 million offset some of these inflows [8].\n\nOn the investing side, cash outflows rose sharply to €14,140 million in 2021, compared to €1,912 million in 2020. The primary driver was the payout for the Varian acquisition, which accounted for a substantial portion of the outflows. Furthermore, investments in capacity expansions and additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment increased by €117 million, reflecting ongoing efforts to enhance competitiveness and innovation capability [6][2].\n\nThe table in image4 provides a clear overview of these changes, showing the substantial increase in both financing inflows and investing outflows.

This substantial improvement can be attributed to several key factors:\n\nFirstly, the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders improved from a loss of $(1,063) million in 2018 to a profit of $862 million in 2020. This turnaround was driven by operational efficiencies and increased revenues, as noted in the financial statements. The operating margin improved from a negative margin in 2018 to 6.3% in 2020, reflecting better cost management and higher sales volumes [9].\n\nSecondly, foreign currency translation adjustments played a crucial role. In 2020, there was a significant gain of $399 million from foreign currency translation adjustments, compared to losses of $(28) million in 2019 and $(42) million in 2018. These adjustments are part of other comprehensive income and positively impacted the comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the company's restructuring efforts in 2018, which included employee termination expenses and asset disposals, contributed to the improved financial performance in subsequent years. Although these actions resulted in expenses in 2018, they likely led to cost reductions and efficiency gains that benefited later periods [7].\n\nThe increase in stock-based compensation expenses, particularly due to the 2018 CEO Performance Award, was partially offset by reductions in other operating expenses, such as customer promotional costs and settlements of legal matters, which also contributed to the improved net income [10].\n\nOverall, the combination of improved operational performance, favorable foreign currency adjustments, and cost management initiatives were key factors in the evolution of comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders from 2018 to 2020.\n\n![Comprehensive income data for 2018-2020](image1)"}

According to the text, Costco reports noncontrolling interests as a component of equity separate from its own equity [1]. The consolidated financial statements include adjustments for comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests [6], which impacts the overall equity figures.\n\nFrom the image data, we see that the financial tables detail changes in equity over time. Specifically, image4 shows a breakdown of equity components, including common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), retained earnings, and noncontrolling interests. The table indicates changes in these categories, reflecting transactions such as repurchases of common stock, cash dividends, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests [4][5][10].\n\nIn the comprehensive income statements, net income including noncontrolling interests is reported [9], which affects the total equity. The image data from image2 and image5 provide numerical values for different fiscal years, showing increases in primary figures and adjustments that likely correspond to net income and other comprehensive income components. For example, the primary figure for August 28, 2022, is $222,730, compared to $192,052 in 2021, indicating growth in net income or similar metrics [2][5].\n\nThe comprehensive income statements also account for items like foreign-currency translation adjustments and stock-based compensation, which contribute to the total comprehensive income [8]. These adjustments are reflected in the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss and retained earnings, impacting the total stockholders' equity [10].\n\nIn summary, the increase in total stockholders' equity from 2021 to 2022 is influenced by net income, adjustments for comprehensive income, and changes in noncontrolling interests. The comprehensive income statements capture these elements, showing how they collectively affect the equity structure.\n\n**Answer:** Costco's total stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests increased from 2021 to 2022, reflecting growth in net income and adjustments in comprehensive income, as detailed in their financial statements."}

The Total RWA also increased from $394,177 million in 2019 to $453,106 million in 2020. This growth in RWA is primarily due to higher credit risk RWA, driven by derivatives exposures and the E*TRADE acquisition, as well as increased market risk RWA from higher volatility [3][6][9]. \n\nIn the **Advanced Approach**, the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio increased from 16.9% in 2019 to 17.7% in 2020, the Tier 1 Capital Ratio rose from 19.2% to 19.8%, and the Total Capital Ratio increased from 21.5% to 21.8%. The Total RWA under this approach increased from $382,496 million in 2019 to $445,151 million in 2020. The Advanced Approach saw a decrease in operational risk RWA due to reduced litigation-related losses, but credit risk RWA increased significantly due to similar factors as the Standardized Approach, including derivatives and equity investments [2][9].\n\nComparing the two approaches, the Advanced Approach generally shows slightly higher capital ratios in 2020, likely due to more sophisticated risk modeling, while both approaches reflect increased RWA driven by market conditions and acquisitions.

This increase was primarily driven by several factors. According to the text, earnings before income taxes rose by $0.4 billion due to a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and lower interest expense [6]. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased, contributing to the net earnings increase [6]. However, foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million due to currency weakening against the U.S. dollar [6]. The text also notes that diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased by 6% to $5.81, partly due to a reduction in shares outstanding and the prior year's loss on early debt extinguishment [10].\n\nRegarding stock-based expenses, the total expense decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022. This reduction is evident in the image showing stock-based expenses and income tax benefits [image3]. Specifically, expenses related to stock options decreased from $249 million in 2020 to $271 million in 2022, while RSUs and PSUs expenses decreased from $309 million in 2020 to $257 million in 2022. The decrease in total stock-based expenses can be attributed to changes in the number of awards granted and vested, as well as adjustments in the fair value of these awards over the years. The text explains that stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of awards at the date of grant, amortized over the requisite service period [7]. The image detailing RSU and PSU activity [image5] shows fluctuations in vested and forfeited units, which likely influenced the expense figures.\n\nIn summary, P&G's net earnings grew due to improved earnings before taxes, lower interest expenses, and a reduced tax rate, offset by foreign exchange impacts.

This increase was driven by higher content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment, as well as the return to full capacity in film and television production operations [2]. Additionally, the segment benefited from the impact of a new licensing agreement for content exclusively available on Peacock, which contributed to the overall revenue growth [3].\n\nIn contrast, the Sky segment experienced a 63.8% increase in revenue to $87 million in 2021 from $53 million in 2020. This growth was primarily due to the introduction of ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky's video services, which expanded its offerings and attracted more viewers [2].

The image1 shows that derivative financial instruments include both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges, with specific contract amounts and fair values for various currencies. In 2020, the total derivative financial instruments amounted to DKK 1,365 million, up from DKK 734 million in 2019, indicating an increase in hedging activities or exposure management [image1].\n\nThis increase in derivative financial instruments is reflected in the financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement, which also rose from DKK 734 million in 2019 to DKK 1,365 million in 2020 [image2].

In 2020, the changes in financial assumptions contributed to actuarial gains of €72 million, while in 2021, these changes resulted in actuarial losses of €26 million. This shift from gains to losses indicates a negative impact on the defined benefit obligation due to adverse changes in financial assumptions, such as discount rates or other economic factors. \n\nThe sensitivity analysis provided in the text and images further supports this conclusion. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point would increase the defined benefit obligation by €271 million in 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020, highlighting the sensitivity of the obligation to changes in discount rates. Additionally, the discount rates themselves increased slightly from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the euro, which might seem beneficial, but the overall actuarial losses suggest that other financial assumptions, such as changes in compensation or pension progression, also played a role. \n\nThe use of a liability-driven investment approach and the monitoring of risks through Value at Risk (VaR) indicate that Siemens Healthineers is actively managing these financial risks, but the adverse changes in financial assumptions still led to a net actuarial loss in 2021.

This consistent growth in net income contributed significantly to the overall comprehensive income, which rose from $3,730,974 in 2018 to $4,575,086 in 2019, and then to $5,472,296 in 2020. The increase in net income is a key driver of the upward trend in comprehensive income.\n\nThe **Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax** components also varied across the years. In 2018, there was a net loss of $481,387, primarily due to significant foreign currency translation losses ($305,225) and defined benefit plan losses ($253,039). By 2019, the net loss narrowed to $264,406, with foreign currency translation losses decreasing to $132,707 and defined benefit plan losses improving to $253,039. In 2020, other comprehensive income turned positive at $278,740, driven by substantial foreign currency translation gains ($197,696) and defined benefit plan gains ($57,100). This shift from losses to gains in foreign currency translation and defined benefit plans positively impacted comprehensive income.\n\nThe **Comprehensive Income Attributable to Accenture PLC** followed a similar trend, increasing from $3,578,520 in 2018 to $4,514,706 in 2019, and reaching $5,386,579 in 2020.

This increase is primarily driven by growth in the \"Insurance and Other\" segment, where unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses rose from $79,854 million to $86,664 million, and unearned premiums increased from $21,395 million to $23,512 million. Additionally, the \"Railroad, Utilities and Energy\" segment saw a slight decrease in liabilities, with notes payable and other borrowings reducing from $75,373 million to $74,990 million. However, the overall increase in liabilities is offset by a significant rise in shareholders' equity, which grew from $506,200 million to $542,347 million, an increase of $36,147 million. This growth in equity is largely due to net earnings of $89,800 million and other comprehensive income of $234 million, contributing to a comprehensive income of $91,041 million for 2021. The substantial net earnings reflect strong performance across various segments, including investment gains and operational efficiency, while the increase in liabilities is managed through robust capital management and strategic debt refinancing. The company's ability to maintain high liquidity and a strong capital base, as evidenced by the increase in shareholders' equity, supports its financial stability and capacity to invest in growth opportunities. \n\n![Comparison of liabilities and shareholders' equity between 2020 and 2021](image4)"}

The company's three pillars of financial strategy—stability, growth, and efficiency—are designed to support sustainable growth, which is crucial in addressing climate-related challenges. By maintaining adequate stability while pursuing growth and efficiency, Toyota aims to build a robust financial foundation that can adapt to the evolving climate scenarios [7]. This is evident in its approach to shareholder returns, where the company prioritizes the stable and continuous payment of dividends, aiming to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30% [10]. The financial data from 2017 to 2021 shows consistent dividend payments and share repurchases, reflecting Toyota's commitment to shareholder value while also investing in next-generation technologies like environmental technologies for a carbon-neutral society [10]. \n\nIn terms of electrification, Toyota recognizes the opportunities and risks associated with climate change, such as the adoption of new technology and tighter regulations [1]. The company is investing in advanced technologies, including batteries, to reduce CO2 emissions and capitalize on the increased sales of electrified vehicles [4][6]. This investment is part of a broader strategy to enhance competitiveness and seize new business opportunities, as outlined in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 [1]. The infographic detailing Toyota's measures in response to climate scenarios highlights the company's proactive approach, including investing in batteries and promoting efficient technology to mitigate risks like increased production costs and fines for non-compliance [image4]. \n\nToyota's financial strategy also involves constructive dialogue with shareholders to encourage sustainable growth and assess the propriety of strategic shareholdings, ensuring they contribute to long-term corporate value [3][4]. This approach is reflected in the evaluation framework that assesses performance based on financial metrics and stock volatility, emphasizing the importance of both consolidated operating income and share price stability [image1][image3]. The table listing executive remuneration further underscores the alignment of individual performance with corporate goals, including climate-related initiatives [image2]. \n\nOverall, Toyota's financial strategy supports its climate response by balancing shareholder returns with strategic investments in electrification, ensuring the company remains competitive and resilient in a changing environment. \n\nToyota's financial strategy correlates with its climate response by balancing shareholder returns with strategic investments in electrification, ensuring competitiveness and resilience."}

According to the text, intangible assets not yet in use are reviewed for impairment based on management's projections and the net present value of future cash flows [4]. In 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million was recognized, primarily related to patents and licences in the Diabetes and Obesity care segment, with all losses recorded in research and development costs [3]. This contrasts with 2019, where DKK 982 million was recognized, with a significant portion in cost of goods sold and research and development costs. The impairment in 2020 was due to management's review of expectations for patents and licences not yet in use, indicating a shift in strategic focus or market conditions affecting these assets [3].\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment are depreciated based on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, with depreciation commencing when the asset is available for use [8]. The text also notes that plant and equipment with no alternative use in research and development projects are expensed, while those with alternative use are capitalized and depreciated [10]. This suggests a careful approach to asset utilization and cost allocation in research activities.\n\nLooking at the image evidence, image4 provides a comprehensive overview of the financial details of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment for 2019 and 2020.

This growth can be attributed to various factors, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which contributed to the expansion of the company's product offerings and customer base. The acquisition's impact is evident in the increased revenues across different regions and product lines, as shown in the geographical and product-specific revenue breakdowns. For instance, the Americas saw a substantial rise from $9,445 million in 2019 to $12,051 million in 2020, while Europe and Asia Pacific also experienced notable growth [image2].\n\nRegarding unearned revenue, the beginning balance for fiscal year 2020 was $8,564 million, and it increased to $10,662 million by the end of the year. This change reflects the company's ability to secure more advance payments from customers, likely due to the strong demand for its services and the addition of new contracts. The increase in unearned revenue is also influenced by the contribution from business combinations, such as the Tableau acquisition, which added $433 million to the unearned revenue in 2020 compared to $68 million in 2019 [image4]. Additionally, the company recognized a significant portion of revenue ratably over time, with $15,586 million recognized in 2020, up from $12,426 million in 2019, indicating sustained customer commitments and longer-term contracts.\n\nThe rise in unearned revenue suggests a robust pipeline of future revenue, as customers continue to invest in the company's subscription-based services. However, it also highlights the importance of managing these obligations effectively to ensure timely delivery of services and recognition of revenue. The increase in contract assets from $215 million to $449 million, including the acquired balance from Tableau, further underscores the growth in deferred revenue and the need for efficient resource allocation to meet future obligations [2].

The impact of COVID-19, including temporary restaurant closures and limited operations, particularly affected markets like the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain [1].

According to the waterfall chart in image5, the NBCUniversal segment contributed the largest increase of $6,788 million, followed by the Sky segment with $1,285 million and the Cable Communications segment with $1,450 million. However, there was a decrease of $730 million from Corporate and Other, Adjustments, and Eliminations. This resulted in a total revenue increase from $72,971 million in 2020 to $81,764 million in 2021.\n\nFor operating expenses, the text quotes highlight several factors. The increase in NBCUniversal expenses was due to higher costs in Media, Studios, and Theme Parks [2]. Cable Communications saw increased programming expenses, technical and product support costs, and regulatory fees, though these were partially offset by decreases in other expenses [2]. Sky's expenses rose due to direct network costs but were mitigated by lower programming and production costs [2]. Corporate and Other expenses decreased primarily due to prior-year severance charges [2]. Additionally, the Cable Communications segment's depreciation and amortization expense rose due to infrastructure investments [8].\n\nComparing across segments, NBCUniversal had the most significant revenue growth, with a 6.9% increase from 2020 to 2021, followed by Sky at 11.4% and Cable Communications at 0.7% [3]. Operating expenses were notably impacted by NBCUniversal's increased costs, while Cable Communications and Sky experienced mixed changes due to various cost factors. The waterfall chart in image5 visually supports these contributions, showing the substantial impact of NBCUniversal on revenue growth, while the detailed financial summary in image4 indicates overall revenue growth of 12.4% and operating income growth of 19.0% from 2020 to 2021.\n\nIn summary, NBCUniversal was the primary driver of revenue growth, while operating expenses were influenced by increased costs in NBCUniversal and Cable Communications, with some offsets in Sky and Corporate segments."}

According to the text, P&G has two primary stock-based compensation programs that grant stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance stock units (PSUs) to key managers and directors [1]. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant, amortized over the requisite service period [6]. This approach impacts both the reported expenses and the net earnings per share.\n\nFrom the image data, we can observe the following trends:\n\n1. **Stock-Based Compensation Expenses**:\n   - The total stock-based expense decreased from $558 million in 2020 to $528 million in 2022, with a slight increase in 2021 at $540 million [image3]. This reduction in expenses could indicate a decrease in the number of awards granted or changes in the valuation assumptions used for these awards. The lattice-based valuation model used by P&G incorporates assumptions like expected volatility and expected life, which have shown slight fluctuations over the years [5]. For instance, expected volatility decreased from 20% in 2021 to 19% in 2022, potentially contributing to lower expense recognition [image1].\n\n2. **Net Earnings and EPS**:\n   - Net earnings attributable to P&G increased from $13,027 million in 2020 to $14,742 million in 2022, reflecting a 13% growth over the period [image4]. This increase is attributed to factors like a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes, and interest expense, despite negative foreign exchange impacts [7].\n   - Basic and diluted EPS also show growth, with basic EPS rising from $5.13 in 2020 to $6.00 in 2022, and diluted EPS from $4.96 to $5.81 [image4]. The increase in EPS is driven by higher net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding due to stock repurchases, which offset the dilutive impact of stock-based awards [10].\n\n3. **Impact of Stock-Based Awards on EPS**:\n   - The dilutive effect of stock options"}

However, other comprehensive income (loss) components, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and net unrealized pension benefits, showed fluctuations that impacted the overall comprehensive income.\n\nIn 2021, the company reported a net unrealized debt securities loss of $42 million, a foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $163 million, and a net unrealized pension benefit gain of $155 million, resulting in an overall other comprehensive loss of $50 million. This contrasts with 2020, where other comprehensive income was a loss of $158 million due to a foreign currency translation adjustment loss of $40 million and a pension benefit loss of $150 million. The 2019 other comprehensive loss was $140 million, primarily from foreign currency and pension adjustments.\n\nThese changes in other comprehensive income, combined with the net income figures, led to comprehensive income of $8,010 million in 2021, $2,977 million in 2020, and $6,619 million in 2019.

Climate change was identified as a material governance and strategic issue, routinely discussed on the Board agenda, including in strategy discussions, portfolio reviews, and risk management oversight [3]. The Sustainability Committee played a crucial role in overseeing climate change performance and governance responsibilities, supported by the Risk and Audit Committee in managing climate-related risks, while the Board retained overall accountability [3]. The Committee also reviewed how greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and climate change scenarios, including those aligned with the Paris Agreement, were reflected in financial statements, focusing on portfolio impacts, demand outlooks, decarbonisation costs, and Scope 3 emissions [7]. This comprehensive oversight ensured that climate risks were thoroughly assessed and integrated into financial planning and disclosures.\n\nIn terms of director training, BHP emphasized continuous learning and development to equip directors with the necessary knowledge to address climate change and other strategic issues. The FY2021 activities included briefings and development sessions aimed at deepening directors' understanding of the company's activities, environment, and key issues, including climate change sessions and innovation and technology discussions [image5]. Site visits, conducted both virtually and physically due to COVID-19 restrictions, provided directors with firsthand insights into operations and relevant issues, further enhancing their understanding of the company's climate-related challenges and opportunities [image5]. Additionally, the Board's succession planning process, which included rigorous evaluation and training programs, ensured that new and existing directors were well-prepared to address evolving governance and risk management challenges, including climate change [image4].

This decline was primarily due to a $53 million decrease in transportation services revenue, a $12 million decrease in allowance oil revenue, and a $21 million decrease in product revenue. However, these decreases were partially offset by a $63 million increase in terminaling services revenue and a $1 million increase in lease revenue [9]. The transportation services revenue decrease was attributed to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the crude and refined products operating environment, lower rates on the Zydeco committed contracts, and higher impacts from planned turnaround activities and storms [10]. Additionally, the deferral of deficiency credits in 2020, as opposed to their utilization in 2019, contributed to the reduction in revenue.\n\nRegarding cash from investing activities, the company reported a net cash provided by investing activities of $64 million in 2020, compared to a net cash used in investing activities of $87 million in 2019. This significant shift was mainly due to the completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco, which led to a decrease in capital expenditures from $35 million in 2019 to $22 million in 2020 [3]. Furthermore, there were no contributions to investment in 2020, which also positively impacted the cash flow from investing activities [3].\n\nThe financial statements provide a detailed breakdown of these changes, showing the impact of both operational and investment-related factors on the company's financial performance.

[1][8].\n\n![The table shows an increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021, with adjustments in operating and investing activities](image1)\n\nAdditionally, the net cash flows from operating activities rose from USD 13.6 billion in 2020 to USD 15.1 billion in 2021, mainly due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for legal provisions, though this was partially offset by unfavorable hedging results [9]. The table in image1 confirms these figures, showing a consistent increase in both IFRS cash flow and free cash flow from operating activities.\n\n![The table highlights the increase in net cash flows from operating activities and the impact of adjustments on free cash flow](image5)\n\nThe financial statements also indicate that total current assets increased by USD 16.0 billion to USD 45.7 billion at the end of 2021, reflecting improved liquidity [2].

In 2021, the changes in financial assumptions resulted in a loss of €26 million, while in 2020, they contributed to a gain of €72 million. This shift from a gain to a loss in financial assumptions between the two years is a key factor in the overall actuarial results. Additionally, the discount rate, which is a critical financial assumption, increased from 1.5% in 2020 to 1.7% in 2021 for the euro, and similarly increased for other currencies such as the U.S. dollar, British pound, and Swiss franc. \n\nThe impact of the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation is illustrated in image3, which shows that a half-percentage point decrease in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the obligation by €271 million in 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020. This indicates that the higher discount rate in 2021 reduced the present value of future pension obligations, contributing to the lower actuarial gains or higher losses observed. \n\nFurthermore, the total actuarial gains and losses for 2021 were a net loss of €22 million, compared to a net gain of €67 million in 2020. This change is influenced by the adverse development in financial assumptions, as well as other factors like changes in demographic assumptions and experience gains and losses. The table in image5 summarizes these effects, showing that while experience gains improved in 2021 (€12 million vs. -€2 million in 2020), the overall impact of financial assumptions and discount rates led to a more negative outcome in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the increase in discount rates and adverse changes in financial assumptions in 2021 resulted in higher actuarial losses compared to the gains seen in 2020. \n\n![Actuarial gains and losses for 2021 and 2020](image5)"}

According to the text quotes and images provided, here's a detailed analysis:\n\nIn 2019, the foreign tax provision was a benefit of $407 million, as shown in the \"Current provision (benefit)\" section for Foreign in image3. This indicates that the company recognized a tax benefit in foreign jurisdictions, likely due to favorable tax positions or credits. However, by 2021, the foreign tax provision had shifted to an expense of $518 million, reflecting a substantial increase in taxes paid or accrued in foreign jurisdictions. This change is also evident in the \"Current provision (benefit)\" section for Foreign in image3, where the 2021 value is positive, indicating an expense.\n\nThe foreign income before taxes also saw a notable increase. In 2019, the foreign income was $439 million, as shown in image4. By 2021, this figure had risen to $1,493 million, more than tripling over the period. This significant growth in foreign income suggests expanded operations or improved profitability in international markets.\n\nThe increase in foreign income before taxes from $439 million in 2019 to $1,493 million in 2021, as seen in image4, likely contributed to the higher foreign tax provision in 2021. The company's foreign tax provision changed from a benefit of $407 million in 2019 to an expense of $518 million in 2021, as indicated in image3. This shift from a tax benefit to a tax expense could be due to several factors, including changes in tax laws, increased taxable income, or the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nThe text quotes provide additional context. For instance, quote [1] mentions a partial refund claim for taxes withheld in Korea, which resulted in noncurrent income taxes receivable and liabilities. This suggests that the company is actively managing its tax positions in foreign jurisdictions, which could impact its cash flow and financial planning. Additionally, quote [10] notes that unrecognized tax benefits related to Korean withholding taxes may increase in fiscal 2022, indicating ongoing tax disputes or adjustments that could affect future tax provisions.\n\nThe company's financial strategy might need to adapt to"}

Throughout the year, there were inflows of $69.3 billion and outflows of $(96.8) billion, with a market impact of $11.6 billion. However, the sale of WFAM on November 1, 2021, significantly reduced the balance by $(587.1) billion, resulting in a year-end balance of $0. This indicates a substantial decrease in assets under management due to the sale, despite positive market impacts and inflows [image1].\n\nRegarding available-for-sale securities, the table in image4 highlights a decrease in amortized cost, net, from $215,533 million at the end of 2020 to $175,463 million at the end of 2021. The net unrealized gains also decreased from $4,859 million to $1,781 million, reflecting higher interest rates that reduced the value of these securities [8]. The fair value of available-for-sale securities decreased from $220,392 million to $177,244 million, and the weighted average expected maturity increased from 4.5 years to 5.2 years. This reduction in net unrealized gains aligns with the text stating that the total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt securities decreased due to higher interest rates [8].\n\nIn summary, the sale of WFAM led to a significant reduction in assets under management, while available-for-sale securities saw a decrease in both amortized cost and net unrealized gains, influenced by rising interest rates. \n\n**Answer:** The sale of WFAM resulted in a substantial decrease in assets under management, and available-for-sale securities experienced a reduction in amortized cost and net unrealized gains due to higher interest rates."}

According to the text, the total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher interest rates [2]. This reduction in unrealized gains suggests a shift in the valuation of securities, likely impacting the company's liquidity and interest rate risk management strategies. The company continued to purchase AFS and HTM debt securities, including HTM debt securities through securitizations of loans held for sale (LHFS), which more than offset portfolio runoff and AFS debt security sales [9]. This activity indicates an active management approach to rebalancing the portfolio to meet interest rate risk objectives, as noted in the discussion of the AFS and HTM debt securities [8].\n\nAdditionally, the sale of Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) on November 1, 2021, marked a strategic pivot. Prior to the sale, WFAM contributed to asset-based fees through investment advisory services [10]. The table in image5 shows that the sale of WFAM resulted in a significant outflow of $587.1 billion, drastically reducing the total assets under management from $603.0 billion at the start of 2021 to a much lower end-of-period balance. This sale reflects a strategic decision to divest non-core assets, aligning with the company's focus on core banking operations and capital management [6].\n\nThe selected balance sheet data in image3 highlights changes in total assets and deposits, indicating adjustments in the company's asset composition. The decrease in consumer loans, particularly in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio, due to loan paydowns and transfers to loans held for sale, also influenced the overall asset structure [1]. The table in image4 further illustrates the increase in commercial loans, driven by higher demand and originations, which partially offset the decrease in consumer loans, contributing to a slight overall increase in total loans [1].\n\nOverall, these changes reflect a strategic realignment towards managing interest rate risk, optimizing the debt securities portfolio, and divesting non-core assets to focus on core banking activities. The sale of WFAM and adjustments in loan portfolios demonstrate a shift towards enhancing capital efficiency and risk management.\n\nIn summary, the changes in total assets and WFAM assets under management from 2020 to 2021"}

These tables are derived from data from the German Siemens population and the Federal Statistical Office in Germany. This indicates a consistent approach in Germany, with updates to the tables reflecting the most recent data available for each year. The discount rate in Germany was 1.7% in 2021, compared to 1.5% in 2020, showing a slight increase, which could impact the present value of future benefit obligations [image5].\n\nIn the United States, the demographic assumptions are based on the Pri-2012 generational projection from the U.S. Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions, which remained the same for both years. This consistency suggests a stable approach to demographic assumptions in the U.S. However, the discount rate in the U.S. was 2.7% in 2021, up from 2.4% in 2020. The higher discount rate in the U.S. compared to Germany reflects differences in the yield on high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds in these regions, which are used to determine the discount rates [image4].\n\nFinancial indicators also show variations. The actuarial gains and losses for 2021 and 2020 highlight changes in assumptions and experience. For instance, changes in financial assumptions led to a loss of -26 million in 2021, compared to a gain of 72 million in 2020, indicating a significant shift in financial market conditions or investment performance affecting the funded status of the plans [image2]. These changes can influence the net defined benefit balance and the overall financial obligations of Siemens Healthineers.\n\nAdditionally, the defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets are critical components affecting the funded status.

This growth was offset by a decrease in Securities Services revenue by $234 million (12%) and a significant drop in Principal Investments by $147 million (56%) [5]. The overall net operating income for Global Markets improved, contributing positively to the segment's financial performance.\n\nIn contrast, Global Banking faced a revenue decrease of $71 million (2%) due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income, though capital markets revenue and net interest income from corporate lending grew [3]. Global Liquidity and Cash Management also saw a substantial decline in revenue by $701 million (26%), impacting the segment's net operating income negatively [5].\n\nThe Corporate Centre segment showed a notable improvement in net operating income, with a $392 million increase (60%) from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to reduced losses in Legacy portfolios and Other categories [image3]. This improvement was partly driven by the allocation of Markets Treasury, HSBC Holdings interest expense, and Argentina hyperinflation impacts to global businesses, as mentioned in text [9].\n\nProfit before tax across segments varied significantly. The overall adjusted profit before tax decreased by $5.3 billion (74%) in 2020, largely due to higher Expected Credit Losses (ECL) from the Covid-19 impact and lower global interest rates [7]. However, specific segments like Markets products, Insurance, and Investments saw a $0.4 billion reduction in revenue, affecting their profit margins [5]. The Corporate Centre's profit before tax increased by $0.4 billion, reflecting cost reductions and improved revenue allocation [10].\n\nIn summary, while Global Markets and Corporate Centre segments showed positive adjustments in net operating income, other segments like Global Banking and Global Liquidity faced declines.

This is supported by the image showing a rise in commercial loans from $478,417 million in 2020 to $513,120 million in 2021, indicating a strategic focus on expanding commercial lending [image5]. Conversely, consumer loans decreased, mainly due to paydowns in the residential mortgage portfolio and the transfer of loans to loans held for sale, partially offset by new originations [1].

The comprehensive income attributable to the partnership also grew from $464 million in 2018 to $526 million in 2019, and then to $542 million in 2020. \n\nThe main contributing factors to these increases include:\n\n1. **Growth in Net Income**: The net income increased by $74 million from 2018 to 2019 and by $10 million from 2019 to 2020. This growth is reflected in the financial statements, showing improved operational performance and profitability. According to the text, investment, dividend, and other income increased by $34 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher equity earnings from acquisitions and increased distributions from Poseidon [1]. Additionally, the elimination of incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and the conversion of the general partner interest into a non-economic interest on April 1, 2020, may have positively impacted net income by reducing expenses related to distributions [7].\n\n2. **Reduction in Other Comprehensive Loss**: The other comprehensive loss, net of tax, decreased from no amount in 2018 to $(1) million in 2020. This reduction indicates less negative impact from remeasurements of pension and other postretirement benefits related to equity method investments, contributing to higher comprehensive income [image1].\n\n3. **Changes in Noncontrolling Interests**: The comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $18 million in 2018 to $13 million in 2020. This reduction means a larger portion of comprehensive income was retained by the partnership, enhancing the comprehensive income attributable to the partnership [image1].\n\n4. **Cash Flows and Financial Position**: The cash provided by operating activities increased from $507 million in 2018 to $650 million in 2020, indicating stronger operational cash generation.

In South & Southeast Asia, cigarette shipment volumes decreased by 17.2%, with no data available for heated tobacco units in 2019, indicating a significant decline in overall market activity. This aligns with the broader trend of unfavorable volume/mix impacting net revenues, as noted in the text [2] and [5], which highlight lower cigarette and heated tobacco unit volumes in PMI Duty Free. The financial summary in image1 shows a 13.7% decline in net revenues, largely driven by volume/mix impacts, corroborating these regional shipment declines.\n\nIn the Middle East & Africa, both cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipments saw substantial decreases of 12.3% and 61.5%, respectively, as detailed in image4. This decline is attributed to lower total market demand and adult smoker down-trading following price increases, as mentioned in text [4]. The financial impact is evident in the 21.7% decrease in net revenues, excluding currency, primarily due to lower cigarette and heated tobacco volumes, as seen in image6.\n\nEast Asia & Australia presented a mixed picture, with cigarette sales declining by 9.7% but heated tobacco units increasing by 10.4%, leading to a slight overall decrease of 2.1% in total sales (image5). This regional variation suggests a shift towards heated tobacco products, potentially offsetting some of the decline in traditional cigarette sales. However, the broader financial summary in image3 indicates a modest 1.2% increase in net revenues, driven by favorable pricing, despite volume/mix impacts.\n\nLatin America & Canada, while not explicitly detailed in the provided images, are noted in text [7] to have experienced unfavorable volume/mix effects, contributing to a 22.5% decrease in operating income, partly offset by pricing and cost reductions.

According to the text, the adjusted EBIT margin for the fiscal year 2021 was 17.4%, up from 15.5% in the prior year [3]. This increase was largely driven by the strong margin development in the Diagnostics segment, which benefited from high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests, as well as the first-time earnings contribution from Varian [3]. Specifically, Varian contributed an adjusted EBIT of €221 million from April 15 through September 30, 2021, with an impressive margin of 17.0% [2]. This positive performance from Varian, combined with the overall revenue growth, led to a 40% increase in adjusted EBIT compared to the prior year [3].\n\nIn terms of net assets, the acquisition of Varian also had notable effects. The operating net working capital increased by €720 million to €3,270 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Varian, which resulted in an increase of €592 million [4]. This is supported by the image data, which shows a significant rise in trade and other receivables, contract assets, and inventories in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increased business activity and expected growth [5]. Additionally, the image data highlights that liabilities to the Siemens Group from financing activities surged to €11,708 million in 2021 from €2,982 million in 2020, mainly due to the financing of the Varian acquisition [10]. This substantial increase in liabilities is also evident in the net debt, which rose to €11,901 million in 2021 from €1,484 million in 2020, primarily due to finance transactions related to Varian [7].\n\nFurthermore, the acquisition led to a significant increase in non-current assets.

According to the financial breakdown, the net price impact was a major driver of the increase in Underlying EBITDA. The change in sales prices resulted in an increase of $16,965 million, primarily due to higher prices for commodities such as iron ore, copper, and nickel [1][2][6]. This substantial rise in sales prices was partially offset by a decrease in price-linked costs of $870 million, which included increased royalties due to higher prices but also lower royalties for petroleum and coal [8]. The net total after considering these price impacts was a positive $16,095 million [image1].\n\nOn the operating cash costs side, there was a slight decrease of $34 million, attributed to inventory drawdowns and increased volumes post-maintenance shutdowns. Additionally, exploration and business development costs reduced by $109 million due to lower exploration expenses, leading to a net total change in controllable cash costs of $75 million [image1]. These cost reductions, combined with the significant boost from higher sales prices, contributed to the overall increase in Underlying EBITDA.\n\nHowever, other costs such as exchange rates and inflation had negative impacts, with exchange rates affecting the EBITDA by $1,588 million and inflation by $286 million [image1]. Despite these challenges, the positive effects of higher sales prices and controlled operating costs were substantial enough to drive the Underlying EBITDA from $22,071 million in FY2020 to $37,379 million in FY2021 [image1][5].\n\nIn summary, the increase in sales prices was the primary factor boosting BHP's Underlying EBITDA, while controlled operating cash costs provided additional support, despite challenges from exchange rates and inflation."}

This is a substantial increase from 2019, where no impairment charges were recognized [6]. These charges contributed to a decrease in statutory net profit after tax from $37,043,000 in 2019 to $11,221,000 in 2020, as shown in the financial data [10]. The impairment charges, along with the implementation of AASB 16, led to a significant reduction in earnings.

These revenues were not attributed to specific segments, indicating their nature as one-time or non-recurring gains. By 2020, unallocated revenues dropped to $1,841 million, largely driven by the Huawei settlement agreement and new patent license agreements.

Unallocated research and development expenses rose from $989 million in 2019 to $1,820 million in 2021, reflecting increased investment in R&D activities not directly tied to specific segments. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also increased, indicating broader corporate overheads.

According to the text, reported profit before tax decreased by 34% to $8.8 billion, while adjusted profit before tax fell by 45% to $12.1 billion [2][5][6]. This decline was primarily due to lower revenue and a significant increase in expected credit losses (ECL) and other credit impairment charges, which rose by $6.1 billion to $8.8 billion, largely driven by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy [2][3][6]. The pandemic led to adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments, further affecting financial performance [1][3].\n\nIn terms of net operating income, the division saw a decrease in revenue across several sectors. For instance, Global Banking revenue decreased by $0.1 billion or 2%, mainly due to lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions, although capital markets revenue grew and net interest income increased from corporate lending [4]. Meanwhile, the Global Markets segment saw a strong performance, with revenue increasing by 27% due to higher volatility and client activity, particularly in Foreign Exchange and Credit [10][image4]. However, this was offset by lower global interest rates and adverse movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments [1][2].\n\nThe adjusted operating expenses were $9.3 billion, a 3% decrease, reflecting cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay, which helped mitigate some of the revenue decline [8].

According to the data, the commercial segment saw a decrease in both risk-based and fee-based individuals served, with risk-based decreasing by 8% and fee-based by 5%, leading to a total commercial decrease of 6% [3]. This decline can be attributed to increased unemployment and related attrition, as well as underwriting discipline [10]. In contrast, the public and senior segment showed growth, particularly in Medicare Advantage, which increased by 8%, and Medicaid, which grew by 12% [3]. The increase in Medicaid was driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in Dual Special Needs Plans [10]. Medicare Supplement (Standardized) saw a slight decrease of 1% [3]. Overall, the total number of individuals served in the public and senior segment increased by 7%, offsetting some of the commercial decline [3].\n\n![The table shows a decrease in commercial individuals served and an increase in public and senior individuals served](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual segment decreased by 2%, while the Medicare & Retirement segment increased by 9%, and the Community & State segment grew by 6% [4].

For Pension Benefits, the discount rate increased from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022, while the expected return on plan assets decreased from 6.5% to 5.5%. For Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate rose from 3.2% to 5.0%, and the expected return on plan assets remained constant at 8.4%. \n\nThe increase in discount rates generally reduces the present value of future benefit obligations, potentially decreasing the net amount recognized. However, the decrease in the expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits could lead to higher net periodic benefit costs, as the lower return assumption increases the unfunded status of the plan. This is supported by the data showing a reduction in the net actuarial loss for Pension Benefits from $4,869 million in 2021 to $1,906 million in 2022, indicating a gain due to higher discount rates, but the net amount recognized still decreased from $(5,428) million to $(2,435) million, possibly due to the lower expected return on assets [1][10][image4][image5].\n\nFor Other Retiree Benefits, the higher discount rate and unchanged expected return on assets led to a net actuarial gain, reducing the net amount recognized from $2,238 million to $3,819 million. This suggests that the increased discount rate had a more favorable impact on the funded status compared to Pension Benefits [10][image4][image5].\n\nIn summary, the changes in discount rates and expected returns influenced the net amount recognized by affecting the valuation of obligations and the return on assets, with Pension Benefits showing a more complex impact due to the decrease in expected returns. \n\nThe discount rate and expected return on plan assets for Pension Benefits increased and decreased, respectively, while for Other Retiree Benefits, the discount rate increased with no change in expected return, impacting the net amount recognized through changes in actuarial gains/losses and benefit obligations."}

The net operating income improved by $392 million, or 60%, moving from -$654 million in 2019 to -$262 million in 2020. This improvement was largely driven by the performance in the FICC segment, which saw a substantial increase in revenue due to higher volatility and increased client activity. Specifically, FICC revenue rose by $1,541 million, or 33%, with notable gains in Foreign Exchange (26% increase), Rates (20% increase), and Credit (90% increase) [9]. The table in image4 highlights these increases, showing the strong performance in these areas.\n\nAdjusted revenue from Global Markets also saw a notable change, with a 27% increase in total revenue from $5,728 million in 2019 to $7,290 million in 2020. This growth was primarily attributed to the FICC segment, which contributed $1,541 million of the total increase. However, other segments like Equities and Securities Services experienced smaller increases or decreases, with Equities up by $21 million (2%) and Securities Services down by $234 million (12%) [4]. The table in image4 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes, illustrating the varied performance across different sectors.\n\nAdditionally, the allocation of revenue and expenses related to Markets Treasury, the funding costs of HSBC Holdings debt, and the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina to the global businesses, as mentioned in text [1], likely contributed to the restatement of comparatives and the overall improvement in adjusted revenue. This reallocation helped in better reflecting the revenue and expenses related to global business activities, which might have positively impacted the reported figures.\n\nDespite the overall improvement, the Global Banking segment saw a decrease in revenue by $71 million (2%), reflecting lower real estate and structured finance fee income and losses on legacy corporate restructuring positions, as noted in text [2]. This decline was partially offset by growth in capital markets revenue and increased net interest income from corporate lending.\n\nIn summary, the changes in net operating income and adjusted revenue from Global Markets were significantly influenced by the strong performance in FICC due to market volatility and client activity, alongside strategic reallocations and adjustments in financial reporting.

Several key factors contributed to this change, as reflected in the financial statements:\n\n1. **Reductions for Losses and Dividends**: The primary drivers of the decrease were a reduction to equity for losses amounting to $22.4 billion and distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends totaling $14.9 billion [1]. These significant outflows directly impacted the equity position.\n\n2. **Foreign Exchange and Postretirement Benefits**: Foreign exchange translation effects added $1.8 billion to equity due to the weaker U.S. dollar, while a change in the funded status of postretirement benefits reserves contributed a $1.0 billion increase [1]. However, these positive adjustments were outweighed by the losses and dividends.\n\n3. **Share Repurchases**: ExxonMobil acquired 8 million shares for the treasury in 2020 to offset shares issued for benefit plans, slightly reducing shares outstanding from 4,234 million to 4,233 million [5]. This activity is part of ongoing treasury stock management but had a minimal direct impact on the equity decrease compared to the losses and dividends.\n\n4. **Environmental Expenditures**: While not directly affecting equity, the company's environmental expenditures, totaling $4.5 billion in 2020, highlight ongoing operational costs that may influence future financial performance [3].\n\n5. **Noncontrolling Interests**: The table in image2 provides a detailed breakdown of equity components, including noncontrolling interests, which adjusted from $1,064 million in 2019 to a negative $150 million in 2020 [7].

According to the text, the goodwill arising from acquisitions or terminations of franchise contracts is linked to intangible assets that do not meet the IFRS 3 criteria for separate recognition, primarily due to their inability to generate future cash flows [9]. The recovery of goodwill is supported by the profitability of acquired companies, with future cash flows ensuring the carrying amount at year-end [3]. However, the pandemic significantly impacted the Group's operations in 2020, with up to 90% of stores closed in the first quarter and restrictions on openings later in the year, affecting financial metrics [4].\n\nLooking at the financial data, the opening balance of goodwill was 201 in 2021 and 207 in 2020, indicating a slight decrease in the opening balance from the previous year. There were no acquisitions affecting goodwill in either year, and foreign exchange translation differences were minimal, with a positive impact of 1 in 2021 and a negative impact of 6 in 2020. This resulted in a closing balance of 202 in 2021 and 201 in 2020, showing a marginal increase in goodwill by the end of 2021 compared to 2020. The consistency in the goodwill values across different entities, such as Stradivarius España, S.A. and Itx Portugal - Confecções, S.A., further supports the stability in goodwill components despite the pandemic's impact [image3].\n\nAdditionally, the changes in other financial components, such as payables, show significant increases in trade and personnel payables from 2021 to 2022, which might indirectly reflect operational adjustments post-pandemic [image2].

The pandemic's impact is evident in operational disruptions but did not drastically alter the goodwill figures.\n\n![Goodwill components show slight fluctuations due to foreign exchange differences](image1)  \n![Payables increased significantly from 2021 to"}

As shown in the table from image1, Rajesh Gopinathan (CEO and MD) received a gross salary of ₹135.90 (under Section 17(1)) and ₹129.22 in perquisites (under Section 17(2)), with a commission of ₹1,000.00 and other allowances of ₹72.82, totaling ₹1,337.94. Similarly, N Ganapathy Subramaniam (Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director) had a gross salary of ₹129.18, perquisites of ₹16.00, a commission of ₹700.00, and other allowances of ₹166.51, totaling ₹1,011.69. These figures highlight the substantial variable component (commission) in their remuneration, which aligns with the Company's practice of linking executive pay to performance [4].\n\nIn contrast, the remuneration for Independent Directors, as detailed in image4, primarily consists of sitting fees and commission. Independent Directors like Aman Mehta and Dr. Ron Sommer received sitting fees of ₹1.80 each and a commission of ₹60.00, totaling ₹61.80 each. Other Independent Directors, such as O P Bhatt, received higher commissions of ₹200.00, reflecting their contributions and attendance. The total remuneration for all Independent Directors was ₹910.60, with a ceiling of ₹42,070.19 under Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013. This structured approach ensures compliance with regulatory limits and emphasizes the role of performance in determining variable pay"}

According to the financial data, the company's total revenue rose from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, with significant growth in all regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific [10]. This growth was partly driven by the increasing acceptance of services internationally and the acquisition of Tableau, which benefited revenues in the Americas and Europe [10]. The 'Salesforce Platform and Other' category, as part of the cloud services, likely benefited from these trends, although specific revenue figures for this category are not detailed in the provided text quotes. However, the overall increase in cloud service revenues suggests a positive impact on this category.\n\nThe cost of revenues also increased, but the percentage of total revenues decreased slightly from 26% to 25% [5]. This indicates improved efficiency or a favorable shift in the business mix, such as the transition to cloud services, which generally have lower service delivery costs compared to perpetual licenses [2]. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to higher employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, and service delivery costs, particularly related to expanding data center capacity [2]. Despite these increases, the gross margin benefited from the shift towards cloud services, which have lower associated costs [2].\n\nThe investment in professional services, which facilitates the adoption of service offerings, remained positive, with a gross margin of $18 million in 2020, up from $22 million in 2019 [3]. This investment supports the adoption of services like the 'Salesforce Platform and Other', potentially enhancing customer retention and revenue growth [3]. Additionally, the company's focus on expanding enterprise and international markets, which have longer contract durations, likely contributed to a lower attrition rate, further supporting revenue stability [1].\n\nOverall, the growth in 'Salesforce Platform and Other' revenues, combined with controlled cost increases and improved margins, positively impacted the company's financial performance by enhancing revenue streams and maintaining profitability. The strategic investments in cloud infrastructure and professional services are expected to continue supporting this trend in future periods [4][7].\n\n![Revenue and cost data for different regions](image1)  \n![Cost of revenues and gross margin details](image5)"}

According to the text, total loans (average) decreased due to lower loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns reflecting continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital markets, partially offset by modest loan growth in late 2021 driven by higher line utilization and customer growth [3]. This trend is supported by the data in image4, which shows a significant decline in total loans from $211,436 million in 2020 to $181,237 million in 2021, a decrease of $30,199 million or 14%. Specific lines of business, such as Commercial and Industrial loans, saw a 16% decrease, while Commercial Real Estate loans decreased by 10% [image4]. The decline in loans was also impacted by actions taken in 2020 to curtail certain non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity originations, as well as a decline in PPP loans [8].\n\nOn the deposits side, total deposits (average and period-end) increased due to higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending reflecting government stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. This is corroborated by image4, which indicates that deposits increased, aligning with the text's explanation of increased liquidity and savings from government stimulus and economic uncertainty [6]. The increase in deposits was further driven by higher treasury management fees due to increased transaction volumes and repricing, contributing to higher deposit-related fees [1].\n\nIn summary, total loans decreased due to lower demand and paydowns, while deposits increased due to higher liquidity and government stimulus. The contributing factors included market conditions, client behavior, and economic policies. \n\n![Balance sheet data showing loan and deposit changes](image4)"}

This increase was primarily driven by higher Derivatives exposures due to market volatility, an increase in Investment securities from the E*TRADE acquisition, and higher Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and Institutional Securities business segments. Additionally, there was an increase in Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains. For the Advanced Approach, Credit Risk RWA also rose due to increased exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility [4]. The table in image2 illustrates these changes, showing a total increase of $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and $56,030 million under the Advanced Approach, leading to final balances of $387,066 million and $284,930 million, respectively, by the end of 2020. This substantial rise in Credit Risk RWA indicates a higher risk profile, necessitating more capital to absorb potential losses.\n\nConversely, External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% at the end of 2019 to 47.7% at the end of 2020, as shown in image5. Despite this decrease, the institution still exceeded the regulatory minimum and required ratios, which were 18.0% and 21.5%, respectively. The reduction in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA suggests a relative decrease in the buffer available to absorb losses compared to the increased risk, though the absolute amount of External TLAC increased from $196,888 million to $216,129 million. This indicates that while the institution maintained compliance, the proportion of TLAC relative to the growing RWA slightly diminished, potentially impacting its ability to absorb losses in proportion to its risk exposure.\n\nThe increase in Credit Risk RWA, combined with the slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA, implies that the institution faced higher capital requirements to maintain regulatory compliance. This dynamic could have necessitated adjustments in capital management strategies, such as retaining more capital or raising additional capital to meet the higher risk-weighted asset base.

The net deferred tax assets also rose from $6,372,000 to $9,344,000. This increase is likely due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets, possibly from carry-forward tax losses, as noted in image5, where carry-forward tax losses increased from $1,799,000 in 2019 to $4,379,000 in 2020.\n\n2. **Carry-Forward Tax Losses:**\n   - The unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset was recognized decreased from $2,063,000 in 2019 to $2,693,000 in 2020 [4].

Additionally, interest expense also decreased, with a total reduction of $5,627 million from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to lower costs in interest-bearing deposits and loans [4]. This contrasts with the 2018 to 2019 period, where interest expense increased by $714 million [4].\n\nThe organizational structure of Bank of America, as depicted in the image quotes, shows that the Consumer Banking segment, which includes deposits and consumer lending, was significantly impacted by these changes. The table in image1 highlights a decline in net interest income for both deposits and consumer lending, with total consumer banking net interest income dropping from $28,158 million in 2019 to $24,698 million in 2020 [8]. This aligns with the broader trend of lower interest rates affecting net interest income across the organization. The structure also includes segments like Global Wealth & Investment Management and Global Markets, which may have been influenced by changes in interest rates and economic conditions, though specific data for these segments is not detailed in the provided quotes [2][10].\n\nFurthermore, the decrease in net interest income reflects the strategic allocation of capital and risk management practices mentioned in the text. The bank's internal risk-based capital models consider various risks, including interest rate risk, which is crucial given the significant impact of rate changes on net interest income [3].

This decrease was primarily driven by a significant drop in interest and other investment income, which fell from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, a 44.4% decline [6]. The decline in interest income was attributed to lower short-term interest rates and reduced income from fixed maturity securities, reflecting the low-rate environment that persisted through 2021 [6]. However, dividend income increased slightly from $4,890 million in 2020 to $5,060 million in 2021, a 3.5% increase, which partially offset the decline in interest income [2].\n\nIn terms of asset composition, the insurance business saw notable changes in its investment portfolio. The amount held in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million at the end of 2020 to $90,688 million at the end of 2021, indicating a strategic shift towards liquidity [image1]. Conversely, the value of fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, suggesting a reduction in holdings of these assets [image1]. Equity securities, however, saw a substantial increase from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, reflecting a significant growth in this portion of the portfolio [image1].\n\nThe increase in cash and equity securities, alongside the decrease in fixed maturity securities, suggests a focus on maintaining liquidity and potentially capitalizing on equity market gains. The volatility in equity markets, as indicated by the net unrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, highlights the impact of market fluctuations on investment income [9]. The company's emphasis on safety over yield in short-term investments aligns with the increased cash holdings, aiming to preserve capital in a low-interest-rate environment [6].\n\nOverall, the changes in net investment income and asset composition reflect a strategic adjustment to navigate the challenges of low interest rates"}

The downstream segment also suffered, with a total loss of $47 million, resulting in a net loss of $5,543 million for the company. This sharp decline was largely due to the global economic downturn and lower commodity prices, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the text, the interest rate risks associated with these contracts are no longer considered significant due to their short duration as of December 31, 2021 [3]. However, the table in image2 provides a detailed analysis of how different interest rate scenarios affect the fair value of these contracts. For instance, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates results in a decrease in the fair value of equity index put option contracts from $99 million to $94 million as of December 31, 2021. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease increases the fair value to $105 million. This sensitivity highlights that while the overall risk is reduced, fluctuations in interest rates still influence the valuation, albeit to a lesser extent compared to previous years when these contracts had longer durations [10].\n\nRegarding non-U.S. denominated debt, the effects on net earnings between 2020 and 2021 show a significant shift. In 2020, the impact of non-U.S. denominated debt included in net earnings was a loss of $764 million, whereas in 2021, it resulted in a gain of $955 million, as shown in image5. This reversal indicates that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect on net earnings in 2021, contrasting with the negative impact observed in 2020. The company does not use derivatives to manage foreign currency risks meaningfully, which exposes it to such fluctuations [4]. The text also notes that changes in exchange rates are recorded in earnings as part of selling, general, and administrative expenses, with pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion in 2021 and losses of $1.0 billion in 2020 [8]. This aligns with the data in image5, where the foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income was a loss of $1,021 million in 2021, compared to a gain of $1,264 million in 2020, further illustrating the volatility in foreign currency impacts on financial results.\n\nIn summary, interest rate changes modestly affect the fair value of equity index put option contracts, while non-U.S. denominated debt effects on net earnings reversed from a loss in 2020 to a gain in"}

According to the text quotes, the GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 was (18.6) percent, a substantial decrease from 7.2 percent in 2019 [4][6][8]. This decrease was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of intellectual property and a $0.2 billion benefit from a foreign tax law change [4][6]. The Operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (1.5) percent, compared to 8.5 percent in 2019 [1][6]. The Operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was mainly due to the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale [1][6].\n\nThe image quotes provide detailed financial tables that illustrate these differences.

For the U.S. downstream sector, earnings improved dramatically from a loss of $571 million in 2020 to $2.4 billion in 2021 [9]. This turnaround was primarily driven by higher margins on refined product sales, which contributed $1.6 billion, increased earnings from CPChem of $1.0 billion, and higher sales volumes of $470 million. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million. The improvement in 2021 compared to 2019, where earnings were $2,389 million, suggests a recovery from the pandemic-related downturn in 2020, as indicated by the data in image3, which shows a significant increase from 2020 to 2021.\n\nIn contrast, the international downstream sector saw a decrease in earnings from $618 million in 2020 to $525 million in 2021 [5]. This decline was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales, amounting to $330 million, and higher operating expenses of $100 million. However, a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million partially mitigated these losses. The earnings in 2019 were $922 million, as shown in image1, indicating a more substantial decline from 2019 to 2021.

According to the financial data, the liability for uncertain tax positions decreased significantly. As of December 31, 2020, the liability was $89 million, down from $303 million in 2019 [7]. This reduction was primarily due to a $249 million tax benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, which also led to the reversal of $46 million in accrued interest [7]. The decrease in uncertain tax positions reflects a resolution of prior year tax positions, impacting the effective tax rate and deferred tax assets.\n\nRegarding fair value assets, the composition and valuation of financial instruments also shifted. The table in image2 shows that the total measured at fair value for cash and cash equivalents increased from $1,991 million in 2019 to $2,482 million in 2020. Short-term investments saw a rise from $2,950 million to $3,461 million, while long-term investments decreased from $272 million to $18 million. This change in long-term investments aligns with the sale of mutual funds to hedge deferred compensation obligations, resulting in $253 million in proceeds [5].

The graph illustrates that GPI's normalized price ranged between 106 and 84, while the BSE Sensex ranged between 98 and 84. This suggests that GPI's share price was generally higher than the BSE Sensex, with both indices peaking and troughing around the same months, indicating a somewhat synchronized movement but with GPI showing greater variability [image5].\n\nIn summary, GPI's share prices were more volatile compared to the BSE Sensex, with both indices experiencing similar trends but GPI exhibiting larger price swings during the period from April 2002 to March 2003."}

This decline in margin was primarily due to the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition and ongoing investments in strategic areas [9]. Additionally, pre-tax income for Cloud & Cognitive Software decreased by 12.4% to $7,811 million, with a pre-tax margin dropping by 5.2 percentage points to 30.4% [2]. The decrease in pre-tax income was influenced by the Red Hat acquisition and lower income from IP partnership agreements [9].\n\nIn contrast, Global Business Services (GBS) saw an increase in external gross profit to $4,655 million, marking a 3.0% rise from 2018, with the gross profit margin improving by 0.8 percentage points to 27.7% [4]. The pre-tax income for GBS increased by 1.3% to $1,623 million, and the pre-tax margin rose slightly to 9.5% [4]. These improvements in GBS were driven by a mix shift to higher-value offerings, delivery productivity enhancements, and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model [5]. GBS also experienced growth in consulting services, particularly in offerings that supported clients' digital transformations, such as cognitive technology and application modernization, despite a decline in traditional application management [10].\n\nThe financial results for Cloud & Cognitive Software were impacted by strategic investments and acquisition-related adjustments, whereas GBS benefited from operational efficiencies and a strategic focus on high-value services.

According to the text, PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 11.6% to 64.2 billion units, or by 10.3% excluding the impact of the RBH deconsolidation [10]. This decline was notably due to lower market shares and total market volumes in several countries, including Argentina, Canada, Colombia, and Mexico, primarily reflecting adult smoker down-trading to ultra-low-price brands and the impact of the pandemic on consumption patterns [2]. Additionally, the optimization of global manufacturing infrastructure, including asset impairments and exit costs related to plant closures, contributed to these changes [3].\n\nIn terms of financial activities, the net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to reduced capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of RBH, though this was partially offset by higher cash collateral for derivatives [1]. The net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion in 2020, mainly due to higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, despite higher net earnings excluding non-cash charges [7]. The financial summary in the image shows that net revenues decreased by 22.9% overall, with a significant negative impact from currency fluctuations, but operating income increased by 100% due to cost improvements and price adjustments ![Financial performance differences, showing decreases in net revenues but significant increases in operating income](image4).\n\nThe shipment data in the image highlights that while cigarette shipments in Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.8%, heated tobacco units saw a 50.8% increase, indicating a shift in product mix ![PMI shipment volume decreased by 11.6% from 2019 to 2020](image3).

According to the financial summary in image3, the net income for Consumer Banking and Lending fluctuated over the three years, influenced by various factors such as revenue streams and expense management. The table highlights total revenue, which combines net interest income and noninterest income, and shows how these components contributed to the net income for each year. For instance, the net interest income decreased in 2021 due to lower interest rates and loan balances, as mentioned in text [7], while noninterest income saw increases in certain areas like mortgage banking and card fees, partially offset by lower gains on residential mortgage loans [1][8].\n\nLooking at the balance sheet data in image4, total loans and deposits provide a clearer picture of the evolution. Total loans decreased from 2019 to 2021, with paydowns exceeding originations and specific actions like the curtailment of non-conforming residential mortgage originations impacting Home Lending [9]. This decline is evident in the loan categories such as Home Lending, Auto, and Credit Card, where dollar amounts and percentage changes are detailed. Conversely, total deposits increased, driven by higher consumer liquidity and savings due to government stimulus and economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. This increase is reflected in the higher average and period-end deposit balances shown in image4.\n\nAdditionally, image5 provides deeper insights into specific lending segments. For Home Lending, mortgage banking revenue saw higher gains in 2021 from GNMA loan securitization pools, while originations shifted towards retail loans with better margins [8]. Credit Card metrics, such as POS volume and new accounts, also indicate changes in consumer behavior and lending activity. The delinquency rates across segments highlight the impact of economic conditions on loan performance.\n\nIn summary, from 2019 to 2021, Consumer Banking and Lending experienced a decrease in total loans due to paydowns and strategic adjustments, while deposits grew significantly. Net income was influenced by these changes, alongside shifts in revenue and expense management, as detailed in the financial summaries and balance sheet data. \n\n![Financial summary showing net income and revenue for different business segments](image3)\n![Balance sheet data for loans and deposits by line of business](image4)\n![Detailed lending segment metrics including originations"}

According to the text, net interest income increased primarily due to a lower cost of funds, though this was partially offset by lower average revolving Card Member loan balances [10]. The image data provides a detailed breakdown of these changes:\n\n**Average Card Member Loans:**\n- In 2019, the average Card Member loans were $13.3 billion [image4].\n- By 2021, this figure increased to $15.0 billion [image4]. This represents a growth of approximately 13%, indicating an expansion in the loan portfolio.\n\n**Net Interest Income:**\n- In 2019, net interest income was $866 million [image4].\n- By 2021, it rose to $1,011 million [image4], marking an increase of about 17%. Despite the growth in loans, the net interest yield on average Card Member loans decreased, reflecting higher paydown rates and competitive interest rates [10].\n\n**Implications for Financial Performance:**\n- The increase in average Card Member loans suggests a higher volume of lending, which could indicate greater customer engagement and spending. However, the decrease in net interest yield implies that the company faced challenges in maintaining profitability from interest income due to competitive pressures and higher paydown rates [10].\n- The slight increase in net interest income, despite lower yields, highlights the company's ability to manage costs effectively, as evidenced by the lower cost of funds [10]. This efficiency helped offset the impact of reduced yields, contributing positively to overall financial performance.\n- The financial data also shows that total revenues net of interest expense increased from $10,619 million in 2020 to $12,500 million in 2021, driven by strong growth in non-interest revenues [image1]. This diversification reduced reliance on interest income, enhancing resilience.\n\nIn summary, while average Card Member loans grew, the net interest income saw a modest increase due to cost management, and the company's financial performance benefited from robust non-interest revenue growth, mitigating the effects of declining yields."}

According to the financial data, share-based compensation expenses increased Restricted Share Units by 1,118,284 and contributed $79,522 to Additional Paid-in Capital, totaling $1,197,806 [5]. This indicates that the company utilized share-based compensation as a tool to incentivize employees, which positively impacted equity by enhancing Additional Paid-in Capital. Additionally, the issuance of Class A Shares for employee programs added $660,723, further boosting equity while decreasing Restricted Share Units and increasing Additional Paid-in Capital by $1,409,627 [5]. These transactions reflect Accenture's strategy to align employee interests with shareholder value through equity-based incentives.\n\nOn the cash flow side, the cash flow statement for 2020 shows net income of $5,185,313, which is a significant contributor to operating cash flow [4]. Adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expenses, along with changes in assets and liabilities, further shaped the operating activities. The net cash provided by operating activities would have bolstered Accenture's cash position, enabling the company to fund its operations and strategic initiatives [2].

The table details the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for both years, indicating a rise in total assets. Specifically, the increase in assets could be attributed to growth in various categories such as property, plant, and equipment, or finance receivables, which are key components of the Financial Products segment. This expansion in assets suggests that the company invested in its operations or expanded its lending activities, potentially enhancing its capacity to generate future revenues.\n\nRegarding cash flow from operating activities, the consolidated net cash provided by operating activities rose significantly from $4.05 billion in 2020 to $7.18 billion in 2021 [2]. This substantial increase was primarily due to higher profit adjusted for non-cash items, including higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation, and lower payments for these compensations [2]. Additionally, changes in working capital, such as favorable adjustments in accounts payable and accrued expenses, contributed positively to the cash flow, despite unfavorable changes in inventory and accounts receivable [2]. The detailed breakdown in image2 further illustrates these components, showing the net cash provided by operating activities across different segments, highlighting the robustness of the company's core operations.\n\nThe implications of these changes are positive for business operations.

According to the financial statements, total assets decreased from $191,367 million in 2020 to $188,548 million in 2021 [3]. This reduction is primarily attributed to a significant decline in cash and cash equivalents, which fell from $32,965 million to $22,028 million, largely due to increased card member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases, and reduced customer deposits [10]. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is further supported by the cash flow statement, which shows a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $10,937 million in 2021, driven by cash used in financing activities and investing activities [image2].\n\nOn the liabilities side, total liabilities also decreased from $168,383 million in 2020 to $166,371 million in 2021 [3].

According to image3, the total operating lease liabilities were $974 million in 2020 and $797 million in 2019. This indicates an increase of $177 million in operating lease liabilities from 2019 to 2020. The increase is broken down into current liabilities of $189 million in 2020 compared to $158 million in 2019, and long-term liabilities of $785 million in 2020 compared to $639 million in 2019. The weighted average remaining lease term remained constant at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020. This suggests that the company took on more lease obligations, possibly due to expansion or new lease agreements.\n\nFor inventory totals, image2 provides a detailed breakdown. The total inventory increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. This represents a growth of $664 million. The increase is seen across all categories: finished goods rose from $833 million to $1,232 million, work in process increased from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials grew from $510 million to $691 million. This significant rise in inventory levels could be attributed to increased production activities or strategic stockpiling in anticipation of higher demand.\n\nIn summary, both operating lease liabilities and inventory totals saw substantial increases from 2019 to 2020, reflecting potential growth and expansion activities by the company.\n\n![Operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020](image3)\n![Inventory totals increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020](image2)\n\nThe operating lease liabilities increased from $797 million in 20"}

This change was driven by gross increases in current year tax positions and prior year tax positions, partially offset by gross decreases due to settlements and statute of limitations lapses. Specifically, in 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits began at $1,423 million, increased by $416 million from current year tax positions and $120 million from prior year tax positions, and decreased by $130 million due to prior year tax position resolutions. The net result was an end-of-period balance of $1,829 million. This trend indicates ongoing tax uncertainties and adjustments over the three-year period, with a significant accumulation of unrecognized tax benefits by 2020.\n\nRegarding common share repurchases, the company repurchased 22 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $245.97 per share, totaling $5,500 million, and 14 million shares in 2020 at an average price of $300.58 per share, totaling $4,250 million. These repurchases reflect the company's strategy to optimize its capital structure and offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. The reduction in the number of shares repurchased from 2019 to 2020, despite a higher average price, suggests a strategic adjustment in the repurchase program, possibly influenced by market conditions or changes in capital allocation priorities. The remaining authorized shares for repurchase decreased from 72 million in 2019 to 58 million in 2020, indicating active utilization of the Board's authorization.\n\nIn summary, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits rose significantly from 2018 to 2020, while common share repurchases in 2019 and 2020 contributed to reducing the number of outstanding shares, aligning with the company's objectives to enhance shareholder value and manage capital structure.\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from 2018 to 2020](image4)  \n![Common share repurchases in 2019 and 2020](image1)"}

For leasehold improvements, hardware, and software, the table in image4 outlines the depreciation policies and movements in asset values. The cost section shows initial balances, additions, disposals, and exchange rate effects, while the accumulated depreciation and impairment losses section details annual depreciation charges and impairment losses. Specifically, the table indicates that depreciation and impairment charges were applied over the lease term for leasehold improvements and a 3-year duration for hardware and software. The carrying amounts at the end of 2020 reflect these depreciation and impairment adjustments, as well as any additions or disposals.\n\nFor right-of-use assets, the transition to AASB 16 significantly impacted the carrying amounts. As noted in text [5], the Group recognized $50,464,000 of right-of-use assets at the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. The table in image5 provides a detailed breakdown: the initial balance was $138,403,000 after recognizing right-of-use assets under AASB 16.

Depreciation charges of $37,454,000 and exchange rate effects of $779,000 adjusted the accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The net result was a carrying amount of $150,464,000 at the end of 2020, up from $138,403,000 at the start. This increase was primarily due to new additions and re-measurements, offset by depreciation and exchange rate impacts.\n\nIn summary, the changes in carrying amounts were driven by depreciation, additions, re-measurements, and exchange rate movements, with the adoption of AASB 16 playing a crucial role in recognizing right-of-use assets and adjusting their values accordingly. \n\nThe carrying amounts of leasehold improvements, hardware and software, and right-of-use assets increased from the beginning to the end of the fiscal year 2020 due to additions, re-measurements, and depreciation adjustments,"}

This is reflected in the image2, which shows a substantial benefit of $2,472 million from the derecognition of the deferred tax asset in 2019. Additionally, the establishment of new U.S. net deferred tax assets led to a $570 million tax benefit, as noted in the same image [6].

This gain was part of a series of divestitures that included the Corporate Trust Services business and the student loan portfolio, collectively generating substantial net gains [2]. The sale of WFAM also led to a reduction in asset-based fees due to the cessation of advisory services previously provided through WFAM [3][6][7].\n\nThe broader effects on the company's income statement are evident in the increase in noninterest income, which rose by 104% from 2020 to 2021, largely driven by gains from these divestitures [10]. This is supported by the income statement summary in image1, which shows a significant jump in noninterest income from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, a change of $5,120 million. The sale of WFAM specifically contributed $269 million to this increase [10].\n\nOn the balance sheet, the sale of WFAM led to a substantial decrease in total assets. The text mentions that total assets decreased modestly due to the timing of cash deployment by the investment portfolio, partially offset by an increase in equity securities [1]. Image3 provides a detailed view of the balance sheet data, showing changes in various asset categories. The sale of WFAM would have reduced the assets under management, as reflected in the significant outflow and sale impact of $(587.1) billion in the WFAM AUM table in image5. This table highlights that the end-of-period balance for WFAM AUM dropped to $198.7 billion in 2021, a drastic reduction from the beginning balance of $603.0 billion, largely due to the sale.\n\nAdditionally, the company continued to administer Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets under a transition services agreement until June 2022, which included AUM of $19 billion and AUA of $582 billion [4].

However, in 2020, the company only declared a single dividend of 15.0 cents per qualifying ordinary share, amounting to $15,866,000 [image5]. This reduction in total dividends can be attributed to the impact of COVID-19 on the business, which led to a deferral of the interim dividend payment and a reduction in the franking percentage due to lower tax payments during the year [5][8]. The interim dividend initially announced for 23 April 2020 was deferred to 30 September 2020, and the franking percentage was reduced to 50% as a result of the pandemic's financial impact [5][8].

This growth was driven by several factors, including a substantial increase in sales volume, which contributed $3,076 million, and favorable price realization adding $932 million. Despite higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses, the company managed to reduce these costs by $1,246 million and $1,021 million, respectively. Additionally, the Financial Products segment contributed an increase of $279 million, and other adjustments added $364 million to the operating profit. This comprehensive breakdown is visually represented in the bar chart, highlighting the key contributors to the profit increase ![The image shows the factors contributing to the increase in Caterpillar's consolidated operating profit from 2020 to 2021](image1).\n\nIn the ME&T segment, the operating profit also saw a notable rise. The segment's profit increased by $363 million, or 15%, from $2,405 million in 2020 to $2,768 million in 2021. This improvement was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, which were partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and higher SG&A/R&D expenses [9]. The segment's profit margin as a percent of total sales decreased from 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, indicating a shift in cost structure or sales mix [4].\n\nRegarding net cash provided by operating activities, the Consolidated segment experienced an increase of $871 million, reaching $7.20 billion in 2021. This improvement was largely due to higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation and lower payments for the same, despite increased working capital requirements [5].

The company also believes it is reasonably possible that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $39 million in the next twelve months due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations [10].\n\nThe image data provides a detailed breakdown of these changes. The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million at the beginning of 2020 to $1,829 million at the end of 2020, driven by current year tax positions of $416 million and prior year tax positions of $120 million, partially offset by gross decreases of $130 million from prior year tax positions ![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020](image3).

This is evident from the text [10], which highlights that dealers decreased inventories more in 2020 than in 2021, contributing to the volume increase. Additionally, favorable price realization played a role, as noted in the same text. The image1 bar graph visually supports this by showing a substantial increase in sales and revenues from $11,235 million in 2020 to $13,798 million in 2021, with notable contributions from sales volume and price realization.\n\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1.611 billion, up $231 million, or 17 percent, from $1.380 billion in 2020 [7]. This improvement was largely due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, which offset increased manufacturing costs and SG&A expenses. The image4 chart further illustrates these factors, showing that while manufacturing costs decreased by $816 million and SG&A/R&D decreased by $272 million, the net effect was a positive change in operating profit. The image2 table also confirms the overall increase in consolidated operating profit, aligning with the text's explanation.\n\nRegional analysis from the text [2], [4], and [8] indicates that EAME, North America, and Asia/Pacific all experienced sales growth due to higher demand and inventory changes.

The table in image3 details the changes in Chevron's equity components from 2018 to 2021. It shows that in 2021, Chevron had significant activity in both retained earnings and treasury stock. The retained earnings increased due to the net income of $15,689 million, as seen in image2, which reported a substantial positive net income for 2021. However, this increase was partially offset by cash dividends paid out to shareholders. The table in image3 indicates that Chevron paid cash dividends of $10,000 million in 2021, which directly reduces retained earnings and thus impacts the equity structure by decreasing the total stockholders' equity. Additionally, the company engaged in treasury stock transactions, repurchasing shares which also reduces equity as it is recorded as a contra-equity account. The movement in treasury stock reflects the company's share buyback activity, which can influence the number of outstanding shares and the overall equity structure.\n\nNext, examining the cash flow statement in image4, we see the impact on cash flow. The financing activities section shows that Chevron used cash for financing activities, with a net cash outflow of $23,113 million in 2021. This outflow includes the cash dividends paid, which is a significant cash outflow from financing activities. The table in image4 specifies that dividends paid amounted to $10,000 million, aligning with the data in image3. Furthermore, the financing activities also include the repurchase of treasury stock, which is another cash outflow. While the exact amount for treasury stock repurchases isn't explicitly stated in image4, the overall net cash used in financing activities reflects the combined effect of dividends and potential share repurchases.\n\nIn summary, the cash dividends and treasury stock transactions in 2021 reduced Chevron's equity by decreasing retained earnings and increasing treasury stock, respectively. These transactions also resulted in a significant cash outflow from financing activities, impacting the company's cash flow negatively. The equity structure was adjusted to reflect these transactions, with retained earnings being reduced by the dividends paid and treasury stock increasing due to share repurchases.\n\n**Answer:** In 2021, Chevron's cash dividends and treasury stock"}

This strategy includes rolling out stores in key regions such as the USA, France, and the UK, as well as exploring franchise options in the Middle East and Vietnam. The table in image2 shows a clear trend of increasing store counts across various countries and regions from 2016 to 2020, with the total number of stores rising from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020. This growth reflects Lovisa's successful execution of its international expansion plan, which involves entering new markets through pilot programs and securing a portfolio of stores to establish a strong operating footprint. The company's ability to identify and secure quality retail sites in high-traffic locations, as mentioned in text quote [10], has facilitated this rapid expansion. Additionally, the global rollout of piercing services and the focus on enhancing customer loyalty, as noted in text quote [2], have supported the performance of these new stores. The image5 further details the strategy's components, including the target of opening one new trial territory annually, which aligns with the observed growth in store counts. Overall, Lovisa's strategic approach to international expansion has been a key driver of its increased presence in new territories over this period.\n\n![Store interior with promotional deals](image1)  \n![Store count trends from 2016 to 2020](image2)  \n![Financial summary showing increased net cash](image4)  \n![Business strategy focusing on international expansion](image5)  \n\nLovisa's international store expansion strategy led to a significant increase in store counts, from 250 in 2016 to 435 in 2020, driven by targeted market entry and efficient store site selection."}

For lease liabilities, the Group recognized a lease liability on the initial application of AASB 16, amounting to $143,621 thousand at 1 July 2019, which adjusted the balance from $0 to $143,621 thousand. During the year, additional lease liabilities of $50,245 thousand were recognized, and there were re-measurements of $1,559 thousand. Lease payments of $(31,886) thousand were made, with interest of $4,707 thousand accrued, and exchange rate movements resulted in a decrease of $(1,092) thousand. By 28 June 2020, the total lease liability was $167,154 thousand, with $36,019 thousand classified as current and $131,135 thousand as non-current. This reflects the adoption of the new standard, which required the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as noted in [10]. The transition also involved re-measuring lease liabilities due to changes in lease terms, such as extensions, and the capitalization of site restoration costs as part of the lease right-of-use asset, as detailed in [3] and [4].\n\nFor employee benefit liabilities, the data shows a slight increase in total liabilities from $4,054 thousand in 2019 to $4,092 thousand in 2020. Current liabilities for annual leave decreased from $2,992 thousand to $2,848 thousand, while long-service leave liabilities increased from $703 thousand to $837 thousand in current liabilities and from $359 thousand to $407 thousand in non-current liabilities. This indicates ongoing obligations for employee benefits, calculated at undiscounted amounts based on expected remuneration rates, as described in [1]. The transition to AASB 16 did not directly impact employee benefit liabilities, but the overall financial reporting framework changes may have influenced the presentation and management of these obligations.\n\nIn summary, the transition to AASB 16 significantly increased lease liabilities due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease obligations, while employee"}

For ClickSoftware, the acquisition involved a significant allocation to goodwill, with a total fair value of the consideration transferred being approximately $1.4 billion. The allocation included $215 million to developed technology and $61 million to customer relationships, as shown in the table in image1. These intangible assets have useful lives of 4 and 8 years, respectively, totaling $276 million in intangible assets subject to amortization. Additionally, the allocation included $164 million in goodwill, as seen in image2, which is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities. The net assets acquired amounted to $134 million, considering liabilities such as accounts payable, accrued expenses, unearned revenue, and deferred income taxes.\n\nIn contrast, the Salesforce.org acquisition, while contributing $228 million in total revenues in fiscal 2020, did not involve a significant allocation to goodwill or intangible assets. Instead, the transaction was settled by effectively resolving existing reseller and resource sharing agreements, resulting in a non-cash charge of approximately $166 million due to favorable terms provided to Salesforce.org [10]. This charge reflects the difference between the reseller agreement's terms and fair value, impacting operating expenses rather than asset allocation.\n\nBoth acquisitions involved the recognition of goodwill, but the amounts and reasons differed. ClickSoftware's goodwill was substantial ($164 million) and linked to workforce and market opportunities, whereas Salesforce.org's impact was more about resolving prior agreements rather than asset allocation. The ClickSoftware acquisition also included detailed allocations to developed technology and customer relationships, as illustrated in image1 and image2, which were not present in the Salesforce.org transaction. The net assets acquired for ClickSoftware were $134 million, while Salesforce.org's financial impact was primarily through revenue contribution and a non-cash charge.\n\nIn summary, while both acquisitions involved goodwill and financial adjustments, ClickSoftware's allocation was more detailed in terms of intangible assets and net assets acquired, whereas Salesforce.org's impact was through revenue and resolving prior agreements.\n\n**Answer:** The ClickSoftware acquisition allocated significant fair value to developed technology, customer relationships, and goodwill, with detailed intangible asset allocations, while the Salesforce.org acquisition primarily involved resolving prior agreements and contributing revenue without substantial asset allocations."}

This decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements and cash payments for asset impairment and exit costs, partially offset by higher net earnings excluding non-cash charges from 2019. The net cash provided by operating activities was $9,812 million in 2020, down from $10,090 million in 2019, as shown in the cash flow table in image2. This reduction in operating cash flows suggests a tighter cash position from operations.\n\nInvesting activities saw a decrease in net cash used, with a reduction of $0.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 [9]. This was mainly due to lower capital expenditures and the absence of the RBH deconsolidation impact, partially offset by higher cash collateral for derivatives. The capital expenditures were $0.6 billion in 2020, down from $0.9 billion in 2019 [7]. The cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2020, compared to $1.9 billion in 2019, as detailed in image2. This improvement in investing cash flows helped mitigate the decline in operating cash.\n\nFinancing activities showed an increase in net cash used by $0.4 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and dividends, partially offset by debt activity [4]. The net cash used in financing activities was $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $8.1 billion in 2019, as seen in image3.

The Annual Total Remuneration is set using a formula based on benchmark results of executive compensation, with adjustments made according to consolidated operating income, the volatility of Toyota's share price, and individual performance evaluations [1][3][10]. This approach ensures that remuneration reflects the company's financial health and market perception.\n\nThe consolidated operating income serves as a key indicator for evaluating Toyota's efforts based on business performance, while the volatility of Toyota's share price acts as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors [image1]. This dual focus ensures that executives are incentivized to drive both operational success and shareholder value. The evaluation framework further emphasizes these metrics, with consolidated operating income and share price volatility each carrying a 50% weight in performance assessments [image3]. For instance, achieving 150% of the required income set in 2011 underscores the company's sustainable growth efforts, directly influencing remuneration outcomes.\n\nPerformance-linked remuneration, which constitutes the balance after deducting fixed monthly payments from the Annual Total Remuneration, is explicitly tied to these performance indicators [3]. This structure ensures that bonuses and share-based compensations are contingent on meeting or exceeding financial targets and market performance. The detailed breakdown in the remuneration table highlights how individual directors, such as Takeshi Uchiyamada and Akio Toyoda, receive compensation that reflects their roles and contributions, with significant portions allocated to performance-linked components like bonuses and share-based compensation [image2].\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Directors delegates the determination of remuneration to the Executive Compensation Meeting, which reviews the system and aligns it with corporate performance and individual responsibilities [5]. This governance structure reinforces the link between executive pay and company success. Toyota also prioritizes shareholder value by maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of around 30%, investing retained earnings in growth areas like environmental and safety technologies [7]. The financial data over five fiscal years shows consistent dividend payments and share repurchases, contributing to a total shareholder return ratio that fluctuates but remains significant, reflecting the company's commitment to rewarding shareholders [image5].\n\nOverall, Toyota's executive remuneration system effectively integrates business performance metrics and shareholder value indicators, ensuring that compensation rewards efforts that enhance both operational success and investor returns. This alignment is evident in the structured evaluation and payment processes, which prioritize performance and value creation.\n\nToyota's executive remun"}

These figures are detailed in the financial data provided for both years, which highlights the Group's lease-related expenses.

According to the text, the company's total sales and revenues rose to $50.971 billion, a 22% increase from 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization [8]. The sales volume increase was driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, as well as changes in dealer inventories. Specifically, dealers decreased their inventories by about $2.9 billion in 2020, compared to a decrease of only $100 million in 2021, indicating a shift towards meeting current demand rather than building stock [10]. This aligns with the image showing the consolidated sales and revenues comparison, where the sales volume increase contributed $7,563 million to the overall revenue growth [image2].\n\nPrice realization also played a significant role, adding $932 million to the revenue increase [image2]. This favorable price realization was seen across various regions, such as North America, where higher end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories contributed to a 23% sales increase [2], and Asia/Pacific, where a stronger Australian dollar and Chinese yuan further boosted revenues [3]. The image detailing the financial results highlights that price realization was a consistent factor across segments, contributing to the overall growth [image3].\n\nIn terms of segments, the Construction Industries segment showed the most significant improvement, with sales increasing by $5.188 billion, or 31%, to $22.106 billion in 2021 [4]. This was driven by higher sales volume and favorable currency impacts, particularly from the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar. The Energy & Transportation segment also saw a notable increase of $2.817 billion, or 16%, to $20.287 billion, with growth across all applications and inter-segment sales [7].

Net interest income decreased by $3.5 billion to $24.7 billion, mainly because of lower interest rates, although this was partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income also decreased by $1.9 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a decline in service charges due to higher deposit balances and lower card income from decreased client activity [8]. Additionally, home equity production and first mortgage loan originations both declined significantly in 2020, with home equity production decreasing by $2.8 billion and first mortgage originations decreasing by $6.0 billion, primarily due to a decline in applications [4][7]. This reduction in loan originations reflects the broader impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer lending activities.\n\nIn contrast, the **GWIM** segment, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank, experienced a decline in revenue but maintained growth in client balances.

This is a significant increase compared to 2019, where there was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of the manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [1]. The restructuring charges in 2020 were recorded as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment [8]. \n\nLooking at the quarterly breakdown, the restructuring charges/other were notably absent in most quarters of 2020, except for the second quarter, where they amounted to $24 million [image3]. This contrasts with 2019, where restructuring charges/other were a credit of $36 million in the second quarter, reflecting the sale of the facility [image3]. The absence of such credits in 2020 indicates a shift from gains to costs, impacting the operating profit negatively.\n\nThe restructuring accrual balances also show a change in the financial position.

This project, aimed at providing relief during the pandemic, underscores the substantial financial commitment to addressing immediate health and economic needs. Other COVID-related projects, such as those in Maharashtra and Kerala, also show considerable spending, reflecting the widespread impact of the pandemic and the need for extensive support. The implementation modes for these projects vary; some are executed directly by the organization, while others are managed through agencies like Solace and Give India, indicating a collaborative approach to ensure rapid and effective distribution of resources. The direct implementation suggests a hands-on approach to manage the crisis efficiently, while agency involvement allows for specialized expertise and broader reach.\n\nIn contrast, Rural Development Projects, as detailed in image2, typically have shorter durations of 1 year and focus on long-term community development. The financial allocations for these projects are generally lower compared to COVID Relief projects, with amounts spent ranging from ₹0.01 crore to ₹1.00 crore. This difference in expenditure aligns with the nature of rural development, which often involves sustained efforts rather than emergency response. The implementation modes for rural projects are predominantly through external agencies, such as the National Health and Education Society and AHEAD, as seen in image2. This reliance on implementing agencies may be due to the need for localized knowledge and existing infrastructure in rural areas to effectively address specific community needs.\n\nThe key differences in project implementation modes lie in the urgency and scope of the projects. COVID Relief projects often require direct intervention to address immediate needs, while Rural Development Projects benefit from agency partnerships to leverage local expertise and resources. This distinction highlights the strategic approach to resource allocation and execution based on the project's objectives and context.\n\nIn summary, COVID Relief projects involve higher financial commitments and a mix of direct and agency-based implementation to respond swiftly to emergencies, whereas Rural Development Projects focus on sustainable growth with lower expenditures and a greater reliance on external agencies for tailored solutions. \n\n![Details of COVID Relief and Rural Development Projects](image4) ![Rural Development Projects with Implementation Modes](image2)"}

This indicates that while operating activities generated substantial cash flow, net income and comprehensive income were lower due to factors such as currency translation adjustments and pension expenses. In 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $9,649 million, compared to net income of $7,353 million and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo of $8,133 million. The comprehensive income was higher than net income due to positive adjustments from currency translation and pension benefits. In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $9,415 million, net income was $12,559 million, and comprehensive income attributable to PepsiCo was $10,453 million.

According to the text, Siemens Healthineers uses actuarial valuations that rely on key assumptions such as discount rates, expected compensation increases, and pension progression [2]. These assumptions are crucial as they directly affect the present value of future benefit entitlements, which form the basis of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) [2]. The sensitivity of the DBO to changes in these assumptions is highlighted in the text, indicating that an increase or decrease in the discount rate, for example, can lead to substantial changes in the obligation [1][7].\n\nThe image1 provides a detailed table showing the effects of a half-percentage point change in these assumptions on the defined benefit obligation as of September 30, 2021, and 2020. For instance, a decrease in the discount rate by 0.5% resulted in an increase of €271 million in the DBO for 2021, compared to €266 million in 2020. Similarly, changes in compensation increase and pension progression also had notable impacts, with pension progression showing a significant effect of €158 million for an increase and -€144 million for a decrease in 2021, compared to €158 million and -€135 million in 2020, respectively. This illustrates the sensitivity of the DBO to actuarial assumptions, particularly the discount rate, which is determined by high-quality corporate bond yields [2].\n\nFurthermore, the funded status of the pension plans is affected by these actuarial changes, as well as movements in financial markets [4][8]. The text mentions that adverse developments in plan assets or the DBO are considered significant risks, prompting Siemens Healthineers to implement a liability-driven investment approach to mitigate these risks [8]. This approach involves monitoring risks using Value at Risk (VaR) and adjusting the investment strategy accordingly, which includes the use of derivatives [8].\n\nThe image2 shows the composition of plan assets, which increased from €2,813 million in 2020 to €3,259 million in 2021. This growth could be influenced by changes in actuarial assumptions, as well as market performance.

According to the text, credit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities from the E*TRADE acquisition [5]. Additionally, market risk RWA increased under both approaches mainly due to higher market volatility [6]. These increases in RWA components led to a higher total RWA by the end of 2020.\n\n![The table provides a detailed breakdown of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) for a financial institution as of the end of 2020, showing increases in Credit and Market Risk RWA](image3)\n\nDespite the increase in RWA, the institution maintained a strong TLAC position. The External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased slightly from 49.9% at the end of 2019 to 47.7% at the end of 2020, as shown in the image. However, this percentage remained well above the regulatory minimum of 18.0% and the required ratio of 21.5% [3][5][6][10].\n\n![The table shows External TLAC and Eligible LTD ratios, with External TLAC as a % of RWA decreasing from 49.9% to 47.7%](image5)\n\nThe increase in RWA components such as credit and market risk, driven by market conditions and acquisitions, contributed to a higher total RWA. However, the institution's TLAC was sufficiently robust to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, indicating effective risk management and capital planning.

In the U.S., the revenue growth rate decreased to 0.4% in 2020 from 5.0% in 2019, reflecting a slowdown in performance. This decline was partly due to increased marketing support, such as the free Thank You Meals for first responders and health care workers, which offset some of the positive sales performance [1][2]. Despite this, the U.S. segment maintained a stable revenue base, with franchised revenues decreasing by only 2% and company-operated sales by 4% [3].\n\nIn contrast, the International Operated Markets segment faced a substantial decline, with comparable sales decreasing by 15.0% in 2020, driven by significant drops in France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain [4]. The pandemic led to temporary closures and limited operations, exacerbating revenue declines [3]. Additionally, the segment incurred over $100 million in marketing support and incremental COVID-19 expenses, including employee-related costs, further impacting margins [5]. The total restaurant margins for International Operated Markets decreased, with company-operated margins falling from $1,660 million in 2019 to $1,158 million in 2020, as shown in the bar chart in image1. This decline was more pronounced compared to the U.S., where franchised margins remained relatively stable at $8,519 million in 2020, down slightly from $9,455 million in 2019 [image1].\n\nThe revenue composition also shifted, with the International Operated Markets segment contributing less to total revenues in 2020. The pie charts in image4 illustrate this shift, showing a decrease in the proportion of revenues from International Operated Markets from 54% in 2019 to 50% in 2020, while the U.S. segment's share increased slightly.

According to the text, Wells Fargo sold its Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) business on November 1, 2021, which resulted in a decline in assets under management (AUM) due to the sale. This is reflected in the table from image2, which shows that the balance of WFAM assets under management at the end of 2021 was significantly reduced by $587.1 billion due to the sale, dropping from a beginning balance of $603.0 billion to an end balance of $-1.3 billion. This substantial outflow directly affected the company's financial metrics, particularly in terms of assets managed and related fees.\n\nThe sale of WFAM, as mentioned in text quotes [2], [6], and [9], led to a decrease in investment advisory and other asset-based fees, which were previously earned from managing these assets. This reduction in fees is likely to have influenced the noninterest income reported in the income statement, as seen in image4, where noninterest income increased by 104% from 2020 to 2021, but this may not fully account for the loss of revenue from WFAM. The sale also resulted in net gains of $269 million, which would have been recorded in the financial results, partially offsetting the loss of ongoing fee income.\n\nFurthermore, the sale of WFAM and the Corporate Trust Services business, as noted in text quotes [3] and [10], led to the transfer of associated goodwill to the Corporate segment. This restructuring did not impact the consolidated financial results but affected the composition of the balance sheet, particularly in the assets and liabilities sections. The decline in AUM also ties into the broader changes in the balance sheet, such as the decrease in total deposits mentioned in text quote [1], as managing under the asset cap required actions that likely influenced deposit levels.\n\nIn terms of the balance sheet data, image5 shows that total assets (period-end) decreased modestly in 2021, partially offset by an increase in equity securities related to the affiliated venture capital business.

According to the text, Lovisa has successfully established a portfolio of company-owned stores in multiple international territories, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, with additional franchised stores in the Middle East and Vietnam [4]. This expansion is part of a broader strategy to capitalize on large international markets and explore franchise options, aiming to open new stores in key regions like the UK, France, and the USA [4].\n\nThe company's approach to entering new markets involves thorough assessment and leveraging local networks to secure a portfolio of stores, ensuring a strong operating footprint upon entry [3]. This strategy is supported by a refined global store model that emphasizes optimal store size and location, allowing for quick and cost-effective roll-outs. For instance, Lovisa has a target store size of 50 square meters and a standardized layout, which facilitates rapid setup, typically taking only 14 days to fit out a new store [9]. This efficiency is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the fast fashion jewelry sector, where customer preferences and market conditions can change rapidly [7].\n\nKey achievements include the global rollout of piercing services in stores during FY20, aimed at enhancing customer loyalty [1], and the opening of 47 stores outside of Australia, with specific growth in the UK, France, USA, and through franchise agreements [4].

According to the text, NII for 2020 was $27.6 billion, a decrease of $2.9 billion or 9.5% compared to 2019 [8]. This decrease was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across major currencies, although it was partly offset by an increase in average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by $170.1 billion or 8.8% [8]. The reduction in NII contributed to a decline in total operating income, as seen in the summary consolidated income statement [image5], which shows a decrease in net interest income from the previous year.\n\nInterest expense in 2020 was $14.178 billion for the year, down $2.9 billion year-on-year, mainly driven by lower market interest rates, despite growth in interest-bearing customer accounts by $142.9 billion [6]. This reduction in interest expense helped mitigate some of the negative impact on NII, but the overall decrease in NII still led to a lower net operating income before credit provisions [image5].\n\nThe net interest margin (NIM) for 2020 was 1.32%, 26 basis points lower than in 2019, reflecting the broader decline in interest rates [1]. The decrease in NIM, combined with the lower NII, reduced the organization's profitability. Additionally, the adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences and the impact of significant items further affected the NIM and NII [1][5].\n\nThe financial metrics over the years, as shown in image1, indicate a decline in key profitability ratios such as return on average ordinary shareholders' equity from 3.6% in 2019 to 2.3% in 2020, and a drop in basic earnings per share from $0.30 to $0.19, highlighting the reduced profitability. The lack of dividends in 2020 compared to previous years also reflects the impact on overall financial performance.\n\nIn summary, the decline in NII and the reduction in interest expense, while partially offsetting each other, resulted in a lower net operating income and reduced overall profitability for the organization in 2020.

Net investment income decreased by 5.0% to $4,807 million in 2021 from $5,039 million in 2020 [2], primarily due to a significant decline in interest and other investment income, which fell 44.4% to $589 million in 2021 from $1,059 million in 2020. This decline was driven by lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as short-term interest rates remained low throughout 2021 [2]. Despite this, dividend income increased by 3.5% to $5,060 million in 2021 from $4,890 million in 2020, partly offsetting the drop in interest income [9]. The effective income tax rate also decreased slightly to 14.9% in 2021 from 15.3% in 2020, contributing to the net investment income figure [image2].\n\nIn contrast, railroad operating earnings showed a positive trend. Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% to $22,513 million in 2021 from $20,181 million in 2020, driven by a 6.9% increase in volume and a 3.5% rise in average revenue per car/unit due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and business mix changes [7]. This recovery was partly due to the easing of pandemic-related disruptions, although global supply chain issues continued to pose challenges [7]. Operating expenses rose 10.2% to $13.7 billion in 2021, but the expense-to-revenue ratio improved to 60.9% from 61.6% in 2020, reflecting productivity gains that offset higher fuel prices and volumes [4].

According to the financial data, the number of systemwide restaurants increased from 37,855 in 2018 to 39,198 in 2020. This growth is primarily driven by an increase in franchised restaurants, which rose from 35,085 in 2018 to 36,521 in 2020, representing 93% of the total systemwide restaurants in 2020. The company-operated restaurants slightly decreased from 2,770 in 2018 to 2,677 in 2020 [9]. \n\nRegarding shareholders' equity, the table in image5 provides a summary of changes over the three-year period.

This is supported by image4, which shows that the operating lease ROU assets increased from $764 million in 2019 to $942 million in 2020. Similarly, the total operating lease liabilities rose from $797 million in 2019 to $974 million in 2020. The weighted average remaining lease term remained constant at 7 years, but the weighted average discount rate decreased slightly from 3.1% to 2.8%. These changes reflect the company's expanded lease commitments and the impact of new accounting standards on its balance sheet, leading to higher reported liabilities and assets related to leases.\n\nRegarding inventories, image1 provides a detailed breakdown. The total inventory increased from $1,628 million in 2019 to $2,292 million in 2020. This growth is evident across all categories: finished goods rose from $833 million to $1,232 million, work in process from $285 million to $369 million, and raw materials from $510 million to $691 million. The text in [9] explains that the increase in cost of sales was partly due to higher sales volumes and acquisition-related charges, particularly from the Cytiva Acquisition, which likely contributed to the inventory buildup. Additionally, the text in [7] notes that the liquidation of LIFO inventory did not significantly impact results, suggesting that inventory management strategies remained consistent despite the increase in inventory levels.\n\nThese changes in lease assets and inventories reflect on the financial statements by increasing both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The higher lease liabilities and ROU assets indicate greater future cash outflows for lease payments, while the increased inventory levels suggest higher investment in production and potential future sales.

According to the data, the net deferred tax asset increased from $119 million in 2019 to $253 million in 2020. This substantial increase can be attributed to several factors:\n\nFirstly, the deferred tax assets saw a notable rise from $197 million in 2019 to $343 million in 2020. This growth is primarily due to the reduction in valuation allowances, which decreased by $1 million in 2020 [8]. Additionally, the deferred tax liabilities decreased from $78 million in 2019 to $90 million in 2020, further contributing to the net increase. The reduction in liabilities is partly explained by the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, which resulted in a $249 million tax benefit [3]. This settlement not only reduced the liabilities but also reversed accrued interest of $46 million, which was included in operating income and expenses (OI&E) [3].\n\nMoreover, the table in image4 highlights the impact of reductions for tax positions of prior years, which amounted to a $249 million tax benefit in 2020. This reduction significantly lowered the balance of uncertain tax positions from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020, indicating a resolution of previously uncertain tax positions [4].

The overall cost of revenues rose from 16,761 million RMB in 2019 to 21,840 million RMB in 2021, indicating a growing operational scale and possibly increased investment in supporting services and infrastructure. ![Cost of revenues increased significantly from 2019 to 2021, with a notable rise in other costs](image2)\n\nTurning to operating expenses, the breakdown reveals shifts in the allocation between selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. In 2019, selling and marketing expenses accounted for 43.0% of total operating expenses, while general and administrative expenses made up 57.0%. By 2021, selling and marketing expenses decreased to 40.0%, and general and administrative expenses increased to 60.0%. This suggests a strategic reallocation towards administrative and R&D activities, aligning with the text's mention of continuous investment in research and development [3]. The total operating expenses grew from 4,744 million RMB in 2019 to 6,687 million RMB in 2021, reflecting expanded operations and increased investment in both marketing and administrative functions. ![General and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total operating expenses from "}

The image quotes, particularly image5, provide a detailed table showing these prices for 2020 and 2019, which can be compared to infer changes from 2018.\n\nFor crude oil, the prices are listed under the \"Consolidated Subsidiaries\" section in image5, with separate columns for each region and the years 2020 and 2019. Similarly, NGL prices are also detailed in the same section. While the exact figures for 2018 are not directly visible in the provided images, the text mentions that the table in section 3.A includes volumes used for these computations, suggesting a consistent method of calculation across years [4]. The data in image5 shows variations in prices across regions, indicating regional differences in market conditions and production costs.\n\nFor instance, the table in image5 highlights that the United States and Canada/Other Americas might have different price trends compared to Europe or Asia, reflecting local economic factors and production efficiencies. The lack of headers in image1 makes it challenging to directly correlate the numbers with specific years or regions, but the structured layout suggests a similar format to image5, supporting the idea of consistent data presentation.\n\nIn summary, the average production prices for crude oil and NGL likely varied by region from 2018 to 2020, influenced by market dynamics and regional production costs, as detailed in the tables provided in image5 and supported by the text's explanation of calculation methods [4][6].\n\n**Answer:** The average production prices for crude oil and NGL varied across regions from 2018 to 2020, influenced by regional market conditions and production costs, as detailed in the tables for 2019 and 2020 in image5."}

According to the data, noncurrent assets increased by $3,039 million (adjusted for currency, $829 million) in 2020, primarily driven by the growth in client and commercial financing receivables [4]. This increase is reflected in the table from image2, which shows noncurrent assets rising from $113,767 million in 2019 to $116,806 million in 2020. The growth in assets suggests an expansion in IBM's financing activities, particularly in supporting external and internal client assets, which aligns with the company's strategy to leverage stable revenue streams [3].\n\nHowever, the increase in noncurrent assets was accompanied by a decrease in long-term debt, which remained relatively stable at $54,355 million in 2020 compared to $54,102 million in 2019, as seen in image2. This stability in long-term debt, despite the asset growth, indicates effective management of financing obligations. The debt-to-equity ratio for Global Financing remained at 9 to 1, suggesting a balanced approach to financing [5].\n\nThe cash flow data from image3 provides further context. Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9,721 million in 2020, a significant shift from a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019. This change was driven by factors such as the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations and increased cash used for marketable securities [8][10]. The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash improved from a negative $3,290 million in 2019 to a positive $5,361 million in 2020, indicating better liquidity management.\n\nEquity also saw a decrease of $258 million in 2020, primarily due to dividends and foreign currency adjustments, partially offset by net income and common stock increases [7]. The return on equity remained steady at 25.8% for both years, as shown in image1, suggesting consistent profitability relative to equity levels.\n\nOverall, the increase in noncurrent assets and stable long-term debt, combined with improved cash flow and maintained return on equity"}

This suggests a lower mix of customer balances at promotional rates and a reduction in net credit losses, likely due to government stimulus and payment deferrals [6]. Additionally, new credit card accounts dropped significantly from 4,320 thousand in 2019 to 2,505 thousand in 2020, indicating a decline in consumer demand for new credit [2]. Credit card purchase volumes also fell from $277.852 billion in 2019 to $251.599 billion in 2020, primarily due to reduced spending, especially in travel and entertainment sectors [6]. However, debit card purchase volumes increased from $360.672 billion in 2019 to $384.503 billion in 2020, suggesting a shift towards more essential spending as businesses reopened [6]. \n\nIn terms of home equity, first mortgage loan originations in Consumer Banking decreased by $6.0 billion, and for the total Corporation by $3.4 billion, driven by a decline in nonconforming applications [1]. Home equity production in Consumer Banking and the total Corporation also decreased by $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, primarily due to fewer applications [5]. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased by $5.9 billion, mainly because paydowns outpaced new originations and draws on existing lines [9]. This reduction in home equity activity could indicate a cautious approach to borrowing among consumers, possibly due to economic uncertainty.\n\nThese changes collectively suggest that consumers were more conservative in their borrowing and spending habits in 2020, with a preference for essential spending and a reduction in discretionary credit use, likely influenced by the pandemic's financial impacts.\n\n![The table presents financial data for 2020 and 2019, showing figures in millions of dollars, with percentage changes between the two years.](image1)\n"}

For coal, the report highlights that lower prices and volumes contributed to a decrease in underlying EBITDA by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million in FY2021 [2]. Specifically, lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, reduced EBITDA by US$0.7 billion, while lower volumes decreased it by US$168 million. Additionally, controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million due to higher maintenance costs and stripping volumes, though this was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives [2]. The average realised sales price for metallurgical coal dropped from US$130.97 per tonne in FY2020 to US$106.64 in FY2021, and for thermal coal, it slightly increased from US$57.10 to US$58.42 per tonne [image2]. This price volatility directly affects revenue and profitability, as seen in the financial figures where revenue decreased from US$6,242 million in 2020 to US$5,154 million in 2021 [image2].\n\nFor nickel, the report notes that underlying EBITDA increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, driven by higher prices and volumes, as well as lower maintenance and contractor costs [1]. However, this was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs due to the stronger nickel price. The average realised sales price for nickel rose from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to US$16,250 in FY2021, benefiting from strong demand and supply disruptions [10]. The financial impact of a US$1 per ton increase in the nickel price is minimal, affecting profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by only US$1 million each [image1], but the overall price increase still contributed positively to EBITDA.\n\nThe key drivers behind these impacts include market demand fluctuations, production costs, and exchange rate movements. For coal, the decrease in prices and volumes, coupled with increased maintenance costs, were significant factors. For nickel, higher prices and volumes were the primary drivers, despite currency and purchase cost challenges. The report emphasizes that commodity price fluctuations are a key driver of value,"}

This increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables [1][3]. The year-to-year rise in net cash from operating activities is also reflected in the table from image1, which shows a jump from $14.8 billion in 2019 to $18.2 billion in 2020. Additionally, the company's cash reserves saw a substantial boost, with cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities increasing to $14.3 billion at the end of 2020, up from $9.0 billion in 2019 [7][image2]. This growth in cash reserves is attributed to strategic actions taken to enhance liquidity and optimize the capital structure, including reducing external debt needs and focusing on the Global Financing portfolio [7]. The table in image2 further illustrates this increase, highlighting the rise in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term marketable securities from $9.0 billion in 2019 to $14.3 billion in 2020.

This decline was attributed to several factors, including lower interest rates, reduced loan balances due to soft demand, elevated prepayments, refinancing activity, the sale of the student loan portfolio, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness, and higher securities premium amortization, partially offset by lower costs and balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt [3]. Additionally, net interest income in 2021 included $518 million from PPP loans and $1.1 billion from loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools [3].\n\nIn contrast, noninterest income increased substantially from $4,916 million in 2020 to $10,036 million in 2021, a rise of $5,120 million, or 104% [image1]. This increase was driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, despite lower lease income due to a $268 million impairment of rail cars used for coal transportation [7]. The impairment charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 as an offset to lease income, reflecting weakening demand for these rail cars [5].\n\nThe changes in net interest and noninterest income resulted in total revenue increasing from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021, a growth of $3,138 million, or 59% [image1].

When there is an increase in waiting customers, the system utilizes an operation management center called AMMS to dispatch additional units in real-time. This ensures that the fleet can meet the heightened demand efficiently. The system also works to maintain consistency in operation intervals, preventing variations that could lead to delays or inefficiencies. Features such as emergency remote vehicle stop/restart, immediate deployment of replacement vehicles, and automatic redirection to a garage in case of abnormalities further enhance the system's flexibility and reliability. This approach aligns with Toyota's commitment to providing effective, efficient, and accurate operation of its vehicles, as seen in the deployment of the e-Palette during the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020, where the system successfully managed a fleet serving 49,000 athletes, staff, and volunteers [3].

In 2020, the company recognized $25 million of restructuring charges primarily for severance and benefit costs associated with the Embedded Processing business [2]. This is a significant shift from 2019, where there was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of the manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland [3]. The restructuring charges in 2020 were a charge of $24 million due to the Embedded Processing action, contrasting with the credit in 2019 [3].\n\nLooking at the image quotes, image3 provides a detailed breakdown of restructuring activities over the years. In 2020, the company recorded restructuring charges of $25 million, with $8 million in payments made by the end of the year, resulting in a balance of $18 million [image3]. This is a stark contrast to 2019, where the restructuring charges were negative $15 million (indicating a credit), and the balance was zero by year-end [image3]. The negative restructuring charges in 2019 align with the text quote indicating a credit from the sale of the manufacturing facility [3].\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that restructuring accrual balances are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment [6]. This suggests that the restructuring charges in 2020 were more substantial and ongoing compared to the one-time credit in 2019.\n\nIn summary, the major change from 2019 to 2020 was the shift from a $36 million credit due to the sale of a facility to a $25 million charge for severance and benefits, reflecting a significant increase in restructuring expenses and a change in the nature of restructuring activities.\n\n![Restructuring charges and credits from 2018 to 2020](image3)"}

According to the financial data, total liabilities rose from $26,199 million in 2019 to $28,418 million in 2020, an increase of $2,219 million. This change is reflected in both current and non-current liabilities.\n\nIn terms of current liabilities, accounts payable increased due to the ramp-up in production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai, as noted in the text [1]. This increase was partially offset by a smaller rise in deferred revenue, primarily from the delivery of regulatory credits in 2020. Additionally, the introduction of Model 3 and Model Y direct leasing led to a larger increase in operating lease vehicles, contributing to the growth in current liabilities. The text also mentions a larger increase in accounts receivables for government rebates, which further impacted the current liabilities [1].\n\nNon-current liabilities saw an increase in debt and finance leases, net of the current portion, as well as deferred revenue, net of the current portion. The table in image4 provides a detailed breakdown of these changes, showing that both current and non-current liabilities contributed to the overall rise in total liabilities. The increase in operating lease vehicles and the associated financing obligations, as described in the text [9], also played a significant role in the growth of non-current liabilities.\n\nFurthermore, the balance sheet in image4 highlights the specific figures for total liabilities, confirming the increase from $26,199 million to $28,418 million. This comprehensive view of the balance sheet components illustrates the various elements driving the change in Tesla's liability structure over the year.\n\nIn summary, Tesla's total liabilities increased by $2,219 million from 2019 to 2020, driven by higher accounts payable, operating lease vehicles, and deferred revenue, as well as increased debt and finance leases.

According to the text, the company repurchased and retired 5.4 million shares of common stock for $703 million since September 26, 2021, under its stock repurchase programs [2][4][10]. Additionally, the company announced a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase authorization on October 12, 2021, in addition to the remaining $0.9 billion under the previous program, indicating an ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders [2][4][10]. \n\nIn terms of cash flow, the net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities, which included $1.6 billion of cash outflows related to advance payments to suppliers under multi-year capacity commitments, and proceeds from marketable securities and stock issuance, partially offset by $3.4 billion in payments to repurchase shares and $3.0 billion in cash dividends paid [9]. This suggests a substantial use of cash for both repurchases and dividends.\n\nThe image data provides further insights. The table in image1 shows that cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities increased by $1,165 million from 2020 to 2021, indicating a net positive cash position despite significant outflows for repurchases and dividends. Image2 highlights the stock repurchase and dividend activities, showing that the company repurchased $3,366 million worth of stock in 2021 compared to $2,450 million in 2020, and paid $3,008 million in dividends in 2021 compared to $2,882 million in 2020. This indicates an increase in both stock repurchases and dividend payments in 2021.\n\nIn summary, the company increased its stock repurchase activity and dividend payments in 2021 compared to 2020, while still maintaining a net increase in cash and marketable securities, reflecting a strategic approach to capital management.\n\n![Cash and marketable securities increased by $1,165 million](image1)  \n![Stock repurchases and dividends increased in 2021](image2)  \n\nThe company's cash and stock repurchase activities increased from 2020 to 20"}

In 2020, expenditures further decreased to $1,641 million, with $535 million on new restaurants, $1,060 million on existing restaurants, and $46 million on other expenditures. This reduction in capital expenditures was primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by new restaurant openings in 2019 and a significant decrease in 2020 due to COVID-19 [3].\n\nRegarding shareholder returns, McDonald's returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders in 2020, primarily through dividends, which was a decrease from the $8.5 billion returned in 2019 and $8.5 billion in 2018 [2].

This is supported by the image showing that interest expense was ($64.2) million in fiscal 2015, compared to ($59.7) million in fiscal 2014, indicating an 8% increase [image4]. The increase in interest expense contributed to a higher net interest expense, which negatively impacted total non-operating income (expense). The image also shows that total non-operating income (expense), net, improved from ($51.3) million in fiscal 2014 to ($29.3) million in fiscal 2015, a 43% decrease [image4]. This improvement was driven by a significant increase in interest and other income (expense), net, which rose from $7.3 million in fiscal 2014 to $33.9 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to gains on the sale of property assets and higher investment income [2]. Despite the rise in interest expense, the substantial increase in other income led to an overall reduction in total non-operating expenses.\n\nIn summary, the net interest expense increased due to higher debt, but the overall non-operating income (expense) improved significantly due to other income gains. \n\nThe net interest expense increased by 8% from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015, but total non-operating income (expense) decreased by 43% due to higher other income."}

The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2022 and 2021 included deferred income tax assets of $445 million and $444 million, respectively, and deferred income tax liabilities of $724 million and $754 million, respectively [10]. The valuation allowance adjustment impacts the net deferred tax assets, reducing them by the amount of the allowance.

The total shipment volume in the region fell by 11.6% [image4]. The decline in cigarette sales was primarily due to lower volumes in Argentina and Mexico, influenced by factors such as price increases, pandemic-related consumption patterns, and market share losses to ultra-low-price brands [5][8][9]. Additionally, the deconsolidation of RBH negatively impacted both regions [7][9].\n\nOperating income in Latin America & Canada saw a significant increase of over 100%, largely due to favorable items like the Brazil indirect tax credit and reduced costs, despite the volume decline [4][7]. In contrast, net revenues decreased by 15.5% due to unfavorable volume/mix and the RBH deconsolidation, though this was partly offset by higher pricing [9][3].\n\nOverall, the shift towards heated tobacco units in both regions was notable, driven by consumer preferences and market dynamics, while cigarette sales faced challenges from price increases, pandemic impacts, and competitive pressures. \n\n**Answer:** Cigarette sales declined in both regions due to price increases, pandemic impacts, and market competition, while heated tobacco units saw growth, particularly in Latin America & Canada, driven by increased shipments in Brazil."}

Additionally, discount revenue, as the largest revenue line, grew by 26 percent year-over-year, largely due to increased Card Member spending [2]. The recovery in worldwide network volumes also played a crucial role, with a 24 percent increase compared to the prior year, helping to reach 2019 levels [5]. This growth was particularly notable in the U.S., where network volumes increased by 27 percent, and non-U.S. volumes rose by 17 percent [5]. The increase in the average discount rate, primarily due to a change in spending mix with higher T&E-related volumes, further contributed to the revenue growth, with the rate rising from 2.28 percent in 2020 to 2.30 percent in 2021 [7].\n\n![The table shows a 24% increase in worldwide network volumes from 2020 to 2021, with significant growth in both U.S. and non-U.S. regions](image2)\n\nFurthermore, the recovery in travel and entertainment (T&E) spending was a key driver, with global T&E spend growing 59 percent year-over-year, reaching 82 percent of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter [6].

Specifically, Shane's fixed base remuneration remains unchanged at $1,500,000, with the addition of a long-term incentive (LTI) grant [6]. This structure emphasizes performance-based rewards, as evidenced by the tiered performance targets linked to EBIT and EPS growth, where significant portions of his remuneration are contingent on achieving specific growth thresholds [10]. For instance, his at-risk remuneration is substantial, with 67% tied to performance outcomes, as illustrated in the table [image1].\n\nIn contrast, Chris Lauder's remuneration leans more heavily towards fixed components, with 67% of his total remuneration being fixed and only 33% at risk [image1]. This suggests a more stable compensation package, potentially reflecting his role as Chief Financial Officer, which may require a different balance of fixed and variable pay compared to the Managing Director's role. The performance-based incentives for both executives are structured around challenging hurdles, such as EBIT and EPS growth targets, which are detailed in the tables [image2, image3, image4, image5].

Additionally, higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem added $1.0 billion, and increased sales volumes contributed $470 million. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating expenses, which rose by $150 million [10]. \n\nThe financial data from the tables further supports this trend.

The exercisable percentage is contingent on achieving certain compound annual growth rates in EBIT over the performance period. \n\nFor example, if the EBIT growth is less than the specified threshold, no incentives are exercisable [3][10]. As the growth rate increases, so does the percentage of incentives that can be exercised. Specifically, at 17.5% compound growth, 40% of the incentives are awarded, at 20% compound growth, 60% are awarded, at 22.5% compound growth, 80% are awarded, and at 25% compound growth, 100% of the incentives are awarded [4][10]. This structure aligns with the information in image4, which shows a similar tiered approach: 0% exercisable for growth below the threshold, 40% at 17.5%, 60% at 20%, 80% at 22.5%, and 100% at 25% compound growth. \n\nAdditionally, image3 provides another perspective on EBIT growth thresholds, indicating that 10% is exercisable at 24% growth, 20% at 25%, and 100% at 26% growth. This suggests that different performance periods or roles may have varying thresholds, but the overall principle remains consistent: higher EBIT growth leads to a greater percentage of incentives being exercisable. \n\nIn summary, EBIT growth directly impacts the exercisable percentage of incentives, with higher growth rates unlocking a larger portion of the potential rewards. The exact thresholds and corresponding percentages are outlined in the company's performance conditions, ensuring that incentives are aligned with achieving specific financial targets.\n\n**Answer**: EBIT growth affects the exercisable percentage of incentives by unlocking a higher percentage as growth targets are met, with specific thresholds outlined in the company's performance conditions. For example, 40% is exercisable at 17.5% growth, 60% at 20%, 80% at 22.5%, and 100%"}

In 2020, the company reported a net loss of $5,561 million, which turned into a net income of $15,689 million in 2021 [5]. This substantial increase was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, improved downstream margins, and the absence of impairments and write-offs that were present in 2020 [4][6][8][9]. Specifically, U.S. income before tax increased by $15.37 billion, moving from a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020 to income of $9.67 billion in 2021, largely due to higher upstream and downstream margins and the lack of 2020 impairments [4]. International upstream earnings also improved dramatically, from a loss of $825 million in 2020 to earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, influenced by higher realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [6]. Similarly, U.S. upstream earnings rose from a loss of $1.6 billion to $7.3 billion, benefiting from higher realizations and asset sales gains [9].\n\nComprehensive income followed a similar trend, with a significant positive shift. In 2021, comprehensive income was $17,412 million, compared to a loss in 2020 [image4]. This improvement was partly due to positive other comprehensive gains, which were negative in previous years, and a favorable currency translation adjustment [image4]. The financial activities contributing to these changes included increased operational cash flows, as seen in the consolidated cash flow statement where net cash provided by operating activities rose to $29,187 million in 2021 from $10,577 million in 2020 [image2]. Additionally, the company's equity structure showed growth, with retained earnings reflecting the improved net income and dividends paid [image1]. The balance sheet also indicated a stable asset base with adjustments in liabilities and equity, supporting the financial turnaround [image3].\n\nOverall, Chevron's financial performance in 2021 was marked by a strong recovery in net income and comprehensive income, driven by operational improvements, favorable market conditions, and effective financial management.\n\n![Detailed equity changes"}

The substantial increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the payment of dividends, including a special dividend of $10.00 per share in 2021, which aggregated approximately $4,430 million [10]. Additionally, the company made payments to its former joint-venture partner and repurchased common stock, contributing to the higher cash used in financing activities in 2021 [9].

However, the number of employees who actually availed parental leave is higher for males (2,023) than for females (1,025). This disparity could suggest varying levels of awareness, cultural acceptance, or practical barriers to taking leave between genders. \n\nDespite the higher entitlement for males, the return rates after availing leave are comparable, with 94% of females and 96% of males returning to work. However, the long-term employment rates after returning are notably lower for both genders, with only 6% of females and 4% of males still employed after 12 months. This could indicate challenges in balancing work and family life post-leave, which might disproportionately affect women due to societal expectations or workplace policies.\n\nHDFC Bank's commitment to gender diversity is evident in their initiatives aimed at increasing female representation and support, such as the Careers 2.0 program [6] and the Shrishti program [10], which focus on retaining and advancing women in leadership roles. The bank also emphasizes equal remuneration and unconscious bias training [9], aiming to create an inclusive environment. However, the data from image1 suggests that despite these efforts, there may still be gaps in the utilization of parental leave benefits, particularly among female employees, which could impact gender diversity outcomes. The bank's policies on parental leave and support for work-life balance, as described in [10], are crucial in addressing these disparities and fostering a truly inclusive workplace culture. \n\nIn conclusion, while HDFC Bank has robust policies to promote gender diversity, the data indicates a need for further efforts to ensure equitable access and utilization of parental leave, reflecting ongoing challenges in achieving gender parity in the workplace."}

This indicates a higher net interest expense, primarily due to higher U.S. average debt balances and borrowing costs, as noted in text quote [4]. Additionally, the early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in 2017, which was not repeated in 2018, contributed to the year-on-year decrease in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017, but the overall trend from 2016 to 2018 still shows an increase in net interest expense.\n\nMoreover, the pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) shifted from a benefit of $(196) million in 2016 to a benefit of $(73) million in 2018. This change reflects the year-on-year increases in non-service costs, primarily due to increased net actuarial amortization expense, as mentioned in text quote [2].

This growth was driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization across all applications and inter-segment sales [5]. The increase in sales volume was particularly notable in Construction Industries, which saw a 27% rise to $5,736 million, and Resource Industries, which grew by 27% to $2,762 million [3][6]. Energy & Transportation also contributed with a 19% increase in sales to $5,728 million [5]. These increases were partly due to higher end-user demand and changes in dealer inventories, with dealers decreasing inventories more in 2020 than in 2021 [2][8].\n\nOperating profit for the segment increased to $1,611 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $1,380 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 17% increase [1][4][7]. This improvement was driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, which more than offset higher manufacturing costs and SG&A/R&D expenses [1][4][9]. Specifically, Construction Industries' profit rose by 25% to $788 million, and Resource Industries' profit increased by 12% to $305 million [4][9]. Despite higher manufacturing costs, primarily due to increased variable labor and material expenses, the overall profit benefited from the substantial sales growth [4][9].\n\nThe image data further illustrates these trends. The consolidated sales and revenues chart shows a $2,527 million increase, with significant contributions from Construction and Resource Industries [image2].

Additionally, the cash provided by operations surged to $6,657 million in 2021, up from $2,485 million in 2020, further indicating improved operational performance [4]. The financial data in the cash flow statement ![Cash flow statement showing financial data for operations, investing, and financing activities](image1) and the comprehensive income table ![Net income and comprehensive income over three fiscal years](image3) support these trends, highlighting the company's ability to recover and grow despite the challenges faced in 2020.

This increase suggests that IBM continued to invest in long-term assets, which could be indicative of strategic growth initiatives or capital expenditures aimed at enhancing operational capacity or expanding business capabilities [2][10].\n\nLong-term debt saw a slight increase to $54,355 million in 2020 from $54,102 million in 2019, as shown in the image data. However, this is somewhat misleading when considering the broader context. Text quotes indicate that total debt actually decreased by $1,361 million (adjusted for currency, $2,859 million) due to early retirements and debt maturities totaling $11,267 million, offset by new issuances of $8,982 million [2]. This reduction in total debt aligns with IBM's strategy to deleverage, as mentioned in the text, which supports maintaining a strong liquidity position and financial flexibility [1][2]. The slight increase in long-term debt in the image might reflect specific strategic borrowings or refinancing activities, but overall, the company is actively managing its debt levels.\n\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased by $1,621 million (adjusted for currency, $251 million) to $41,020 million in 2020 from $39,398 million in 2019. This increase could be attributed to various factors, such as higher obligations or provisions related to long-term contracts or commitments. The text mentions that this increase was primarily driven by specific factors, though the exact nature isn't detailed [6]. This growth in noncurrent liabilities might indicate an expansion in operational activities or increased commitments, which could be part of IBM's strategic focus on sustaining or growing its business segments.\n\nThe Global Financing segment's debt decreased significantly, from $24,727 million in 2019 to $21,"}

This change can be attributed to several factors highlighted in the financial data. In 2020, the company faced a significant increase in the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which added $626 million to the provision, compared to $552 million in 2018. Additionally, the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate rose from $3,348 million in 2018 to $4,356 million in 2020, reflecting higher taxable income. The state income taxes, net of federal benefit, also increased from $168 million in 2018 to $315 million in 2020. However, there were reductions in certain areas, such as the foreign rate differential, which decreased from a negative $203 million in 2018 to $164 million in 2020, and other adjustments, which saw a decrease from $259 million in 2018 to $164 million in 2020. The overall effective tax rate increased from 22.3% in 2018 to 24.0% in 2020, primarily due to the reinstatement of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2020 after a moratorium in 2019. The company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits also grew, reaching $1.0 billion by the end of 2020, which could affect future tax rates if recognized. These changes collectively contributed to the notable increase in the provision for income taxes over the three-year period. \n\n![The table shows the provision for income taxes increased from 2018 to 2020](image1)"}

This substantial rise was primarily driven by the payout for the acquisition of Varian, which was a major capital expenditure. Additionally, there was an increase of €117 million due to additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, mainly for capacity expansions.

ENBREL experienced a decline in sales in 2020, with a 4% decrease to $4,996 million from $5,226 million in 2019. This decline was driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory [4]. Additionally, ENBREL has been losing market share consistently, and the COVID-19 pandemic further reduced the growth rate of the rheumatology market, compounding the decline [4]. The table in image4 highlights this trend, showing a 4% decrease in total ENBREL sales in 2020 compared to 2019, with notable drops in both the U.S. and Canada.

The average impact rose from $20 million to $78 million, the high impact from $24 million to $136 million, and the low impact remained stable at $18 million. This increase is primarily due to heightened volatility in the first quarter of 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. For interest rates, the year-end impact decreased from $301 million in 2019 to $180 million in 2020, but the average impact surged from $247 million to $445 million, the high impact from $346 million to $1,146 million, and the low impact remained at $180 million.

This substantial rise was primarily driven by several key factors. Firstly, the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard at the beginning of 2020 led to an increase in the allowance for credit losses by $124 million, particularly affecting employee loans [5]. Additionally, the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment was notably higher in 2020, reflecting the economic impact of COVID-19, which influenced asset quality trends and sector risks [8]. The provision was primarily due to actual and forecasted changes in these trends, as well as uncertainties in the outlook for sectors like Commercial real estate and Corporate loans. Despite gross charge-offs of $105 million and recoveries of $8 million, the net charge-offs amounted to $97 million, which was offset by a significant provision of $762 million and other adjustments of $17 million [4][8]. The increase in ACL was also influenced by higher volume-related expenses and integration-related costs from the E\\*TRADE acquisition, as well as increased information processing and communications expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses [1][7]. The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitment losses rose, with charge-offs mainly related to Commercial real estate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities segment [8]. The table in image4 illustrates these changes, showing the starting balance, effects of CECL adoption, charge-offs, recoveries, provisions, and other adjustments leading to the ending balance of $1,231 million, with $835 million allocated to loans and $396 million to lending commitments.

This includes not only their own operations but also their financing activities and supply chain. They have already achieved carbon neutrality in their own footprint and have reduced energy use by 40% and location-based GHG emissions by 50% [2]. Additionally, they have sourced renewable energy to power their facilities and purchased carbon offsets for unavoidable emissions, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to decarbonization.\n\nIn terms of air pollution, Bank of America reports on their emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter, with specific figures for 2019 [image3].

The impact of these emissions on society is estimated at $146,000, based on social cost factors from the World Resources Institute’s assessment tool [image3]. This quantification underscores the tangible effects of their operations on air quality and public health.\n\nRegarding GHG emissions, the bank provides detailed metrics on their emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3, including categories like purchased goods, capital goods, and employee commuting [image1].

This growth can be attributed to several factors, including net earnings and other comprehensive income components.\n\nIn 2018, the company reported a comprehensive income of $10,865 million, which was primarily driven by net earnings of $12,382 million. However, other comprehensive income was negative, largely due to foreign currency translation losses of $1,242 million and unrealized losses on investment securities of $227 million [5]. These losses were partially offset by reclassification adjustments for net realized gains [5].\n\nBy 2019, comprehensive income increased to $14,821 million, with net earnings rising to $14,239 million. The improvement was also supported by positive other comprehensive income of $582 million, mainly from gross unrealized gains on investment securities of $933 million, despite foreign currency translation losses of $271 million [5].\n\nIn 2020, comprehensive income further increased to $15,533 million, with net earnings reaching $15,769 million. However, other comprehensive income was negative at $236 million, primarily due to significant foreign currency translation losses of $983 million, which outweighed gross unrealized gains on investment securities of $805 million [5]. The reclassification adjustment for net realized gains was also negative, contributing to the overall decrease in other comprehensive income [5].\n\nThe fluctuations in other comprehensive income were largely influenced by foreign currency translation losses and investment securities performance. Despite these challenges, the strong growth in net earnings drove the overall increase in comprehensive income over the three years.

The net cash from operating activities in 2020 was £12,345,000, compared to £15,678,000 in 2019 [image2]. This indicates that the net cash from operating activities was lower in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nAdditionally, the financial statement highlights a significant increase in non-current assets, particularly due to the recognition of right-of-use assets under AASB 16, which contributed to the total assets growing from £99,215,000 in 2019 to £260,020,000 in 2020 [image1].

According to the text, the total gross margin percentage decreased by 65 basis points compared to 2021, and excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, it was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points [5]. This decline was primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, particularly in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and a 19 basis-point decrease due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Additionally, increased 2% rewards negatively impacted gross margin by one basis point [5]. However, warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly gasoline, positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, partially offset by e-commerce [5]. The cessation of incremental wages related to COVID-19 positively impacted gross margin by five basis points, while a one-time charge for additional paid time off had a negative impact [5].

For the Chairman of the Board of Directors, bonuses are awarded in the form of shares blocked for ten years, as seen in the table referenced in section 4.3 [8]. This aligns with image4, which shows that the Board of Directors (specifically the Chairman) receives a bonus in blocked non-voting equity securities/shares for 10 years, while the Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) members receive their bonuses in cash [image4]. \n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that the Remuneration Committee decides on the form of bonuses, which can include cash payments and/or blocked non-voting equity securities and/or shares [9]. This decision-making process is consistent with the structured approach depicted in image4, where the Chairman's bonus is tied to long-term equity, whereas the CEC's bonus is in cash. The distinction in bonus structure reflects the different roles and responsibilities, with the Board's compensation emphasizing long-term alignment with company performance through equity, while the CEC's cash bonuses may provide more immediate incentives tied to annual performance metrics.\n\nIn summary, the Board of Directors receives bonuses in the form of blocked shares, while the Corporate Executive Committee receives cash bonuses.

This adjustment reflects the removal of non-recurring or non-core items, such as amortization and restructuring charges, which are not part of the ongoing operational costs. \n\nIn contrast, for 2020, the IFRS results for Cost of Goods Sold were -$5,252 million, with adjustments for amortization ($366 million), impairments ($127 million), acquisition/divestment items ($22 million), and other items ($128 million), leading to a core result of -$4,609 million. The adjustments in 2020 were also aimed at isolating core operational performance by removing non-recurring expenses.\n\nThe key difference lies in the magnitude of the adjustments. In 2021, the adjustments were larger, particularly due to the amortization of intangible assets and other items, which had a more substantial impact on reducing the Cost of Goods Sold and thereby increasing the core gross profit. This indicates that the company faced higher non-recurring costs in 2021, which were adjusted out to present a clearer picture of core profitability.\n\n![Adjustments to Cost of Goods Sold in 2021](image3) highlights the significant impact of amortization and other items on the core results, whereas ![Adjustments to Cost of Goods Sold in 2020](image2) shows a smaller adjustment scale.

Specifically, the table in image4 highlights the adjustments made to arrive at the net income, including significant reductions for amortization and depreciation, transaction costs, and severance charges, alongside gains from divestments [4][7].\n\nThe adjusted basic earnings per share rose by 26% to €2.03, aligning with the company's outlook and fulfilling their target corridor [4][5].

This area is highlighted due to the complexity involved in managing rebates, discounts, and allowances, especially within the competitive US healthcare environment where pricing pressures and discounting trends are significant [7]. The estimates for these sales deductions are based on contractual obligations and historical experience, requiring significant judgment as not all conditions are known at the time of sale, such as total sales volume to a given customer [4][6]. Management must use reasonable estimates and judgments to account for these obligations, which are reviewed regularly and adjusted as more information becomes available [9][10]. \n\n![The table outlines various principal accounting policies with associated estimation risks, highlighting US net sales and rebates as having high estimation risk](image5)\n\nAdditionally, the financial data provided in the tables illustrates the substantial impact of these rebates and discounts on gross sales, leading to net sales figures. For instance, the adjustments for US Managed Care and Medicare, wholesaler charge-backs, Medicaid rebates, and other discounts significantly reduce gross sales to net sales [image4]. This underscores the importance and complexity of accurately estimating these provisions, as they directly affect the reported financial performance.\n\nIn summary, the principal accounting policy with high estimation risk is the estimation of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates."}

However, in 2021, the net financing cash flows increased sharply to US\\$17,922 million, reflecting higher repayments of interest-bearing liabilities and increased dividends paid [7]. This trend is supported by the data in image5, which shows the net financing cash flows for each year, highlighting the substantial increase in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher repayments of interest-bearing liabilities, including bond repayments and early repurchase of hybrid bonds, as well as higher dividends paid to shareholders and non-controlling interests [7]. The significant outflow in 2019 could be attributed to various financing activities, including potential debt repayments or other financial obligations.

This is a significant increase from 2019, where only 550 shares were issued, valued at $6,045,000 [image2]. The increase in the number of shares issued reflects a larger allocation to the trust, which likely aligns with expanded employee participation or a higher valuation of shares during the year.\n\nThe impact on the total share capital is evident when examining the \"On issue at end of year\" figures. In 2020, the total number of shares on issue was 107,460,000, with a value of $234,165,000, compared to 105,566,000 shares valued at $214,571,000 in 2019 [image2]. This growth in both the number and value of shares underscores the effect of the increased share issuance to the trust.\n\nAdditionally, the movement in treasury shares highlights the transaction's financial implications. In 2020, the shares issued to the trust resulted in a reduction of treasury shares by 1,894, with a corresponding decrease in value by $19,594,000. However, when these shares were allocated on option exercise, they added 1,894 shares with a value of $4,086,000, leading to a net reduction in treasury share value to $20,288,000 [image2].

The table in image3 shows that total deferred tax assets decreased from $4,564 million in 2021 to $4,091 million in 2022. This reduction is primarily due to decreases in loss and other carryforwards ($1,030 million to $914 million) and pension and other retiree benefits ($1,476 million to $740 million), partially offset by increases in capitalized research & development ($358 million to $646 million) and lease liabilities ($196 million to $185 million).

These changes suggest a higher future tax liability, potentially due to increased deferred tax liabilities from goodwill and retiree benefits, which could impact future cash flows and tax payments.\n\nThe net effect of these changes is a widening gap between deferred tax liabilities and assets, increasing from $3,939 million ($8,503 - $4,564) in 2021 to $5,197 million ($9,288 - $4,091) in 2022.

According to the Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Unit Vesting Schedule [10], the RSUs vest based on whether the Non-GAAP OI for each respective year is not more than 15% less than the set objective in the Annual Operating Plan (AOP). This means that for each of the first, second, and third full years, the Business Unit must achieve a Non-GAAP OI that does not fall below 85% of the AOP objective [3][6][10]. \n\nAdditionally, the RSUs are subject to continued employment with the company or one of its subsidiaries through the vesting date [4]. The vesting schedule is detailed in a table that outlines the number of RSUs vesting at each vesting date, contingent on the satisfaction of these performance criteria [image3]. If the performance conditions are not met, the unvested RSUs will be forfeited [3]. The company also reserves the right to adjust the performance objectives by substituting or combining the OI and AOP OI objectives of different business units or activities, which could affect the vesting conditions [2][6]. \n\nThe vesting process is further clarified by the Vesting Schedule attached as Exhibit C, which specifies the exact dates and conditions for each vesting tranche [1]. The RSUs are generally granted with a time-based vesting schedule, but performance measures play a critical role in determining the actual number of shares that vest [8][9]. The company updates its assessment of the probability of achieving these performance criteria quarterly and adjusts the fair value of performance-based RSUs accordingly [5]. \n\nIn summary, the conditions for RSU vesting over the first three years include meeting the Non-GAAP OI performance targets for each year and maintaining continuous employment with the company or its subsidiaries. The exact vesting dates and numbers are outlined in the Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Unit Vesting Schedule, with adjustments possible at the company's discretion [image3][10].\n\nThe conditions for restricted share units vesting over the first three years are meeting the Non-GAAP OI performance criteria for each year and continued employment with the company or its subsidiaries."}

This decline reflects the challenges faced by the company, particularly in 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19, which led to significant sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment. The decrease in margins was partly offset by positive sales performance in the U.S., but overall, the reduction in operating performance contributed to the lower margins [1][5][9].\n\nRegarding currency translation, the impact on company-operated margins was minimal. In 2020, there was a slight currency translation cost of $(1) million, while in 2019, the cost was $(51) million, and in 2018, there was a benefit of $4 million.

By January 28, 2023, the fair value decreased to $1,019 million, while the carrying value increased to $1,143 million. This indicates a decrease in fair value by $186 million and an increase in carrying value by $143 million over the period.\n\nThe decrease in fair value could be attributed to changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of the debt, such as interest rate movements or credit spreads. Meanwhile, the increase in carrying value might reflect additional debt issuance or adjustments in accounting for the debt. The difference between fair value and carrying value suggests that the debt was recorded at a premium in 2022 and at a discount in 2023, which aligns with the company's use of interest rate swaps to manage exposure, as noted in the text [6].

In 1998, the majority of investments were focused on the Seed stage, with 21 investments accounting for 78% of the total, followed by Early Stage with 5 investments (18%) and Mid-Stage with just 1 investment (4%) [image1]. This heavy emphasis on Seed funding aligns with the early-stage focus typical of venture capital during that period, aiming to support startups in their initial development phases.\n\nBy 2007, there was a notable transition. The Seed stage investments dropped dramatically to just 2 investments (10%), while Early Stage investments surged to 14 (74%), and Mid-Stage investments increased to 3 (16%) [image1]. This shift reflects a strategic pivot towards later stages, likely driven by the post-bubble environment where capital scarcity led to more selective and efficient investment practices. The increased focus on Early and Mid-Stage investments suggests a move towards funding companies that have already demonstrated some level of growth and viability, aligning with the improved capital efficiency and higher yield rates observed in European venture capital [4].\n\nThis change is further supported by the growth trajectories of the funds over time. The 2007 Fund, despite starting with a lower initial value of €0.8 million compared to the 1998 Fund's €5.3 million and the 2000 Fund's €9.8 million [image3], achieved a remarkable growth to €84.5 million by Year 5, outpacing both earlier funds [image2]. This indicates that later-stage investments in 2007 were more successful in scaling companies, contributing to the overall growth and success of the fund.\n\nThe shift also correlates with the entrepreneurial boom and the maturing of the European ecosystem, where companies were scaling faster and achieving higher valuations sooner [7]. This environment, characterized by a demand-supply imbalance and selective investment, has produced some of the strongest venture capital firms in the world [2]. The scarcity of VC money in Europe has driven up capital efficiency and hit rates, as fewer investors could afford to be less selective [4].\n\nIn summary, the distribution of investment stages changed from a predominant focus on Seed funding in 1998 to a significant increase in Early and Mid-Stage investments by 2007, reflecting a strategic adaptation to a"}

According to the August 2022 survey, about half of Latino registered voters (53%) say they would vote for or lean toward the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, compared with 28% who favor the Republican candidate [1]. This aligns with the broader trend where Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a nearly two-to-one margin (64% vs. 33%) [4]. This pattern is visually reinforced by image3, which shows the Democratic Party's support among Latinos hovering around 64% in 2022, slightly down from 66% in 2021, while the Republican Party's support remains steady at 33% [image3].\n\nDespite this alignment, Latino registered voters' future party affiliation remains uncertain. A 2021 Pew Research Center study noted that substantial shares of Latino voters have soft ties to the political parties, indicating potential volatility [2]. This uncertainty is reflected in their perceptions of differences between the parties. For instance, image2 illustrates that a majority of all Hispanics (45%) perceive a \"great deal of difference\" between the parties, with similar views among both Democratic-leaning (47%) and Republican-leaning (48%) Latinos [image2]. This perception of significant differences may influence their voting behavior, as it suggests a clear distinction in how the parties are viewed.\n\nMoreover, Latino voters' dissatisfaction with the country's direction (77%) and President Biden's performance (54%) could impact their alignment, though equal shares of Latino Democrats and Republicans (60% each) believe it matters who wins control of Congress [3]. Image5 further highlights these perceptions, showing that while Democratic-leaning Latinos are more likely to believe the Democratic Party cares about and works hard to earn Latino votes (78% and 81% respectively), Republican-leaning Latinos are more skeptical of the Democratic Party's efforts (35% and 35%) but more positive about the Republican Party's care (68%) and efforts (72%) [image5]. This mixed perception underscores the complexity of Latino voters' alignment, influenced by both party actions and perceived differences.\n\nIn summary, Latino registered voters have maintained a strong alignment with the Democratic Party, but their perceptions of significant differences between the parties and varying views on party"}

In 2013, Telkomsel had 132.7 million subscribers and 60.5 million data users, which increased to 139.3 million subscribers and 63.5 million data users by late 2014. This growth indicates Telkomsel's strong market dominance and successful expansion in both subscriber base and data services [image4].\n\nXL, the second-largest operator, saw a decrease in subscribers from 68.5 million to 58.3 million but an increase in data users from 37.5 million to 32 million. This suggests a shift in focus towards retaining high-value data users despite a decline in overall subscribers, possibly due to competitive pressures or market saturation [image2][image4].\n\nIndosat, the third-largest operator, had 59.7 million subscribers and 29 million data users in 2013, which slightly increased to 54.2 million subscribers and 29 million data users by late 2014. The stable data user numbers despite a slight drop in subscribers might indicate effective retention strategies or a focus on high-value data services [image2][image4].\n\nThese changes suggest that Telkomsel continued to outperform its competitors, while XL and Indosat faced challenges in maintaining subscriber growth but managed to stabilize or grow their data user base. The increasing data users across all three operators reflect the growing demand for data services, likely driven by the rise in instant messaging and data-based communication, as noted in the text [10]. This trend aligns with the broader shift in consumer behavior towards data usage over traditional voice and SMS, impacting ARPU and market dynamics [5][7].\n\nIn summary, Telkomsel's consistent growth in both subscribers and data users highlights its market leadership, while XL and Indosat's performance indicates a strategic pivot towards data-centric services amidst competitive pressures."}

However, despite this increase, the majority of Independents still lean toward either the Democratic or Republican Party. In 2018, 17% of Independents leaned Democratic, 13% leaned Republican, and only 7% had no partisan lean [4]. This suggests that while the number of Independents has risen, most still align with one of the two major parties, maintaining a significant partisan influence [7].

This is a stark contrast to past administrations, where ethical standards were generally rated higher. For instance, image3 shows that Reagan's approval ratings in the early 1980s were consistently above 60%, and even during periods of lower approval, such as Clinton in 1996, the ratings were still higher than Trump's current ethical standards.

In 2004, 49% of Americans felt that the country hadn't gone far enough in protecting itself, while 29% believed policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties [3]. By 2015, this balance had reversed, with 56% concerned that policies hadn't gone far enough and 28% worried about civil liberties restrictions [3]. This shift is evident in the line graph showing the trend over time, where the percentage of those concerned about insufficient protection increased, while concerns about civil liberties declined [image3]. The graph also highlights that the lines intersected around 2010-2011, marking a pivotal point in public sentiment [image3].\n\nThe change was particularly pronounced among Republicans, with 71% now expressing greater concern about insufficient protection, up from 57% in January and 38% in July 2013 [2]. Democrats also showed increased concern, though less dramatically, with 54% in 2015 [image4]. Independents were at 49% [image4]. This partisan shift reflects broader trends, as seen in the table where older age groups (50-64 and 65+) were more likely to prioritize protection over civil liberties, while younger groups (18-29) were more concerned about restrictions [image1].\n\nAdditionally, the rise in perceived threats, such as ISIS, which saw a 16% increase in concern from August 2014 to December 2015 [image2], likely influenced these views. The survey also noted that confidence in the government's ability to reduce terrorism threats fell from 72% to 46% by December 2015, the lowest since 9/11 [9]. Overall, the data indicates a growing public demand for stronger anti-terror measures, with a significant decline in concerns about civil liberties restrictions [8]. \n\nIn summary, public opinion shifted from a focus on civil liberties to a greater emphasis on national protection, driven by increased perceived threats and partisan differences."}

In March, 54% of Democrats believed the U.S. was the leading global economy, but this dropped to 44% today [1]. This decline reflects a broader trend where views of U.S. economic superiority have decreased by 7 percentage points over the past four months [4]. Republicans, on the other hand, have mostly held steady in their views over the same period [1]. \n\nThis shift is part of a larger trend where more Americans now see China as economically dominant, with 32% holding this view compared to 52% who still see the U.S. as the leader [4].

Initially, the population was very low, with only 130 residents in 1870 [5]. However, this number surged dramatically to 8,267 by 1880 and peaked at 14,096 in 1890 [5]. This rapid growth was largely due to the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act of 1862, which transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state by providing settlers with land and facilitating westward expansion [9]. The Homestead Act, in particular, attracted a large number of pioneers, although nearly half failed to secure land titles [9]. \n\nFollowing the peak in 1890, the population began a slow decline, dropping to 13,330 by 1900 and continuing to decrease through the early 20th century [3][5]. This decline can be attributed to the consolidation of farms and the mechanization of agriculture, which reduced the need for labor and led to fewer small farms [4]. The average farm size increased from 179.7 acres in 1920 to 577 acres by 2002, reflecting the shift towards larger, fewer farms [4]. This consolidation likely contributed to the outmigration of residents seeking opportunities elsewhere.\n\nDespite these trends, some towns, like Aurora, showed resilience. Aurora's population increased steadily since 1940, peaking at 4,225 in 2000 [2]. However, other rural communities struggled, with many peaking between 1900 and 1940 and then declining [3]. The ethnic settlement patterns also played a role, with clusters like the Danish in Kronborg and Swedes in Hordville maintaining cultural ties and community focal points such as St. John’s Lutheran Church [7][10]. The church, with its Gothic-style architecture and surrounding cemetery, remains a significant landmark in the area [image1].\n\nThe population data table [image3] illustrates these trends, showing a peak in 1890 followed by a gradual decline until the mid-20th century, with some recovery in later decades.

This makes China the issue among those tested where Americans have the least confidence in Biden [3]. For instance, 67% have confidence in him to improve relationships with allies, and around six-in-ten believe he can handle terrorism, climate change, military force decisions, and international trade effectively [3]. \n\nPartisan differences are stark: 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have confidence in Biden on China, compared to just 19% of Republicans and Republican leaners [5][8]. This partisan divide is visually represented in image1, which shows significant differences in opinions on various China-related issues, with Republicans more likely to favor tougher stances and view China as an enemy [image1]. \n\nAdditionally, image3 provides a direct comparison of confidence levels across different issues, highlighting that 53% have confidence in Biden to deal with China, which is lower than confidence in other areas like improving relationships with allies (67%) or handling terrorism (60%) [image3].

Nearly eight-in-ten (78%) of Obama’s voters believed Democratic leaders should work with Republicans, even if it meant disappointing their supporters [5]. Similarly, 76% of McCain’s voters held the same view [5]. This bipartisan support for cooperation is evident in the image showing survey results from November 2008, where 74% of all voters thought Republican leaders should work with Obama, with 86% of Democrats favoring this approach and 59% of Republicans agreeing [image2].

This stark difference is highlighted in the same image, which shows that in November 2016, only 32% of Democrats supported working with Trump, compared to 65% who wanted to stand up to him [image2]. This reflects a significant shift towards partisanship and resistance among Clinton voters compared to the more cooperative stance seen among Obama voters in 2008.\n\nAdditionally, the image depicting the percentage of voters who perceived more mudslinging in elections shows a trend of increasing negativity, with 92% of voters in 2016 feeling there was more mudslinging than in past elections [image1]. This heightened negativity likely contributed to the more polarized views in 2016. Furthermore, the image showing opinions on whether something \"should\" or \"should not\" matter in 2016 indicates that Clinton voters overwhelmingly (84%) believed it was important for Democratic leaders to stand up to Trump, whereas Trump voters were more divided, with 52% believing it didn't matter [image5].

By 2019, this dropped to 35%, with a majority (50%) favoring maintaining current spending levels [10]. This decline in support for increased spending is particularly pronounced among Republicans, whose share fell by 14 percentage points from 2017 to 2019 [8]. Democrats also showed a modest decline in this view [8]. Meanwhile, fewer Americans see a need for European allies to increase defense spending, aligning with the overall trend [4].\n\nIn contrast, Germans remain divided on their own country's defense spending. In 2017, about half were content with current levels, while a third wanted an increase [7]. By 2019, the public was evenly split, with 40% supporting an increase and 41% favoring maintenance [7]. This division reflects a shift from 2017, when 51% were satisfied with the status quo [7]. The data from the comparative bar chart in image5 illustrates these changes, showing a decrease in the percentage of Americans advocating for increased spending and a more balanced view in Germany.\n\nOverall, while Americans have become less inclined to push for increased defense spending by allies, Germans continue to be divided on their own defense budget, with a slight shift toward support for increases.

According to the data, a substantial majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (65%) believe the government has an obligation to take care of workers displaced by automation, even if it means higher taxes for others [1]. This contrasts sharply with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, where 68% feel individuals should be responsible for their own financial well-being, even if jobs are automated on a wide scale [1]. This partisan divide is further illustrated by the support for specific policies: 77% of Democrats favor a universal basic income compared to just 38% of Republicans, and 66% of Democrats support a national service program compared to 46% of Republicans [5][10]. However, there is more alignment on the idea that machines should be limited to dangerous or unhealthy jobs, with 85% of Democrats and 86% of Republicans supporting this [3][10]. The image showing policy support by party affiliation (`![Support for policies by party affiliation](image3)`) highlights these differences, with Democrats more favorably inclined towards government intervention in job displacement scenarios. Additionally, the overall public opinion is evenly split on whether the government or individuals should be responsible for displaced workers, but the partisan breakdown reveals stark contrasts, with 65% of Democrats favoring government responsibility versus 30% of Republicans [8][5].

Additionally, 20% argue that the data collected does not accurately reflect a person's true financial situation [8]. Fairness is another critical issue, with 15% expressing concerns about potential unfairness or discrimination [8]. These concerns are further supported by the image quotes, which show that 68% of Americans find the use of automated personal finance scores unacceptable, with privacy violations being the top concern among them [image5]. The image also indicates that 20% believe the data does not accurately represent individuals, aligning with the text's emphasis on the importance of accurate representation [8]. Overall, the public's skepticism is driven by the belief that these scores might not capture the complexity of human circumstances, leading to unfair evaluations [6]. \n\nIn summary, U.S. adults are primarily concerned that automated personal finance scores violate privacy, fail to accurately represent individuals, and may be unfair or discriminatory."}

By the age of 70-74, internet usage falls to 68%, and broadband adoption decreases to 55% [5]. The decline continues into older age groups: only 47% of those aged 75-79 go online, with just 34% having broadband at home, and among those 80 and older, only 37% use the internet, and 21% have broadband [8]. This age-related drop is consistent with the observation that internet and broadband adoption rates among seniors fall notably starting at approximately age 75 [7].\n\n![Internet and broadband usage decrease with age](image4) illustrates this trend, showing a sharp decline in both internet usage and broadband availability as age increases.

Similarly, Asians make up 13% of STEM workers but only 6% of all employed individuals [8]. This overrepresentation is particularly pronounced among college-educated workers, where 17% of STEM workers are Asian, compared to 10% of all college-educated workers [4][5]. \n\n![STEM jobs show higher representation of Whites and Asians compared to all employed](image1) highlights this trend, showing that in STEM jobs, whites constitute 69% and Asians 13%, whereas in all employed categories, whites are 65% and Asians 6%.

In January, a substantial majority of 59% of Republicans believed the government was doing very well or fairly well in combating terrorism [2]. However, by the current period, this figure has plummeted to just 18%, indicating a sharp decline in confidence [2]. This trend aligns with broader negative assessments across the political spectrum, where only 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well, down from 63% at the start of the year [4]. The decline is particularly pronounced among Republicans, who have become more likely to express concern that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country. In fact, 71% of Republicans now hold this view, up 14 points since January (57%) and 33 points since July 2013 (38%) [3]. This shift reflects a growing skepticism about the government's effectiveness in addressing terrorism, as seen in the broader public's lower ratings of government efforts, which are now at their lowest since the September 2001 attacks [6]. The partisan divide is evident, with Democrats being the only group where a majority (64%) still views government efforts positively, though this is down from 85% in January [4]. The image illustrating approval ratings over time shows a clear decline in Republican support for Obama's handling of terrorism, paralleling the broader negative trend [![Approval ratings of U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama over time, segmented by political affiliation](image1)]. Additionally, the graph comparing concerns about civil liberties and national protection highlights a shift where more Republicans now feel policies are insufficient rather than overly restrictive [![Line graph comparing perspectives on civil liberties and national protection](image2)]. This comprehensive change underscores a significant erosion of trust among Republicans in the government's ability to manage the terrorist threat.\n\nIn summary, Republicans' views on government efforts to reduce the terrorist threat have become increasingly negative, with a sharp decline in confidence and a growing concern that policies are not stringent enough."}

Only 43% of blacks in STEM jobs believe that black employees are usually treated fairly during recruitment, and 37% feel the same about promotion and advancement opportunities [3]. In contrast, 78% of white STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in hiring, and 75% believe this about advancement processes [3]. Image4 reinforces these findings, showing that 43% of Black respondents believe Blacks are treated fairly in recruitment, while 78% of White respondents feel the process is fair. Similarly, for promotion opportunities, 37% of Black respondents believe they are fair, compared to 75% of White respondents.\n\nThese disparities underscore the persistent challenges faced by blacks in STEM jobs, including higher rates of reported discrimination and lower confidence in fair treatment during key career processes. The data and images collectively illustrate that while there is widespread support for diversity, the lived experiences of blacks in STEM jobs are markedly different from those of their white counterparts, with blacks facing more barriers and less perceived fairness in workplace practices. \n\nIn summary, blacks in STEM jobs experience significantly higher levels of discrimination and perceive less fairness in hiring and promotion processes compared to whites."}

For instance, in the table presented in image1, models like LLaVA-1.5-13B and Gemini Nano2* show relatively higher scores in the 'Human & Social Sci.' category compared to their overall test performance. This suggests that the nature of tasks in these disciplines may align more closely with the strengths of current LMMs, which are better at handling images that are more common in their training data, such as photos and paintings [6].

For higher-resource languages, the gains are consistent, with approximately 3 BLEU points across all pairs [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains vary: they are small for A Z and B E but very large for G L, which achieves up to 11 BLEU points [1]. This suggests that pre-trained word embeddings are especially beneficial for languages on the threshold of producing reasonable translations, as seen in G L [1].\n\nIn the case of G L → EN, pre-training not only improves the BLEU score but also enhances the model's ability to handle rarer vocabulary and generate grammatically correct sentences. For example, it successfully translates names and multi-word phrases like \"chris,\" \"big lawyer,\" and \"patent legislation,\" highlighting the utility of pre-trained embeddings in representing less frequent concepts [2].\n\nPre-training is more effective when the baseline system is moderately effective, typically with a BLEU score between 3-4. Once there is enough data to capture basic language characteristics, pre-training becomes highly effective [4]. This is supported by the observation that languages with larger headroom for improvement, like R U and H E, see larger increases in BLEU scores [9].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also influenced by language similarity. In multilingual systems sharing an encoder, pre-training and aligning word embeddings can improve BLEU scores, especially for similar languages like G L and P T, which show the largest gains, while B E and R U show smaller changes [10]. Image1 illustrates this, showing that aligned embeddings slightly improve scores for RU → EN (+0.3) and AZ → EN (+0.1), but decrease for GL → EN (−1.3) and TR → EN (−0.2), indicating nuanced effects based on language pairs.\n\nMoreover, pre-training significantly boosts BLEU scores when training data is limited. Image2 shows that the gain from pre-training is more substantial at smaller training set sizes and diminishes as data increases, particularly for Ru→En and Tr→En. This aligns with the finding that pre-training is most beneficial when data is scarce [6].\n\nFor multilingual translation systems, pre-training and alignment of word embeddings ensure that languages are in similar vector spaces, aiding the model's learning process [10].

The results, as shown in ![The inclusion of references improves the COMET-RANK score across all languages, with the most significant improvements observed in the reverse language pairs (source to English)](image2), indicate that the metric's scores improve substantially when references are included.

In the single-task model [5], there is a single decoder that attends to the encoder's hidden states to generate the output sequence. This setup is straightforward, with the decoder focusing on the encoded input to produce the desired output [4].\n\nIn contrast, the multitask model [2] introduces a more complex architecture where two separate decoders are used, each with its own attention mechanism. Both decoders share the same encoder but attend independently to the encoder's states. This means each decoder focuses on different aspects of the input, allowing the model to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. For instance, one decoder might be responsible for transcription, while the other handles translation, each using its own attention to extract relevant information from the shared encoder [2].\n\nThe key difference lies in the attention mechanisms: the single-task model uses a single attention mechanism tied to one decoder, whereas the multitask model employs two distinct attention mechanisms, each tailored to its respective decoder. This dual-attention approach enables the multitask model to leverage shared encoder information for different tasks, potentially improving performance on both transcription and translation by allowing each decoder to specialize in its task [2].\n\n![Comparison of model architectures showing single-task and multitask setups](image4)\n\nIn summary, the multitask model enhances flexibility and task-specific attention by using separate decoders with independent attention mechanisms, unlike the single-task model, which relies on a single decoder and attention mechanism."}

The main components are:\n\n1. **Multimodal Retriever**:\n   - **Function**: This component is responsible for creating and storing multimodal embeddings for both visual images and text descriptions. As shown in Fig. 1 [1], it encodes images and text into embeddings and stores them in an external memory bank. The retriever efficiently indexes these embeddings using techniques like the HNSW algorithm [7], which reduces dimensionality and speeds up retrieval. The retriever queries this memory to find the most similar embeddings to a given input image, retrieving the top-k class names [1].\n\n2. **Inference Pipeline**:\n   - **Function**: Upon receiving an input image, the pipeline retrieves the top-k similar class names from the memory bank. These candidates are then ranked by the MLLMs to produce the final prediction [1]. The ranking process leverages the MLLMs' internal knowledge and the retrieved information to make contextually aware classifications [4].\n\n3. **Ranking Prompt**:\n   - **Function**: The prompt integrates the input image with the retrieved category labels, guiding the MLLMs to rank these candidates based on similarity [5]. This step ensures that the MLLMs can refine the retrieved results using their extensive knowledge base, improving accuracy [4].\n\n4. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Function**: For object detection tasks, additional steps like cropping and blurring are applied to focus the MLLMs on relevant objects [3]. Cropping isolates objects of interest, and blurring non-target areas directs attention to the objects, aiding in zero-shot recognition [3].\n\n5. **Memory Integration**:\n   - **Function**: The retrieved embeddings and category labels are sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt, combining internal knowledge with external memory to enhance few-shot/zero-shot performance [6].\n\nThe RAR pipeline synergizes retrieval and ranking, addressing the limitations of MLLMs in fine-grained tasks while preserving their broad knowledge. This design is demonstrated to outperform baselines across various datasets, as evidenced by improved performance metrics in tables comparing RAR with other methods [10]. The pipeline's modular nature allows seamless integration into different MLLMs, making it adaptable for diverse applications [2].\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline enhances MLL"}

This is further supported by the performance metrics in Table 4, which indicate that reranking hard samples yields significant improvements [8]. \n\n![Performance comparison with and without LLM reranking](image5) illustrates the impact of LLM reranking on the FewNERD dataset. The graph shows that without reranking (pink line), performance is lower across all confidence levels.

Similarly, for relation extraction, the relation propagation layer also peaks at the second iteration (M=2) [8], as depicted in Figure 3b [5].

According to the study, RA enhances performance by providing models with access to external knowledge, which is crucial for handling less frequent entities that are often poorly represented in training data [2][5][9]. The SnapNTell dataset, designed to evaluate entity-centric VQA, includes a diverse range of entities categorized into Head, Torso, and Tail based on their popularity [1][5]. The results demonstrate that RA leads to substantial improvements in accuracy and reductions in hallucination rates for all categories, with the most notable gains observed in Tail entities [5].\n\nFor Head entities, accuracy improves by 11.1% (from 24.4% to 27.1%), and hallucination rates decrease by 3.6% (from 75.6% to 72.9%) when RA is applied [5]. This indicates that even for well-represented entities, RA contributes to more accurate and reliable responses. However, the impact is more pronounced for Torso entities, where accuracy increases by 18.8% (from 19.1% to 22.7%) and hallucination rates drop by 4.4% (from 80.9% to 77.3%) [5]. The most significant enhancement is seen in Tail entities, with accuracy soaring by 85.3% (from 6.8% to 12.6%) and hallucination rates decreasing by 6.2% (from 93.2% to 87.4%) [5]. This substantial improvement highlights RA's effectiveness in addressing the challenge of long-tail entities, which are critical for reducing hallucinations in VQA tasks [2][5][9].\n\nThe proposed retrieval-augmented multimodal LLM leverages external knowledge to generate entity-specific responses, directly addressing the limitations of traditional models that struggle with rare entities [3][8]. By integrating retrieval mechanisms, the model can access detailed information about entities, thereby improving factual accuracy and coherence [4][8][9].

This approach allows for the incorporation of specialized knowledge and tools that the language model might not inherently possess, thereby improving the factual accuracy and quality of the outputs. \n\nAs described in the text, post-hoc correction involves refining the model output after it has been generated, without updating the model parameters [5]. This flexibility enables the use of external feedback, which can include knowledge bases, trained models, code interpreters, and search engines [1]. For instance, models like RARR, REFEED, and LLM-Augmenter prompt the language model to question its outputs, and an external retriever searches for relevant evidence to refine the outputs [6]. This external knowledge ensures factual accuracy across various tasks, including code generation and scientific literature review [6].\n\nThe image illustrates this strategy by showing how external models and tools assist in refining outputs after the language model generates them [image1]. The critic model reviews the outputs and provides feedback, which is then used to enhance the quality through external assistance. This iterative process of generation, review, and refinement ensures that the outputs are more accurate and reliable [image1].\n\nFurthermore, the feedback can be in the form of natural language or scalar values, and the refinement strategies may involve supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or in-context learning [image2]. This multifaceted approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation and correction of the outputs, addressing issues like hallucination and unfaithful reasoning [image2].\n\nIn summary, 'Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback' enhances output refinement by integrating external resources and tools to provide precise and specialized feedback, leading to more accurate and high-quality outputs. \n\n![Post-hoc Correction with External Feedback involves external models and tools assisting in refining outputs](image1)"}

Tree Traversal Retrieval operates by moving layer-by-layer through the tree, starting from the root and progressively selecting the most relevant nodes at each level based on cosine similarity to the query embedding [2][7]. This method prunes and selects nodes at each layer, focusing on a top-down approach where the specificity of the retrieved information increases as it descends through the tree [9]. For instance, it begins with a broad overview by considering higher-level nodes and narrows down to finer details at lower levels, maintaining a constant ratio of thematic information to granular details regardless of the question [1]. This structured approach allows for controlled specificity and breadth by adjusting parameters like depth \\( d \\) and the number of nodes \\( k \\) selected at each layer [9].\n\nIn contrast, Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates nodes collectively across all layers, flattening the multi-layered tree into a single layer for comparison [2][3]. This method searches through all nodes simultaneously, offering greater flexibility by retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [1]. By considering all nodes at once, it can adapt to the question's detail level more effectively, as illustrated in Figure 2 ![The image illustrates two mechanisms for retrieving information using tree structures: Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval.](image2). The collapsed tree approach consistently outperforms tree traversal in experiments, likely due to its ability to provide more relevant and comprehensive information by matching the question's complexity [1]. For example, in the Cinderella fairytale analysis, RAPTOR's tree-based retrieval often yields more relevant information than Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) by selecting nodes from different layers, as shown in Figure 4 ![The image is an illustration of the querying process by RAPTOR, a system for retrieving information. It shows how RAPTOR retrieves information for two questions about the Cinderella story.](image4).\n\nThe performance differences are evident in the F1 score graph, where the collapsed tree method peaks at 2000 tokens with a higher score compared to the steady but lower performance of tree traversal ![Collapsed tree (green line) peaks at 2000 tokens with the best F1 score, while Tree Traversal (blue line) performs lower.](image5).

The combination mechanism, depicted in the image as a gray block labeled `comb`, aggregates information from both the green (left-to-right) and blue (right-to-left) sequences of transformer blocks. This integration allows the model to leverage full contextual information from both directions, enhancing its ability to capture nuanced dependencies in the input sequence. \n\nDuring fine-tuning, it is noted that disabling masking in the combination layer is beneficial, especially for tasks like NER, as it enables access to the full context including the token itself [4][8].

The model structure in the study incorporates personality traits using different methods, including a hard-coded approach where scores are scaled to sum to 100 and used as a fixed vector [2]. \n\nIn the context of the model structure, the blue personality vector likely represents the hard-coded method, where the raw OCEAN scores are scaled and fixed. For example, a user with an OCEAN score of {30, 70, 50, 30, 20} would be scaled to {0.3, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2} [image4]. \n\nGiven the focus on extreme cases, the personality scores for these samples would be the highest values observed in the datasets. From the histograms, the highest scores for each trait can be inferred, but specific values are not provided. However, based on the normalization to 100, the extreme cases would have scores close to 100 for their respective traits.\n\n**Answer:**\n[\"100\", \"100\", \"100\", \"100\", \"100\"]"}

According to the text, the ScRNN model with a background backoff strategy achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.9%, which is a 32% relative error reduction compared to the vanilla ScRNN model [5]. This indicates that the background backoff strategy is particularly effective in handling unseen words, as it leverages a larger corpus to improve recognition accuracy. Additionally, the text highlights that the neutral backoff variant has the lowest sensitivity, suggesting it reduces the number of unique outputs, which can be beneficial for robustness [6].\n\nIn the image quotes, image3 provides a direct comparison of different spell-correctors, including ATD, ScRNN with a 78K-word dataset, and ScRNN with a 10K-word dataset using three backoff variants (Pass-Through, Neutral, and Background). The table in image3 shows that the Background variant of ScRNN (10K) has the lowest scores across all types of errors (Swap, Drop, Add, Key, and All), indicating superior performance in correcting these errors compared to other methods. This aligns with the text's findings that backing off to a larger corpus improves performance by handling unseen words more effectively.\n\nFurthermore, image5 compares Closed Vocabulary and Open Vocabulary Models across different backoff strategies. The Background variant for Open Vocabulary Models shows improved performance in most error types compared to Pass-Through and Neutral variants, reinforcing the effectiveness of the Background backoff strategy.\n\nIn summary, the ScRNN model with a Background backoff strategy performs best across all types of spelling errors, as evidenced by its lower error rates and the text's emphasis on the benefits of leveraging a larger background corpus.\n\n![ScRNN with Background backoff has the lowest error rates across all spelling error types](image3)"}

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Step 1: System Message + Visual Annotation**  \n   The process begins with setting a system message that defines the desired tone and style of the instruction-response pairs. This is complemented by visual annotations, which provide essential image information such as bounding boxes and descriptions. This step ensures that the language model (e.g., ChatGPT) understands the context and requirements for generating high-quality pairs [6].\n\n2. **Cold Start**  \n   During the cold-start stage, in-context examples are collected by prompting ChatGPT solely through system messages and visual annotations. This heuristic approach continues until satisfactory examples are identified, ensuring the quality of the initial dataset [6]. This stage is crucial for guiding the model in the right direction before scaling up.\n\n3. **Step 2: Generate Instruction-Response Pairs**  \n   Using the established system messages and visual annotations, ChatGPT generates instruction-response pairs. The model leverages the provided context to create pairs that align with the visual content, focusing on tasks like perception, reasoning, and planning [2].\n\n4. **Step 3: Filtering**  \n   The generated pairs undergo a filtering process to ensure quality. ChatGPT is again utilized to evaluate and refine the pairs, removing any that do not meet the desired standards [6]. This iterative step is vital for maintaining the integrity and relevance of the dataset.\n\n5. **Step 4: Translation**  \n   Once the pairs are finalized, they are translated into eight languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, French, German, Korean, and Arabic. This multilingual support enhances the dataset's applicability across diverse user bases [6].\n\nThe image provides a visual flowchart of these steps, emphasizing the iterative and context-driven nature of the Sythus pipeline. By incorporating in-context examples and leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, Sythus efficiently scales the generation of high-quality, multi-lingual instruction-response pairs tailored to visual contexts.\n\n![Flowchart of the Sythus process](image1)\n\nIn summary, the Sythus process involves setting up system messages and visual annotations, collecting initial examples, generating pairs, filtering for quality, and translating the pairs into multiple languages, ensuring a robust and diverse dataset for training vision-language models."}

This method iterates a set number of times or until a predefined threshold is met, ensuring that the context becomes richer with each cycle. It is particularly useful for scenarios where initial retrieval might not fully capture the nuances of the query, allowing for progressive refinement of the generated output.\n\nRecursive retrieval, depicted in ![Recursive retrieval refines queries and decomposes problems into sub-problems](image5), focuses on progressively refining the user's query and breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems. This approach continuously solves these sub-problems through repeated cycles of retrieval and generation, using query transformation and decomposition. It is effective in handling complex or ambiguous queries by systematically narrowing down the search space and improving the relevance of results.\n\nAdaptive retrieval, illustrated in ![Adaptive retrieval autonomously decides when to retrieve knowledge](image5), introduces a decision-making component where the RAG system determines the necessity of external knowledge retrieval. It can autonomously decide when to stop retrieval and generation, often using special tokens to signal the end of the process. This flexibility allows the system to optimize efficiency by retrieving only when needed, making it suitable for dynamic scenarios where the information requirements may vary significantly.\n\nIn summary, Iterative retrieval enhances context through repeated cycles, Recursive retrieval refines queries and decomposes problems, and Adaptive retrieval dynamically decides when to retrieve, each contributing uniquely to the flexibility and effectiveness of RAG systems."}

This is because MRC tasks typically involve predicting the starting and ending indexes of answers within a context, resulting in only a few positive tokens (the actual answers) and a large number of negative tokens (background information).

However, when the model is re-trained on adversarial distractors, the F1 score increases to 60.10, indicating a recovery of performance [4]. This suggests that adversarial training helps the model adapt to more challenging distractors, though it does not fully bridge the gap with original distractors.\n\nFurthermore, when evaluating on adversarial distractors with entity type filtering, the model's performance improves from 40.73 F1 with original training to 58.42 F1 with adversarial training [5]. This highlights that adversarial training not only mitigates the impact of adversarial distractors but also enhances the model's robustness to additional constraints like entity type matching. The diagram in image1 illustrates the process where BERT processes multiple question-paragraph pairs, selecting the most relevant output, which aligns with the adversarial selection strategy described in the text [7].\n\nIn the open-domain setting, adversarial training also plays a role.

However, when moving to the open-domain setting, the model's performance drops to 38.06 F1 [3], highlighting the challenges posed by insufficient retrieval methods for multi-hop questions. This is further supported by the data in image5, which shows that even with 500 distractors, the F1 score is only 39.12, but adding a gold paragraph boosts it to 53.12. This suggests that the failure to retrieve relevant gold paragraphs is a major factor in the model's struggle in open-domain scenarios [10].\n\nMoreover, adversarial selection of distractors can reduce performance, as seen in image2, where the F1 score drops from 67.08 to 46.84 when evaluated on adversarial data.

This balance extends to the types of queries, which are categorized into three rungs based on their complexity and the causal inference techniques required to answer them.\n\n**Rung 1** focuses on basic probabilistic queries, including marginal and conditional probabilities, as well as explaining away questions. These queries are foundational and involve understanding the distribution of variables and their direct relationships.

While the exact cost range for this specific setup isn't directly provided, we can look at the general cost estimates for training models on cloud services.\n\nFrom image2, which compares estimated costs for models in terms of hours and expenses for both cloud and electric options, we see that training a single model for 120 hours costs between $52 and $175 on cloud services.

These segments are independently encoded using a pretrained cross-lingual encoder, as shown in the architecture diagram. After encoding, a pooling layer is applied to each segment to create sentence embeddings. The embeddings are then used to compute the triplet margin loss, which aims to minimize the distance between the \"better\" hypothesis and the source/reference while maximizing the distance between the \"worse\" hypothesis and these anchors. This setup helps the model learn to distinguish between higher and lower quality translations by optimizing the embedding space accordingly.\n\n![Translation Ranking model architecture with four input segments](image6)\n\nAccording to the text, the model receives a tuple \\((s, h^{+}, h^{-}, r)\\) where \\(h^{+}\\) is the better hypothesis and \\(h^{-}\\) is the worse one.

In the open-domain setting with 500 paragraphs, the F1 score is 39.12 [3]. However, when a gold paragraph is added to this setting, the F1 score increases to 53.12 [3]. This demonstrates that the failure to retrieve gold paragraphs is a major factor in the model's performance decline in open-domain scenarios. The gold paragraph provides critical information that the standard TF-IDF retrieval method often misses, as shown in the table where the F1 score jumps from 39.12 to 53.12 with the addition of the gold paragraph [3]. This highlights the importance of effective retrieval methods for multi-hop questions, as the model struggles without the necessary context provided by the gold paragraph [3]. The table in image4 further illustrates this improvement, showing the F1 score for \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs\" at 39.12 and \"Open-domain 500 Paragraphs + Gold Paragraph\" at 53.12, confirming the significant impact of including the gold paragraph [image4].

According to the text, when repetition control is applied, the question-asking rate drops from the expected 100% to 79.67% [4]. This reduction occurs because the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram` discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared previously, such as common question-starting phrases like \"do you\" or \"what is,\" which are essential for forming questions. To mitigate this, an additional setting `z=10 (boost)` is introduced, which temporarily disables the `extrep bigram` feature during beam search but re-enables it for reranking candidates afterward. This adjustment allows the model to generate necessary question-asking bigrams, resulting in a restored question-asking rate of 99.54%, albeit with a slight increase in external bigram repetition [4].\n\n![Question-asking rate with and without repetition control](image4)\n\nThe image illustrates this effect, showing that the question-asking rate for the \"Question-controlled CT with repetition control\" line (purple) reaches only around 80% at z=10, compared to the \"Question-controlled CT\" line (blue) which approaches 100%.

Each of these modules plays a crucial role in the verification process, ensuring that the system can efficiently gather and evaluate the necessary information to determine the veracity of a claim.\n\nThe claim verifier, as described in [1] and [9], is a central component that determines whether the current context is sufficient to verify the claim.

InstructGPT is used to prompt the model with examples and the current claim and context, enabling it to decide if further questions are needed [9]. This reliance on InstructGPT indicates that the claim verifier module is implemented with a large language model backbone.\n\nThe question generator module, mentioned in [5], is also based on InstructGPT.

This dual approach allows the model to leverage both the textual content and the categorical labels for more informative news representations.\n\n![The news encoder framework includes a title encoder and a topic encoder](image3)\n\nThe title encoder itself has multiple layers, starting with word embeddings, followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture local contexts, and an attention mechanism to highlight important words [6][10]. Meanwhile, the topic encoder focuses on learning representations from the topic and subtopic categories, which are informative for understanding the general and detailed topics of the news [1]. This combination ensures that the news encoder can effectively integrate both textual and categorical features for robust news representation learning."}

According to the text, both methods show similar patterns in performance as \\( p \\) varies [8]. When \\( p \\) is too small, the model tends to overfit on the long-term user representation (LTUR), leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, when \\( p \\) is too large, performance declines, likely because the useful information in LTUR is not effectively incorporated [8]. A moderate \\( p \\) (e.g., 0.5) is optimal for balancing LTUR and short-term user representation (STUR) learning [4].\n\n![Influence of mask probability on LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con](image3)\n\nThe image shows line charts for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, plotting metrics like AUC against varying \\( p \\) values. For LSTUR-con, the AUC (green circles) increases as \\( p \\) rises from 0, peaks around 0.5, and then slightly decreases as \\( p \\) approaches 0.9. Similarly, LSTUR-ini follows a comparable trend, indicating that both methods benefit from a moderate \\( p \\) value. While LSTUR-ini generally shows slightly higher AUC values, the difference is minimal, and both methods peak around the same \\( p \\) value, confirming the text's assertion that they perform similarly across different \\( p \\) settings [2].\n\nIn summary, as the mask probability \\( p \\) increases, both LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini improve up to a point (around 0.5), after which performance declines, with LSTUR-ini showing a marginally higher AUC but both methods following a similar trend."}

The model is trained using a hybrid objective function that includes masked language modeling (MLM) and replaced token detection (RTD), which allows it to leverage both bimodal (NL-PL pairs) and unimodal (code-only) data. This approach is designed to enhance the model's ability to understand and generate code, as well as to capture semantic connections between natural language and programming languages.\n\nThe results from the experiments indicate that CodeBERT (MLM+RTD) consistently outperforms other configurations and baseline models. For instance, in the code-to-documentation generation task, CodeBERT with both MLM and RTD objectives achieves a BLEU score of 22.36, which is 2.55 points higher than RoBERTa [7]. Additionally, when evaluating on downstream tasks like natural language code search and code documentation generation, CodeBERT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning [10].\n\nFurther analysis in a zero-shot setting, where the model parameters are not fine-tuned, shows that CodeBERT (MLM) outperforms RoBERTa and models pre-trained on code only [3]. This is evident from the probing tasks results, where CodeBERT (MLM) achieves an overall PL probing score of 85.66, significantly higher than RoBERTa's 62.45 and the code-only pre-trained model's 74.11 [8]. The table in image2 highlights these differences, showing CodeBERT's superior performance across multiple programming languages.\n\nMoreover, image4 provides a direct comparison of different model configurations, confirming that CodeBERT (RTD+MLM) achieves the highest scores across all programming languages and overall.

Specifically, in about 28% to 35% of the pairs, all annotators had unanimous judgments, while in about 55% to 60% of the pairs, one annotator differed from the other two [5]. This indicates that while there is a significant portion of cases where agreement is unanimous, a substantial number of cases involve disagreement, highlighting the subjectivity in evaluating mixed-modal responses.\n\nThe image provides detailed statistics on annotator agreement for comparisons between Chameleon and other models. For instance, when comparing Chameleon with Gemini+, all three annotators agreed in 31.5% of cases, two agreed in 58.1%, and there was no agreement in 10.3% [image1]. Similarly, for Chameleon vs. GPT-4V+, the agreement rates were 35.4%, 55.2%, and 9.3% respectively.

This extensive coverage is further illustrated in Figure 3, which details the subject distribution [image3]. Unlike benchmarks like VQA, GQA, and VisWiz, which focus on daily knowledge and common sense, MMMU incorporates college-level knowledge and a diverse array of image formats, such as diagrams, tables, charts, chemical structures, and medical images [5].

Initially, the model computes the hidden state \\(\\mathbf{h}_t\\) and splits it into components used for predicting words, parents, and relations [1]. When generating a token, the model first determines the type of mention \\(t_t\\), which can be 'new', 'related', or \\(\\varnothing\\) [1].

In the example provided, the parent entity is 'Super Mario Land' [4]. Following this, the model identifies the relation \\(r_t\\), which in this case is 'Publisher' [4]. Using the parent entity and the selected relation, the model then determines the specific entity to render \\(e_t\\), which is 'Nintendo' [4].

This is achieved by first using a pre-trained BERT model to encode the dialogue context and each domain-slot pair, obtaining contextualized representations conditioned on the domain-slot information [3]. The model then employs a slot gate to handle different types of slots: for non-categorical slots, it uses a two-way linear mapping to find text spans in the context, while for categorical slots, it selects the most plausible values from predefined picklists based on the contextual representation [3].\n\nThe architecture of the DS-DST model, as shown in ![The DS-DST model architecture with fixed and fine-tuned BERT components](image3), involves two main components. The fixed BERT model processes the candidate-value list for categorical slots, outputting value representations, while the fine-tuned BERT model processes the concatenation of domain-slot pairs and recent dialog context, outputting start and end vector distributions. These components are connected through cosine similarity matching, enabling the model to effectively interpret context and domain-slot information [3].\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach is supported by experimental results, where the DS-DST model outperforms BERT-DST and other BERT-based models, demonstrating the importance of direct interactions between slots and dialog context [2][7]. For instance, the DS-DST model achieves a joint accuracy of 51.21% on MultiWOZ 2.1, surpassing BERT-DST's 43.40% and ToD-BERT's 48.00% [10][image1].

This is attributed to the iterative latent interactions in BiDAF's architecture, which are particularly beneficial for tasks where information is distributed across documents [3]. BiDAF's ability to leverage cross-document information is highlighted in experiments where performance drops significantly when documents without candidate mentions are discarded, indicating its reliance on multi-step inference [10]. In contrast, FastQA, with fewer latent interactions, struggles more with integrating information across documents, showing less robust performance in such scenarios.\n\n![Performance comparison of BiDAF and FastQA on WIKIHOP and MEDHOP](image1) illustrates these differences numerically.

According to the text, D1 has a relatively balanced number of neutral examples in both the training and test sets, with 637 neutral examples in the training set and 196 in the test set [2]. This balance allows models to learn neutral-related features more effectively compared to D3 and D4, where the number of neutral examples is much smaller. For instance, D3 has only 50 neutral examples in the training set and 35 in the test set, while D4 has 88 neutral examples in the training set and 38 in the test set [2]. This extreme imbalance in D3 and D4 makes it challenging for models to accurately predict neutral instances, as even small differences in prediction can drastically affect precision and recall [2]. The image ![Distribution of neutral examples across datasets](image2) provides a clear visual representation of these differences, showing that D1 has a higher proportion of neutral examples compared to D3 and D4, which have notably fewer neutral instances. This imbalance is a key factor in why macro-F1 scores for D3 and D4 are more affected by improvements from document-level knowledge, as noted in the text [2][4][9].

Word-level embeddings provide semantic and contextual information by representing words in a vector space based on their usage in the corpus. This allows the model to understand the meaning and context of words within sentences. However, word-level embeddings alone may not capture morphological variations, such as different forms of a word (e.g., \"run,\" \"running,\" \"ran\") or capitalization patterns, which are crucial for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) [1][5].\n\nCharacter-level embeddings, on the other hand, focus on the subword information, enabling the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words and morphological variations. By processing characters, the model can generate representations for words that are not present in the training data and capture nuances in word forms [1][5]. For instance, character-level Bi-LSTMs can generate embeddings for rare or unseen words by analyzing their constituent characters, which is particularly useful for languages with rich morphology or for handling misspellings and variations in capitalization.\n\nThe combination of both embeddings allows the model to leverage the strengths of each. Word-level embeddings provide high-level semantic context, while character-level embeddings offer detailed subword information. This dual approach enhances the model's ability to recognize named entities accurately, especially in low-resource languages where word embeddings might be sparse or less informative [3][7][8]. The architecture described in the image5 illustrates this integration, where character embeddings are concatenated with word embeddings before being fed into a word-level Bi-LSTM, ensuring that both types of information are utilized effectively in the subsequent layers, including the self-attention and CRF components for sequence tagging.\n\nIn summary, using both word-level and character-level embeddings ensures that the model can capture both the semantic context and the morphological details necessary for robust NER performance."}

These steps are crucial for enhancing the model's ability to focus on the relevant objects within an image, especially in object detection tasks where multiple objects of varying sizes and positions are present. \n\nFirstly, the image is divided into regions based on bounding box coordinates, which helps isolate individual objects. This cropping ensures that each object is processed separately, allowing the model to analyze smaller, more focused areas rather than the entire image. This is particularly important because objects in detection datasets are often smaller and less centrally positioned compared to classification tasks, where the primary object typically occupies a larger portion of the image. \n\nSecondly, resizing the cropped regions to a fixed proportion standardizes the input size for the image encoder. This standardization is essential for consistency in feature extraction, as it ensures that the model processes each object uniformly, regardless of its original size in the image. \n\nAdditionally, the diagram suggests employing a blurring technique on non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This blurring directs the model's attention toward the relevant objects, reducing distractions and improving the accuracy of the embeddings generated by the image encoder.

The timeline in Figure 1, as described in the text [1], highlights significant events that have shaped the research in this field. Starting in 2010, the introduction of the \"Time tensor with Random Indexing\" marked an early attempt to model semantic changes over time [4]. This conceptualization laid the groundwork for quantitatively analyzing word meanings across different periods.\n\nIn 2011, the exploration using the \"Google Ngrams corpus\" became pivotal [9]. This dataset, which spurred the field of culturomics, allowed researchers to detect differences in word usage and meaning across large time spans, demonstrating the potential of large corpora in studying semantic shifts. The following year, work on \"Word epoch disambiguation\" further refined methods for distinguishing between different meanings of words over time, addressing the challenge of polysemy in diachronic analysis.\n\nBy 2013, advancements in \"Prediction-based models\" emerged, with the pioneering use of word embeddings like word2vec in 2014 [7]. Kim et al. (2014) employed these models to trace semantic shifts, showing the effectiveness of prediction-based approaches over traditional methods. The development of \"Models alignment\" in 2015 was crucial for comparing word vectors across different time periods, enabling more accurate detection of semantic changes [8].\n\nIn 2016, the analysis using the \"NYT corpus\" and \"COHA corpus\" expanded the range of datasets utilized, providing more granular insights into semantic evolution [10]. These corpora allowed researchers to capture subtle shifts in meaning over shorter time frames, enhancing the robustness of computational methods.\n\nBy 2017, the field had advanced to include insights into \"Laws of semantic change\" and the recognition that \"Local measures\" were better suited for detecting cultural shifts [6]. The use of the \"Gigaword corpus\" and the exploration of \"Diachronic relations\" further enriched the methodologies. Additionally, there was \"Criticism of semantic change laws,\" prompting discussions on the limitations and future directions of the field. The concept of \"Joint learning across time spans\" also emerged, suggesting integrated approaches to model semantic evolution.\n\n![Timeline of key milestones in diachronic semantic shift research from 2010 to 201"}

In the original dataset, BERT achieves a peak test accuracy of 77% [1], which is close to the human baseline. However, this performance is largely attributed to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset [1][6]. When analyzing the contributions of different components, BERT's accuracy on warrants alone (W) reaches 71% [2][6], with additional gains from reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W) accounting for the remaining six percentage points [2][6]. This suggests that BERT's high performance is not due to genuine argument comprehension but rather reliance on these cues.\n\nWhen tested on the adversarial dataset, designed to eliminate these cues, BERT's performance drops dramatically. The adversarial dataset results, shown in image4, indicate that BERT's mean performance is around 50% with a maximum of 53%, which is essentially random [3][7]. This significant decline confirms that the adversarial dataset effectively neutralizes the spurious cues, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [3][7].\n\nComparing the configurations, BERT (W) still shows a slight edge over BERT (R, W) and BERT (C, W) in the original dataset, as seen in image1, but all configurations perform similarly on the adversarial dataset, hovering around 50% [7].

This improvement in specific settings aligns with the observation that clearer instructions enhance model performance, as noted in the text [9]. The line graph in image2 further supports this by showing that precision increases with more explicit knowledge requirements, while recall remains stable, indicating that models generate more accurate citations when knowledge is explicitly targeted.\n\nThe implications for their use are significant: GPT-4 may be preferable for tasks requiring high accuracy and alignment with external knowledge sources, such as academic or technical writing where citations are critical.

This high performance in the taxi domain during zero-shot evaluation can be attributed to the similarity in slot values shared with the train domain. As mentioned, the taxi domain's slots have values that are similar to those in the train domain, facilitating effective knowledge transfer [9]. This similarity allows the model to leverage learned representations from the train domain, enhancing its ability to predict slot values accurately even without in-domain training samples. \n\n![The table highlights the zero-shot performance across different domains, with the taxi domain achieving the highest joint accuracy of 60.58%](image5)\n\nFurthermore, the heatmap in image2 shows that slots like \"destination\" and \"departure\" in the train domain have high cosine similarity with corresponding slots in the taxi domain, indicating that these slots have learned similar embeddings. This similarity suggests that the model can effectively generalize from the train domain to the taxi domain, contributing to the superior zero-shot performance observed [2].\n\n![Heatmap showing high cosine similarity between slots in the train and taxi domains, indicating effective knowledge transfer](image2)\n\nIn contrast, other domains like hotel and restaurant, which have unique slots such as \"parking,\" \"stars,\" and \"food,\" struggle more in zero-shot settings due to the lack of shared slot values with other domains [3].

According to the study, the collapsed tree approach consistently outperforms tree traversal, particularly when considering flexibility and granularity. The collapsed tree method evaluates all nodes simultaneously, allowing it to retrieve information at the appropriate level of detail for a given question [5][6]. This flexibility is crucial, as it adapts to the question's requirements, unlike tree traversal, which maintains a constant ratio of thematic to granular information regardless of the query [6].\n\n![Collapsed tree outperforms tree traversal across context lengths](image3)\n\nThe graph in image3 illustrates this difference, showing that the collapsed tree method achieves higher F1 scores across varying context lengths, peaking at 2000 tokens. In contrast, tree traversal shows a steady increase in F1 score with longer contexts but remains lower overall. This suggests that collapsed tree retrieval is more effective in capturing relevant information efficiently, especially at optimal token limits [3][10]. The collapsed tree's ability to flatten the tree structure and search all nodes collectively enhances its performance, as evidenced by the superior F1 scores at 2000 tokens, where it surpasses tree traversal by a significant margin [6][10].\n\nIn summary, the collapsed tree method consistently achieves higher F1 scores across different context lengths compared to tree traversal, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant information."}

The CTBT program highlights quantitative metrics such as minutes watched, clicks, and participant numbers, alongside a world map to illustrate geographic distribution. This approach emphasizes global reach and engagement, using a combination of numerical data and geographic visualization to show the program's impact and diversity. For instance, the infographic details 70,000 minutes watched online and 425 participants from 105 countries, with a world map illustrating regional participation. This aligns with the **law of good gestalt** [9], where the mind prioritizes simplicity and conciseness, grouping related data to create a clear, unified understanding of the program's scope.\n\nIn contrast, the weekend activity data uses pie charts to compare time allocation across different years, focusing on percentage changes in activities like spending time with family, watching films, and fitness. The pie charts visually represent proportions, making it easy to compare shifts in priorities over time. The use of clock faces for the charts ties to the **law of closure** [7], as the circular shapes suggest completeness, even with segments missing. This method emphasizes temporal changes and highlights trends, such as the increase in fitness activities from 5% in 2005 to 17% in 2010.\n\nBoth representations employ Gestalt principles to enhance comprehension. The CTBT infographic uses **proximity** and **unity** to group related statistics, while the pie charts use **closure** and **similarity** to compare segments. However, the CTBT data focuses on participant distribution and engagement metrics, whereas the weekend activities focus on behavioral trends over time. The CTBT's use of a world map also introduces a spatial element, contrasting with the temporal focus of the pie charts. Thus, while both use visual grouping to simplify complex data, their objectives and the types of insights they provide differ significantly.\n\nIn summary, the CTBT training program's statistics emphasize global participation and engagement metrics, using geographic and numerical data for a comprehensive overview, whereas the weekend activity data highlights temporal changes in behavior through proportional comparisons. ![The image shows a grid of circles arranged in six rows and six columns, forming a 6x6 matrix.

According to the analytics value chain, data must be pushed through a series of phases—from collection to impact—to achieve meaningful results. This progression is crucial because, as noted, \"Partway along the chain doesn't count\" [6]. The journey begins with data collection, where raw data is gathered and stored, as illustrated in the flowchart in image1, which shows data moving from \"Data\" to \"Reporting,\" \"Analysis,\" \"Action,\" and finally resulting in \"Value.\" This visual representation underscores the necessity of each step in the chain to ensure that insights lead to tangible business benefits.\n\nThe levels of analytics further elaborate on this progression, emphasizing the need for strong data leadership that supports the analytics organization and ensures that insights are integrated into decision-making processes [2][4]. Managers must rely on data insights to make informed decisions, embedding analytics deeply into organizational processes [4]. This alignment is critical, as highlighted by the quote from Zynga: \"Analytics is about impact... if you have brilliant insight and no one changes, you get zero credit\" [8]. This underscores the importance of not just generating insights but also ensuring they drive action.\n\nThe analytics value chain also involves pushing data through stages like statistical analysis and predictive modeling, as shown in image2, which illustrates the hierarchy from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics. This progression increases both business value and the degree of intelligence, moving from basic reporting to optimization. Each level builds on the previous one, with statistical analysis and forecasting providing deeper insights that inform strategic decisions.\n\nAdditionally, the distinction between reporting and analysis, as outlined in image3, is vital.

The image shows light rays hitting a surface and reflecting off it, with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection. This principle is fundamental in many applications, from mirrors to optical devices, where surfaces are designed to reflect light efficiently.\n\nIn summary, CDs/DVDs and surfaces like those depicted in the reflection diagram are two examples of reflecting surfaces."}

In telophase, the nuclear membrane begins to re-form around the separated sets of chromosomes, which have moved to opposite ends of the cell. This is a critical step as it marks the re-establishment of the nucleus in each daughter cell. The chromosomes, which were condensed during earlier stages of mitosis, start to decondense, and the nucleolus reappears, indicating the cell is preparing for normal cellular functions again. This process is often visualized using fluorescence microscopy, where different colors highlight various components like chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. ![The image shows a cell undergoing telophase and cytokinesis, with chromosomes separated and the nuclear membrane reforming](image2).\n\nCytokinesis follows closely, overlapping with telophase in many cells. During this stage, the plasma membrane grows inward at the midpoint of the cell, creating a cleavage furrow that eventually pinches the cell into two daughter cells. This division of the cytoplasm ensures each new cell receives the necessary organelles and cytoplasmic components. The process is depicted in images where the cleavage furrow is clearly visible, indicating the physical separation of the cell. ![The image illustrates the cleavage furrow forming during cytokinesis](image5).\n\nThe chromosomal copies, which were duplicated earlier in the S phase, are now fully separated, and each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes.

According to the text, the chain involves pushing data through stages from collection, analysis, decisions, action, and finally to impact [2]. This means that data must be processed through each stage effectively to achieve the desired outcome. The process begins with data collection, where data is gathered from various sources. This data is then used in the reporting phase, where it is organized into reports and visualizations to provide a clear picture of current metrics and trends. Following this, the analysis phase involves deeper examination of the data to uncover insights and patterns [10]. These insights are then used to inform decisions, which are implemented as actions within the organization. Finally, these actions lead to measurable impacts, such as improved performance or increased efficiency, resulting in value creation.\n\n![The image illustrates a data-driven process transforming data into value through stages of reporting, analysis, action, and value](image1)\n\nThe image1 flowchart visually represents this chain, starting with \"Data\" and moving through \"Reporting,\" \"Analysis,\" \"Action,\" and culminating in \"Value.\" This visual depiction aligns with the text's emphasis on the necessity of progressing through each stage to achieve meaningful results. The flowchart underscores that merely stopping at the analysis phase is insufficient; the insights must be translated into actions that drive tangible benefits.\n\nAdditionally, strong data leadership is crucial for this transformation. Leaders who actively evangelize data as a strategic asset and support the analytics organization ensure that the value chain is effectively executed [4][8][9]. This leadership fosters a data-driven culture where data insights are deeply embedded into decision-making processes across the organization [10].\n\nIn summary, the Analytics Value Chain transforms data into value by systematically progressing from data collection to reporting, analysis, action, and ultimately, measurable impact, as illustrated in the flowchart.

In the parental generation, Mendel crossed homozygous purple-flowered plants (PP) with homozygous white-flowered plants (pp) [5]. The F1 generation all displayed the dominant purple phenotype because they were heterozygous (Pp) [5]. This is illustrated in image4, which shows that all F1 offspring inherit one dominant P allele and one recessive p allele, resulting in purple flowers despite the presence of the recessive allele [image4].\n\nIn the F2 generation, the heterozygous F1 plants (Pp) produce gametes with a 1:1 ratio of P and p alleles [5]. When these gametes combine, the possible genotypes are PP, Pp, and pp in a 1:2:1 ratio [5]. The phenotypic ratio is 3:1, with three purple-flowered plants (PP and Pp) and one white-flowered plant (pp) [5]. This segregation of alleles is visually represented in image5, which demonstrates how the dominant purple trait masks the recessive white trait in the F1 generation but reappears in the F2 generation [image5].\n\nThe concept of dominant and recessive alleles is further clarified by image3, which shows genotypes like PP (homozygous dominant), aa (homozygous recessive), and Bb (heterozygous), highlighting how different combinations result in specific phenotypes [image3]. Mendel's discovery that parents pass heritable factors (now known as genes) to offspring [7] explains why traits reappear in subsequent generations, as seen in the F2 generation where the recessive white trait reemerges [5].\n\nThus, Mendelian inheritance predicts the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation due to the segregation and independent assortment of alleles, ensuring that both dominant and recessive traits are represented in the offspring.\n\n**Answer:** Mendelian inheritance explains the F2 generation's phenotypic and genotypic ratios through the segregation of dominant and recessive alleles, resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio and a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio."}

This process is foundational in ensuring that the team understands the stakeholders' needs and expectations. According to the image1, Needs Exploration includes techniques like active stakeholder participation, high-level requirements specification, and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). These methods help in defining what needs to be built by involving stakeholders early and often, ensuring alignment with their expectations. For instance, active stakeholder participation ensures that stakeholders are continuously involved, providing feedback and clarifying requirements as the project progresses. This is crucial in complex domains where requirements can evolve rapidly [2].\n\nOn the other hand, 'Elicitation Methods' focus on the specific techniques used to gather these requirements. As seen in image5, Elicitation Methods include strategies like just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, and iteration demos. These methods are part of a broader approach to managing changing stakeholder needs, as highlighted in the Construction phase of the DAD process goals in image2. For example, JIT model storming allows the team to collaboratively define models or requirements just before they are needed, ensuring that the information is relevant and up-to-date. This flexibility is essential in agile environments where requirements are often uncertain or subject to change.\n\nBoth strategies are interconnected. 'Needs Exploration' sets the stage by defining the scope and initial requirements, while 'Elicitation Methods' provide the tools to adapt and refine these requirements as the project unfolds. The image4 further illustrates the structured approach to scoping, emphasizing the importance of balancing the level of detail and modeling strategy to effectively manage stakeholder needs. This balance ensures that the team can respond to changes without losing sight of the overall project goals.\n\nIn summary, 'Needs Exploration' lays the groundwork for understanding stakeholder requirements, while 'Elicitation Methods' offer the dynamic tools to adapt and refine these requirements throughout the project. Together, they ensure that agile teams remain responsive and aligned with stakeholder expectations, as emphasized by the DAD framework's focus on context-driven decision-making [5].\n\n![Diagram illustrating the process of producing a potentially consumable solution](image1)  \n![Mind map illustrating \"The Process Goals of Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)\"](image2)  \n![Diagram related to exploring initial scope"}

According to the text quotes, one of the primary issues is the siloed approach within organizations, which leads to misaligned goals and fragmented efforts [3]. This is visually supported by image1, which highlights that 52% of respondents identify \"no single ownership of the experience\" as a significant challenge, resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals. Additionally, 46% cite being \"too siloed by business line/product/brand\" as a major issue, further emphasizing the organizational structure's role in hindering integration.\n\nAnother key barrier is the lack of resources and technical infrastructure. Image1 also shows that 36% of respondents lack the necessary resources, and 28% lack the technical infrastructure to support an integrated approach. This aligns with text quote [6], which mentions the absence of clear roles, responsibilities, and skilled resources as significant obstacles.\n\nMoreover, the text quotes stress the importance of measurement and data utilization. For instance, quote [2] emphasizes that adoption barriers often relate to management and culture rather than data and technology, and quote [6] lists issues like drowning in data and the lack of a 360-degree view. Image5 supports this by illustrating that 52% attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, indicating a reliance on simplistic metrics like last-click attribution, which fails to capture the full customer journey. This ties back to text quote [4], which critiques the overemphasis on first-click or last-click attribution in marketing campaigns.\n\nFurthermore, the need for a balanced approach between quantitative and qualitative data is highlighted in text quote [5], which advocates for a measurement framework that includes engagement, brand awareness, and customer behavior. Image2 shows that while 44% of organizations are \"Customer Focused,\" 35% remain \"Product/Brand Focused,\" suggesting a gap in prioritizing customer-centric metrics.\n\nIn summary, the major barriers include siloed organizational structures, insufficient resources and infrastructure, reliance on simplistic metrics, and a lack of integrated measurement frameworks. These challenges must be addressed to successfully adopt an integrated customer management approach.\n\n![Lack of single ownership and siloed structures are prominent concerns](image1)  \n![Customer-focused approaches are still less prevalent than product-focused ones](image2)  \n![Simplistic attribution methods dominate](image5)"}

In a Single Point Fuel Injection (TBI) system, the injector is located inside the throttle body, which sits on top of the inlet manifold. This means the throttle valve is positioned below the injector, as the injector sprays fuel into the airflow above the throttle valve [1][2][6]. The throttle valve regulates the air intake, and the injector introduces fuel into this airflow, creating a mixture that is then directed into the engine [image4]. In contrast, in a multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system, injectors are located in each branch of the inlet manifold, below the throttle valve, spraying fuel directly into each intake port [3][7][image3]. Therefore, in the TBI system, the throttle valve is beneath the fuel injector.\n\n![Single Point Fuel Injection system with injector above throttle valve](image4)"}

Initially, consuming the first hot dog provides a utility of +10, which is the highest. However, the utility diminishes significantly with each subsequent hot dog: the second provides +4, the third 0, the fourth -1, the fifth -4, and the sixth -10. This pattern illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal utility, where the additional satisfaction gained from consuming more units of a good decreases, and eventually becomes negative [9]. \n\nThis implies that consumers should be mindful of the point at which the marginal utility turns negative, as continuing to consume beyond this point leads to a decrease in overall satisfaction. The table in image4 clearly demonstrates this decline, suggesting that optimal consumption behavior involves stopping before reaching negative utility. The image also ties this to real-world behavior, such as competitive eating, where the focus on quantity can lead to diminishing returns and even negative outcomes [image4](image4).\n\nFurthermore, image5 expands on this idea by showing extreme cases of diminishing marginal utility, where consuming 66 hot dogs results in a utility of -50, highlighting the potential negative consequences of excessive consumption. However, it also introduces the concept of differential outcomes, where a specific milestone (like tying a competitor in a championship) can drastically alter utility, as seen with the jump to +5000 at 64 hot dogs. This suggests that external factors or goals can temporarily override diminishing utility, but the general principle remains that continued consumption beyond a certain point reduces overall satisfaction [image5](image5).\n\nIn summary, the utility from each additional hot dog decreases, eventually becoming negative, indicating that consumers should limit consumption to maximize satisfaction."}

For instance, standard reports and ad-hoc queries in image3 fall under this category, addressing basic questions such as \"What happened?\" and \"How many, how often, where?\" These activities are essential for establishing a clear picture of historical performance and identifying areas that require deeper investigation.\n\nIn contrast, analysis, as highlighted in image1, is prescriptive and forward-looking, aiming to answer \"Why?\" by transforming data and information into insights. This phase involves storytelling and contextual understanding, moving beyond mere description to provide actionable recommendations. Image3 further illustrates this progression, showing statistical analysis and forecasting as part of business analytics, where the focus shifts to understanding causality and predicting future trends. The analysis phase is critical for driving informed decisions, as it bridges the gap between data collection and actionable insights, aligning with the analytics value chain described in [9], which emphasizes pushing data through the chain from collection to impact.\n\nThe flowchart in image4 visually encapsulates this journey, starting with data storage and moving through reporting and analysis to action and value. Reporting sets the stage by providing the necessary context and questions, while analysis deepens understanding and guides strategic decisions. This progression is supported by strong data leadership, as mentioned in [7], which ensures that insights are leveraged to impact all parts of the business. The emphasis on embedding analytics into organizational processes, as noted in [8], underscores the importance of both reporting and analysis in creating a data-driven culture.\n\nUltimately, reporting and analysis together enable organizations to move from reactive to proactive decision-making, enhancing business value as depicted in image3. By integrating these concepts, companies can effectively transition from basic business intelligence to advanced business analytics, maximizing the strategic impact of data as a core asset. \n\n**Answer:** Reporting and analysis are integral to the analytics value chain, with reporting providing descriptive insights and raising questions, while analysis offers prescriptive insights and answers, collectively driving informed decisions and strategic impact."}

According to the text quotes, standard plywood thickness onsite is typically 18 mm [5], which is usually sufficient for most concrete pours. However, thicker plywood, such as 25 mm, may be used when the weight of the concrete causes standard thickness plywood to bow out, potentially distorting the concrete face [6]. This suggests that 25 mm sheeting is suitable for situations where additional strength is needed to prevent deformation.\n\nLooking at the images, image1 and image2 show wooden formwork setups with visible metal braces and rebar, indicating practical applications of timber formwork. While these images do not specify the exact thickness, they demonstrate the use of timber in formwork, supporting the idea that thicker plywood can be employed for stability. Image3 provides specific dimensions for construction materials, listing sheeting thicknesses from 25 mm to 40 mm for slabs, beam sides, and beam bottoms. This aligns with the text, confirming that 25 mm is a recognized standard for certain applications.\n\nIn summary, both 20 mm and 25 mm sheeting can be appropriate, but 25 mm is recommended for scenarios requiring extra support to prevent bowing. The choice should be based on the load and structural demands of the project.\n\n**Answer:** 25 mm sheeting is appropriate for timber formwork when additional strength is needed to prevent bowing, while 20 mm may be suitable for lighter applications."}

According to text [4], the ECU determines the amount of fuel, ignition timing, and other critical parameters needed for the engine to run smoothly. It achieves this by reading values from multidimensional maps calculated by sensor devices, such as those shown in image5, which includes sensors like the Engine Temperature Sensor, Intake Air Temperature Sensor, and Crankshaft Sensor. These sensors provide real-time data to the ECU, which then processes this information to adjust the injectors and ignition timing accordingly.\n\nIn image5, the ECU is depicted at the center, receiving input from multiple sensors and controlling several injectors. This setup aligns with text [3], which explains that the ECU uses engine sensors and a control module to regulate the opening and closing of injector valves. The ECU's ability to adjust ignition timing, as mentioned in text [6], is crucial for maximizing power and economy. For instance, the ECU can fine-tune the exact timing of the spark to optimize combustion, as illustrated in image3, where the injector sprays fuel into the combustion chamber and the spark plug initiates ignition.\n\nFurthermore, the ECU manages idle speed control, as described in text [5]. It monitors the engine RPM via the crankshaft position sensor and adjusts the throttle or idle air bypass to maintain the desired idle speed. This control is part of the broader system shown in image2, where the \"CONTROL SYSTEM\" receives signals from the \"DETECTING SYSTEM\" to manage the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM\" and \"ENGINE\" operation. The ECU's role in coordinating these subsystems ensures that fuel and air are mixed and delivered efficiently, as depicted in image4, where the fuel injector atomizes fuel into the airflow within the intake manifold.\n\nIn summary, the ECU acts as the brain of the engine management system, integrating sensor data to control fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed, thereby ensuring the engine operates efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe role of the Engine Control Unit (ECU) in the depicted engine management system is to regulate engine parameters such as fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed by processing sensor data and controlling injectors and other components."}

In standard consumption, this is evident in the way enjoyment drops with each additional hot dog consumed, as shown in image4, where the utility from each hot dog decreases from +10 for the first to -10 for the sixth. This aligns with the idea that variety is important to maintain enjoyment, as mentioned in [3], because repeated consumption of the same item leads to a decline in satisfaction.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the dynamics can differ. Image5 illustrates this by showing a dramatic increase in utility at 64 hot dogs, jumping from -50 to +5000, which is tied to a competitive achievement (winning a championship). This highlights how focus and cumulative practice can lead to significant outcomes, even if the immediate utility decreases with each additional unit consumed. The text in [7] supports this by noting that focused practice can improve both the experience and outcomes due to accumulated skill and experience. \n\nIn competitive settings, as seen in [10], the cumulative effect of focus may be beneficial, leading to mastery and success, even if the marginal utility diminishes.

{"q_id": 1995, "model": "InternVL3-38B", "in_tok": 1586, "out_tok": 444, "total_tok": 2030, "response": "In Pro Mode, the different metering and focus modes provide photographers with the flexibility to adapt to various shooting scenarios, ensuring optimal image quality. For instance, when shooting natural landscapes, the **Matrix Metering Mode** is ideal as it measures light across the entire frame, balancing exposure for the entire scene [5]. This mode ensures that both the foreground and background are well-exposed, which is crucial for capturing the vastness and details of a landscape [image5]. On the other hand, for portraits, **Center Metering Mode** focuses on light near the center of the screen, ensuring the subject's face is properly illuminated and highlighted [image5]. This is particularly useful when the background is significantly brighter or darker than the subject, preventing overexposure or underexposure of the main focus.\n\nSimilarly, the focus modes in Pro Mode cater to different subject types. For stationary subjects like landscapes or still portraits, **AF-S (single)** mode locks focus on the subject, maintaining sharpness throughout the shot [image1]. This is beneficial when the subject isn't moving, ensuring consistent focus. In contrast, **AF-C (continuous)** mode is designed for moving subjects, such as sports or wildlife photography, where the camera continuously adjusts focus to keep the subject sharp as it moves [image1]. For more control, **MF (manual)** mode allows photographers to manually select the focus point, which is useful for creative compositions or when the camera's autofocus struggles to lock onto the desired area [image1].\n\nBy combining these modes, photographers can tailor their settings to the specific conditions and subjects, enhancing the overall quality and impact of their photos. For example, using **Matrix Metering** with **AF-S** for a landscape ensures both exposure and focus are optimized for a static scene, while **Center Metering** with **AF-C** is perfect for capturing a moving subject in a portrait setting. This level of control in Pro Mode allows for greater artistic expression and technical precision [10]. \n\nIn summary, the different metering and focus modes in Pro Mode enhance photography by allowing photographers to adjust settings according to the specific needs of their scene, ensuring accurate exposure and sharp focus in various scenarios."}

{"q_id": 1997, "model": "InternVL3-38B", "in_tok": 2269, "out_tok": 512, "total_tok": 2781, "response": "The conversion rate from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Accepted Leads (SAL) varies significantly across different datasets, highlighting the importance of understanding these differences for optimizing marketing and sales strategies. According to the text quote [4], the process involves tracking how many MQLs convert into SALs, which is a critical step in the lead funnel progression. The image4 provides specific data showing a conversion rate of 1.50% from MQL to SAL, which is notably low. This suggests that while a large number of leads are qualified by marketing, a very small percentage are deemed acceptable by the sales team. In contrast, the image5 presents cross-industry averages, indicating a conversion rate of 45-75% for SALs, which is much higher than the 1.50% observed in image4. This discrepancy could imply inefficiencies in either the lead qualification process or the alignment between marketing and sales teams in the dataset from image4. The low conversion rate might indicate that the criteria for MQLs are too lenient, leading to a high volume of leads that do not meet sales' acceptance standards. Conversely, the higher industry averages suggest that other organizations may have more stringent qualification criteria or better alignment between departments. To improve this conversion rate, organizations should review their lead scoring methodology and ensure that marketing and sales teams are aligned on the definition of an MQL, potentially leading to more effective handoffs and higher conversion rates. \n\n![Marketing metrics showing revenue and investment trends](image1) illustrates the broader impact of marketing efforts on revenue, emphasizing the need for efficient lead conversion to maximize return on investment. The low MQL to SAL conversion rate in image4 could be a bottleneck in achieving the higher revenue potential indicated in image1. Additionally, the detailed breakdown in image2, which categorizes leads by source, could help identify which lead sources are more effective in producing SALs, allowing for targeted improvements. Overall, addressing the gap between MQL and SAL conversion rates is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of the entire sales funnel. \n\nIn summary, the observed differences in conversion rates highlight the need for organizations to refine their lead qualification processes and improve interdepartmental alignment to ensure that MQLs are more likely to be accepted by sales, thereby increasing the efficiency of the lead funnel and driving better revenue outcomes. \n\n**Answer:** The conversion rate from MQL to SAL varies significantly, with image4 showing a low 1.50% compared to industry averages of 45-75%"}
