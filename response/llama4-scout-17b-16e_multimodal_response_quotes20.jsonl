However, roughly comparable shares of Democrats (60%) and Republicans (54%) feel that there should generally be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with robots or computers [5].\n\n![Public opinion on policies regarding automation](image1)\n\nOverall, the public is concerned about the impact of automation on the workforce and favors policies that would limit the use of machines in certain jobs or provide support for displaced workers."}

Specifically:\n- 58% of those with a postgraduate degree say the government is doing very or fairly well.\n- 40% say it is doing not too or not at all well.\n\nIn contrast, 48% of those with a bachelor's degree and 44% of those with less education rate the government's performance positively.\n\n### Age and Education\n\n- **Age**: Among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well in reducing the terrorist threat (42% say it is). In contrast, 46% of younger adults (those 18-29 years old) give the government's performance a negative rating, while 53% say it is doing very or fairly well.\n- **Education**: Older, less educated Americans give more negative ratings of government efforts against terrorism.\n\n### Partisan Differences\n\nCompared to early 2015, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well (down from 85% in January). Independents' positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%. And just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well in reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year.\n\n### Public Opinion on Anti-Terror Policies\n\nBy a two-to-one margin, Americans now say that they are more concerned that the government's anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%), rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person's civil liberties (28%). Since the start of the year, there has been a seven-percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe perception of the government's efforts to combat terrorism has declined significantly over time, with notable differences among various demographic and political groups. These differences highlight complex and shifting public opinions on national security and counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n![Public Opinion Trends](image1)\n\nThe graph shows trends in public opinion on government efforts to combat terrorism from 2001 to 2015, highlighting fluctuations in confidence across different administrations.\n\n![Demographic Differences in Scrutiny Due to Religion](image2)\n\nThis table illustrates how different demographic groups perceive additional scrutiny solely because of religion or scrutiny than people in other religious groups.\n\n![Government Performance Ratings by Demographics](image3)\n\nThis table provides a detailed breakdown of how different demographics rate the government's performance in reducing the threat of terrorism.\n\n![Partisan Differences in Problem Prioritization](image4)\n\nThis table outlines partisan differences in prioritizing various national issues, including terrorism and national security.\n\n![Religious Affiliation and Scrutiny](image5)\n\nThis chart highlights how different religious affiliations perceive additional scrutiny or scrutiny than people in other religious groups.\n\n![Trends in Public Concern Over Anti-Terror Policies](image7)\n\nThe graph illustrates trends in public concern over whether anti-terror policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties or not far enough to protect the country.\n\n### Direct Answer\n\nThe perception of terrorism and government efforts to combat it has changed significantly over time, with a decline in positive assessments and notable differences among demographic and political groups, particularly with partisanship, age, and education level influencing opinions."}

The data suggests that there are significant partisan differences in opinions on how the U.S. has dealt with the outbreak, with Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents being more critical than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.

Similarly, 53% of college graduates think that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement, whereas only 32% of those with a high school diploma or less share this view [1][9].\n\n![Perceptions of technology's impact on work interest and career advancement by education level](image1)\n\nThe survey also reveals that workers express mixed views about the impact of various workforce technologies on their jobs and careers. A substantial share of workers indicate that technologies such as word processing or spreadsheet software (70%), smartphones (67%), and email or social media (60%) have had a positive impact on their careers [8].\n\nHowever, the benefits of these tools are most likely to accrue to workers with high levels of formal educational attainment. Workers lacking a college education are much less likely to express positive attitudes towards the current generation of workforce technologies [11].\n\nWorkers across different age groups and occupations also have varying perceptions of the impact of technology. For instance, young adults and certain demographic groups report being impacted by workforce automation technologies at somewhat higher than average levels [4].\n\n## Impact by Occupation and Employment Type\n\nWhen broken down by occupation, the data shows:\n\n- **Fast food workers**: 6% reported a negative impact, 17% a not very significant impact, 39% a somewhat positive impact, and 38% a very positive impact.\n- **Insurance claims processors**: 7% reported a negative impact, 27% a not very significant impact, 44% a somewhat positive impact, and 22% a very positive impact.\n- **Software engineers**: 12% reported a negative impact, 35% a not very significant impact, 38% a somewhat positive impact, and 15% a very positive impact.\n- **Legal clerks**: 12% reported a negative impact, 38% a not very significant impact, 36% a somewhat positive impact, and 13% a very positive impact.\n- **Construction workers**: 19% reported a negative impact, 39% a not very significant impact, 32% a somewhat positive impact, and 10% a very positive impact.\n- **Teachers**: 26% reported a negative impact, 38% a not very significant impact, 26% a somewhat positive impact, and 10% a very positive impact.\n- **Own job or profession**: 30% reported a negative impact, 40% a not very significant impact, 23% a somewhat positive impact, and 7% a very positive impact.\n- **Nurse**: 34% reported a negative impact, 46% a not very significant impact, 16% a somewhat positive impact, and 4% a very positive impact.\n\nThe perceptions of workforce automation and technology vary across different demographics and education levels, with education level being a significant factor. Workers with higher levels of education tend to view technology more positively.\n\nOverall, technology has both positive and negative impacts on workers' jobs and careers, with education level and occupation being key factors influencing these perceptions. \n\nThe final answer is: Workforce automation impacts workers differently based on education and occupation; educated workers tend to view technology positively while those with lower education levels are more likely to view it negatively."}

In contrast, Trump's success ratings are lower, with 29% believing he will be successful and 47% thinking he will be unsuccessful [5].\n\n## Trust and Views of Success\nThe level of trust in Trump's presidency also varies by political affiliation. In January 2019, 55% of Republicans and Republican leaners viewed Trump as \"very\" or \"somewhat\" trustworthy, compared to 69% of Democrats and Democratic leaners who viewed him as \"not at all\" trustworthy [2].\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, perceptions of Trump's presidency are highly divided along political lines, with Republicans generally more positive and Democrats more negative. These perceptions differ significantly from those of previous presidents, reflecting a deep partisan divide in views on his trustworthiness, ethical standards, economic impact, and long-term success.\n\n![Partisan Divide in Views of Trump's Presidency](image2)\n![Economic Impact of Trump's Policies](image4)\n![Trust in Trump's Presidency](image7)"}

About one-in-five (18%) say they would vote for another candidate or are not sure who they would vote for [4].\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n![Latino voters' preferences for 2022 midterm elections](image4.png)\n![Key differences in preferences based on demographic factors](image3.png)\n\nThe images show that:\n- **Demographic differences**: There are significant differences in preferences based on demographic factors such as religious affiliation, political leaning, and the importance of being Hispanic.\n- **Party preferences**: The Democratic Party is preferred by a larger margin among Latino voters who consider being Hispanic extremely or very important (60%) [4].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of Latino voters' party affiliations and important election issues from 2019 to 2022 indicates a strong preference for the Democratic Party and a focus on economic issues, with abortion and healthcare also being significant concerns. Demographic factors such as religious affiliation, political leaning, and the importance of Hispanic identity play a crucial role in shaping these preferences. \n\nLatino voters' preferences are influenced by various factors, including their views on the economy, healthcare, and abortion. These factors contribute to their party affiliations and voting decisions. Overall, Latino voters tend to lean Democratic, with a strong emphasis on economic issues and a growing concern for abortion rights."}

According to the provided data, there are significant differences in how Hispanics across different generations perceive their identity.\n\n### Language Proficiency and Cultural Background\n\n- **Speaking Spanish**: The importance of speaking Spanish in defining Hispanic identity varies across generations. Among self-identified Hispanics, 28% believe speaking Spanish is necessary, but this view is less common among later generations. Specifically:\n  - **71%** of self-identified Hispanics say not speaking Spanish does not affect their Hispanic identity.\n  - This percentage increases to **84%** among second-generation Hispanics and **92%** among third or higher generation Hispanics, indicating that language proficiency becomes less critical for self-identification as one moves further from their family's immigrant roots.\n\n### Generational Differences\n\n- **Generational Status**: The generational status significantly influences self-identification as Hispanic. For instance:\n  - **36%** of immigrant Hispanics consider themselves a typical American, a share that rises to **63%** among second-generation Hispanics and **73%** among third or higher generation Hispanics.\n  - This trend suggests that as Hispanics are more integrated into American society across generations, their sense of identity may shift.\n\n### Cultural and Ancestral Ties\n\n- **Cultural and Ancestral Links**: The reasons for not considering oneself Hispanic despite Hispanic ancestry also vary. Some of the key reasons include:\n  - **Mixed background/Hispanic ancestry too far back** (27%),\n  - **Upbringing/No contact with Hispanic relatives** (16%),\n  - **Does not speak Spanish/Has no cultural link** (15%),\n  - **Identifies as other race/Does not look Hispanic** (12%), and\n  - **Born in U.S./Identifies as American** (9%) [1].\n\n### Comparison Across Generations\n\n- **Country of Origin/Heritage**: Self-identified Hispanics often cite their country of origin or heritage as a significant factor in their identity, with **50%** of self-identified Hispanics often thinking of their country of origin/heritage, **23%** sometimes, and **23%** never.\n- **Hispanic/Latino vs. American Identity**: The balance between Hispanic/Latino identity and American identity also shifts across generations. While **70%** of foreign-born Hispanics often think of their Hispanic/Latino identity, this decreases to **68%** among second-generation and **26%** among third or higher generation Hispanics.\n\n### Visual Representations\n\nThe provided images visually represent these trends:\n- ![Differences in self-identification factors across generations](image1)\n- ![Frequency of thinking of Hispanic/Latino identity vs. American identity](image7)\n- ![Importance of speaking Spanish in Hispanic identity](image1)\n- ![Views on Hispanic identity and generational status](image2)\n- ![Self-identification and cultural practices](image3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the self-identification of Hispan categories in the U.S. is influenced by a range of factors, including but not limited to, language proficiency, generational status, cultural practices, and ancestral ties. These factors show significant variation across different generations, reflecting evolving identities and experiences within the Hispanic community in the U.S. \n\nThe factors include \n- Language proficiency \n- Generational status \n- Cultural practices \n- Ancestral ties \n\nThese factors influence the self-identification across generations by changing the importance of speaking Spanish, thinking of Hispanic/Latino vs American identity and country of origin/heritage. \n\nThe conclusion is that **Hispanic identity is shaped by generational experiences, language, culture, and ancestral ties, evolving significantly across generations**."}

This process converts the user's natural language input into a format that the system can understand and process [2].\n\n### System Components\n\nThe overall system architecture is shown in ![System architecture overview](image1).\n### Step 2: Dialogue State Tracking\n\nThe encoded user utterance, along with the encoding of the previous system action, serves as input to a dialogue-level LSTM. This LSTM maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state, which is updated after processing each dialogue turn [3].\n\n### Step 3: Policy Network\n\nThe policy network takes in the dialogue-level LSTM state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of query results. It then emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act, conditioning on these inputs [5].\n\n### Step 4: Natural Language Generation\n\nThe emitted system action is used to produce a system response in natural language format by combining the state tracker outputs and the retrieved KB entities. A template-based NLG (Natural Language Generator) is used, where delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced by the values from either the estimated user goal values or the KB entities [6].\n\n### Step 5: Interaction with Knowledge Base\n\nThe system uses symbolic queries to interact with the KB, leaving the ranking of KB entities to an external recommender system. This approach allows for more flexibility and richer features in entity ranking, such as user profiles and local context [7].\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, given the user input \"Movie for the day after tomorrow, please\", the system encodes the utterance, tracks the dialogue state, and generates a response using the policy network and NLG [6].\n\nThe final answer is: The system generates a response to the user's request by encoding the user's input into a continuous vector, tracking the dialogue state, emitting a system action using a policy network, and producing a natural language response using a template-based NLG."}

Understanding DETR-DC5 Model Components\nThe DETR-DC5 model, as discussed, utilizes a transformer architecture which includes components like the global self-attention in the encoder, FFN (Feed Forward Network), multiple decoder layers, and positional encodings. These components significantly contribute to the final object detection performance [1].\n\n## 2. Role of Positional Encodings\nPositional encodings are crucial in transformer models as they provide information about the position of each element in the input sequence. The DETR model experiments with various combinations of fixed and learned encodings. The results, as shown in a table (image3), indicate that not using spatial positional encodings leads to a significant drop in AP, and passing them in the decoder only leads to a minor AP drop.\n\n## 3. Impact of Loss Components and Decoder Layers\nThe model's performance is also influenced by its loss components and the depth of the decoder layers. The set-based loss in DETR eliminates the need for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) by design. An analysis of decoder layer outputs shows that both AP and AP50 improve after every layer, with a significant improvement between the first and the last layer [11].\n\n## 4. Visualization of Predictions and Specialization\nVisualizations of box predictions on all images from COCO 2017 val set for 20 out of total N=100 prediction slots in the DETR decoder show that each slot learns to specialize in certain areas and box sizes. This specialization is related to the distribution of objects in COCO [4].\n\n## 5. Panoptic Segmentation\nThe extension of DETR for panoptic segmentation by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs demonstrates competitive results on COCO-val 2017, outperforming published results and a strong Pan-optic FPN baseline [9].\n\n## 6. Quantitative Analysis\nA quantitative analysis (image4) shows that AP No NMS, AP NMS=0.7, AP50 No NMS, and AP50 NMS=0.7 improve with the decoder layer, indicating that deeper layers improve performance but with diminishing returns and some loss in AP as NMS incorrectly removes true positive predictions.\n\n## 7. Conclusion on Configurations and AP\nGiven these insights, different configurations of positional encodings and loss components can significantly affect the Average Precision (AP) in the DETR-DC5 model. The optimal configuration, as seen in the results, achieves 40.6 AP and 42.0 AP on short and long schedules, respectively [7].\n\nThe DETR-DC5 model's architecture and its attention mechanisms play a key role in modeling relations between feature representations of different detections, contributing to its performance [7].\n\n![DET Model Architecture](image1)\n\nThis architectural overview and the detailed analysis of components' contributions provide a comprehensive understanding of how DETR-DC5 achieves its object detection performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the DETR-DC5 model's performance is influenced by the configuration of positional encodings, loss components, and the depth of decoder layers, with an optimal setup leading to competitive AP scores.\n\nThe Average Precision (AP) in DETR-DC5 is affected by configurations of positional encodings and loss components, with optimal setups achieving up to 40.6 AP."}

Specifically, as shown in Figure 4, ProgramFC outperforms FLAN-T5, especially with smaller model sizes, indicating that program-guided reasoning substantially alleviates the demands on subsequent sub-task solvers.\n\nIn terms of retrieval recall, ProgramFC exhibits significant improvements over one-step retrieval. Figure 5 illustrates that ProgramFC outperforms one-step retrieval on all datasets, with the largest improvement of 37.1% on HOVER 4-hop.

According to [1], adding logical constraints to LLM instructions provides stable improvements, especially with more demonstrations. For instance, when using 5 demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints, the performance achieves 25.7%, surpassing that of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%). This indicates that telling LLMs both \"what\" (demonstrations) and \"how\" (logical constraints) is crucial.\n\n### Demonstration Samples\nThe number of demonstration samples also plays a vital role in model performance. As shown in image1, when the number of demonstrations increases from 1 to 5, there is an evident improvement, but subsequent improvements are limited when continuing to increase the number of demonstrations (e.g., ≥10). This suggests that an optimal number of demonstrations exists, beyond which additional demonstrations yield diminishing returns.\n\n### Model-Specific Performance\n\n- **Turbo, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna, and Llama2**: These models exhibit varying degrees of improvement when logical constraints and demonstrations are incorporated. For example, on the MAVEN-ERE dataset, GPT-4 with logical constraints achieves a Micro-F1 of 32.3%, outperforming other models [6].\n\n- **Impact of Logical Inconsistency**: A higher logical inconsistency corresponds to a poorer micro-F1 score. However, rectifying logical inconsistency does not necessarily lead to the same degree of increase in micro-F1 [8].\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the strategic use of logical constraints and demonstration samples can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs on the MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets. \n\nThe final answer is: ![The incorporation of logical constraints and optimal demonstration samples improves model performance on MAVEN-ERE and Causal-TimeBank datasets.]()"}

This benchmark is crucial for understanding the strengths and limitations of current models in handling complex, college-level knowledge tasks that require both visual and textual understanding.\n\n### Model Performance Across Difficulty Levels\n\nWhen evaluating models across different difficulty levels, the results indicate that GPT-4V, a state-of-the-art model, achieves a significantly higher proficiency compared to open-source models in the \"Easy\" category, with a success rate of $76.1\\%$. However, as the complexity of tasks increases, the advantage of more advanced models like GPT-4V almost disappears.

Across all types, GPT-4V consistently outperforms other models by a huge margin. Open-source models demonstrate relatively strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings but obtain very low scores for less common image categories such as Geometric shapes, Music sheets, and Chemical structures.

According to [4], for questions about simple, objective properties of the responses, there is rarely disagreement among annotators. However, for more subjective questions like task fulfillment or prompt interpretation, there can be closer decisions, such as \"fulfills\" vs. \"partially fulfills,\" rather than opposite judgments like \"fulfills\" vs. \"does not fulfill.\"\n\n## Step 1: Understanding Inter-annotator Agreement\nThe agreement between different annotators is examined to understand the quality of human annotators and the design of the questions asked. As stated in [5], every question in the evaluation is answered by three different human annotators, with the majority votes taken as the final answer.\n\n## 2: Analyzing Task Fulfillment Rates\n[6] provides insights into task fulfillment rates, showing that Chameleon's responses are considered to have completely fulfilled the tasks in $55.2\\%$ of the cases, compared to $37.6\\%$ for Gemini$^+$ and $44.7\\%$ for GPT-4V+. This indicates a higher rate of task fulfillment for Chameleon.\n\n## 3: Evaluating Inter-annotator Agreement for Task Fulfillment\nThe inter-annotator agreement for task fulfillment can be seen in Figure 9a and Table 7.

For questions about simple, objective properties of the responses, there is rarely any disagreement among annotators. However, for some questions, such as whether the response fulfills the task or whether the model interprets the prompt correctly, when one annotator's judgment differs from the other two's, the decision is usually still close (e.g., fulfills vs. partially fulfills) rather than opposite (e.g., fulfills vs. does not fulfill) [12].\n\n## Relative Evaluation\nFor the relative evaluation, Table 4 shows the numbers of cases where all three annotators agree, two annotators agree, and there is no agreement [6]. On about 28% to 35% of the pairs, all annotators have unanimous judgments, and in about 55% to 60% of the pairs, one annotator differs from the other two.

The ablation study presented in the text quotes [2] and supported by image7 indicates that the inclusion of entity detection (ED) significantly enhances the model's performance. Specifically, a comparison with and without ED shows that ED markedly surpasses the variant lacking this feature, highlighting its necessity and effectiveness.\n\n### Retrieval Augmentation\n\nRetrieval augmentation (RA) is another critical component that contributes to the model's performance. According to [6] and as shown in image8, the performance improvement for torso-to-tail entities far exceeds that of head entities through retrieval augmentation, effectively addressing the challenge of hallucinations in long-tailed entities.\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\nThe performance of the SnapNTell model, with and without ED and RA, is detailed in several tables. For instance, image4 and image5 show comparative results between baseline models and the proposed method on various datasets, including VQA2, TextVQA, OK-VQA, and SnapNTell. The results indicate that the SnapNTell model outperforms existing approaches, achieving a 66.5% improvement in the BELURT score [5].\n\n### Accuracy and Hallucination Rates\n\nThe impact of ED and RA on accuracy and hallucination rates can be seen in image6 and image7. The data shows that with RA and ED, there's a notable increase in accuracy and a decrease in hallucination rates across different entity types (head, torso, tail). Specifically, the results in image8 demonstrate that the inclusion of RA and ED leads to a significant improvement in performance metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BELURT.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of entity detection and retrieval augmentation in the SnapNTell model significantly enhances its performance in terms of accuracy and hallucination rates. By accurately identifying entities and augmenting retrieval information, the model is better equipped to handle long-tail entity queries, providing more detailed and entity-specific knowledge in its responses.\n\nThe SnapNTell model's architecture, as shown in image1 and image2, illustrates how entity detection and retrieval augmentation are integrated to improve performance.\n\nThe final answer is that the inclusion of entity detection (ED) and retrieval augmentation (RA) in the SnapNTell model leads to a substantial improvement in accuracy and a reduction in hallucination rates, making it more effective in handling entity-centric VQA tasks."}

For instance, experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that models pretrained on Common Crawl data achieve higher accuracy compared to those pretrained on News Crawl data, which consists of individual sentences [3]. \n\nMoreover, the choice of modeling approach also impacts performance. The cloze-driven training regime proves to be more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately. A comparison of different loss types in Table 5 indicates that the cloze loss performs significantly better than the bilm loss, and combining the two does not improve over the cloze loss alone [4].\n\nThe impact of pretraining data size is also notable. Figure 3 illustrates that more training data can significantly increase accuracy, with results suggesting that additional training data would likely continue to improve performance [7].\n\nIn terms of specific modeling approaches, stacking task-specific architectures on top of pretrained two-tower models yields state-of-the-art performance levels for tasks like NER and constituency parsing. Fine-tuning these models gives the biggest gain, as shown in Table 3 and Table 9 [2][9].\n\nOverall, the combination of pretraining data and modeling approaches plays a crucial role in determining performance on NLP tasks.\n\n![More training data leads to higher GLUE scores](image7)\n![Comparison of different models and their performance](image1)\n![Model architecture for predicting tokens](image8) \nThe best answer is: Combining pretraining on large corpora with effective modeling approaches like cloze-driven training and fine-tuning yields better performance on NLP tasks."}

According to the provided tables, when examining the effect of aligning word embeddings between the source and target languages, we observe that the gains or losses are essentially insignificant across all languages, as shown in Table 4. This suggests that a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary in bilingual scenarios.\n\n![Effect of Word Embedding Alignment](image3)\n\nFor instance, in the case of GL → EN and PT → EN, the BLEU scores with unaligned embeddings are 12.8 and 30.8, respectively, while with aligned embeddings, they are 11.5 and 30.6, indicating a minimal decrease or no significant change.\n\nHowever, it's also noted that aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks when a single encoder is used for both of the source languages [2].\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings seems to be more significant for more similar translation pairs. For example, GL/PT shows the largest gains, and BE/RU showing a small decrease [2].\n\nTo summarize, pre-trained embeddings can be surprisingly effective in some cases, providing gains of up to 20 BLEU points in the most favorable setting [3]. \n\nTherefore, the alignment of word embeddings may not necessarily lead to significant improvements in BLEU scores across different language translation tasks."}

For instance, Table 3 shows that languages like ES, FR, and IT, which are more similar to the target language PT, exhibit larger increases in BLEU scores compared to more distant languages like RU and HE [1].\n\nThe role of training set size is also crucial, as pre-training tends to be more effective when there is a moderate amount of training data but not so little that the system cannot capture the basic characteristics of the language. This is evident from the trend observed in the BLEU scores across different training set sizes, where pre-training shows the most significant gains in the range of 3-4 [4].\n\nLanguage similarity plays a role in the efficacy of pre-training, with more similar language pairs showing larger gains. For example, the gains in BLEU scores are roughly in order of their similarity, with GL/PT showing the largest gains and BE/RU showing a small decrease [11].\n\nFurthermore, pre-training helps more when the size of the training data is small. Figure 2 illustrates that pre-training improves the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, particularly for low-frequency words in the training corpus [7].\n\n## Conclusion\nPre-training affects translation accuracy across different language pairs by providing better representations of less frequent concepts, and its effectiveness is influenced by language similarity and training set size.\n\n![Pre-training effect on BLEU scores across language pairs](image1)\n\nThe image shows that pre-training leads to significant improvements in BLEU scores for certain language pairs.\n\n![Effect of training set size on pre-training effectiveness](image2)\n\nThis graph indicates that pre-training is particularly effective for smaller training sets.\n\n![Translation examples with and without pre-training](image5)\n\nThe table highlights the improvement in translation quality with pre-training, especially for low-resource languages.\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is also evident in the qualitative analysis of translations from GL to EN, which showed one of the largest increases in quantitative numbers [6]. \n\nPre-training not only helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed.\n\nPre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.\n\nTherefore, pre-training can be highly effective in improving translation accuracy, especially in low-resource scenarios."}

For instance, [8] shows that transferring different layers of the model can have varying effects on performance across datasets D1, D2, D3, and D4.\n\n| Settings               | D1   Acc. | Macro-F1 | D2   Acc. | Macro-F1 | D3   Acc. | Macro-F1 | D4   Acc. | Macro-F1 |\n|------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| LSTM only              | 78.09     | 67.85    | 71.04     | 66.80    | 78.95    | 65.30    | 83.85     | 67.11    |\n| Embeddings only        | 77.12     | 67.19    | 69.12     | 65.06    | 80.13    | 67.04    | 84.12     | 70.11    |\n| Output layer only      | 76.88     | 66.81    | 69.63     | 66.07    | 78.30    | 64.49    | 82.55     | 62.83    |\n| Without LSTM           | 77.45     | 67.25    | 69.82     | 66.63    | 80.27    | 68.02    | 84.80     | 70.27    |\n| Without embeddings      | 77.97     | 67.96    | 70.59     | 67.16    | 79.08    | 65.56    | 83.94     | 68.79    |\n| Without output layer    | 78.36     | 68.06    | 71.10     | 67.87    | 80.82    | 67.68    | 84.71     | 70.48    |\n\nFrom the table in image4, we can see that different settings of transferring layers have varying impacts on the model's performance across the datasets.\n\n### Trends with Varying Percentage of Document-Level Training Examples\n\nWhen examining how the model's performance changes with an increasing percentage of document-level training examples, we observe notable trends [4]. The improvements in accuracy and macro-F1 scores are evident as the percentage of document-level training examples increases from 0.0 to 1.0 for the PRET + MULT model.\n\n![The changes in accuracy and macro-F1 scores with an increasing number of document-level training examples.](image3)\n\nThe graph in image3 illustrates that as the percentage of document-level training examples increases, the model's performance improves across all datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4), with particularly sharp increases in macro-F1 scores for D3 and D4 when the percentage changes from 0 to 0.4. This indicates that incorporating document-level knowledge significantly enhances the model's ability to classify sentiments accurately, especially in datasets with limited aspect-level training data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating document-level knowledge into aspect-level sentiment classification models can lead to improved performance across different datasets. The extent of improvement varies with the specific components transferred and the dataset in question. Notably, transferring the LSTM and embedding layers tends to be more beneficial than transferring the output layer alone. Moreover, as the percentage of document-level training examples increases, so does the model's performance, with significant gains observed in certain datasets.\n\nThe effectiveness of knowledge transfer from document-level to aspect-level sentiment classification is evident, suggesting that leveraging larger, more easily obtainable document-level datasets can help mitigate the challenges posed by the limited availability of aspect-level annotated data.\n\nTherefore, **the inclusion of different components in the model affects its performance across datasets, with notable improvements observed when transferring knowledge from document-level data, especially in terms of accuracy and macro-F1 scores**."}

This is crucial for adapting to new domains with limited data.\n\n## Fine-Tuning Strategies: GEM vs. EWC\n\n- **GEM (Gradient Episodic Memory)** and **EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation)** are two continual learning techniques used to prevent catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new domain data.\n- **GEM** keeps a small number of samples from the source domains and applies a constraint on the gradient to prevent the loss on the stored samples from increasing.\n- **EWC** uses the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix as a regularizer for adapting to the target domain data.\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\n[4] indicates that fine-tuning with GEM outperforms the naive fine-tuning approach on new domains. For instance, on the attraction domain, GEM achieves a 34.73% joint accuracy, while naive fine-tuning only achieves 29.39%. This suggests that GEM is more effective in maintaining the performance of the original domains while adapting to a new one.\n\n## Slot Similarities and Performance\n\n[2] discusses the impact of slot similarities across domains. It highlights that knowledge about certain slots (like people, area, price range, and day) is successfully transferred from other domains to hotel and restaurant. However, for unseen slots that only appear in one domain (e.g., parking, stars, and internet in hotel, and food in restaurant), it's challenging for the model to track correctly.\n\n## Visualizing Performance and Slot Error Rates\n\n- **Table 3** [3] and [5] provide a detailed comparison of the performance of different fine-tuning strategies across various domains, showing that GEM generally outperforms EWC and naive fine-tuning in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting.\n- **Image 4** shows the slot error rates across different domains, indicating which slots are more challenging for the model to predict accurately.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFine-tuning strategies like GEM and EWC play a significant role in adapting dialogue state tracking models to new domains. GEM appears to be more effective than EWC in preventing performance degradation on original domains while adapting to a new domain. Slot similarities across domains significantly affect performance, with some slots being more easily transferable than others.\n\nThe effectiveness of GEM over EWC and the impact of slot similarities on performance can be directly observed from the provided tables and figures, particularly:\n![Fine-tuning comparison and slot error rates](image3)\n\nThis image illustrates the performance of different fine-tuning strategies, including GEM and EWC, across various domains and slots.\n\nIn conclusion, GEM outperforms EWC in adapting to new domain data with less forgetting on original domains, and slot similarities significantly impact the model's performance, with certain slots being more transferable than others."}

For example, the table below shows the performance of Google Translate on Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian with and without adjectives [10].\n\n| Language | Original | +Adj | $\\Delta$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ES | 53.1 | 63.5 | +10.4 |\n| RU | 37.7 | 48.9 | +11.2 |\n| UK | 38.4 | 42.9 | +4.5 |\n\n### Examples of Biased Translations\n\nThe following table provides examples of biased translations [2].\n\n| Source | [Target lang.] Predicted translation | Phenomenon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen. | [ES] Al conserje no le gusta el panadero porque ella siempre desordena la cocina. | Biased translation, giving \"baker\" a male inflection, with a mismatched pronoun reference. |\n| The janitor does not like the pretty baker because she always messes up the kitchen. | [ES] Al conserje no le gusta la panadera bonita porque ella siempre desordena la cocina. | Adding a stereotypically female adjective \"fixes\" the translation. |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe study provides the first large-scale multilingual quantitative evidence for gender bias in machine translation. The results show that all tested MT systems are prone to translate based on gender stereotypes rather than meaningful context. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/gabrielStanovsky/mt_gender.\n\nThe final answer is: \nMachine translation systems exhibit significant gender bias across languages, with varying performance and accuracy levels, and adding stereotypically female adjectives can improve translation accuracy and reduce bias. \n![The performance of Google Translate on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across languages, showing a significant difference in accuracy between the two types of roles.](image1)"}

This bias is evident in the performance differences across various languages and systems.\n\n#### Performance Across Languages\n\nThe performance of MT systems varies significantly across languages, with some systems performing better on certain languages than others. For instance, the accuracy of Google Translate across different languages is as follows: Spanish (53.1%), French (63.6%), Italian (39.6%), Russian (37.7%), Ukrainian (38.4%), Hebrew (53.7%), Arabic (48.5%), and German (59.4%) [1].\n\n#### Impact of Stereotypical Adjustments\n\nAdjusting translations with stereotypical gender adjectives can improve gender bias accuracy. For example, adding adjectives like \"handsome\" or \"pretty\" to male or female entities can affect translations. In Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian, this adjustment significantly reduces bias, as shown in Table 4: \n|  | Original | +Adj | $\\Delta$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ES | 53.1 | 63.5 | +10.4 |\n| RU | 37.7 | 48.9 | +11.2 |\n| UK | 38.4 | 42.9 | +4.5 |\n\nThis table indicates that adding adjectives can improve accuracy, suggesting that stereotype-based adjustments can impact gender bias accuracy [9].\n\n#### Performance on Stereotypical and Non-Stereotypical Roles\n\nMT systems perform better on stereotypical gender role assignments than on non-stereotypical ones. Figure 2 depicts Google Translate's absolute accuracies on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across all tested languages, showing a significant performance gap [2].\n\n#### Accuracy Comparison\n\nA comparison of performance across different systems and languages is provided in the table below [1]:\n![Performance comparison across different systems and languages](image1)\n![{Performance comparison across different systems and languages}](image1)\n\n#### Stereotypical vs Non-Stereotypical Gender Roles\n\nThe bar chart shows that for many target languages, a significant gap exists between stereotypical and non-stereotypical role accuracy [4]:\n![Stereotypical vs Non-Stereotypical Gender Roles Accuracy](image4)\n\n### Conclusion \n\nThe impact of stereotype-based adjustments on gender bias accuracy in machine translation varies across languages and systems but generally shows that adjustments can improve accuracy and mitigate bias, especially when adding adjectives to entities. Therefore, stereotype-based adjustments can help reduce gender bias in machine translation by providing more context and improving translation accuracy."}

The provided text and image quotes offer insights into experiments conducted on the HotpotQA dataset, focusing on the impact of distractors, question types, and model architectures.\n\n## Analysis of Training and Evaluation Strategies\n\n### Impact of Distractors\nThe use of distractors in question answering (QA) tasks can significantly affect model performance. Distractors are paragraphs that are not directly relevant to answering a question but can potentially mislead the model. The effectiveness of a model can be evaluated based on its ability to handle different types of distractors.\n\n### Question Types and Reasoning\nQuestions can be categorized based on their requirement for multi-hop or single-hop reasoning. Multi-hop questions require information from more than one paragraph to be answered, while single-hop questions can be answered using a single paragraph.\n\n### Experimental Results\n- **Original Model Performance**: The original model achieves an F1 score of 67.08 on standard distractors but sees a decline when tested with adversarial distractors, dropping to 46.84 F1. However, when retrained on adversarial distractors, the model recovers most of its original accuracy, increasing to 60.10 F1 [4][1].\n- **Effect of Entity Type Matching**: Filtering paragraphs by entity type (e.g., person) before selecting distractors further impacts performance, reducing the F1 score to 40.73 but recovering to 58.42 when trained on entity-matched distractors [1].\n- **Single-Hop vs. Multi-Hop Reasoning**: A single-hop BERT-based model achieves 67 F1, comparable to state-of-the-art multi-hop models, suggesting that many questions may not require true multi-hop reasoning [6].\n\n## Impact on F1 Scores\nThe F1 score is a measure of a model's accuracy in question answering tasks, with higher scores indicating better performance.\n\n### Training Data and Evaluation Data\n| Evaluation Data | Original | Adversarial |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Original | 67.08 | 59.12 |\n| Adversarial | 46.84 | 60.10 |\n| + Type | 40.73 | 58.42 |\n\n### Discussion\n- The table shows that a simple single-paragraph BERT model performs competitively, achieving 67.08 F1 on standard distractors. However, when faced with open-domain settings or more challenging distractors, its performance drops significantly.\n- **Open-domain Performance**: The model achieves 38.40 F1 in open-domain settings with 10 paragraphs and 39.12 F1 with 500 paragraphs, indicating difficulties in retrieving relevant information [7].\n\n## Conclusion\nDifferent training and evaluation strategies significantly affect F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks. The use of distractors, question types, and model capabilities all play crucial roles in determining model performance. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing more robust and accurate QA models.\n\n![Training and Evaluation Impact](image8)\nThe F1 score variations are primarily due to differences in training and evaluation strategies, including distractor types and question requirements."}

However, this result is largely due to the exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset [1]. \n\n### Impact of Adversarial Dataset\n\nWhen evaluated on an adversarial dataset designed to eliminate these cues, all models achieve random accuracy. Specifically, BERT's performance drops substantially, indicating that its high performance on the original dataset was not due to genuine argument comprehension but rather the exploitation of statistical cues [8].\n\n### Performance Comparison\n\n| Model | Mean | Median | Max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BERT | $0.504 \\pm 0.01$ | $0.505$ | $0.533$ |\n\nThe table shows BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset, with a mean accuracy of $0.504$ and a maximum of $0.533$, much lower than its performance on the original dataset [3].\n\n### Key Findings\n\n- **Elimination of Spurious Cues**: The adversarial dataset successfully removes the cues that models were exploiting, providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension.\n- **Performance Drop**: BERT's peak performance drops to $53\\%$ on the adversarial dataset, with mean and median at $50\\%$ [6].\n- **Robust Evaluation**: The adversarial dataset provides a more robust assessment and should be adopted as the standard in future work on ARCT.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's impressive performance on the original ARCT dataset was largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues rather than genuine argument comprehension. This finding underscores the importance of using more robust evaluation methods to assess the true capabilities of machine learning models [1]. \n\nThe conclusions that can be drawn from such results are that previous high performance metrics may not accurately reflect a model's ability to comprehend arguments, and there is a need for more robust evaluation methods like the adversarial dataset to ensure meaningful assessments [3]. \n\nBERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension as its performance fell to essentially random on the adversarial dataset.\n\n![The adversarial data setup impact on BERT performance](image2)\n\nThe adversarial dataset eliminates the problem by mirroring the distributions of cues around both labels, ensuring that models can no longer rely on these spurious cues to achieve high performance [9]. \n\nTherefore, future research should utilize such adversarial datasets for a more accurate assessment of argument comprehension capabilities [3]."}

According to [3] and [8], this is because the neutral backoff model maps UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word, reducing the number of unique outputs it predicts and thereby lowering sensitivity.\n\n### Open Vocabulary Models\n\nIn contrast, open vocabulary models (char-only, word+char, word-piece) consider every unique combination of characters differently. The pass-through version is more sensitive than the background variant for word+char and word-piece models, as it passes words as is. However, for word-only models, pass-through is less sensitive because all OOV character combinations are rendered identical [6].\n\n## Impact on Sensitivity and WER\n\n- **Neutral Backoff**: Offers a balance with lower sensitivity and WER, making it effective against various attack types.\n- **Background Model**: Provides a lower error rate but can have higher sensitivity compared to the neutral backoff.\n- **Pass-through**: Tends to have higher sensitivity and WER in certain settings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe neutral backoff strategy offers a favorable trade-off between sensitivity and WER, particularly for closed vocabulary models, making it robust against different types of attacks. The choice of backoff strategy significantly impacts the model's performance, with the neutral backoff variant often providing the highest robustness across most attack types.\n\nThe sensitivity and WER differ between closed and open vocabulary models under different backoff strategies, with neutral backoff generally showing lower sensitivity and effective WER management.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe neutral backoff strategy tends to offer a favorable balance between low sensitivity and word error rate (WER), particularly for closed vocabulary models, making it robust against various attack types. ![Trade-off between WER and sensitivity](image3) shows this relationship, where neutral backoff has lower WER and sensitivity compared to pass-through and background models."}

This significant adjustment indicates that without this amortization, the gross profit would have been higher.\n\n#### Operating Income Adjustments\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets:** The adjustment for amortization of intangible assets to arrive at core operating income was $-11,657$ million [2]. This suggests that a substantial portion of operating income adjustments came from intangible asset amortization.\n\n### 2021 Adjustments\n\n#### Gross Profit Adjustments\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets:** The adjustment for amortization of intangible assets to arrive at core gross profit was $-11,751$ million [1]. This shows a similar trend to 2020, where amortization significantly impacted gross profit.\n\n#### Operating Income Adjustments\n- **Amortization of Intangible Assets:** The adjustment for amortization of intangible assets to arrive at core operating income was $-8,641$ million [1]. This indicates that amortization was a key factor in adjusting operating income to core results.\n\n### Impact Analysis\n\nThe adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and other items significantly impacted both gross profit and operating income when transitioning from IFRS results to core results in 2020 and 2021.\n\n- **2020 Gross Profit and Operating Income:** The amortization of intangible assets was $-2,935$ million for gross profit and $-2,999$ million for operating income [image2].\n- **2021 Gross Profit and Operating Income:** Similarly, in 2021, the amortization of intangible assets was $-3,419$ million for gross profit and $-3,528$ million for operating income [image1].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and other items had a substantial impact on transitioning from IFRS results to core results for both gross profit and operating income in 2020 and 2021. These adjustments primarily involved significant amortization expenses that were factored out to present a core financial performance.\n\nThe financial impact is clearly shown in the tables detailing adjustments to gross profit and operating income, emphasizing the importance of understanding these adjustments for accurate financial analysis.\n\n![Adjustments in 2020 and 2021](image3)\n\nIn conclusion, the adjustments primarily involved amortization of intangible assets and other items that significantly altered the financial performance metrics from IFRS to core results, highlighting the need to consider these when evaluating the company's financial health and operational efficiency."}

These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. The company continues to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, prioritizing safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.\n\n### Asset Allocations and Net Investment Income\n\nThe asset allocations reflect these changes, with a decrease in income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. \n\n#### Cash, Cash Equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills\n\n- 2021: **$90,688 million**\n- 2020: **$67,082 million**\n- 2019: Not directly comparable but remained significant.\n\n#### Fixed Maturity Securities\n\n- Carrying value in 2021: **$16,386 million** [6]\n\n### Earnings from Insurance Investment Income\n\nEarnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased **4.6%** compared to 2020 and declined **8.9%** in 2020 versus 2019 [10]. The decrease in earnings was negatively affected by declines in interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\n### Pre-Tax Net Investment Income\n\nPre-tax net investment income was **$5,649 million** in 2021, **$5,949 million** in 2020, and **$6,600 million** in 2019, reflecting a decline over the years [7].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by lower interest income due to decreased interest rates on short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as reflected in the company's asset allocations.\n\nThe asset allocation reflects a significant holding of **cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills** (`$90,688 million` in 2021) [6], indicating a conservative investment approach prioritizing liquidity and safety.\n\n![Decline in Interest Income](image6)\n\nThe decline in net investment income is closely related to the decrease in interest-earning assets and the low-interest-rate environment.\n\nPre-tax earnings decline was partially due to lower interest income."}

For international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better.\n\n- **Pension Benefits:** The discount rate decreased from 1.7% in 2021 to 3.7% in 2022, and from 3.1% to 5.0% for Other Retiree Benefits.\n- **Discount Rate Changes:** \n    | Year | Pension Benefits | Other Retiree Benefits |\n    |:----:|:------------------:|:--------------------:|\n    | 2022 |        3.7%        |          5.0%         |\n    | 2021 |        1.7%        |          3.2%         |\n\n\n### Expected Return on Plan Assets Changes\n\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption impacts defined benefit expense since many of the defined benefit pension plans and the primary OPRB plan are partially funded.\n\n- **Pension Benefits:** The expected return on plan assets decreased from 6.5% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits:** The expected return on plan assets remained constant at 8.4% from 2021 to 2022.\n\n### Impact on Net Amount Recognized\n\nA change in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets can significantly impact the net amount recognized in the financial statements. \n\n- A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $\\S135$ million for pension benefits and $\\S10$ million for OPRB.\n- The change in the expected return on plan assets can impact the annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $\\S125$ million.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe changes in discount rates and expected returns on plan assets can significantly impact the net amount recognized in the financial statements for both Pension Benefits and Other Retiree Benefits.

This substantial rise is primarily attributed to [2][7]:\n- **Net Income**: Increased from €1,423 million in 2020 to €1,746 million in 2021, indicating a significant improvement in operational performance.\n- **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**: OCI that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss increased to €542 million from -€593 million, driven by improvements in currency translation differences and cash flow hedges.\n\n### Balance Sheet Components\n\n#### Equity\n\n- **Subscribed Capital and Capital Reserves**: Increased due to a capital increase in March 2021, which raised subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million.\n- **Unappropriated Net Income**: Decreased by €856 million due to dividend distribution but was more than offset by net income for the year, resulting in an overall increase of €497 million.\n- **Equity Ratio**: Declined from 76% to 55%, primarily due to the significant increase in loan liabilities, which was partially offset by the capital increase.\n\n#### Cash Flows\n\n- **Operating Activities**: Cash generated from operating activities decreased to €952 million from €1,188 million in 2020, mainly due to higher income tax payments.\n- **Investing Activities**: Significant cash outflow of €14,009 million, primarily due to additional capital payments for the acquisition of Varian.\n- **Financing Activities**: Noted a net inflow of €9,613 million, mainly from loans raised to finance the Varian acquisition and a capital increase.\n\n### Key Financial Highlights\n\n- **Revenue Growth**: Comparable revenue growth was 19%, at the upper end of the expected range.\n- **Net Financial Income**: Improved by €436 million, primarily due to higher income from equity investments and profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH.\n- **Earnings Per Share**: Basic and diluted earnings per share were €1.57 in 2021, up from €1.41 in 2020.\n\n### Visual Insights\n\n![Comprehensive Income Comparison](image1)\nThe comprehensive income table highlights the significant increase in net income and OCI.\n\n![Financial Performance Overview](image2)\nThis table provides an overview of Siemens Healthineers AG's financial performance, including revenue, gross profit, and net income.\n\n![Cash Flow Comparison](image3)\nThe cash flow statement shows a decrease in operating activities but significant inflows from financing activities.\n\n![Equity Movement](image5)\nThe equity movement table details the changes in equity components, including capital increases and dividend distributions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe fiscal year 2021 saw substantial improvements in comprehensive income and strategic financial maneuvers, including a significant capital increase and acquisition activities. These developments reflect Siemens Healthineers AG's growth and strategic positioning in the market.\n\nThe key differences in comprehensive income and balance sheet components between fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are primarily driven by the acquisition of Varian and a capital increase, leading to significant changes in equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income."}

This disparity suggests that Cloud & Cognitive Software was a stronger contributor to IBM's financial performance that year.\n\n### Factors Contributing to Financial Results\n\nSeveral factors contributed to these financial results [3][8]:\n- **Cloud & Cognitive Software**: The growth in this segment can be attributed to its strategic focus areas, including data and AI, automation, and security. The acquisition of Red Hat, which closed in 2019, likely had a positive impact on these figures, given its contribution to hybrid cloud and AI capabilities.\n  \n- **Global Business Services (GBS)**: The performance in GBS was driven by strong growth in Consulting, led by offerings that enabled clients' digital journeys. These included cognitive technology and data platform services, application modernization, and next-generation enterprise applications, as well as offerings that use AI to help clients unlock new opportunities and realize productivity improvements.\n\n### Gross Margin and Pre-tax Margin\n\nThe gross margin for Cloud & Cognitive Software was 77.1%, while for Global Business Services, it was 27.7%.

This could be due to higher sales, improved profit margins, or better management of working capital.\n\n3. **Financial Health:** These changes could indicate an improvement in the company's financial health, suggesting that it is generating more cash and possibly investing in growth opportunities or returning value to shareholders.\n\n4. **Operational Efficiency:** The ability to increase cash flow from operations while also growing total assets might suggest improvements in operational efficiency or successful strategic initiatives.\n\n5. **Investment and Funding:** The company might be using the increased cash flow to invest in new projects, reduce debt, or distribute dividends, which could further influence its financial position and operational capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe increase in total assets and cash flow from operating activities for the consolidated segment from 2020 to 2021 indicates positive trends in the company's financial performance and operational efficiency.

This change is primarily attributed to decreases in **Card Member receivables** (from $\\S68,029$ million to $\\S53,581$ million) and **Investment securities** (from $\\S29,824$ million to $\\S20,548$ million), partially offset by increases in **Card Member loans** (from $\\S25,908$ million to $\\S26,587$ million) [image1].\n\nThe **total liabilities** decreased from $\\S168,383$ million in 2020 to $\\S166,371$ million in 2021, a reduction of $\\S1,712$ million.

This change is largely driven by higher **net income** ($\\S8,060$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S3,135$ million in 2020) and a smaller decrease in **other comprehensive income** ($\\S-50$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S-158$ million in 2020) [image2].\n\n### Cash Flows\n\nThe entity's **net cash provided by operating activities** was $\\S14,645$ million in 2021, compared to $\\S5,591$ million in 2020. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital accounts, such as **provisions for credit losses** ($\\S1,419$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S4,730$ million in 2020) and **accounts payable and other liabilities** ($\\S5,389$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S2,025$ million in 2020) [image7].\n\nThe **net cash used in investing activities** was $\\S(14,933)$ million in 2021, compared to $\\S(9,068)$ million in 2020, mainly due to increased **purchase of investments** ($\\S(1,517)$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S(20,562)$ million in 2020) and **net (decrease) increase in Card Member loans and receivables** ($\\S(27,557)$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S(11,047)$ million in 2020).\n\nThe **net cash used in financing activities** was $\\S(10,937)$ million in 2021, compared to $\\S8,519$ million in 2020, primarily due to **repurchase of common shares** ($\\S(7,652)$ million in 2021 vs. $\\S15,593$ million in 2020).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe entity experienced a decrease in total assets and total liabilities from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by changes in Card Member receivables, Investment securities, and Customer deposits. Despite these decreases, the entity reported higher comprehensive income in 2021, mainly due to increased net income.

In the European Union, the decline in cigarette market share for major brands like Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield contrasts with the growth in HEETS market share. In Eastern Europe, the significant increase in heated tobacco units helped mitigate the decline in cigarette volumes. \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift towards heated tobacco products, consistent with the company's overall performance and strategic shifts in product offerings. \n\nThe growth in heated tobacco units across regions, particularly in Italy, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, was a key driver of the changes in shipment volumes [1]. \n\nOverall, the data indicates a regional variation in the adoption and impact of heated tobacco units on cigarette shipment volumes. \n\nThe company's performance in these markets reflects changing consumer preferences and product dynamics. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe shipment volumes for cigarettes decreased, while those for heated tobacco units increased in both the European Union and Eastern Europe from 2019 to 2020. \n\nThe shift towards heated tobacco units is evident, particularly in regions like Eastern Europe, where HTUs increased by **55.3%**. \n\nThis trend aligns with the company's strategic focus on heated tobacco products as a growth area. \n\n![European Union Key Data](image2)\n![Eastern Europe PMI Shipment Volume](image8)"}

In 2021, Chevron paid $10,179 million in cash dividends [5].\n\n## 2: Impact on Equity Structure\nThe payment of cash dividends reduces the company's retained earnings, which is a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2021, Chevron Corporation's stockholders' equity was $139,067 million, with retained earnings of $165,546 million. The cash dividends paid in 2021 were $10,179 million, which directly reduces retained earnings.\n\n## 3: Treasury Stock Transactions\nTreasury stock transactions involve the purchase and issuance of the company's own shares. In 2021, Chevron had net sales (purchases) of treasury shares of $(1,383) million, indicating they repurchased shares [5].\n\n## 4: Impact on Equity Structure and Cash Flow\n- **Equity Structure:** Treasury stock is reported at cost. The purchase of treasury shares reduces stockholders' equity, while issuances increase it. In 2021, Chevron had 2,442,676,580 shares issued and outstanding, with 517,490,263 shares held in treasury at cost of $(41,464) million.\n\n## 5: Financial Statement Impact\nThe Consolidated Statement of Equity provides a detailed breakdown of changes in equity components, including the impact of cash dividends, treasury stock transactions, and other comprehensive income.\n\n## 6: Cash Flow Impact\nThe cash flow impact of these transactions can be seen in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash dividends paid are reported under financing activities, with $10,179 million paid in 2021. Treasury stock transactions also affect cash flow; in 2021, there was a net outflow related to share repurchases.\n\n## 7: Conclusion on Impact\nBoth cash dividends and treasury stock transactions significantly impact Chevron's equity structure and cash flow. Cash dividends directly reduce retained earnings and cash, while treasury stock transactions affect the number of shares outstanding and stockholders' equity.\n\nGiven the information:\n- Cash dividends in 2021: $10,179 million [5]\n- Treasury stock activity: Chevron had net sales (purchases) of treasury shares of $(1,383) million.\n\nThe direct and concise answer to how both cash dividends and treasury stock transactions impacted Chevron's equity structure and cash flow in 2021 is:\n\nChevron's equity structure was impacted by cash dividends reducing retained earnings and treasury stock transactions affecting the number of shares outstanding and stockholders' equity. The cash flow was impacted through financing activities for cash dividends and investing/ financing activities for treasury stock transactions.\n\n![Chevron’s cash flow and equity](image6)"}

It is expressed as a percentage of RWA and leverage exposure. The requirement for TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18%.\n\n## 2: Changes in RWA Components\n- **Credit Risk RWA**: Increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily from an increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility and an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E* TRADE acquisition [12].\n- **Market Risk RWA**: Increased in 2020 under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher market volatility [8].\n- **Operational Risk RWA**: Decreased under the Advanced Approach in 2020, reflecting a decline in the frequency and severity of litigation-related losses [1].\n\n## 3: Impact on External TLAC\nExternal TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital, as well as eligible long-term debt (LTD). The TLAC buffer requirements are on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements.\n\n## 4: TLAC as a Percentage of RWA\nAt December 31, 2019, the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA was 49.9%, and at December 31, 2020, it was 47.7% [7]. This decrease indicates that while the absolute values of TLAC and RWA might have changed, the ratio decreased, suggesting that the increase in RWA had a dilutive effect on the TLAC ratio.\n\n## 5: Conclusion\nGiven that TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020, and considering the increases in credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, along with the decrease in operational risk RWA, we can infer that the changes in RWA components, particularly the increases in credit and market risk RWA, contributed to this shift. The decrease in TLAC as a percentage of RWA could imply that the increase in RWA outpaced the increase in TLAC, or there was a change in the composition of RWA that affected the TLAC ratio.\n\nThe decrease in TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% to 47.7% reflects changes in risk-weighted assets and TLAC requirements.\n\n![Changes in Risk Weighted Assets and TLAC](image3)\n\nThis table shows changes in various risk-weighted assets categories.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{47.7%}$"}

Service costs increased from RMB 14,967 million in 2019 to RMB 17,478 million in 2020 and RMB 18,992 million (US$2,980 million) in 2021, indicating a steady rise in operational expenses related to supporting online music services and social entertainment services.\n- **Other Cost of Revenues**: This includes employee benefits expenses, advertising agency fees, and others. Other cost of revenues increased by 20.0% from RMB 2,373 million in 2020 to RMB 2,848 million (US$447 million) in 2021, primarily due to higher agency fees and payment channel fees [2].\n\n### Operating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses consist of selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.\n\n- **Selling and Marketing Expenses**: These expenses increased from RMB 2,041 million in 2019 to RMB 2,475 million in 2020 and RMB 2,678 million (US$420 million) in 2021. The increase is primarily due to higher branding and user acquisition costs, salaries and other benefits paid to sales and marketing personnel, and amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions.\n- **General and Administrative Expenses**: These expenses mainly consist of R&D expenses, salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel, and research and development personnel. General and administrative expenses increased from RMB 2,703 million in 2019 to RMB 3,101 million in 2020 and RMB 4,009 million (US$629 million) in 2021 [2][6].\n\n### Implications for Financial Management \n\nThe changes in cost structure and operating expenses indicate several trends:\n\n1. **Increasing Operational Costs**: The steady increase in cost of revenues and operating expenses suggests that the company has been investing heavily in its operations, possibly to expand its user base, improve services, and enhance its competitive advantages in product and technology innovations.\n\n2. **Focus on Research and Development**: The significant increase in R&D expenses from RMB 1,159 million in 2019 to RMB 2,339 million (US$367 million) in 2021 indicates a strong focus on innovation and technology [5].\n\n3. **Efficient Financial Management**: Despite the increases in various expenses, the company managed to maintain a profit for the year, with adjusted profit for the year (Non-IFRS financial measure) increasing from RMB 4,540 million in 2019 to RMB 4,903 million in 2021 [4].\n\n4. **Cash Flow Management**: The company's cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year increased from RMB 15,426 million in 2020 to RMB 11,128 million (US$1,746 million) in 2021, indicating effective cash flow management despite increased expenses [7].\n\n### Conclusion \n\nThe evolution of the cost structure and operating expenses from 2019 to 2021 indicates that the company has been strategically investing in its growth and development, focusing on research and development, user acquisition, and operational efficiency.

This decrease was primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million, partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million.\n\n### Impact on Cash Flows\n\n- **Cash Flows**: Financing activities were a net use of $9,721 million in 2020 compared to a net source of $9,042 million in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18,763 million was driven by [2]:\n  - A decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year.\n  - A decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables, primarily driven by the wind-down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations.\n\n### Impact on Equity\n\n- **Equity**: Total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to [6]:\n  - Dividends paid of $5,797 million.\n  - A decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million, mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments.\n  - Partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million.\n\n### Global Financing Metrics\n\n- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: The Global Financing return on equity remained at 25.8% at December 31, 2020 [3].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe financial changes in noncurrent assets and long-term debt between 2019 and 2020 had several implications for IBM's overall financial standing:\n- The decrease in long-term debt and noncurrent assets indicates a strategic portfolio management approach, focusing on lower funding requirements due to a decline in financing assets.\n- The financing activities' net use of cash and changes in equity highlight IBM's dynamic management of its financial structure, including dividend payments and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n- The stable return on equity suggests that despite these changes, Global Financing maintained a consistent profitability level.\n\nOverall, these changes reflect IBM's ongoing efforts to manage its financial portfolio actively, balancing debt, equity, and asset management to maintain financial stability and profitability.\n\nThe key financial metrics are as follows:\n- **Noncurrent Assets Increase**: $3,039 million ![Financial Data](image8)\n- **Long-term Debt Decrease**: $1,361 million ![Debt Overview](image6)\n- **Financing Activities**: Net use of $9,721 million ![Cash Flow Statement](image5)\n- **Equity Decrease**: $258 million ![Equity Changes](image6)\n- **Global Financing Return on Equity**: 25.8% ![Return on Equity](image3)"}

These changes are reflected in the company's consolidated statements of changes in equity.\n\n### Issued Capital\nThe issued capital increased from € 1,075,000,000 to € 1,128,000,000, representing a rise of 53,000,000 shares. This increase was primarily due to a capital increase in March 2021, where 53,000,000 new shares were issued to institutional investors at a placement price of €44.10 per share [12].\n\n### Capital Reserves\nThe capital reserves also experienced a notable change, increasing from €10,801 million to €15,818 million. This increase is attributed to the issuance of new shares in equity in March 2021 for financing the acquisition of Varian, where capital reserves rose by €2,284 million [8].\n\n### Retained Earnings\nRetained earnings decreased by €856 million due to the dividend distributed for fiscal year 2020. However, net income for the year resulted in an increase in unappropriated net income of €497 million overall.\n\n### Equity Ratio\nThe equity ratio declined from 76% to 55%, primarily due to the significant increase in loan liabilities, which was offset by the capital increase.\n\n### Comprehensive Income\nComprehensive income, net of taxes, was €700 million, compared to €-598 million in the previous year. This change is mainly attributed to higher income from equity investments and a profit transfer from Siemens Healthcare GmbH, which increased by €420 million to €1,879 million [7][4].\n\n### Income Tax Expenses\nIncome tax expenses recognized in the consolidated statements of income were €658 million, with an effective tax rate of 27.4%. The total income taxes included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or directly recognized in equity were €653 million [2][1].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe significant changes in equity components from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021, include a capital increase of €53 million, an increase in capital reserves of €2,284 million, and a decrease in retained earnings due to dividend distribution. These changes reflect the company's strategic actions, such as financing acquisitions and managing its capital structure.\n\nThe significant changes in equity components are primarily driven by the capital increase and the issuance of new shares for financing the acquisition of Varian, leading to an increase in equity from €9,769 million to €16,339 million.\n\n![The significant changes in equity components](image6)\n\nThe issuance of new shares led to an increase in issued capital and capital reserves.\n\n![Equity increase due to capital reserves and issuance of shares](image8)"}

For instance, one project had an expenditure of ₹1.23 crore, another ₹0.18 crore, and ₹0.14 crore for different locations.\n  - **Implementation Methods:** These projects were implemented through agencies like Sanjeevani Institute for Empowerment & Development, BAIF Development Research Foundation, and Aga Khan Rural Support Programme India.\n\n### Implementation Methods\n\n- **COVID Relief:** The implementation methods for COVID Relief projects were primarily through non-direct means, involving various charitable and educational institutions.\n- **Rural Development:** Rural Development Projects were also implemented through non-direct means, focusing on rural development initiatives.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key differences lie in their financial expenditures and the agencies involved in their implementation. COVID Relief projects had a broader range of expenditures and specific implementation agencies. In contrast, Rural Development projects showed diversity in financial commitments and were implemented through direct and indirect channels.\n\n![Projects related to COVID Relief and Rural Development](image1)\nThe image shows various projects related to COVID Relief and Rural Development, detailing financial expenditures and implementation methods. \n![Details of contracts or arrangements](image2)\nThe table provides details of contracts or arrangements entered into by the company, including those with related parties. \n![Rural Development Projects](image3)\nThe image shows a table detailing various Rural Development Projects undertaken by the entity, including their financial expenditures and implementation methods.\n![Rural Development Projects](image4)\nThe image shows a table detailing various Rural Development Projects undertaken by the entity, including their financial expenditures and implementation methods.\n![Net assets and profit or loss](image5)\nThe table provides an overview of the entity's net assets and profit or loss for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n![Percentage Increase](image6)\nThe table provides information on the percentage increase in salaries for various designations.\n![CSR Expenditure](image7)\nThe table provides information on CSR expenditure for the financial year. \n## The key differences between COVID Relief and Rural Development projects focus on financial expenditures and implementation methods, with COVID Relief projects often involving direct implementation and higher expenditures for initiatives like preventive and curative healthcare, and Rural Development projects focusing on sustainable development and poverty eradication.

However, the composition and specifics of these elements vary between the two groups [12].\n\n## Bonus Remuneration\n- **Board of Directors**: The Chairman receives a bonus award that can be in the form of shares blocked for ten years. Other members of the Board of Directors do not receive bonuses in the form of S-SARs or RSUs [1][7].\n- **Corporate Executive Committee**: Members, including the CEO of Roche Group, receive bonuses that can be in cash or in the form of blocked non-voting equity securities and/or shares.

The change in retained earnings directly impacts total equity.\n- **Cash Flow Hedges and Foreign Currency Translation Differences**: These are components of other comprehensive income that affect equity.\n\n#### Movement in Equity:\nThe table [4] shows:\n- **Opening Balance at 2 July 2018**: $45,242\n- **Impact of Change in Accounting Policy**: -$150\n- **Total Comprehensive Income for the Year**: $37,043\n- **Capital Contributions**: $1,265\n- **Dividends**: -$33,781\n- **Balance at 30 June 2019**: $53,651\n\n#### 2020:\n- **Profit**: $11,221\n- **Cash Flow Hedges**: -$352\n- **Foreign Operations - Foreign Currency Translation Differences**: $327\n- **Capital Contributions**: $4,086\n- **Dividends**: -$15,866\n- **Balance at 28 June 2020**: $58,368\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows [1] details the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n#### Key Points:\n- **Net Cash from Operating Activities**: $80,000 (2020) vs. $46,228 (2019)\n  This significant increase in net cash from operating activities indicates a positive impact on the company's liquidity and, by extension, its equity.\n\n### Impact on Total Equity\n\n- **Retained Earnings Growth**: The profit for the year ended 28 June 2020 was $11,221 [4], contributing positively to retained earnings and, consequently, total equity.\n- **Cash Flow from Operations**: The increase in net cash from operating activities to $80,000 [1] suggests that the company generated more cash, which can be used for growth, dividend payments, or debt reduction, all of which impact equity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities increased significantly from $46,228 to $80,000, indicating improved operational efficiency and cash management. The retained earnings increased due to a profit of $11,221, directly enhancing total equity. Therefore, the improvement in cash flow from operating activities and changes in retained earnings positively affected the total equity from July 2018 to June 2020.\n\n![Cash flow and equity changes](image1)\n\nThe cash flow statement and changes in equity show that operating activities and retained earnings positively impacted total equity."}

This rapid growth was likely driven by the expansion of the railroad and the Homestead Act of 1862, which provided settlers with 160 acres of land if they constructed a permanent structure and resided on it for five years [5].\n* **Steady Decline (1890-1940)**: Following the peak population in 1890, Hamilton County experienced a steady decline to 9,982 by 1940. This decline may be attributed to the challenges faced by rural communities, including farm consolidation and changes in agricultural practices [6].\n* **Post-War Growth (1940-2000)**: The population began to recover and grow steadily, reaching 9,403 by 2000. This growth may be attributed to the economic development and urbanization of the area.\n\n### Historical Factors\n\nSeveral historical factors influenced these changes [5][6]:\n* **Railroad Expansion**: The construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869 and the Transcontinental Railroad Act of 1862 transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state, attracting settlers and driving population growth.\n* **Homestead Act**: The Homestead Act of 1862 provided settlers with land, leading to an influx of people and the establishment of new farms and communities.\n* **Agricultural Changes**: The agricultural landscape of Hamilton County changed dramatically over the last century, with mechanization and consolidation leading to a decline in the number of farms and an increase in farm size [6].\n* **Ethnic Settlement Patterns**: The county was settled by various ethnic groups, including Danes, Swedes, Germans, and Russians, who established strong religious congregations and rural church complexes [4][12].\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nThe population trends can be visualized using the following table [2]:\n\n| Census Year | Total Population |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 130 |\n| 1880 | 8,267 |\n| 1890 | 14,096 |\n| 1900 | 13,330 |\n| 1910 | 13,459 |\n| 1920 | 13,237 |\n| 1930 | 12,159 |\n| 1940 | 9,982 |\n| 1950 | 8,778 |\n| 1960 | 8,714 |\n| 1970 | 8,867 |\n| 1980 | 9,301 |\n| 1990 | 8,862 |\n| 2000 | 9,403 |\n\nOverall, the population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000 reflect the complex interplay of historical factors, including railroad expansion, agricultural changes, and ethnic settlement patterns.\n\nThe population trends reflect the broader patterns of migration and settlement in the Great Plains during this period, influenced by factors such as agricultural development, railroad expansion, and changes in land use. \n![Population trends in Hamilton County, Nebraska, from 1870 to 2000](image2)"}

By 2020, these numbers had shifted to 52% for the U.S. and 32% for China. This indicates a slight increase in the percentage of Americans who view the U.S. as the leading economic power, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in those who believe China holds this position.\n\n### Differences in Perceptions Between Political Affiliations\n\nA closer examination of the data reveals notable differences in perceptions between political affiliations. As shown in image3, in 2020, 54% of Democrats believed that the U.S. was the world's leading economic power, compared to 66% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. This represents a 12-percentage-point gap between the two groups.\n\nFurthermore, image6 highlights that since March, there has been a decline in the share of Democrats who see the U.S. as the world's top economy, from 54% to 44%. In contrast, Republicans' views have remained relatively steady.\n\n### Prioritizing Economic Relations with China\n\nimage4 illustrates that, in 2020, 51% of Americans preferred getting tougher with China economically, while 62% advocated for building a stronger relationship with China on economic issues.\n\n### Confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping\n\nimage2 shows that, as of 2020, 77% of Americans expressed little to no confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs. This represents a significant increase from previous years, with a 10-point rise from March and a more than twofold increase from 2019.\n\n### Partisan Divide\n\nimage4 also reveals a partisan divide in evaluations of Xi, with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents being 10 points more likely than their Democratic counterparts to have no confidence at all in Xi.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Americans' perceptions of their country's status as the world's leading economic power have undergone changes over time, with a slight increase in those who view the U.S. as the leading economy. However, significant differences in perceptions exist between political affiliations, with Republicans being more likely to view the U.S. as the leading economy and express skepticism towards China.

However, [7] implies that women in computer jobs report pay inequities (46% vs. 29% of all women in STEM).\n\n## 6: Conclusion based on available data.\nGiven the information, computer jobs seem to have a significant gender gap, with women in these jobs reporting higher levels of discrimination and sexual harassment.\n\nThe final answer is: Computer jobs."}

The data highlights differences in experiences between men and women, as well as the prevalence of certain types of content.\n\n### Differences in Perceptions Between Men and Women\n\nMen are slightly more likely than women to encounter mean or bullying behavior on social media platforms. Specifically:\n- **29% of men** say they more often see people being mean or bullying compared to **19% of women**.\n- Conversely, women are more likely to see kind or supportive behavior, with **24%** reporting this, compared to **17%** of men.\n\nRegarding attempts to correct misinformation:\n- **24% of men** say they more often see people trying to be deceptive, while **13%** of women share this view.\n- Both men and women are equally likely to see people trying to point out inaccurate information, at **17%**.\n\n### Common Types of Content Encountered\n\nUsers see a mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media:\n- **54%** of users typically see an equal mix of people being kind or supportive and people being mean or bullying.\n- **21%** say they more often see people being kind and supportive, while **24%** say they more often see people being mean or bullying.\n\n### Content Frequency\n\nThe survey also asked about the frequency of encountering certain types of content [3][7]:\n- **58%** of users frequently see posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated.\n- **59%** frequently see people making accusations or starting arguments without having all the facts.\n\n### Emotional Responses to Content\n\nUsers experience a range of emotions from the content they see:\n- **25%** of users frequently encounter content that makes them feel angry.\n- Younger adults (18-29) are more likely to encounter content that makes them feel lonely (**15%**) compared to older adults (**4%** for those 50 and older).\n\n### Acceptability of Data Use by Social Media\n\nRegarding the use of data for targeted content:\n- **75%** of social media users find it acceptable for platforms to use data to recommend events in their area.\n- A smaller majority (**57%**) thinks it is acceptable for platforms to use data to recommend people they might want to know [4].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of online behavior and content encountered on social media vary between men and women, with men more likely to see mean or bullying behavior and women more likely to see kind or supportive behavior. Users frequently encounter a range of content types, including overly dramatic posts and accusations, and experience various emotions, with anger being a common response. The acceptability of data use for targeted content also varies among users.\n\n![Men and women perceptions on social media content](image2)\n![Acceptability of social media data usage](image1)"}

This is evident from the bar graph, where the Micro-F1 score increases as the number of demonstration samples grows from 1 to 5 but plateaus or slightly decreases with further increases.\n\n### Role of Logical Constraints\n\n- **Addition of Logical Constraints**: Incorporating logical constraints into LLM instructions provides stable improvements in Micro-F1 performance, especially with more demonstrations. For instance, in image1, the performance of using 5 demonstrations on MAVEN-ERE with logical constraints (25.7%) surpasses that of 10 demonstrations without logical constraints (24.5%). This indicates that logical constraints can enhance performance even with fewer demonstrations.\n\n## Comparison Across Models\n\n- **Model Performance**: Different models respond differently to the addition of logical constraints and demonstration samples. For example, image4 and image5 provide detailed comparisons across various models, including RoBERTa-Large, Davinci, GPT-4, Vicuna-13B, and Llama2-13B, under different settings (with all logical constraints, with retrieved logical constraints, and with post-processing). The results show that incorporating logical constraints generally improves performance.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the number of demonstration samples significantly affects the Micro-F1 performance on the MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets. Increasing demonstration samples improves performance up to a point, and incorporating logical constraints can further enhance this improvement, often surpassing the performance gains from additional demonstrations alone. Therefore, instructing LLMs with both \"what\" (demonstrations) and \"how\" (logical constraints) is crucial for optimal performance.\n\nThe final answer is: ![The Micro-F1 performance improves with an increasing number of demonstration samples but reaches a plateau; incorporating logical constraints provides additional and stable improvements across MAVEN-ERE and CTB datasets.](image1)"}

This model is designed to handle one task at a time, such as speech transcription or translation, but not both simultaneously.\n\n## Multitask Model (Figure 1b)\nIn contrast, the multitask model, as shown in Figure 1b, is designed to handle two tasks jointly: speech transcription and translation. It shares the encoder but uses separate attentions and decoders for each task. This means it can process and generate outputs for both transcription and translation tasks using a single encoder but distinct decoder and attention components for each task.\n\n## Key Differences\n- **Shared Encoder**: Both models use a shared encoder, but the multitask model diverges into two separate decoder and attention paths after the encoder.\n- **Separate Decoders and Attentions**: The multitask model has two sets of decoders and attentions, one for transcription and one for translation, allowing it to jointly learn both tasks.\n- **Information Flow**: The multitask model does not inherently pass information from one task's decoder to the other, unlike more advanced models.\n\n## Implications\nThe multitask model's architecture allows for the joint learning of transcription and translation tasks, potentially leveraging shared information in the input (like speech) to improve performance on both tasks. However, it does not explicitly model the interaction between the decoders of the two tasks, which could be beneficial for tasks that are closely related, like transcription and translation.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe multitask model represented in Figure 1b differs from the single-task model in Figure 1a primarily by its ability to handle two tasks (transcription and translation) jointly with shared encoder but separate decoder and attention components for each task.\n\nThe multitask model has separate decoders and attentions for each task ![Multitask Model Architecture](image6)."}

It primarily consists of two main components: a **multimodal retriever** and a **ranking prompt** that integrates with MLLMs.\n\n### Multimodal Retriever\nThe multimodal retriever is responsible for querying a large external memory or database to find information relevant to the input query or context. This involves:\n- **Encoding and Storing**: The retriever creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions. \n- **Index Construction**: To optimize retrieval speed, an index system using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm is implemented, reducing the dimensionality of vectors in a $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space to $\\frac{d}{9}$. This facilitates efficient storage and quick retrieval of relevant information.\n\n### Ranking Prompt\nAfter retrieving top-k categories, the MLLMs rank these results to make the final prediction. The prompt format merges the input image with retrieved category information, guiding MLLMs to rank based on similarity.\n\n### Key Functions\n- **Retrieval Phase**: The system retrieves top-k similar results from the memory.\n- **Ranking Phase**: MLLMs rank these retrieved candidates to make accurate predictions.\n\nThe integration of these components allows the RAR pipeline to be seamlessly integrated into various MLLMs in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing performance across a range of vision-language recognition tasks, including fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, few-shot image recognition datasets, and object detection datasets [12]. \n\nHere are the images that support the explanation of RAR pipeline:\n- **Multimodal Retriever Process** `![Multimodal Retriever](image1)`\n- **Retrieving & Ranking Process** `![Retrieving & Ranking](image3)`"}

This shows that LLM reranking has a significant positive impact on micro-F1 performance, particularly for hard samples.\n\n## 4: Conclusion on LLM Reranking Effect\nGiven that LLM reranking targets hard samples identified by SLMs and leads to significant performance improvements on these samples, it can be concluded that LLM reranking enhances micro-F1 performance across different confidence levels for the FewNERD dataset, especially by improving the handling of hard samples.\n\nThe final answer is: LLM reranking improves micro-F1 performance across different confidence levels for the FewNERD dataset, particularly enhancing the handling of hard samples."}

(2015) used a word LSTM model and showed improved performance by adding a CRF layer on top [5].\n\n### Example Architectures\n\n- **Character LSTM**: An example architecture involves using a character-level LSTM to generate representations for each word, which are then combined with word embeddings for input to LSTM layers [1].\n\n- **Word + Character Models**: Some models concatenate word embeddings with LSTM or CNN over the characters of a word, passing this through another sentence-level Bi-LSTM for final predictions [9].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEach word in a sentence is processed at the character level to generate detailed representations, which are then combined with word embeddings to form comprehensive input features for LSTM layers. This approach allows the model to leverage both the semantic meaning of words and their internal character structures.\n\nThe final answer is: \nModern neural architectures use word embeddings and character-level representations, generated through LSTMs or CNNs over characters, to process words before inputting them into LSTM layers for NER tasks."}

This paradigm uses SLMs as filters to select the top-N candidate labels, then LLMs rerank them to make final decisions.

The process starts with a broad outlook by considering the top layers of the tree and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers [8].\n\n### Collapsed Tree Retrieval\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree approach offers a simpler way to search for relevant information by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously. Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison [10].\n\n## Key Differences and Advantages\n\n- **Layer-by-Layer vs. Simultaneous Evaluation**: Tree Traversal Retrieval evaluates nodes layer by layer, selecting the most relevant ones at each step, while Collapsed Tree Retrieval evaluates all nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.\n- **Flexibility and Granularity**: The Collapsed Tree approach provides greater flexibility by searching through all nodes simultaneously, allowing it to retrieve information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [3].\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\nThe performance of both methods can be seen in the figures below:\n\n![RAPTOR’s tree-based retrieval allows it to choose nodes from different tree layers, matching the question’s detail level.](image6)\n\nThe Collapsed Tree approach consistently performs better, as shown in the graph below:\n\n![The collapsed tree approach consistently performs better.](image4)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information. While Tree Traversal Retrieval offers control over the specificity and breadth of information retrieved by adjusting the depth and number of nodes selected at each layer, Collapsed Tree Retrieval provides a simpler and more flexible method by evaluating all nodes simultaneously.\n\nRAPTOR’s retrieval process is illustrated in `image6`, and the performance comparison between Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval is shown in `image4`. \n\nThe Collapsed Tree Retrieval method offers better performance as shown in the table below:\n\n| Model | Accuracy (QuALITY) | Answer F1 (QASPER) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| SBERT with RAPTOR | 56.6% | 36.70% |\n| SBERT without RAPTOR | 54.9% | 36.23% |\n| BM25 with RAPTOR | 52.1% | 27.00% |\n| BM25 without RAPTOR | 49.9% | 26.47% |\n| DPR with RAPTOR | 54.7% | 32.23% |\n| DPR without RAPTOR | 53.1% | 31.70% | \n\nThe answer is: \nRAPTOR uses two querying mechanisms: Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval.

The presence of repetition control is crucial as it helps in avoiding redundant information and promotes a more natural and varied conversation.\n\n## Impact on Question-Asking\nThe control of question-asking is particularly important for engagingness, with a question-asking rate of $65.7\\%$ maximizing engagingness [3]. This suggests that there is an optimal level of questioning that can make conversations more engaging.\n\n## Relationship Between Repetition Control and Question-Asking\nWhen introducing repetition control, the question-asking rate is reduced. For instance, with $z=10$, the setting that should produce $100\\%$ questions only yields $79.67\\%$ questions [10]. This indicates that controlling repetition impacts the model's ability to ask questions, potentially due to the prevention of commonly occurring bigrams in questions.\n\n## Effective Control Methods\nConditional training (CT) is found to be more effective than weighted decoding for controlling question-asking, allowing for precise control over the question-asking rate [2]. By adjusting the control variable $z$, the model can produce a range of question-asking rates from $1.40\\%$ to $97.72\\%$ [10].\n\n## Conclusion\nThe presence of repetition control affects the frequency of question-asking in generated text by reducing it. This is because repetition control mechanisms, such as preventing bigram repetition, can discourage the model from producing common question-asking phrases.

These differences are crucial for understanding how each process contributes to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the RAG system.\n\n### Iterative Retrieval\n\n- **Process**: Iterative retrieval involves refining search queries based on previous results. This process is designed to gradually converge on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop.\n- **Functionality**: It allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user's requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with search outcomes. Techniques such as IRCoT and ToC create a clarification tree to systematically optimize ambiguous parts of the query.\n- **Use Cases**: Useful in complex search scenarios where the user's needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced.\n\n### Recursive Retrieval\n\n- **Process**: Recursive retrieval uses a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner. This may include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search.\n- **Functionality**: It embodies the recursive nature of delving deeper into data sources, extracting interconnected information.\n- **Use Cases**: Particularly useful for handling complex data scenarios, such as lengthy documents or graph-structured data sources.\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval\n\n- **Process**: Adaptive retrieval methods enable LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval. This enhances the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced.\n- **Functionality**: Unlike fixed retrieval processes, adaptive methods evaluate the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios. This allows for more flexible and dynamic use of module outputs to bolster another module's functionality.\n- **Use Cases**: Beneficial for integrating with other technologies such as fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, and for scenarios requiring adaptive retrieval techniques like FLARE and Self-RAG.\n\n### Comparison and Differences\n\n- **Iterative vs. Recursive**: Iterative retrieval focuses on refining queries based on previous search results, while recursive retrieval involves a hierarchical approach to data processing and retrieval.\n- **Adaptive vs. Iterative/Recursive**: Adaptive retrieval stands out by allowing LLMs to decide dynamically when and what to retrieve, enhancing efficiency and relevance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes in a RAG system differ significantly in their methodologies and applications. Iterative retrieval refines queries based on feedback, recursive retrieval processes data hierarchically, and adaptive retrieval dynamically adjusts based on scenario needs. These differences highlight the evolving sophistication in retrieval strategies aimed at improving the performance and adaptability of RAG systems.\n\nHere is an image that illustrates the Iterative, Recursive and Adaptive processes: \n![Iterative, Recursive and Adaptive processes](image2) \n\nThe table below shows evaluation metrics for different evaluation frameworks [8]:\n![Evaluation metrics for different evaluation frameworks](image1)"}

Sentiment analysis often requires capturing the nuances of language, including the order of words, to accurately determine the sentiment of a piece of text. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are particularly well-suited for this task because they can learn long-term dependencies in sequences of data, such as sentences or paragraphs, by maintaining a memory of previous inputs.\n\nThe importance of word-order information in sentiment analysis can be illustrated by comparing the performance of models with and without this information. For instance, when the word order is shuffled, the performance of LSTM models may change, indicating that word order does play a role in sentiment analysis accuracy.\n\n## Impact of Word-Order Information\n- **Role in Sentiment Analysis**: Word-order information is crucial for accurately capturing the sentiment of text. This is because the same words in different orders can convey different sentiments (e.g., \"not really good\" vs. \"really not good\").\n\n## Experimental Evidence\nExperiments that shuffle the word order in training sets can provide insights into how much word-order information contributes to a model's performance. For example, a study might find that on the Yelp polarity dataset, the results drop noticeably when word order is shuffled, further suggesting that word-order does matter for sentiment analysis [7].\n\n## Comparison with Other Models\nComparing LSTM models with other architectures like SWEM (Simple Word Embedding Model) can also shed light on the importance of word-order information. SWEMs, which do not inherently capture word-order information, may perform differently on sentiment analysis tasks compared to LSTMs or CNNs, which do capture such information through their architectures.\n\n## Quantitative Analysis\nQuantitatively, the impact of word-order information can be seen in tables comparing model performances across different tasks. For instance, a table might show that LSTM models perform better than SWEMs on sentiment analysis tasks, indicating that capturing word-order information can improve performance [10].\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, word-order information significantly affects sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models. These models are capable of capturing sequential dependencies in text, which is crucial for understanding sentiment. The evidence from various studies and comparisons with other models underscores the importance of word order in sentiment analysis.\n\nSWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered, Surprisingly, on most of the datasets considered (except WikiQA), SWEM demonstrates the best results compared with those with CNN or the LSTM encoder. Notably, on SNLI dataset, we observe that SWEM-max performs the best among all SWEM variants, consistent with the findings in  Nie and Bansal  ( 2017 );  Conneau et al. ( 2017 ), that  max-pooling  over BiLSTM hidden units outperforms average pooling operation on SNLI dataset. As a result, with only 120K parameters, our SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of $83.8\\%$ , which is very competitive among state-of-the-art sentence encoding-based models ![Effectiveness of SWEM](image1).\n\nThe table below shows a comparison of different models and their complexities:\n\n| Model | Parameters | Complexity | Sequential Ops |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CNN | $n \\cdot K \\cdot d$ | $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot L \\cdot K \\cdot d)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ |\n| LSTM | $4 \\cdot d \\cdot(K + d)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot d^2 + L \\cdot K \\cdot d)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ |\n| SWEM | $0$ | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ |\n\nThis table ![Model Complexity Comparison](image2) shows that SWEM has much less parameters and lower complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, SWEM achieves a test accuracy of $83.8\\%$ on SNLI dataset and outperforms a 29-layer deep CNN model when predicting topics ![SWEM Performance](image5).\n\nThe results on three distinct tasks are shown in Table  ![Results on Various Tasks](image4). \n\nGenerally, SWEM is less effective at extracting representations from short sentences than from long documents ![SWEM Limitations](image7). \n\nFriendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options.

The comparison involves visualizing the embeddings produced by SPECTER and SciBERT, a state-of-the-art pretrained Transformer language model for scientific text.\n\n## Visual Comparison\n\nThe visualization in Figure 2 shows the embeddings produced by SPECTER and SciBERT. \n\n![SPECTER and SciBERT embeddings comparison](image2)\n\n## Analysis\n\n- **SPECTER Embeddings**: These appear to produce more compact and clearly separated clusters for different topics, indicating a better ability to encode topical information.\n- **SciBERT Embeddings**: The clusters seem less compact and more dispersed, suggesting a less effective grouping by topic.\n\n## Quantitative Comparison\n\nTo quantify this comparison, the authors use the DBScan clustering algorithm and evaluate the quality using homogeneity and completeness measures. The results show that SPECTER outperforms SciBERT, with homogeneity and completeness values of 0.41 and 0.72, respectively, compared to SciBERT's 0.19 and 0.63.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the visual comparison and quantitative measures, SPECTER appears to produce more tightly clustered groups representing different topics compared to SciBERT.\n\nSPECTER produces more tightly clustered groups representing different topics."}

As shown in Figure 2 [2], without repetition control, the model achieves a question-asking rate of approximately 97.72%. However, when repetition control is introduced, this rate drops to 79.67%. To address this issue, an additional setting, z=10 (boost), is implemented. This setting allows the model to produce necessary question-asking bigrams while slightly increasing external bigram repetition, ultimately yielding a 99.54% question-asking rate.\n\n![Effect of Repetition Control on Question-Asking Rate](image2)\n\nThe data in the figure indicates that controlling for repetition alongside question-asking leads to a more engaging conversation. Specifically, a question-asking rate of 65.7% maximizes engagingness, as seen in Figure 3 (left) [7]. This suggests that while repetition control affects the question-asking rate, adjusting the control level can optimize conversation engagement.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of repetition control at the highest level (z=10) reduces the question-asking rate but can be mitigated with adjustments like the z=10 (boost) setting."}

Label Loyalty measures the consistency of output labels with and without isolation, while Word Loyalty compares the top-5 predicted words with and without isolation using Jaccard similarity [1].\n\n## 2: Analyzing the Effects of Isolation\nThe experimental findings suggest that isolating label words in shallow layers significantly impairs model performance, indicating that label words collect useful information during forward propagation in shallow layers. This implies that the model's reliance on label words for information aggregation is crucial in early layers [3].\n\n## 3: Examining Layer-Specific Impacts\nFigures 5a and 5b show that deep layers have a strong correlation between attention distributions on label words and the model's final prediction, with AUCROC_l approaching 0.8. This suggests that deep layers extract information from label words to form the final prediction [2].\n\n## 4: Impact of Isolating Different Layers\nIsolating shallow layers causes a significant impact on model performance, while isolating deep layers has a negligible impact, even when the number of isolation layers increases. This further illustrates the crucial role of deep layers for final prediction [10].\n\n## 5: Visualizing Loyalty Changes\nFigure 11 demonstrates variations in label loyalty and word loyalty based on whether label or non-label words are isolated in various layers. It shows that isolating label words in the shallow layers significantly influences the outcome, compared to isolation in deep layers or non-label word isolation [11].\n\n## 6: Conclusion Based on Available Data\nGiven that isolating non-label words (or random words) in the last few layers does not significantly affect model performance, as indicated by the minimal changes in loyalty metrics when non-label words are isolated, especially in deep layers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{yes}$"}

The numbers in the last three rows indicate the number of dialogues for train, validation and test sets [6].\n\n### Error Analysis \n\nAn error analysis of multi-domain training shows that name slots in the restaurant, attraction, and hotel domains have the highest error rates, 8.50%, 8.17%, and 7.86%, respectively. This is because this slot usually has a large number of possible values that is hard to recognize [7].\n\n### Zero-Shot Analysis \n\nIn the zero-shot analysis of two selected domains, hotel and restaurant, which contain more slots to be tracked, knowledge about people, area, price range, and day slots are successfully transferred from the other four domains [4].\n\n### Slot Embeddings \n\nSlot embeddings are not close to each other, which is expected because the model only depends on these features as start-of-sentence embeddings to distinguish different slots. Note that some slots are relatively close because either the values they track may share similar semantic meanings or the slots are correlated [12].\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, the MultiWOZ dataset has a complex distribution of data across different slots, with a large number of (domain, slot) pairs and possible slot values.

This encoder takes in user input in natural language format and outputs a continuous vector representation of the user's utterance.\n\n## Encoding User Utterances\nThe Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder encodes a dialogue with a sequence of turns using a hierarchical LSTM neural network. Specifically, it uses a bidirectional LSTM to encode the user utterance to a continuous representation [8].\n\n## User Utterance Vector Generation\nThe user utterance vector is generated by concatenating the last forward and backward LSTM states. Let $\\mathbf{U}_{k}=\\left(w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{T_{k}}\\right)$ be the user utterance at turn $k$ with $T_{k}$ words. These words are firstly mapped to an embedding space, and further serve as the step inputs to the bidirectional LSTM [8].\n\n## Continuous Representation\nThe user utterance encoding, together with the encoding of the previous system action, serves as the input to a dialogue-level LSTM.

In the context of 'published by', the model needs to select an entity that is relevant to the publication information.\n\n## Model Decision Process\nThe decision process involves several steps [2][7]:\n1. **Parent Entity Selection**: The model picks a parent entity from the local knowledge graph. For example, in the context of the sentence about Super Mario Land, the parent entity could be \"Super Mario Land\" itself.\n2. **Relation Selection**: It then selects a relation that is relevant to the context 'published by'. In this case, the relation could be \"Publisher\".\n3. **Entity Rendering**: Based on the selected relation and parent entity, the model then decides which entity to render. For 'published by', it might select \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render because Nintendo is the publisher of Super Mario Land.\n\n## Entity Rendering Process\nThe rendering process [7] involves:\n- **Vocabulary Expansion**: When rendering an entity, the model has an expanded vocabulary available to it, containing the standard vocabulary along with all word types in any of the aliases of the entity to be rendered.\n- **Distribution Over Vocabulary**: The model constructs a distribution over the original vocabulary and a vocabulary containing all the tokens that appear in aliases of the selected entity.\n\n## Example Illustration\nFor instance, given the sentence \"Super Mario Land is a 1989 side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Nintendo as a launch title for their Game Boy handheld game console.\", if the model is to render \"Nintendo\" as the entity related to 'published by', it would use the expanded vocabulary including aliases of Nintendo.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe model decides which entity to render based on the context, parent entity, relation, and available vocabulary, including aliases of entities.\n\n![The model selects an entity to render based on the parent entity, relation, and context, using an expanded vocabulary including entity aliases.](image2)\n\nThe model achieves this through a process that involves selecting a parent entity, a relation, and then an entity to render based on the context and available knowledge graph information.\n\n## Final Answer\nThe model decides which entity to render in the context of 'published by' by selecting a parent entity, choosing a relevant relation, and then picking an entity based on that relation and context, utilizing an expanded vocabulary that includes aliases of the entity to be rendered."}

There are several pathways that cells use to repair damaged DNA, including [4]:\n- Base excision repair (BER)\n- Nucleotide excision repair (NER)\n- Direct reversal repair\n- Mismatch repair (MMR)\n- Recombination repair\n\n### Base Excision Repair (BER)\n\nThis repair mechanism is probably the most frequent DNA repair pathway in the cell. It is used for single-strand point mutations affecting one or few bases of one DNA strand [5]. \n\n### Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)\n\nNER is one of the most important DNA repair systems and is highly conserved among species. It can excise DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA [6].\n\n### Direct Reversal Repair\n\nDirect reversal repair can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl-transferase, respectively [11].\n\n### Mismatch Repair (MMR)\n\nThe MMR system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication [12].\n\n### Recombination Repair\n\nRecombination repair mechanisms aim primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA, which represent the most devastating mutation-induced lesions of DNA [7].\n\n## Types of DNA Damage \n\nDNA damage can be caused by various factors, including [5]:\n- Oxygen radicals\n- Alkylating agents\n- Replication errors\n- UV light\n- DNA-damaging drugs\n\n## Repair Processes \n\nThe repair processes include [5]:\n- BER: repairs damage caused by oxygen radicals and alkylating agents\n- MMR: repairs single base mismatch insertion/deletions\n- NER: repairs damage caused by UV light\n- Recombinational repair: repairs DNA damage caused by DNA-damaging drugs\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, Figure 11 demonstrates various DNA repair mechanisms, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, and recombination repair. These mechanisms work together to maintain genome stability and prevent mutations. \n\nThe evidence provided supports the existence of multiple DNA repair mechanisms that help protect the genome from damage. \n\n![DNA repair mechanisms](image5) \nThis image illustrates the different types of DNA damage and their corresponding repair processes."}

This process involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement [12].\n\n## Symbolic Reasoning Stage\nA deterministic symbolic solver, such as a logic programming engine, performs inference on the symbolically represented problem to obtain a symbolic answer [2].\n\n## Result Interpretation Stage\nFinally, an LLM- or rule-based Result Interpreter translates the symbolic answer back into natural language.\n\n## Logical Reasoning Process\nThe LOGIC-LM framework decomposes a logical reasoning problem into three stages [12]:\n1. **Problem Formulation**: The LLM converts the natural language description of the problem into an appropriate symbolic formulation.\n2. **Symbolic Reasoning**: A deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation.\n3. **Result Interpretation**: The output is explained and mapped to the correct answer.\n\n## Example of Symbolic Formulation\nFor example, given the problem: \"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.

However, without the direct visual of Figure 1, we infer from descriptions that relations like \"style\" are abstract and point towards categories rather than specific instances.\n\nThe final answer is: \n- The relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes are those pointing to abstract categories or general concepts rather than specific entities.

Generally, a higher reliance on renewable energy sources and lower reliance on coal and gas can lead to lower CO2 emissions. \n\n## Estimated CO2 Emissions\n\nTo provide a visual comparison of the energy consumption, here is a table summarizing the energy consumption distributions:\n\n| Consumer        | Renew. | Gas | Coal | Nuc. |\n|-----------------|--------|-----|------|------|\n| China           | 22%    | 3%  | 65%  | 4%   |\n| Germany         | 40%    | 7%  | 38%  | 13%  |\n| United States   | 17%    | 35% | 27%  | 19%  |\n| **Amazon-AWS**   | 17%    | 24% | 30%  | 26%  |\n| **Google**       | 56%    | 14% | 15%  | 10%  |\n| **Microsoft**    | 32%    | 23% | 31%  | 10%  |\n\nGiven this data, Microsoft and Amazon-AWS have similar coal usage but Microsoft has a higher renewable energy usage.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the comparison between Amazon-AWS and Microsoft reveals differences in their energy consumption distributions, which can impact their CO2 emissions. Microsoft's higher renewable energy usage and lower coal usage may result in lower CO2 emissions compared to Amazon-AWS.\n\nThe estimated costs and CO2 emissions for training various models are also significant, with large models requiring substantial computational resources and emitting considerable CO2 [2].\n\n### References\n\nFor more information on energy consumption and emissions, see [3] and [5].\n\n### Figures\n\n![Energy consumption comparison of different countries and cloud service providers](image3)\n\nThis table shows the energy consumption distributions of different countries and cloud service providers, highlighting the variations in renewable energy, gas, coal, and nuclear usage.\n\nGiven the provided information and focusing on the implications of energy consumption on CO2 emissions, it can be concluded that differences in energy sources significantly impact emissions.\n\nTherefore, promoting the use of renewable energy sources and efficient hardware could substantially reduce the environmental impact of NLP research.\n\nTo reduce carbon emissions, researchers should prioritize developing efficient models and hardware."}

This model is designed to integrate information across modalities and generate multimodal documents that can contain arbitrary sequences of images and text [1].\n\n## Key Features of Chameleon\n\nThe key features of Chameleon include [6]:\n- A unified token space that allows it to seamlessly reason over and generate interleaved image and text sequences.\n- A fully token-based architecture, which enables the integration of information across modalities.\n- The ability to represent images as a series of discrete tokens, similar to text.\n\n## Understanding the Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Chameleon involves an early-fusion approach, differing from late-fusion models that encode images and text separately before combining them. This approach allows Chameleon to jointly reason over image and text in a unified manner [8].\n\n## Performance and Capabilities\n\nChameleon demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of vision-language benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in image captioning tasks and maintains competitive performance on text-only benchmarks.

She was the eldest child of the Tuscan painter Orazio Gentileschi and Prudenzia di Ottaviano Montoni. Her father, Orazio, was a prominent figure in the Mannerism art movement, which likely influenced Artemisia's own artistic style. However, Artemisia herself was a part of the Caravaggio movement, a group of artists who followed the style of Caravaggio. She was also a student of her father, Orazio Gentileschi, which further shaped her artistic development.\n\n### Influence of Orazio Gentileschi\n\nOrazio's influence on Artemisia's development as a prominent Baroque painter can be seen in her highly naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes, and the use of chiaroscuro technique [7].\n\n### Knowledge Graph Representation\n\nThe knowledge graph represents Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi's career through various attributes and relationships [7]:\n- **Occupation**: Painter\n- **Child**: Artemisia Gentileschi\n- **Movement**: Baroque\n- **Style**: Baroque painter\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\nThe evaluation metrics for the influence of Orazio Gentileschi on Artemisia Gentileschi's career include [1][7]:\n- **Authenticity**: 1.00\n- **Relevance**: 0.73 (General), 0.84 (Specific)\n- **Naturalness**: 4.38 (General), 3.52 (Specific)\n- **Significance**: 3.94 (General), 3.68 (Specific)\n\n### Experimental Results\n\nThe experimental results on conscious incompetence show the impact of Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi's career [2]:\n- **Precision**: Increases with the number of knowledge removed\n- **Recall**: Remains relatively stable\n- **F1 Score**: Increases with the number of knowledge removed\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOrazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi's career shaped her development as a prominent Baroque painter through her highly naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes, and the use of chiaroscuro technique.\n\n![Orazio Gentileschi's influence on Artemisia Gentileschi](image7) \n![Evaluation metrics for Orazio Gentileschi's influence](image1)"}

This task is particularly challenging because it requires the model to generalize its knowledge to unseen categories.\n\n## Step 2: Role of Pre-processing in Zero-Shot Recognition\nPre-processing steps are crucial in enhancing the performance of zero-shot recognition systems. These steps often involve techniques such as cropping, blurring, and resizing, which can significantly affect how well a model can understand and classify images, especially in scenarios where objects of interest may vary greatly in size, scale, or position within an image.\n\n## 3: Analyzing the Provided Diagram\nThe diagram illustrates a process that includes pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring for object detection tasks. For object detection datasets, the methodology for extracting image embeddings $e_{\\mathrm{img}}$ is slightly different from the approach discussed previously. As presented in Fig. 3, we apply two additional pre-processing steps: cropping and blurring.\n\n## 4: Contribution of Pre-processing to Visual Recognition\nThe pre-processing steps contribute to visual recognition by preparing the input data in a way that enhances the model's ability to extract meaningful features. For instance, cropping regions of interest helps in focusing the model's attention on relevant parts of the image, while blurring non-target areas can reduce noise and distractions, thereby improving the model's performance on fine-grained recognition tasks.\n\n## 5: Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the pre-processing step is integral to the zero-shot recognition system as depicted in the diagram. It aids in improving the model's performance by enhancing feature extraction from images through techniques like cropping and blurring.\n\nThe pre-processing step contributes to zero-shot recognition by enhancing feature extraction through cropping and blurring, improving model performance on fine-grained tasks.\n![Pre-processing steps](image8)\n\nPre-processing involves techniques like cropping and blurring to enhance model performance on visual recognition tasks [8]."}

For instance, in the CoNLL03 NER dataset, the number of tokens with the tagging class \"O\" is 5 times as many as those with entity labels, while in the OntoNotes5.0 dataset, this number is 8 times. Similarly, in MRC tasks, the negative-positive ratio can be as high as 50-200 [10].\n\nIn comparison to other datasets, the QUOREF dataset has one of the highest negative-positive ratios. For example, the SQuAD 1.1 and SQuAD 2.0 datasets have ratios of 55.9 and 82.0, respectively. The CoNLL03 NER and OntoNotes5.0 NER datasets have ratios of 4.98 and 8.18, respectively [4].\n\nThe class imbalance issue in the QUOREF dataset is more severe than in other datasets, such as the English OntoNotes 5.0 and CoNLL2003 datasets, which have ratios of 8.18 and 4.98, respectively.\n\nThe imbalance can be observed in the following table:\n\n| Task | # neg | # pos | ratio |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CoNLL03 NER | 170K | 34K | 4.98 |\n| OntoNotes5.0 NER | 1.96M | 239K | 8.18 |\n| SQuAD 1.1 | 10.3M | 175K | 55.9 |\n| SQuAD 2.0 | 15.4M | 188K | 82.0 |\n| QUOREF | 6.52M | 38.6K | 169 |\n\nThis table shows that the QUOREF dataset has a much higher ratio of negative to positive instances compared to other datasets.\n\nTo address this issue, various methods have been proposed, including the use of different loss functions, such as Dice loss (DL), Focal loss (FL), and DSC loss.

For instance, Figure 2 depicts the absolute accuracies of Google Translate on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across all tested languages.\n\n![The bar chart shows the performance of Google Translate on stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles across languages, with a notable difference in accuracy between the two, indicating a bias towards stereotypical roles.]()\n\nAccording to the figure, **Italian (IT) exhibited the greatest bias**, with an accuracy of 52% for stereotypical roles and 30% for non-stereotypical roles.\n\n### Example Translations\n\nThe table below shows example translations of sentences with biased results [2]:\n| Source | Target Language | Predicted Translation | Phenomenon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The janitor does not like the baker because she always messes up the kitchen. | [ES] | Al conserje no le gusta el panadero porque ella siempre desordena la cocina. | Biased translation, giving \"baker\" a male inflection, with a mismatched pronoun reference. |\n\n### Impact of Stereotypical Adjectives\n\nAdding stereotypical gender adjectives can improve performance in some languages. For example, the performance of Google Translate on Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian gender prediction accuracy improved with the addition of adjectives [4]:\n![Performance improvement after adding stereotypical gender adjectives for Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian languages.](image4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe study provides evidence for significant gender bias in MT systems, with a tendency to translate based on gender stereotypes rather than context.\n\nThe language with the greatest bias in accuracy between stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender roles when using Google Translate is **Italian (IT)**."}

The model utilizes a citation-based pretraining objective and is compared against several baselines, including SciBERT, which is a state-of-the-art pretrained Transformer language model for scientific text.\n\n## Impact of Features on SPECTER's Performance\n\n- **Abstract**: The abstract is a crucial piece of information for scientific documents. Removing it results in a substantial decrease in performance, as seen in Table 2, where the performance drops to 68.1. This indicates that the abstract provides significant contextual information for the model.\n\n- **Venue**: Adding venue information slightly decreases performance except on document classification tasks, suggesting that while venues might offer some contextual relevance, they do not substantially enhance the model's capability to understand document-level relatedness.\n\n- **Author**: Including authors as input hurts performance, possibly because author names are sparse in the corpus and might be tokenized suboptimally, leading to noisy correlations.\n\n## Comparison with Baselines and Fine-Tuning\n\nSPECTER outperforms various baselines, including SciBERT fine-tuned on task-specific data. For instance, in Table 3, SPECTER achieves an average performance of 80.0 across all metrics, surpassing SciBERT fine-tuned on co-view, co-read, co-citation, and multitask data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe inclusion or exclusion of specific features significantly impacts the performance of the SPECTER model. The abstract is crucial for performance, while adding venue or author information does not consistently improve results. SPECTER's design, particularly its use of citation-based pretraining, allows it to outperform fine-tuned SciBERT models across tasks.\n\n## Interleaved Text and Image Response\n\nThe SPECTER model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including classification, user activity prediction, and citation prediction. \n\n### Performance Comparison\n\n| Model | CLS | USR | CITE | REC | Avg |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SPECTER | 84.2 | 88.4 | 91.5 | 36.9 | 80.0 |\n\n![The performance of SPECTER and its variants across different tasks.](image1)\n\n## Model Architecture and Loss Function\n\nThe model architecture involves a Transformer initialized with SciBERT, processing query papers, related papers, and unrelated papers to compute embeddings used in a triplet loss function.\n\n![The architecture of the SPECTER model, including its input and loss function.](image2)\n\n## Fine-Tuning and Multitask Performance\n\nFine-tuning SciBERT on task-specific data sources generally results in inferior performance compared to using fixed representations from SPECTER.\n\n![Performance comparison of SPECTER with SciBERT fine-tuned on various tasks.](image3)\n\n## Document Embeddings\n\nSPECTER generates document-level embeddings that can be effectively applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning.\n\n![Comparison of SPECTER with SciBERT on document embeddings.](image4)\n\n## Visualization of Embeddings\n\nThe embeddings produced by SPECTER and SciBERT show distinct patterns, with SPECTER's embeddings clustering more effectively by discipline.\n\n![Visualization of SPECTER and SciBERT embeddings.](image5)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SPECTER model demonstrates superior performance across various tasks, benefiting from its citation-based pretraining objective and effective use of document-level information.\n\nSPECTER achieves the best results with an effective use of document-level information."}

The **collapsed tree** method flattens the tree into a single layer, allowing for a simultaneous search across all nodes. This approach offers greater flexibility and has been shown to perform better than tree traversal, particularly in retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question [4].\n\nIn contrast, the **tree traversal** method involves traversing the tree layer by layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level.

The CTBT training program statistics, as shown in image2, utilize a combination of numerical values, icons, and a world map to convey information about registered participants, clicks on lecture videos, and institutional affiliations. This approach allows for a clear and concise visual representation of the data.\n\nIn contrast, the changes in weekend activities from 2005 to 2010, depicted in image4, employ a different strategy. The data is represented through pie charts, which effectively illustrate how people allocate their time during weekends. The use of pie charts enables easy comparison of time spent on various activities, such as shopping, eating out, and fitness, between the two years.\n\nA key difference between the two representations is the level of detail and the type of information being conveyed. The CTBT training program statistics focus on program metrics, whereas the weekend activities data highlights changes in behavior over time.\n\nThe Gestalt principles, particularly proximity and similarity, play a crucial role in understanding these representations. In image2, the proximity of elements, such as the clustering of bars in the institutional affiliation chart, helps to create a sense of grouping and organization. Similarly, the similarity in color schemes and icon styles contributes to a cohesive visual identity.\n\nOn the other hand, image4 leverages the principle of similarity by using consistent colors and shapes to represent different activities across the two years, making it easier to compare and contrast the data.\n\nUltimately, the choice of data representation depends on the specific information being conveyed and the intended audience. By applying Gestalt principles, designers can create effective visualizations that facilitate understanding and insight.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe CTBT training program statistics and weekend activities data employ distinct data representation strategies, each leveraging Gestalt principles to communicate information effectively."}

The retro cinematic-themed graphic highlights several key issues to steer clear of.\n\n## Design Flaws to Avoid\n\n*   **Bad Fonts**: Avoid using fonts that are difficult to read or not suitable for your presentation. Some examples of bad fonts include Times New Roman, Arial, and Comic Sans, as shown in the image with a red \"X\" marked through them. These fonts can make your presentation look unprofessional and be hard on the eyes.\n*   **Bad Colors**: Be cautious with color schemes that don't work well together. The image illustrates this with a rainbow-colored Venn diagram and a blue circle overlapping with yellow and green circles, indicating a poor color choice.\n*   **Bad Spacing**: Ensure that your text and images have sufficient space between them. The image of a car with a highlighted area showing poor spacing demonstrates how bad spacing can negatively impact your presentation.\n\nBy being mindful of these design flaws, you can create a more engaging and effective presentation.\n\n## Effective Design Choices\n\nIn contrast, effective design choices can enhance your presentation. For instance, using **iconography** can help convey complex information in a visually appealing way, as shown in image1 with an open book divided into \"beginning,\" \"middle,\" and \"end.\" \n\nSimilarly, incorporating **emotives visuals** and limiting your slides to **one point per slide** can make your presentation more engaging and easier to follow.\n\n## Visual Learning and Presentation Effectiveness\n\nVisuals play a significant role in learning and retention. The brain processes visual information more efficiently than text, with **65% of people being visual learners**. Additionally, people retain **80% of what they see** and only **20% of what they read** and **10% of what they hear**.\n\n## Best Practices for Presentations\n\nTo create an effective presentation, consider the following best practices:\n\n*   **Use emotive visuals**: One point per slide can make your presentation more engaging.\n*   **Choose a matching color scheme and stick to a theme**: A consistent color scheme can help tie your presentation together.\n*   **Use font choice to let your slide breathe**: Select fonts that are easy to read and suitable for your presentation.\n*   **Storfy your presentation**: Tell a story with your presentation to keep your audience engaged.\n\nBy incorporating these best practices and avoiding common design flaws, you can create a presentation that effectively communicates your message and engages your audience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEffective presentation design is crucial for engaging your audience and conveying your message. By avoiding bad fonts, colors, and spacing, and incorporating visuals, emotive imagery, and storytelling, you can create a presentation that resonates with your audience.\n\nThe final answer is: Use visuals, choose a matching color scheme, use font choice to let your slide breathe and storfy your presentation."}

Telophase is characterized by the nuclear envelope beginning to reform around each set of chromosomes, and the chromatin begins to de-condense back into a less visible chromatin structure, returning to its interphase appearance. Cytokinesis, on the other hand, is the process of dividing the cytoplasm of the cell.\n\n## 2: Telophase Description\nIn telophase, the chromosomes that have reached the poles of the cell begin to de-condense, forming chromatin. The nuclear envelope starts to reform around each set of chromosomes, and the nucleolus reappears.\n\n## 3: Cytokinesis Description\nCytokinesis is the final stage of cell division, both in mitosis and meiosis. In animal cells, it occurs through the formation of a cleavage furrow, which gradually deepens, dividing the cell into two daughter cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the center of the cell and grows outward until it reaches the cell wall, dividing the cell into two.\n\n## 4: Visual Representation\nThe provided images show various stages of cell division. Specifically, `image2` illustrates the process of cytokinesis in animal cells, where a cleavage furrow is formed, and `image5` and `image6` show the result of cytokinesis, where two daughter cells are produced.\n\n## 5: Conclusion on Telophase and Cytokinesis\nThe telophase and cytokinesis stages are crucial for completing cell division. During telophase, the nuclear envelope reforms, and chromosomes de-condense. Cytokinesis then physically divides the cell into two daughter cells, each with a complete set of chromosomes.\n\n## 6: Cellular Structure Changes\nThe cellular structures undergo significant changes during these stages. The chromosomes, now at opposite poles of the cell, begin to de-condense, and nuclear envelopes form around them. The cytoplasm divides, and in animal cells, this is achieved through a cleavage furrow that pinches the cell into two.\n\n## 7: Finalizing Cell Division\nThe process results in two genetically identical daughter cells from one parent cell, each with its own nucleus and set of organelles.\n\nThe final answer is: \nCell division completes with telophase and cytokinesis, where ![cell division completion](image2). \nThe chromosomes arrive at the poles and nuclear envelopes form around them, and the cytoplasm divides through cleavage or cell plate formation ![completed cell division](image5)."}

This concept is crucial in understanding the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants.\n\n### Genetic Principles\n\n- **Inheritance of Unique Sets of Genes**: Offspring are similar to their parents but show variations in traits due to the inheritance of unique sets of genes from two parents [2].\n- **Heritable Factors (Genes)**: Parents pass heritable factors (now called genes) to their offspring [4].\n\n### Monohybrid Cross Example\n\nConsider a monohybrid cross involving flower color, where one parent has purple flowers (dominant trait, *P*) and the other has white flowers (recessive trait, *p*). The genetic makeup of the parents is *PP* or *Pp* for purple flowers and *pp* for white flowers [11].\n\n### Punnett Square Analysis\n\nA Punnett square for a monohybrid cross between *Pp* and *Pp* parents looks like this:\n\n```\n    P     p\nP  PP    Pp\np  Pp    pp\n```\n\nThe genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is *1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp*, and the phenotypic ratio is *3 purple : 1 white* [11].\n\n### Phenotypic and Genotypic Ratios\n\n- **Genotypic Ratios**: The genotypic ratio reflects the genetic makeup, with *1 PP* (homozygous dominant), *2 Pp* (heterozygous), and *1 pp* (homozygous recessive) [7][8].\n- **Phenotypic Ratios**: The phenotypic ratio shows the physical appearance, with *3/4* of plants having purple flowers (*PP* and *Pp*) and *1/4* having white flowers (*pp*).\n\n### Explanation of Ratios\n\nThe appearance of the recessive trait in *1/4* of the F2 offspring and its disappearance in the F1 generation can be explained by [11]:\n- **Dominant Allele**: *P* (purple flowers) dominates over the recessive allele *p* (white flowers).\n- **Recessive Allele Expression**: Only *pp* genotype expresses the recessive white flower phenotype.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nThe image illustrates this concept with a Punnett square and flower images [image1].\n\nThe phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants can be explained by Mendelian inheritance through the interaction of dominant and recessive alleles, resulting in specific genotypic (*1:2:1*) and phenotypic ratios (*3:1*)."}

Two key strategies within this framework are 'Needs Exploration' and 'Elicitation Methods,' which play crucial roles in addressing stakeholder requirements.\n\n### Needs Exploration\n\nNeeds Exploration is a critical phase in agile management that focuses on understanding and defining the requirements of a project. It involves activities such as [2]:\n- **Active stakeholder participation**: Engaging stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle to ensure their needs are understood and met.\n- **High-level requirements specification**: Defining initial requirements to guide the project.\n- **Detailed requirements specification**: Delving deeper into specifics as needed.\n- **Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)**: Ensuring that tests are defined to validate that the solution meets the requirements.\n- **Just-in-time (JIT) model storming**: Modeling activities that occur just in time to support development.\n\n### Elicitation Methods\n\nElicitation Methods are techniques used to gather and understand stakeholder needs. These methods include [4]:\n- **Active stakeholder participation**: Direct involvement of stakeholders in the project.\n- **Indirectly via proxies**: Using representatives when direct stakeholder involvement is not feasible.\n- **Electronic means**: Utilizing digital tools for communication.\n\n### Comparison\n\nBoth strategies aim to ensure that stakeholder requirements are effectively addressed, but they approach this goal from different angles:\n- **Needs Exploration** is more about the strategies and techniques applied to understand and explore requirements, such as test-driven development (TDD), model storming, and look-ahead modeling.\n- **Elicitation Methods** focus on how stakeholders interact with the team and how their needs are gathered and managed, including direct participation, proxies, and electronic means.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods are complementary strategies within the DAD framework. Needs Exploration delves into understanding and defining requirements through various techniques, while Elicitation Methods focus on the interaction with stakeholders to gather these requirements. Together, they ensure that stakeholder needs are accurately captured and addressed throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n![Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods Comparison](image2)\n\nBy integrating these strategies, agile teams can ensure a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder requirements, leading to more successful project outcomes."}

Additionally, over-attribution of overall campaign performance to the last click (i.e., paid search) and too many generalities (B2C SEM is not the same as B2B SEM) are significant barriers [12].\n\n## Challenges in Implementation\n- **Management and Culture**: Adoption barriers relate to management and culture, not data and technology. Companies need to begin with questions and desired insights first, not data. Effective measurement requires understanding what data is needed, who needs access to it, and how marketing applications need to interact with it to implement simple solutions [11].\n- **Measurement and Attribution**: A significant problem across marketing is the overemphasis on the First Click or Last Click for performance attribution of marketing campaigns, particularly those with digital elements. There's also a challenge in calculating inferred attribution through matchback analysis, fractional attribution through models, and other methods [10].\n\n## Organizational and Operational Challenges\n- **Lack of Focus on Customer Engagement**: Companies struggle with too much focus on reach and not enough on engagement. There's also a challenge in drowning in data that is not insightful or actionable, and no top-line activity/efforts against metrics [2].\n- **Processes and Roles**: The absence of clear processes, roles, and responsibilities, along with a lack of skilled resources, poses significant barriers [2].\n\n## Data Utilization and Interpretation\n- **Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data**: There's too much focus on quantitative data and not enough on qualitative data, such as satisfaction. A consistent and relevant digital marketing taxonomy is also lacking [2].\n\n## Conclusion\nThe major barriers include a siloed approach, lack of leadership commitment and guidance, and challenges in measuring and attributing marketing campaign performance effectively. Companies face difficulties in transitioning from traditional methods to more integrated and customer-focused strategies due to these barriers.\n\nGiven the information, there isn't a direct image that conclusively summarizes these barriers in a simple visual format provided, but [4] and [6] give insights into how companies view their challenges.\n\nThe siloed approach and misaligned goals significantly hinder the adoption of an integrated customer management approach, as shown in image6, where 52% of respondents indicate that there is no single ownership of the experience resulting in siloed approaches and misaligned goals.\n\n![Major Barriers to Integrated Customer Management](image6)\n\nIn conclusion, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach include a siloed approach, lack of leadership commitment, challenges in data utilization and interpretation, and operational challenges."}

Although it does not provide data for 2010, we can see that some countries have had more consistent export numbers over the years, while others have had more variation.\n\nThe law of proximity [10] states that objects that are visually close together are perceived as belonging to a group. This can be applied to image2, which shows dots grouped together by color, illustrating how people tend to group similar things.\n\nThe law of continuity [7] also plays a role in understanding trends in data visualization. It states that elements tend to be grouped together if they are aligned within an object, which can help explain why certain patterns emerge in data over time.\n\nBy applying these principles, we can better understand how changes in activity distribution may relate to trends in banana exports. For example, countries with more consistent export numbers may be perceived as more cohesive groups.\n\nHowever, without specific data on banana exports for 2010, we cannot draw direct conclusions about the relationship between activity distribution and banana exports during that year.\n\nOverall, understanding how people perceive and group information is crucial for effective data presentation and analysis. \n\nTherefore, people tend to see objects that are visually close together as belonging to part of a group. ![Proximity Principle Application](image2)."}

This involves understanding the steps to create these maps, which are foundational for more advanced map-making techniques.\n\n## Module 2: Embedded Maps in Wikimedia Projects \nModule 2 takes the knowledge from Module 1 a step further by teaching participants how to embed maps in Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons [2]. This module builds on the basic maps created in Module 1, showing how they can be integrated into various Wikimedia projects.\n\n## Module 3: Interactive, Layered Off-Wiki Maps \nModule 3 is about creating interactive, layered Wikidata-driven maps that can be used off-Wiki, i.e., in regular HTML pages [2]. This module is more advanced and involves using some basic Python and Jupyter notebooks to create maps that can be used outside of the Wiki environment.\n\n## Learning Objectives \nThe learning objectives for each module are [2]:\n- **Module 1**: Understand steps to make basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata, based on geo-referenced (P625) items and SPARQL queries.\n- **Module 2**: Understand steps to embed maps in Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikidata.\n- **Module 3**: Understand steps to create Wikidata-based off-Wiki maps.\n\n## Conclusion \nIn conclusion, the key learning objectives for each module in the Wikidata map-making workshop differ in their focus on creating basic maps, embedding maps in Wikimedia projects, and creating interactive off-Wiki maps. \n\nThe modules differ in complexity and application, progressing from basic map creation to embedding maps in Wikimedia projects and finally to creating interactive off-Wiki maps. \n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will have gained a comprehensive understanding of how to work with Wikidata to create various types of maps for different uses. \n\nThe workshop covers a range of topics from basic to advanced map-making techniques, providing participants with a thorough understanding of how to utilize Wikidata for map creation. \n\nHere are some images showing the learning objectives for each module: \n![Learning objectives for Module 1, basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata](image1)\n![Learning objectives for Module 1, basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata, and Module 2 and 3](image2)\n![A map showing public libraries in the Netherlands](image6)\n![A GitHub repository for the Wikidata MapMakingWorkshop](image4) \n![A map of public libraries in the Netherlands](image8) \n![A heatmap of public libraries in the Netherlands](image5) \n![A map showing public libraries in the Netherlands](image7)"}

When a user requests a domain through AliCloud DNS, the system needs to efficiently direct this request to the appropriate ECS instance.\n\n### Infrastructure Flow\n\nThe figure on page 18 illustrates the flow of how AliCloud DNS interacts with ECS components. Here is a breakdown of the steps and components involved:\n\n1. **AliCloud DNS**: Receives the domain request from the user.\n2. **Server Load Balancer (SLB)**: The request is then directed to a Server Load Balancer. The SLB is used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple ECS instances to ensure high availability and reliability.\n3. **ECS Instances**: The SLB then directs the traffic to multiple ECS instances. In the provided figure, there are four ECS instances shown.\n\n### Number of ECS Components\n\nBased on the information provided and the typical infrastructure setup, the AliCloud DNS will go through **4** ECS components.

A standard plywood thickness onsite is typically 18mm, which is usually sufficient for most pours [4]. However, thicker plywood may be used when the weight of concrete causes a standard thickness plywood to bow out, distorting the concrete face [5].\n\n## Sheeting Thickness for Timber Formwork\nThe table provided in one of the images suggests that sheeting for slabs, beam sides, and beam bottoms can range from 25 mm to 40mm thick. This implies that 25mm sheeting falls within a recommended range for formwork applications.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven that 25mm sheeting is mentioned as being within the recommended thickness range (25 mm to 40mm) for certain applications in formwork, it can be considered appropriate for timber formwork.\n\nTherefore, 25mm sheeting is more appropriate than 20mm for timber formwork based on common construction practices.\n\nThe best answer is: $\\boxed{25mm}$"}

In standard consumption economics, focusing on a single activity or good can lead to diminishing marginal utility, meaning that the enjoyment or satisfaction derived from it decreases over time. This is illustrated by the example of hot dog consumption, where the utility gained from eating each additional hot dog decreases [2].\n\n## Diminishing Marginal Utility in Standard Consumption\n\nIn the context of standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility is a common phenomenon. For instance, consider the utility gained from eating hot dogs:\n- The first hot dog consumed might bring a high level of utility or satisfaction (+6 or +10).\n- However, as more hot dogs are consumed, the utility gained from each additional hot dog decreases. This can be seen in the tables provided, where the utility from each hot dog consumed decreases with each additional hot dog.\n\n| Hot Dogs Consumed | Utility from Each Hot Dog |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1    | +6                     |\n| 2    | +2                     |\n| 3    | 0                      |\n| 4    | -2                     |\n| ...  | ...                    |\n| 64   | -40                    |\n| 65   | -45                    |\n| 66   | -50                    |\n\nThis illustrates how, in standard consumption, focusing on one activity (eating hot dogs) leads to diminishing marginal utility [1].\n\n## Competitive Contexts and Focus\n\nIn competitive contexts, such as sports or competitions, the concept of focus and its impact on outcomes is crucial. The power to focus can lead to improved activity experience and outcomes due to accumulated skill (consumption capital) and cumulative experience (human production capital). For example, in competitive eating, focus can lead to exceptional outcomes, as illustrated by Joey Chestnut's record-breaking hot dog consumption.\n\n## Comparison and Contrast\n\nWhile in standard consumption economics focusing on one activity can lead to diminishing marginal utility, in competitive contexts, focus can lead to mastery and improved outcomes. This is because, in competitions, the cumulative effect of focus may be beneficial, leading to increased utility due to improved activity experience and outcomes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of diminishing marginal utility differs significantly between standard consumption and competitive contexts. In standard consumption, diminishing marginal utility leads to decreased enjoyment over time, while in competitive contexts, focus can lead to mastery and improved outcomes.\n\nThe concept of focus is essential in achieving mastery in some area, as illustrated by image2.\n\nTherefore, understanding the context is crucial in determining the impact of focus on outcomes. \n\nIn competitive contexts like sports, **focus leads to mastery**, while in standard consumption, **diminishing marginal utility** applies."}

Early in the division process, chromosomes duplicate. Each chromosome appears as two sister chromatids, containing identical DNA molecules. Sister chromatids are joined at the centromere, an narrow region [4].\n- **Metaphase**: Chromosomes line up at the center of the cell, attached to the spindle fibers [12].\n- **Anaphase**: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.\n- **Telophase**: Nuclear envelope reforms, and chromosomes uncoil to form chromatin.\n\n## Images and Cell Division Stages\n\nThe provided images show various stages of cell division:\n- ![Cell with a large blue nucleus and microtubules](image1)\n- ![Stages of mitosis, including metaphase plate and cleavage furrow](image2)\n- ![Centrosomes with centriole pairs and early mitotic spindle](image3)\n- ![Cell with a large blue nucleus and microtubules](image4)\n- ![Cell with two blue nuclei and microtubules](image5)\n- ![Cell with a large blue nucleus and microtubules](image8)\n\n## Specific Stages\n\nBased on the images and descriptions:\n- **Slide 12**: Likely represents **metaphase**, where chromosomes align at the metaphase plate.\n- **Slide 14**: Not directly mentioned but based on common cell division stages, if referring to another image, it could represent **telophase** or **cytokinesis**, given the context of provided images.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe stages of cell division shown on slides are likely **metaphase** and possibly **telophase** or **cytokinesis**, given the context of mitosis stages.

The process involves various stages, including the preparation of the site, assembly of formwork, and the actual pouring of concrete.\n\n### Stages Involving Heating\n\nHeaters are typically used in the process of concrete curing, especially in large or mass concrete pours, to maintain a consistent temperature and ensure proper setting. This is crucial for achieving the desired strength and durability of the concrete.\n\n### Specific Stage\n\n- **Stage 5: Slab Concrete Placement** - During this stage, as mentioned, the slab concrete is placed. Maintaining a suitable temperature is essential for the proper curing of concrete. This is where heaters can be used, especially in cold weather conditions or for large pours to prevent cold joints and ensure uniform setting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the context and focusing on the provided information, the stage that explicitly mentions or implies the use of heaters for temperature control during the curing process is not directly listed in the quotes. However, based on standard construction practices:\n\nThe process of heating is most relevant in **Stage 5** where temperature control is vital for concrete curing, as indicated by descriptions related to maintaining high temperatures for concrete to reach its striking strength overnight.\n\nTherefore, **Stage 5** is where heaters are implied to be used for temperature control during concrete curing.\n\n## Images Supporting Construction Process\n\nVarious images depict different aspects of formwork and construction processes:\n- `![Construction site with formwork setup for tunnel framework](image1)`\n- `![Modular column formwork system](image2)`\n- `![Detailed column formwork system](image3)`\n- `![Wall formwork system](image4)`\n- `![Formwork components and their functions](image5)`\n- `![Wall reinforcement and formwork](image6)`\n- `![Heated formwork system for concrete curing](image8)`\n\nThese images illustrate different components and stages of formwork in construction, highlighting the complexity and detail involved in creating structures with concrete.\n\n## Final Answer\n\nThe stage that requires a heater is **Stage 5** [3]."}

This rate helps in identifying how well marketing strategies are aligned with sales requirements.\n\n#### Dataset Comparison\n\n- **Image 4** provides a direct insight into the conversion rates across different stages of lead progression, including MQL to SAL. It shows that out of 19,503 total leads, 10,051 are MQLs, and 668 are SALs, leading to a conversion rate of 6.67%.\n\n- **Image 5** presents a table with various lead sources and their conversion ratios, average transition times, and flow. For instance, the Website has a conversion ratio of 47.77%, Online Ad has 13.87%, and Organic - Google has 44.84%. \n\n- **Image 6** lists different sources with their prospects, costs, and lead-to-opportunity index, providing another angle to evaluate the efficiency of different marketing channels in generating SALs.\n\n#### Implications of Differences Observed\n\nThe differences in conversion rates from MQL to SAL across datasets imply varying levels of alignment between marketing efforts and sales team requirements. A higher conversion rate indicates that marketing efforts are effectively generating leads that sales teams find valuable.\n\n- A **52.07%** conversion rate from Lead to MQL and **1.50%** from MQL to SAL in Image 4 suggests that while a significant portion of leads are qualified by marketing, only a small fraction are accepted by sales, indicating a potential misalignment or strict criteria from the sales team.\n\n- The varying conversion ratios and average transition times in Image 5 and lead-to-opportunity index in Image 6 across different lead sources highlight the importance of channel optimization.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conversion rates from MQL to SAL vary significantly across different datasets, indicating differences in marketing effectiveness, lead quality, and sales team acceptance criteria. Understanding these differences is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies and improving alignment with sales objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, comparing conversion rates from MQL to SAL across datasets reveals the effectiveness of marketing in generating qualified leads that are accepted by sales teams, highlighting areas for improvement in marketing strategy alignment with sales goals."}
