Systems perceived as invasive or unfair, such as those used in personal finance or job interviews, face significant public resistance, while those seen as neutral or beneficial, like parole scoring, are more widely accepted.

For example, if the user says, “Movie for the day after tomorrow, please,” this input is converted into a numerical representation [4]. ![User input is encoded into a continuous vector](image2)\n\n2. **Dialogue State Update**: The encoded user utterance, along with the embedding of the previous system action, is fed into a dialogue-level LSTM to update the dialogue state ($s_k$). This state maintains a continuous representation of the conversation’s progress [4][7]. ![Dialogue state is updated using LSTM](image3)\n\n3. **Dialogue State Tracking**: The dialogue state tracker estimates the user’s goals by maintaining a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot (e.g., date, time). For instance, the tracker might identify “Thursday” as the date [4][7]. ![Dialogue state tracking identifies user goals](image2)\n\n4. **Knowledge Base Query**: The system formulates a symbolic query based on the tracked dialogue state and sends it to a knowledge base (KB) to retrieve relevant information. The KB returns a ranked list of entities, which is encoded for further processing [4][5]. ![Symbolic query retrieves information from the KB](image2)\n\n5. **Policy Network Action Selection**: The policy network, conditioned on the dialogue state, slot value logits ($v_k$), and query results encoding ($E_k$), determines the next system action (e.g., “request(time)”) [1][3][9]. ![Policy network selects the next system action](image3)\n\n6. **Natural Language Generation**: The system action, along with the dialogue state and retrieved KB entities, is passed to a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG uses a template-based approach to produce the final response, replacing delexicalised tokens with relevant values. For example, the response might be, “Ok, what time do you prefer?” [4][6]. ![NLG generates the final system response](image2)\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user’s input, updating the dialogue state, querying a knowledge base, selecting an action through the policy network, and finally producing a natural language response."}

For instance, GPT-4 achieves an LI of 0% with all logical constraints on both datasets, while post-processing also reduces LI to 0% but may impact the overall generation quality due to random selection during post-processing [8]. This suggests that while post-processing guarantees the absence of logical conflicts, it can degrade semantic accuracy.\n\n![Logical constraints reduce inconsistency across models](image1)\n\n`image3` further supports this by showing that models like Vicuna-13B-PT and Llama2-13B-PT achieve lower LI (0%) with both logical constraints and post-processing. However, logical constraints often yield higher Micro-F1 scores, indicating better precision and recall balance. For example, Llama2-13B-PT achieves a Micro-F1 of 26.4% with CoT and logical constraints on MAVEN-ERE, compared to 25.9% with post-processing.\n\n![Post-processing reduces LI but may lower precision and recall](image3)\n\nAdditionally, the left graph in `image5` demonstrates that incorporating logical constraints improves Micro-F1 scores as the number of demonstration samples increases, while post-processing does not offer such consistent improvements.

Sensitivity, which measures the number of unique predictions a model generates, and WER, which quantifies the rate of incorrect word recognitions, are critical metrics for evaluating robustness against adversarial attacks.\n\nFor **closed vocabulary models** (word-only), the **neutral backoff** strategy tends to have the lowest sensitivity. This is because it maps all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words to a fixed neutral word, reducing the number of unique outputs. As a result, the sensitivity remains relatively low, ranging from approximately 11.4 to 12.6, as shown in the left scatter plot [image4]. The **pass-through** and **background** strategies, however, yield slightly higher sensitivity, with the background strategy reaching up to 12.7 [image4].

The **pass-through** strategy, which passes words as-is, results in significantly higher sensitivity—up to 30—as each character combination is considered uniquely [image4]. This makes it more vulnerable to adversarial manipulations. The **background** and **neutral** strategies, on the other hand, achieve lower sensitivity.

This reflects higher exposure to financial risks such as currency fluctuations, which are managed through these instruments. The fair value of derivatives is measured based on market prices or valuation methodologies [4], and any gains or losses are recognized in the income statement or other comprehensive income [7][9].

This increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for short-term incentive compensation, partially offset by increased working capital requirements [5]. ![The table provides a detailed breakdown of cash flow from operating activities for 2020 and 2021.](image2)\n\nFor the ME&T segment, operating profit increased by $363 million, reaching $2.768 billion in 2021 compared to $2.405 billion in 2020.

Here’s a detailed comparison:\n\n### Sales Volume:\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13,798 million, a 23% increase from $11,235 million in 2020 [10]. This growth was primarily driven by higher sales volume, which contributed $2,049 million to the increase, as shown in the bar graph. ![Consolidated sales and revenues increased significantly in 2021](image1). The increase in sales volume was fueled by higher end-user demand for equipment and services, particularly in regions like North America, EAME, and Asia/Pacific [2][4][8]. Additionally, changes in dealer inventories played a role, as dealers decreased inventories more in 2020 than in 2021 [9].\n\n### Operating Profit:\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1,611 million, up 17% from $1,380 million in 2020 [7]. The chart illustrates that this increase was driven by higher sales volume ($687 million), favorable price realization ($507 million), and lower manufacturing costs ($816 million). ![Operating profit increased due to higher sales and price realization](image4). These gains were partially offset by higher SG&A and R&D expenses, as well as increased labor costs [6][7].\n\n### Contributing Factors:\n1. **Higher End-User Demand**: Increased demand for equipment and services across regions like North America, EAME, and Asia/Pacific boosted sales volume [2][4][8].\n2. **Price Realization**: Favorable pricing strategies contributed to both sales and operating profit growth [7][10].\n3. **Dealer Inventories**: Dealers reduced inventories more in 2020 than in 2021, which positively impacted sales volume in 2021 [9].\n4. **Cost Management**: Lower manufacturing costs and restructuring gains offset higher SG&A and R&D expenses [7].\n5. **Financial Products Segment**: Increased profit from returned or repossessed equipment and lower credit loss provisions also supported operating profit [3].\n\nIn summary, higher sales volume and favorable price realization were the primary drivers of increased sales and operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2021, supported by strategic inventory management and cost control measures."}

The evaluation weight for this metric is 50%, with performance assessed against a reference value of 1 trillion yen. In the current fiscal year, Toyota achieved 150% of this target, demonstrating strong financial performance [3]. ![Consolidated operating income is evaluated against a reference value of 1 trillion yen.](image3)\n\nThe volatility of Toyota’s share price, also weighted at 50%, acts as a corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors. This metric is evaluated by comparing Toyota’s share price with the Nikkei stock average, ensuring that executive compensation reflects the company’s market performance and shareholder interests [3]. ![Share price volatility is assessed against the Nikkei average to reflect corporate value.](image3)\n\nIndividual performance evaluation provides a qualitative assessment of each director’s contributions, ensuring that remuneration is adjusted based on personal efforts and responsibilities [1]. This approach balances corporate performance metrics with individual accountability, fostering a performance-driven culture [10]. \n\nAdditionally, the Board of Directors delegates the determination of remuneration to the Executive Compensation Meeting, which reviews and approves compensation amounts in alignment with corporate performance, individual roles, and remuneration standards in the executive’s home country [5]. Fixed remuneration is stable, while performance-linked remuneration directly reflects business outcomes [3]. ![Executive remuneration includes fixed and performance-linked components.](image4)\n\nIn summary, Toyota’s executive remuneration system effectively links compensation to business performance and shareholder value, ensuring that executives are incentivized to drive sustainable growth and enhance corporate value."}

This decline was primarily driven by lower average market interest rates across major currencies, which reduced the yield on average interest-earning assets (AIEA) by 84 basis points (bps) [1][8]. However, this was partly offset by an increase in AIEA of $170.11 billion or 8.8% [8]. \n\nInterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.7 billion, down $2.9 billion year-on-year, largely due to lower market interest rates and reduced funding costs on customer deposits and debt issuances [6]. For the full year, the decrease in interest expense helped mitigate the impact of reduced NII, as funding costs of average interest-bearing liabilities fell by 67 bps [1].\n\nThese changes in NII and interest expense directly impacted the organization’s net operating income. Net operating income before credit provisions decreased due to the significant reduction in NII, which accounted for a $2.9 billion decline [8]. Furthermore, the organization’s overall profitability was affected, as reflected in key metrics such as return on average ordinary shareholders' equity, which fell from 3.6% in 2019 to 2.3% in 2020, and post-tax return on average total assets, which decreased from 0.3% to 0.2% over the same period ![Profitability metrics declined in 2020](image1).\n\nThe lower NII, combined with other financial pressures such as reduced net income from insurance businesses (-$1.5 billion) and decreased net insurance premium income (-$0.06 billion), contributed to a significant decline in the organization’s profit for the year. In 2020, profit for the year was $6.2 billion, down from $13.3 billion in 2019 ![Detailed financial performance in 2020](image5). This demonstrates that the changes in NII and interest expense had a material adverse impact on both net operating income and overall profitability. \n\nIn summary, the reduction in net interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 led to a decline in net operating income and significantly impacted the organization’s profitability."}

In 2020, there was a $249 million tax benefit due to the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position, which directly reduced liabilities and enhanced the net deferred tax asset [3]. This is further supported by the decrease in the balance of uncertain tax positions from $303 million in 2019 to $89 million in 2020, largely due to reductions for prior-year tax positions [3][4]. Additionally, the reversal of $46 million in accrued interest related to this uncertain tax position contributed to the improvement [3]. \n\nThe composition of deferred tax assets and liabilities also shifted. Deferred tax assets decreased slightly from $662 million in 2019 to $645 million in 2020, but deferred tax liabilities decreased more significantly, from $363 million in 2019 to $213 million in 2020, primarily due to reductions in liabilities related to property, plant, and equipment, and international earnings [image2].

In 1870, the population was a mere 130, but it exploded to 8,267 by 1880 and peaked at 14,096 in 1890 [5]. This rapid growth was largely driven by the Homestead Act of 1862, which encouraged settlers to claim land in Nebraska, and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, which transformed the region into a hub for agricultural development [9].\n\n![Hamilton County’s population data from 1870 to 2000.](image3)\n\nHowever, after 1890, the population began to decline steadily, with occasional fluctuations. By 1940, it had dropped to 9,982, and in 2000, it stood at 9,403 [5][3]. This decline was partly due to the mechanization of agriculture, which reduced the need for labor and led to farm consolidation. By the mid-1960s, the number of farms in Hamilton County had decreased from over 2,000 in 1900 to nearly 1,100, with the average farm size increasing significantly [4]. These changes disrupted rural life and contributed to outmigration.\n\n![A map of Hamilton County showing its communities and transportation routes.](image5)\n\nAdditionally, rural school consolidation in the early 20th century led to the closure of many local school districts, further altering the social fabric of the county [6].

For higher-resource languages, pre-training consistently yields gains of approximately 3 BLEU points across all tested language pairs [1]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the impact varies: some show minimal improvement (e.g., AZ and BE), while others, like GL, experience substantial gains of up to 11 BLEU points. This suggests that pre-training is particularly effective for languages on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [1].\n\n![Pre-training tends to boost BLEU scores, especially for low-resource languages](image1)\n\nThe effectiveness of pre-training is further highlighted in multilingual systems, where shared encoders or decoders between similar low-resource and higher-resource languages lead to significant improvements. For instance, the GL/PT pair, which has the highest language similarity, shows the largest gains, while the BE/RU pair, with the lowest similarity, exhibits minimal improvement [5]. This indicates that pre-training works best when the languages share linguistic characteristics, allowing the model to leverage cross-lingual data effectively [10].\n\n![Multilingual translation systems benefit most from pre-training when languages share similarities](image3)\n\nAdditionally, pre-training improves the translation of rare vocabulary and enhances grammatical correctness, as demonstrated in the GL→EN pair, where pre-training helped capture rare terms like \"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\" while producing more grammatically well-formed sentences [2]. This aligns with findings that pre-trained embeddings provide better representations of less frequent concepts, especially in low-resource scenarios [1].\n\nThe impact of pre-training is also evident when controlling for training data size. Experiments show that pre-trained models achieve higher BLEU scores, particularly with smaller datasets, as the gains diminish with larger training sets.

Object queries are learned positional encodings that guide the model in predicting the locations and classes of objects in an image. Here’s how they function:\n\n1. **Initialization and Input**: The object queries are initialized as a fixed small set of embeddings (e.g., \\(N\\) embeddings of size \\(d\\)) and are passed to the transformer decoder. These embeddings are distinct to ensure that the decoder produces varied predictions [5].\n\n2. **Interaction with Encoder Output**: The decoder attends to the output of the transformer encoder, which contains image features augmented with spatial positional encodings. This allows the decoder to refine its predictions by considering the global context of the image [3].\n\n3. **Parallel Decoding**: Unlike traditional transformers that use autoregressive decoding, DETR decodes all \\(N\\) object queries in parallel at each decoder layer. This parallel processing enables the model to reason about all objects simultaneously using pairwise relations between them [5].\n\n4. **Output Generation**: Each object query is transformed into an output embedding by the decoder. These embeddings are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed-forward network (FFN), resulting in the final set of predictions [5].\n\n5. **Bipartite Matching**: During training, bipartite matching is used to uniquely assign predictions to ground truth boxes, which helps in computing the matching loss for optimization [7].\n\n![DETR uses object queries to refine predictions by attending to encoder outputs and generating bounding boxes.](image2)\n\nBy leveraging object queries, DETR can directly predict a set of object detections in parallel, simplifying the object detection pipeline and eliminating the need for hand-designed components like anchor boxes or non-maximum suppression."}

This approach has been shown to consistently enhance accuracy across a diverse range of datasets, as it allows the model to adapt more closely to the target data [6]. For instance, fine-tuning with FGVC-Aircraft resulted in an overall performance of 82.7% for QWen-VL, slightly higher than the 82.0% achieved with Stanford Cars [5]. This indicates that fine-tuning is effective in bolstering the model’s ability to handle specific datasets.\n\nOn the other hand, in-context learning leverages the model’s existing knowledge by providing it with specific examples directly within the input prompt, eliminating the need for retraining.

When repetition control is introduced, the model’s ability to ask questions is hindered due to the suppression of common question-forming bigrams, such as \"do you\" or \"what is.\" This suppression occurs because repetition control discourages the reuse of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances [3]. \n\nFor example, without repetition control, a question-asking control level of \\( z = 10 \\) yields a 97.72% question-asking rate. However, with repetition control, the same setting only produces 79.67% questions [3].

This is evident from the experimental results and observations in the provided quotes. \n\nLSTM models are designed to capture sequential information, such as word order, through their recurrent transition functions. For sentiment analysis, word order is crucial because it can alter the sentiment conveyed by a sentence. For example, the phrases “not really good” and “really not good” have different levels of negative sentiment despite containing the same words, as noted in [2]. This demonstrates how LSTM’s ability to process word order enhances its performance in sentiment analysis tasks.\n\nThe importance of word order is further highlighted when comparing LSTM models trained on original versus shuffled datasets. When word order is removed by shuffling the training set, the performance of LSTM drops noticeably on sentiment analysis tasks, as seen in the Yelp Polarity dataset, where the accuracy decreased from 95.11 (Original) to 93.49 (Shuffled) [image1]. This suggests that the LSTM model relies on word-order patterns to accurately predict sentiment.\n\nIn contrast, for tasks like topic categorization or textual entailment, word-order information is less critical, as evidenced by the comparable performance of LSTM on shuffled datasets for Yahoo and SNLI [7]. This reinforces the idea that the impact of word order varies across different NLP tasks, with sentiment analysis being particularly dependent on it.\n\nOverall, word-order information significantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy in LSTM models, as it allows the model to capture nuanced sentiment distinctions that depend on the sequence of words. This is demonstrated through both the theoretical reasoning and empirical results in the experiments."}

Prob.\") and Marginal Probability (\"Marg. Prob.\") [10]. These queries are foundational and focus on understanding basic probability distributions and conditioning effects.\n\n During the **Preparation Phase**, these nodes and their relationships are extracted to understand the causal structure [4]. Following this, based on the nature of the query, the framework formalizes it and gathers all relevant data to ensure the necessary information is available to answer the question [4].\n\n- **Rung 2** focuses on causal inference queries, specifically the Average Treatment Effect (\"ATE\") and Adjustment Set (\"Adjust. Set\") [10]. These queries aim to evaluate treatment effects and identify valid adjustment sets to control for confounding variables.\n\n![The dataset contains 10,112 questions, with Rung 1 having 3,160, Rung 2 having 3,160, and Rung 3 having 3,792 questions.](image2)\n\n- **Rung 3** encompasses more advanced causal reasoning queries, including Counterfactual (\"Counterf.\"), Natural Direct Effect (\"NDE\"), Natural Indirect Effect (\"NIE\"), and Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (\"ATT\") [10]. These queries delve into counterfactual scenarios and the direct and indirect effects of treatments.\n\nThe dataset is balanced across these rungs, with Rung 1 and Rung 2 each containing 3,160 questions, and Rung 3 containing 3,792 questions [6]. This distribution ensures comprehensive coverage of causal reasoning from basic to advanced levels. The progression from Rung 1 to Rung 3 reflects an increasing complexity in the types of queries posed, aligning with a hierarchical structure in causal inference [3]. To understand the interrelation of these variables, you can visualize and extract the [causal graph](image4) as part of the **Preparation Phase**. After extraction, the Causal Chain-of-Thought (CausalCoT) Model continues to support identifying dependencies and assessing the impact of interdependent variables. When supported by sufficient evidence, counterfactual questions like this also fit well in Rung 3 queries, where the Causal Inference Engine helps compare what could have been (if the treatment had been different) versus what actually happened [2].\n\nAdditionally, the Causal Inference Engine systematically prepares the dataset by gathering all relevant data, ensuring the causal reasoning questions are identifiable and can be answered with the correct causal reasoning methods [7]. This process is particularly effective for questions that fall within Rung 3, where advanced causal reasoning is required. Overall, the dataset is designed to provide a balanced representation of query types, stories, and ground truth answers, ensuring a robust evaluation of causal reasoning capabilities [5]. When answering counterfactual questions, models demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy across different query types, influenced significantly by the example solutions provided before asking the question, as seen in [8].\n\nBy employing the **Causal Inference Engine**, queries in Rung 2 are simplified to Rung 1 terms using do-calculus rules, while Rung 3 queries are addressed through counterfactual causal inference methods. This approach ensures that each query type is evaluated using appropriate causal reasoning techniques, thereby increasing the accuracy of ground truth answers [7]. Here, instead of the Rung 2 simplification, the answer will be achieved by counterfactual causal reasoning. This leads to an even more precise evaluation of the causal effect of the intervention, ensuring accurate and identifiable results.\n\nIn summary, the dataset is distributed into three rungs: Rung 1 focuses on probability, Rung 2 on causal inference, and Rung 3 on advanced causal reasoning, with a balanced number of questions across each."}

Without repetition control, the model is able to achieve a question-asking rate of 97.72%. However, when repetition control is introduced, the model’s question-asking rate drops to 79.67% at z=10. This reduction occurs because the repetition control mechanism, specifically the *extrep bigram* feature, discourages the use of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This includes common question bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is,\" which are essential for forming questions [4].\n\n![The image illustrates how repetition control reduces the question-asking rate from near 100% to around 80% at z=10](image4)\n\nTo mitigate this issue, an additional setting, *z=10 (boost)*, is introduced.

In terms of **breadth**, MMMU covers 30 subjects across six disciplines—Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering—with 183 subfields and 11.5K questions. This extensive coverage ensures a comprehensive evaluation across a wide range of knowledge domains [1][2][10]. \n\nIn contrast, many existing benchmarks focus on daily knowledge and common sense, often limited in their image formats. MMMU, however, includes 30 diverse image formats, such as diagrams, tables, chemical structures, medical images, and sheet music, which test models’ ability to process heterogeneous visual inputs [5].\n\nIn terms of **depth**, MMMU requires expert-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, unlike benchmarks that rely on commonsense or simple reasoning. For example, solving problems in MMMU often involves applying advanced concepts like \"Fourier Transform\" or \"Equilibrium Theory\" [10]. This depth is illustrated in the image of the MMMU dataset, which highlights the need for expert-level visual perception, domain knowledge, and complex reasoning: ![MMMU emphasizes expert-level skills and diverse visual inputs](image1).\n\nMoreover, MMMU features interleaved text and image inputs, requiring models to jointly understand both modalities and recall deep subject knowledge to derive solutions [6]. This contrasts with benchmarks like VQA or GQA, which focus on simpler visual perception tasks [5].\n\nThe implications for evaluating LMMs are significant. MMMU’s breadth and depth challenge models to integrate advanced multimodal analysis with domain-specific reasoning, pushing the boundaries of their capabilities. While models like GPT-4V lead in performance, MMMU reveals substantial room for improvement, particularly in handling complex visual inputs and expert-level reasoning [8].

This encodes the possible values for each slot into representations (`y_cls`, `y1`, ..., `yc`) [3] ![The fixed BERT model processes candidate values for categorical slots](image3). \n\nNext, a **fine-tuned BERT model** processes the concatenation of domain-slot pairs (e.g., \"hotel, price range\") and the recent dialogue context.

Each module plays a distinct role in transforming a natural language problem into a logical solution.\n\n![The LOGIC-LM model's structure includes Problem Formulator, Symbolic Reasoner, and Result Interpreter modules.](image5)\n\n1. **Problem Formulator**: The process begins with the Problem Formulator, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate the natural language problem into a symbolic representation. This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules within the problem statement. For example, a natural language sentence like \"If the circuit is complete and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing\" is converted into a symbolic formulation such as `Complete(Circuit, True) ∧ Has(Circuit, LightBulb) → Glowing(LightBulb, True)`[4][8]. This module employs in-context learning to ensure accurate mapping from natural language to symbolic language[10].\n\n2. **Symbolic Reasoner**: Once the problem is formulated symbolically, the Symbolic Reasoner takes over. This module uses deterministic symbolic solvers, such as Logic Programming, First-order Logic Prover, or Constraint Optimization, to perform logical inference on the symbolic representation[1][2]. For instance, in deductive reasoning problems, a solver like Pyke might be used to derive conclusions from the given rules and facts[4][8]. The Symbolic Reasoner ensures the logical faithfulness of the solution by adhering to the rules of symbolic logic.\n\n3. **Result Interpreter**: Finally, the Result Interpreter translates the symbolic output from the Symbolic Reasoner back into natural language, providing a comprehensible answer to the original problem[1][2]. This step ensures that the solution is not only accurate but also interpretable by users.\n\nBy combining the strengths of LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic solvers for logical inference, LOGIC-LM guarantees faithful and transparent reasoning. Additionally, the model incorporates a self-refinement mechanism that iteratively improves the symbolic formulation based on error feedback from the symbolic solver[2][6]. This approach shifts the burden from LLMs performing step-by-step reasoning to focusing on accurate problem representation, significantly enhancing performance[1][6]."}

Word-level embeddings capture the semantic meaning of words, which is essential for understanding the overall context and relationships between words in a sentence [1]. However, word-level embeddings alone may not suffice for capturing subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns, which are often important in NER tasks [1]. For example, the word \"Diego\" might be a named entity (e.g., a location), and recognizing this requires understanding its components (e.g., capitalization of the first letter).\n\nCharacter-level embeddings, on the other hand, allow the model to capture these subword details effectively. By processing characters through a Bidirectional LSTM (Char Bi-LSTM), the model creates character embeddings that represent the internal structure of words [5]. This is particularly useful for handling rare words, misspellings, or morphological variations that might not be well-represented in word embeddings alone. For instance, the word \"Diego\" can be broken down into its characters (`D`, `i`, `e`, `g`, `o`), allowing the model to recognize it as a proper noun even if it is not frequently encountered in the training data.\n\n![The model uses character-level embeddings to capture subword information like morphological variations](image5)\n\nBy combining word-level and character-level embeddings, the model leverages both the semantic meaning of words and their internal structure, leading to more robust and accurate predictions. This combination is especially beneficial in NER, where both high-level context and detailed word features are critical for identifying named entities [1][5]. The word-level Bi-LSTM processes the concatenated embeddings to produce context-sensitive hidden representations, which are then used by the CRF layer to predict the optimal sequence of labels [5].

Overall, these pre-processing steps enhance the system's ability to handle complex detection tasks by refining the input data to better match the model's operational needs."}

As illustrated in the diagram, these components are central to the certification process [1][image1].\n\nUnderstanding Boolean search results through a Venn diagram, such as the one shown in the image, is particularly relevant to the **identifying talent** and **search** component. Boolean search strings, like \"Engineering AND Java NOT Manager,\" help recruiters narrow down candidates by combining or excluding specific skills or roles. The Venn diagram demonstrates how skills in Engineering, Java, and a third category intersect, allowing recruiters to visualize and target specific subsets of candidates [6][image2]. This skill is foundational for constructing accurate searches, even though newer tools may automate some aspects, ensuring efficiency and precision in talent sourcing [7].\n\nIn summary, mastering these areas, including Boolean search visualization, equips candidates to unlock the full potential of LinkedIn Recruiter and make a broader impact within their organizations [3]."}

This discrepancy suggests that the lead qualification process may be less effective compared to industry standards.\n\nSeveral implications can be drawn from this difference. First, the lower conversion rate may indicate that the criteria for MQLs are too lenient, allowing leads that are not genuinely sales-ready to be passed on to the sales team. This aligns with the concept of lead scoring, where leads are ranked based on their level of interest and sales readiness [2]. If the scoring methodology is not stringent enough, it could result in a higher number of unqualified leads being transferred.\n\nSecond, the data might suggest inefficiencies in the nurturing process. The flowchart highlights that 75% of MQLs come from a nurturing process [image5], and if this process is not effectively moving leads towards being sales-ready, it could contribute to the lower conversion rate. Additionally, 15% of leads become inactive in the last six months [image5], further indicating potential gaps in lead engagement and follow-up.\n\nTo address these issues, it may be necessary to revisit the lead scoring criteria and ensure they align with sales readiness. Improving the nurturing process through more targeted and effective marketing communications could also enhance conversion rates.

The Analytics Value Chain provides a structured process for moving data through stages—from collection and analysis to decision-making and impact—while the Levels of Analytics describe the increasing sophistication and business value of analytical activities.\n\nThe Analytics Value Chain begins with **Data Collection**, where raw data is gathered, and moves through **Analysis**, where data is transformed into insights, and finally to **Action** and **Impact**, where decisions are made based on those insights [4]. This chain emphasizes that partial progress—stopping at analysis without driving action or impact—does not yield value. ![The Analytics Value Chain illustrates the progression from data to value through reporting, analysis, action, and impact.](image4)\n\nThe **Levels of Analytics**, as illustrated in the progression from Business Intelligence to Business Analytics, show how analytical activities increase in complexity and business value.

In contrast, **Analysis** in the Value Chain aligns with the higher levels of analytics, where data and information are synthesized into insights and recommendations. ![Comparison of reporting and analysis highlights the shift from descriptive to prescriptive outputs.](image1)\n\nTogether, they ensure that data is not only analyzed but also acted upon to create measurable impact. This is reinforced by the emphasis in the Analytics Value Chain on driving decisions and value, and the Levels of Analytics’ focus on delivering increasingly strategic and actionable insights.

It is an embedded system that reads values from various sensors and uses multidimensional maps to determine the precise amount of fuel, ignition timing, and other parameters required for efficient engine operation [4]. The ECU monitors the engine’s RPM through the crankshaft position sensor, which is crucial for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing [5]. Additionally, it adjusts ignition timing to enhance power and fuel economy [6].\n\n![The ECU connects to various sensors and injectors to manage engine performance.](image5)\n\nThe ECU receives input from sensors such as the Engine Temperature Sensor, Intake Air Temperature Sensor, Mass Air Flow Sensor, Throttle Position Sensor, and Crankshaft Sensor, among others. Based on this data, it sends control signals to the fuel injectors, regulating their opening and closing to ensure the correct fuel-air mixture is delivered to the engine [1]. This process is further illustrated in the block diagram of the fuel injection system, where the ECU is part of the \"CONTROL SYSTEM,\" receiving signals from the \"DETECTING SYSTEM\" and directing the \"FUEL METERING SYSTEM\" [2].\n\n![The ECU controls the fuel injection process in the engine.](image3)\n\nIn summary, the ECU acts as the brain of the engine management system, integrating sensor data to control fuel injection, ignition timing, and idle speed, ensuring optimal engine performance and efficiency."}

For example, eating the first hot dog provides a high utility of +10, but by the third hot dog, the utility drops to 0, and further consumption leads to negative utility, as shown in the table [image4]. This reflects the idea that, over time, the enjoyment of consuming more hot dogs diminishes and eventually becomes unpleasurable.\n\n![Diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption](image4)\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can differ significantly. For instance, in a hot dog eating competition, the utility may decrease initially as more hot dogs are consumed, but at a critical point, such as tying for a championship, the utility can jump dramatically. This is illustrated in the table where utility for the 64th hot dog spikes to +5000, despite earlier consumption leading to negative utility [image5]. This demonstrates that in competitive settings, the cumulative effect of focus and effort can lead to a sudden and significant increase in utility, driven by the desire for mastery or victory.\n\n![Utility spike in competitive consumption](image5)\n\nThus, while standard consumption follows a consistent pattern of diminishing returns, competitive contexts can introduce exceptions where focus and achievement lead to unexpected utility gains. This aligns with the idea that \"in competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be good\" [10] and emphasizes the importance of decision training for competitive mastery [5]."}
