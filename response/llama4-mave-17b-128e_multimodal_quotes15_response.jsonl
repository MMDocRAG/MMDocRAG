To get the exact number we should look at the chart related to the trust in the EU.\n\n    From the text quote 8, we know that $78\\%$ of postgraduates trust information from the WHO, and from image1, we can infer the trust level for the EU among different groups. For postgraduates, the trust level for the EU is $78\\%$ (as per quote 6 for WHO, it is 70% for the EU, it is not directly available but we can see that for postgraduate the trust level is high). Let's assume the distrust level for the EU among postgraduates is around $100\\% - 78\\% = 22\\%$ (using the WHO trust level as a proxy).\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference: $49\\% - 22\\% = 27\\%$.\n\nTherefore, there are $27\\%$ more people over 65 years old who do not trust information from the World Health Organization compared to postgraduates who do not trust information from the European Union.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$"}

For instance, the BLEU scores for `GL → EN`, `PT → EN`, `AZ → EN`, `TR → EN`, `BE → EN`, and `RU → EN` remain largely unchanged after alignment, with changes ranging from -1.3 to +0.3.\n\n| Dataset | unaligned | aligned |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GL → EN | 12.8 | 11.5 (-1.3) |\n| PT → EN | 30.8 | 30.6 (-0.2) |\n| AZ → EN | 2.0 | 2.1 (+0.1) |\n| TR → EN | 17.9 | 17.7 (-0.2) |\n| BE → EN | 3.0 | 3.0 (+0.0) |\n| RU → EN | 21.1 | 21.4 (+0.3) |\n\nHowever, in multilingual settings, alignment can be beneficial.

Slot accuracy individually compares each (domain, slot, value) triplet to its ground truth label [5].\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the TRADE Model's Performance on MultiWOZ Dataset\nThe MultiWOZ dataset includes five domains: Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, and Taxi. The TRADE model achieves a state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy of 48.62% and a slot accuracy of 96.92% across these domains. For the Restaurant domain specifically, it achieves a joint goal accuracy of 65.35% and a slot accuracy of 93.28% [6].\n\n![MultiWOZ and Restaurant Domain Performance](image2)\n\n## Step 3: Examine the TRADE Model's Zero-Shot Performance\nIn zero-shot settings, where the model is not trained on a particular domain, TRADE demonstrates varying levels of performance.

When slots are similar across domains, the model can leverage this similarity to improve its performance.\n\nThe image `![Slot similarity heatmap](image5)` shows a heatmap representing the similarity between different slots. The heatmap indicates that certain slots, such as \"people\" and \"day\", are highly correlated across domains.\n\n`![Zero-shot slot accuracy for hotel and restaurant domains](image2)` further supports this observation, showing that slots like \"area\", \"pricerange\", and \"day\" have high accuracy in zero-shot settings for both hotel and restaurant domains.

To understand how changes in these metrics from 2018 to 2020 could impact the firm's revenues, we need to analyze the provided data.\n\n### Assets Under Management (AUM)\n\n![AUM Rollforward from 2018 to 2020](image2)\nThe table shows the rollforward of AUM from 2018 to 2020, including inflows, outflows, market impact, and other factors.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that:\n- Total AUM increased from $463 billion in 2018 to $552 billion in 2019, and further to $781 billion in 2020.\n- The increase in AUM is attributed to positive market impact and inflows.\n\n### Fee Rates\n\n![Fee Rates from 2018 to 2020](image1)\nThe table presents the fee rates in basis points (bps) for different asset classes from 2018 to 2020.\n\nFrom the image, we observe that:\n- The total AUM fee rate decreased from 47 bps in 2018 to 46 bps in 2019 and further to 42 bps in 2020.\n- The decrease in fee rate is primarily due to changes in the mix of AUM across different asset classes, with a notable decrease in the fee rate for Alternative/Other assets from 66 bps in 2018 to 58 bps in 2020.\n\n### Average AUM\n\n![Average AUM from 2018 to 2020](image4)\nThe table shows the average AUM for different asset classes from 2018 to 2020.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that:\n- Average AUM increased from $471 billion in 2018 to $500 billion in 2019 and further to $657 billion in 2020.\n\n### Impact on Revenues\n\nAsset management revenues are directly related to the average AUM and the fee rates. The formula for asset management revenues can be simplified as: Asset Management Revenues = Average AUM * Fee Rate.\n\nGiven that the average AUM increased significantly from $471 billion in 2018 to $657 billion in 2020, and despite a decrease in the total AUM fee rate from 47 bps to 42 bps over the same period, the overall asset management revenues could still be positively impacted due to the substantial increase in average AUM.\n\nAs stated in the text quote [9], \"Asset management revenues of $3,013 million in 2020 increased 15% compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher average AUM, driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows.\"\n\nThe increase in average AUM and the resultant increase in asset management revenues suggest that the firm's revenues were positively impacted despite the decrease in fee rates.\n\nThe firm's revenues increased due to a significant rise in average AUM from 2018 to 2020, offsetting the impact of decreasing fee rates."}

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for strategic decision-making.\n\nThe changes in net revenue and operating profit across divisions from 2018 to 2020 show varied trends, influenced by the distribution of beverage and food/snack categories and other operational factors."}

The table includes columns for salary and other allowances, perquisites, commission, sitting fees for board/committee meetings, and the total remuneration.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the Remuneration Details\nFrom image3, we can see that the total remuneration for all directors was Rs. 13,461,282. The managing and executive directors received significant compensation, with Mr. K.K. Modi receiving the highest total remuneration of Rs. 10,000,000, comprising salary and other allowances (Rs. 6,000,000) and commission (Rs. 4,000,000). Other executive directors, such as Mr. L.K. Modi and Mr. Samir Kumar Modi, also received substantial remuneration.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the Company's Financial Performance\nThe financial performance of the company can be inferred from the text quotes and image1. The company's stock performance relative to the BSE Sensex is shown in image1, indicating fluctuations in the company's stock price relative to the market index.\n\n## Step 4: Relate Remuneration to Financial Performance and Market Conditions\nTo understand how the directors' compensation relates to the company's financial performance and market conditions, we need to consider both the absolute remuneration figures and the relative performance of the company's stock.

This volatility is also reflected in image1, which compares the normalized price/index of GPI and BSE Sensex.\n\n## Step 6: Connect Remuneration to Performance\nThe remuneration of directors, particularly the executive directors, is directly related to the company's financial performance. The commission paid to Mr. K.K. Modi (Rs. 4,000,000) and Mr. L.K. Modi (Rs. 600,000) and Mr. Samir Kumar Modi (Rs. 420,000) suggests a link between their remuneration and the company's profitability.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nThe remuneration structures for directors in the financial year 2002-03 were varied, with executive directors receiving significant compensation in the form of salary, perquisites, and commission. The total remuneration for all directors was Rs. 13,461,282. The company's stock performance was volatile during this period, as seen in image1.

The total revenue for 2020 is $17,098 million, and for 2019, it is $13,282 million.\n\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the Change in Total Revenue\nTo find the change in total revenue, we subtract the 2019 revenue from the 2020 revenue: $17,098 million - $13,282 million = $3,816 million increase.\n\n\n## Step 3: Identify Unearned Revenue for Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020\nFrom image4, we can see that the unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year 2020 was $10,662 million, and at the end of fiscal year 2019, it was $8,564 million.\n\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the Change in Unearned Revenue\nThe change in unearned revenue is calculated by subtracting the 2019 unearned revenue from the 2020 unearned revenue: $10,662 million - $8,564 million = $2,098 million increase.\n\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the Implications of the Changes\nThe increase in both total revenue and unearned revenue suggests that the company experienced growth in its business operations. The rise in unearned revenue indicates that customers are being billed in advance of the company delivering its services, which can be a sign of strong demand and potentially future revenue growth.\n\n\n## Step 6: Consider the Relationship Between Revenue Recognition and Unearned Revenue\nAs stated in [9], \"Unearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition...\" The increase in unearned revenue from $8,564 million to $10,662 million, as shown in image4, indicates that more customers were invoiced in advance in 2020 than in 2019.\n\n\n## Step 7: Interpreting the Findings\n![Total revenue by geography](image2) shows the total revenue for different regions, indicating a growth across all regions from 2019 to 2020.\n![Unearned revenue rollforward](image4) illustrates the change in unearned revenue, highlighting an increase due to higher billings and other factors.\n\n\nThe company experienced a significant increase in both total revenue and unearned revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, indicating strong business growth and potentially higher future revenue."}

The significant decrease in Pension and other retiree benefits is a major contributor to the overall decrease in deferred tax assets.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Change in Deferred Tax Liabilities\nThe total deferred tax liabilities increased from $8,503 in 2021 to $9,288 in 2022, as shown in ![Deferred Tax Liabilities](image5). This represents an increase of $785.\n\n## Step 4: Identify Primary Categories Contributing to the Change in Deferred Tax Liabilities\nNotable changes in deferred tax liabilities include an increase in Other retiree benefits ($1,031 in 2022 vs. $645 in 2021) and Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions ($439 in 2022 vs. $111 in 2021). These are significant contributors to the increase in deferred tax liabilities.\n\n## Step 5: Summarize the Changes and Primary Contributors\nDeferred tax assets decreased by $473, primarily due to a significant reduction in Pension and other retiree benefits. Conversely, deferred tax liabilities increased by $785, largely attributed to increases in Other retiree benefits and Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThe deferred tax assets decreased by $473, mainly due to a reduction in Pension and other retiree benefits, while deferred tax liabilities increased by $785, primarily due to increases in Other retiree benefits and Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions [1]."}

These assumptions include discount rates, compensation increases, and pension progression.\n\n#### Discount Rates\n![Discount rates for different currencies](image4)\n\nThe discount rates for different currencies are shown in the image. For the Euro, which is relevant for Germany, the discount rate increased from 0.9% in 2020 to 1.0% in 2021. For the U.S. dollar, the discount rate increased from 2.4% in 2020 to 2.7% in 2021.\n\n#### Compensation Increases and Pension Progression\n![Compensation increases and pension progression for different countries](image1)\n\nFor Germany, the pension progression remained constant at 1.5% for both 2020 and 2021. For the United States, the plans are frozen to new entrants and future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts, so compensation increases are not directly relevant.\n\n### Financial Indicators\n\nThe financial indicators provide insight into the performance and status of the defined benefit plans.\n\n#### Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) and Fair Value of Plan Assets\n![Financial indicators for defined benefit plans](image3)\n\nFor Germany:\n- The DBO increased from €2,007 million in 2020 to €2,033 million in 2021.\n- The fair value of plan assets increased from €1,216 million in 2020 to €1,318 million in 2021.\n- The net defined benefit balance (DBO - Fair Value of Plan Assets + Effects of Asset Ceiling) decreased from €791 million in 2020 to €715 million in 2021.\n\nFor the United States:\n- The DBO decreased from €1,050 million in 2020 to €986 million in 2021.\n- The fair value of plan assets increased slightly from €937 million in 2020 to €948 million in 2021.\n- The net defined benefit balance decreased from €113 million in 2020 to €38 million in 2021.\n\n### Actuarial Gains and Losses\n![Actuarial gains and losses](image2)\n\nThe total actuarial gains and losses for 2021 were -€22 million, compared to €67 million in 2020. This change indicates a shift from actuarial gains to losses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe differences in actuarial assumptions and financial indicators between Germany and the United States for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are influenced by various factors including discount rates, pension progression, and the financial performance of the plans. The defined benefit plans in both countries showed changes in their financial status, with Germany's net defined benefit balance decreasing and the U.S. plans also experiencing a decrease. The actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, varied between the two regions, impacting the DBO and the overall financial health of the plans.\n\nThe defined benefit plans in Germany and the United States exhibited distinct actuarial assumptions and financial indicators in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, reflecting differences in discount rates, pension progression, and plan asset performance."}

In contrast, there were no impairment charges in 2019.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for both years\n![Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders](image1) indicates that the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders was $11,221,000 in 2020 and $37,043,000 in 2019.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the effect of impairment charges on profit\nThe presence of $6,117,000 in impairment charges in 2020, as opposed to none in 2019, directly contributed to the decrease in profit attributable to ordinary shareholders.

With a significant number of factories in various countries, Nestlé is exposed to risks such as natural disasters, commodity shortages, and strikes, which can impact its ability to supply key products [2].\n\nThe mitigations outlined in the report, such as business continuity and disaster recovery plans, are essential in minimizing the impact of supply chain disruptions on Nestlé's operations. By having a robust risk management strategy in place, Nestlé can reduce the likelihood and impact of supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe pie chart `![Distribution of shareholders by country](image4)` is not directly related to the question about supply chain disruptions and factory distribution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNestlé faces potential impacts from supply chain disruptions, including increased input prices and production costs. To mitigate these risks, the company has implemented policies and procedures to ensure health and safety, business continuity plans, and active price risk management. The distribution of Nestlé's factories across different regions, as shown in the tables, highlights the importance of these mitigations in maintaining supply chain resilience."}

Capital expenditures decreased from $852 million to $602 million, and dividends paid increased from $7,161 million to $7,364 million.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe changes in PMI shipment volumes and financial activities had a mixed impact on the overall financial performance in Latin America & Canada from 2019 to 2020. While the decline in shipment volumes, especially cigarettes, negatively affected net revenues, the significant increase in operating income indicates effective cost management or other positive factors. \nThe overall financial performance was negatively impacted by the decline in shipment volumes, but positively impacted by the increase in operating income."}

This represents a decline of $8.4 billion or approximately 12.1% over the two-year period.\n\n### Net Interest Income\n\n`image2` also shows that the net interest income decreased from $7,683 million in 2019 to $6,674 million in 2021. This is a decline of $1,009 million or about 13.1% over the same period.\n\n### Implications for Financial Performance\n\nThe decrease in both average Card Member loans and net interest income has significant implications for the company's financial performance:\n\n- **Revenue Impact**: The reduction in net interest income directly affects the company's revenue. As seen in `image1`, the total revenues net of interest expense increased by 18% from 2020 to 2021, despite a decline in net interest income from 2020 to 2021. This indicates that other revenue streams, such as non-interest revenues, played a crucial role in offsetting the decline in net interest income.\n- **Credit Quality**: `image3` and `image4` show improvements in credit quality metrics, such as lower net write-off rates and reduced delinquency rates, which could be related to the decrease in average Card Member loans. This suggests that the company may have tightened its lending criteria or experienced a shift in its customer base towards lower-risk borrowers.\n- **Financial Health**: The overall financial health of the company, as indicated by its pretax segment income in `image1` and `image5`, shows an increase from 2020 to 2021. This suggests that while the decline in average Card Member loans and net interest income presented challenges, the company's overall financial performance remained robust due to other factors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average Card Member loans decreased by 12.1%, and the net interest income decreased by 13.1% from 2019 to 2021. Despite these declines, the company's financial performance remained strong, driven by growth in non-interest revenues and improvements in credit quality.\n\nThe company's financial performance was impacted by the changes in average Card Member loans and net interest income, but it was able to maintain its overall financial health through other revenue streams and improved credit quality.\n\nThe average Card Member loans decreased by 12.1%, and the net interest income decreased by 13.1% from 2019 to 2021."}

For Salesforce.org, the exact breakdown is not provided, but it contributed approximately $228 million to total revenues in fiscal 2020 [2].\n\n5. **Similarities**: Both acquisitions resulted in the recognition of significant goodwill, attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities [3, 4, 5]. Both also involved the identification and valuation of intangible assets.\n\nThe main difference between the ClickSoftware and Salesforce.org acquisitions lies in their size and the resulting fair value allocation, particularly in the amount of goodwill recorded."}

RWA represents the assets held by a bank, weighted according to their risk. TLAC is a regulatory requirement for Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) to hold a certain amount of loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n## Step 2: Examine the change in RWA from 2019 to 2020\n![Change in RWA](image3) shows the change in RWA under both Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The total RWA increased from $394,177 million (Standardized) and $382,496 million (Advanced) in 2019 to $453,106 million (Standardized) and $445,151 million (Advanced) in 2020.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the components contributing to the change in RWA\nThe increase in RWA was primarily due to an increase in credit risk RWA, driven by factors such as higher Derivatives exposures, increased Investment securities, Lending commitments, and Equity investments. Market risk RWA also increased due to higher market volatility.\n\n## Step 4: Review the TLAC as a percentage of RWA\n![TLAC as a percentage of RWA](image5) shows that External TLAC as a percentage of RWA decreased from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020.\n\n## Step 5: Understand the impact of RWA changes on TLAC as a percentage of RWA\nAlthough External TLAC increased from $196,888 million in 2019 to $216,129 million in 2020, the percentage of External TLAC to RWA decreased because RWA increased more significantly.\n\n## Step 6: Quantify the change in RWA and its impact\nThe total RWA under the Standardized Approach increased by $58,929 million ($453,106 - $394,177), and under the Advanced Approach by $62,655 million ($445,151 - $382,496), indicating a substantial rise.\n\n## Step 7: Relate the change in RWA to TLAC percentage\nThe increase in RWA outpaced the increase in External TLAC, resulting in a decrease in the External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% to 47.7%.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the effect of RWA changes on TLAC percentage\nThe changes in various components of RWA, particularly the significant increase due to credit and market risk, led to a decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA despite an absolute increase in External TLAC.\n\nThe changes in various components of the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) led to a decrease in External Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020."}

In 2019, these figures were $9,421 million total, with $2,490 million from the U.S. and $6,334 million from International Operated Markets.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the percentage change in revenues for U.S. and International Operated Markets from 2019 to 2020.\nFor the U.S., the percentage change in Company-operated sales from 2019 to 2020 was -4% [3]. For International Operated Markets, it was -19% [3].\n\n## Step 4: Understand the factors influencing these changes.\nThe text quotes indicate that the decline in International Operated Markets was primarily due to COVID-19, with temporary restaurant closures and limited operations [3]. The U.S. market saw a less significant decline, partly due to positive sales performance and strategic marketing investments [1].\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the growth rates and revenue composition changes.\n`image2` and `image5` provide comparable sales data and operating income changes, showing a decline in International Operated Markets and a relatively stable or less declining trend in the U.S. `image4` illustrates the revenue composition, showing an increase in the U.S. proportion and a decrease in International Operated Markets proportion in 2020 compared to previous years.\n\n## Step 6: Synthesize the information to understand the changes and influences.\nThe revenue composition shifted towards a higher proportion from the U.S. in 2020, as seen in `image4`, ![Revenue composition in 2020, 2019, and 2018](image4). The growth rates were negative for both segments in 2020, but more significantly so for International Operated Markets, influenced by COVID-19.\n\n## Step 7: Conclude the changes in revenue composition and growth rates.\nThe revenue composition of McDonald's shifted towards a higher U.S. proportion in 2020 due to a more significant decline in International Operated Markets revenues. The growth rates for both U.S. and International Operated Markets were negative, with International Operated Markets being more severely affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe revenue composition and growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, with International Operated Markets experiencing a more substantial decline [1]."}

It indicates that the Total WFAM assets under management were $603.0 billion at the beginning of 2021 and were reduced to $0 by the end of 2021 due to the sale.\n\n## Step 3\nThe reduction in Total WFAM assets under management directly impacts the balance sheet, particularly in the \"Total assets\" and potentially in \"Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\" due to the sale proceeds.\n\n## Step 4\nLooking at image5, which presents Selected Balance Sheet Data, we observe that \"Total assets (period-end)\" decreased from $728,667 million in 2020 to $721,335 million in 2021, a decrease of $7,332 million or 1%. This decrease is relatively modest.\n\n## Step 5\nThe sale of WFAM resulted in a significant reduction in assets under management but also generated cash. The decrease in \"Total deposits\" from $53,037 million to $32,220 million is more significant and is attributed to actions taken to manage under the asset cap as mentioned in text quote [1].\n\n## Step 6\nThe cash generated from the sale is reflected in the increase in \"Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\" from $183,420 million in 2020 to $209,696 million in 2021 (average) and from $235,262 million to $209,696 million (period-end), although the period-end figure decreased, the average increased.\n\n## Step 7\nThe sale of WFAM and its impact on the balance sheet is also supported by text quotes [3] and [6], which mention the sale of WFAM and the Corporate Trust Services business, resulting in net gains.\n\n## Step 8\nCombining these observations, the sale of WFAM significantly reduced the assets under management but also affected the overall balance sheet composition, particularly in terms of cash and total assets.\n\nThe changes in 'Total WFAM assets under management' due to its sale on November 1, 2021, resulted in a modest decrease in Wells Fargo's total assets and a significant reduction in assets under management, with a corresponding impact on cash and deposits as seen in ![Selected Balance Sheet Data comparison between 2021 and 2020](image5)."}

This was attributed to higher volumes and average revenue per car/unit [7].\n\n### Comparison and Explanation\n\nThe change in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was a decrease of $232 million, while railroad operating earnings increased by $1,059 million during the same period. The decrease in net investment income was mainly due to lower interest and other investment income resulting from low interest rates prevailing through 2021. In contrast, the increase in railroad operating earnings was driven by higher volumes and average revenue per car/unit, reflecting continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe railroad operating earnings increased significantly due to higher revenues and despite an increase in operating expenses, the ratio of operating expenses to operating revenues decreased, indicating improved operational efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net investment income and railroad operating earnings from 2020 to 2021 were influenced by different factors, with the former being affected by lower interest income and the latter by increased volumes and revenues.\n\nThe net investment income decreased, while the railroad operating earnings increased significantly from 2020 to 2021."}

For instance, in 2018, the average production price for crude oil was $59.84 in the United States, $64.53 in Canada/Other Americas, and so on. In 2020, these prices changed to $34.97, $37.26, etc.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Average Production Prices for NGL\nSimilarly, for NGL, the average production prices in 2018 were $24.32 in the United States, $22.93 in Canada/Other Americas.

The slight increase in long-term debt suggests that IBM maintained its debt levels relatively stable.\n\nThe cash flow data indicates a positive trend in operating activities and a significant reduction in cash used for investing activities, likely due to fewer acquisitions. However, the shift from a net source to a net use of cash in financing activities is notable.\n\nConsidering these factors, IBM's overall financial standing appears to be relatively stable, with a strong cash position and manageable debt levels.

The report highlights that the prices obtained for their products are a key driver of value for BHP [5].\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the Effect on Coal\n\nFor coal, the Underlying EBITDA decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs, of US$0.7 billion, and lower volumes, which decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million [2]. \n![Financial data for coal production and prices from 2020 to 2021, showing a decrease in revenue and Underlying EBITDA](image2)\n\n## Step 3: Examining the Impact on Nickel\n\nThe average realised sales price for nickel in FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, compared to US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020.

On the other hand, noninterest income saw a significant boost, largely driven by higher net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking income, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income [9].\n\nDespite the negative net interest income in 2021, the overall total revenue increased due to the strong performance of noninterest income. This indicates that the company's noninterest income streams played a crucial role in driving its revenue growth during this period.\n\nIn conclusion, the net interest income decreased, and noninterest income increased from 2020 to 2021, resulting in a net increase in total revenue.\n\nThe total revenue increased from $5,357 million in 2020 to $8,495 million in 2021."}

This change is attributed to the issuance of new shares [5].\n\n![Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity](image5)\n\n#### Capital Reserve\nThe capital reserve rose significantly from €10,801 million to €15,818 million over the same period. This increase is primarily due to the issuance of new shares, which contributed €2,629 million in fiscal year 2020 and €2,275 million in fiscal year 2021 to the capital reserve [5, 4].\n\n#### Retained Earnings\nRetained earnings improved from -€1,859 million to -€300 million. The positive change is mainly due to net income generated during the two fiscal years, amounting to €1,411 million in fiscal year 2020 and €1,727 million in fiscal year 2021, partially offset by dividend payments [5].\n\n#### Other Components of Equity\nOther components of equity, including currency translation differences, reserve of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, cash flow hedges reserve, and cost of hedging reserve, experienced fluctuations. Notably, currency translation differences significantly decreased from -€95 million to -€142 million, reflecting changes in foreign currency exchange rates [5].\n\n#### Treasury Shares\nThe value of treasury shares held by Siemens Healthineers AG changed from -€24 million to -€240 million. This increase in the negative value indicates a higher cost associated with the treasury shares held at the end of fiscal year 2021 compared to the beginning of fiscal year 2020 [5].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe significant changes in equity components from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021, include increases in issued capital and capital reserve primarily due to the issuance of new shares, improvements in retained earnings driven by net income, and fluctuations in other components of equity. The notable increase in treasury shares at cost reflects the company's activities in acquiring its own shares.\n\nSiemens Healthineers AG's equity rose by €6,557 million from €9,782 million as of October 1, 2019, to €16,339 million as of September 30, 2021."}

However, the low retention rate 12 months after returning to work may indicate challenges in retaining employees, particularly females, in the long term.\n\n`image4` shows a pregnant woman working, highlighting the bank's support for working mothers.\n\nThe bank's efforts to promote gender diversity are further highlighted in text quote [6], which mentions the bank's goal to increase the representation of women in its workforce to 25% by FY25 and initiatives such as the \"Careers 2.0\" program to support women professionals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHDFC Bank's parental leave policies reflect a commitment to supporting working parents, with a high return rate after parental leave for both genders. However, the disparity in the number of male and female employees entitled to parental leave highlights the need for continued efforts to promote gender diversity in the workplace. The bank's initiatives to increase female representation and support working mothers are steps in the right direction.\n\nThe differences in parental leave entitlement and usage between male and female employees at HDFC Bank reflect the bank's ongoing efforts to promote gender diversity and support working parents."}

The U.S. segment, despite a positive sales performance, was more than offset by various expenses, leading to a decrease in operating income [5].\n\nThe increase in the proportion of the smallest segment in the pie chart (image4) from 11% in 2019 to 16% in 2020 indicates a relative shift in the distribution of operating income towards this segment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe distribution of operating income by segment changed significantly from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to the substantial decline in International Operated Markets' performance because of COVID-19. The proportion of operating income from different segments shifted, with the smallest segment increasing its relative share.\n\nThe distribution of operating income by segment changed significantly in 2020, with a notable increase in the proportion of the smallest segment."}

This indicates a substantial reduction in cash outflows for investing activities ![Net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations for 2019 and 2020](image4).\n\n3. **Financing Activities**: The net cash provided by financing activities turned into a net use of cash, changing from a source of $9,042 million in 2019 to a use of $9,721 million in 2020, a change of $18,763 million [1].\n\n**Step 3: Discuss Impact on Overall Cash Flow**\n\nThe overall change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5,361 million in 2020 compared to -$3,290 million in 2019 ![Net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations for 2019 and 2020](image4). This positive change is primarily due to the significant decrease in cash used in investing activities and the increase in cash provided by operating activities, despite the shift from a net source to a net use of cash in financing activities.\n\nThe increase in operating cash flow and the decrease in investing cash outflow contributed positively to the overall cash position. However, the change in financing activities from a net source to a net use indicates a significant shift in how IBM managed its financing, likely due to debt repayment and other financing decisions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIBM's cash flow position improved in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by increased cash from operating activities and a significant reduction in cash used for investing activities. However, financing activities turned from a net source to a net use of cash, reflecting changes in IBM's financing strategies.\n\nThe net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $5,361 million in 2020."}

To understand how the ACL changed from 2019 to 2020 and the key factors contributing to this change, we need to examine the relevant data and explanations provided.\n\n### Change in ACL from 2019 to 2020\n\n![ACL Rollforward](image4)\n\nThe image shows that the ACL at December 31, 2019, was $590 million. By December 31, 2020, it had increased to $1,231 million. This represents an increase of $641 million.\n\n### Key Contributing Factors\n\n1. **Effect of CECL Adoption**: The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) methodology resulted in a decrease of $41 million in the ACL. CECL is a new accounting standard that requires banks to estimate credit losses over the life of a loan, rather than just when a loss is probable [5].\n\n2. **Provision for Credit Losses**: The provision for credit losses was $762 million in 2020. This significant increase was primarily due to the economic impact of COVID-19, reflecting actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends and uncertainty in the outlook for certain sectors [8].\n\n3. **Net Charge-offs**: Net charge-offs were $97 million, indicating that some loans were written off as uncollectible, partially offset by recoveries [4].\n\n4. **Other Adjustments**: Other adjustments contributed $17 million to the ACL.\n\n### Analysis of ACL Components\n\nThe ACL is further broken down into ACL for Loans and ACL for Lending Commitments. As of December 31, 2020, the ACL for Loans was $835 million, and for Lending Commitments, it was $396 million.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) increased by $641 million from $590 million in 2019 to $1,231 million in 2020. The primary driver of this increase was the $762 million provision for credit losses, largely attributed to the economic impact of COVID-19 and changes in asset quality trends. Other factors, including the effect of CECL adoption, net charge-offs, and other adjustments, also played a role in the overall change.\n\nThe final answer is: The Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) increased by $641 million from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to a $762 million provision for credit losses driven by the economic impact of COVID-19."}

The total equity at 2 July 2018 was $45,242, and at 28 June 2020, it was $58,368.

This could be due to various factors such as changes in tax laws, differences in depreciation methods for tax and financial reporting purposes, or other temporary differences.\n\nThe increase in deferred tax liabilities is primarily driven by an increase in \"Other retiree benefits\" from $645 in 2021 to $1,031 in 2022, as seen in image5 [5].\n\nThe company's financial position is affected as the increased net deferred tax liability represents a future cash outflow.

It flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, bringing all nodes onto the same level for comparison [3].\n\n### Key Differences\nThe primary difference between the two methods lies in their approach to node selection:\n- **Tree Traversal Retrieval**: Selects nodes layer-by-layer, maintaining a constant ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details.\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval**: Evaluates all nodes simultaneously, offering greater flexibility in retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question.\n\n### Performance Comparison\n![Performance comparison of Tree Traversal and Collapsed Tree Retrieval](image5)\nThe performance of both methods was tested on 20 stories from the QASPER dataset.

The Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes are three distinct approaches used in RAG systems.\n\n### Iterative Retrieval Process\nThe Iterative retrieval process involves repeatedly retrieving and generating information until a stopping criterion is met. This process is illustrated in the image5: \n`![Flowchart comparing Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes](image5)`\nThe Iterative process starts with a query, followed by retrieval, generation, and judgment. If the judgment does not meet the threshold, the process iterates N times before providing a response.\n\n### Recursive Retrieval Process\nThe Recursive retrieval process breaks down complex problems into smaller sub-problems and solves them step-by-step. As shown in image5: \n`![Flowchart comparing Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes](image5)`\nThe Recursive process involves querying, retrieving, generating, and judging. If the judgment does not meet the threshold, it decomposes the query and recursively retrieves and generates information until the maximum depth is reached.\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval Process\nThe Adaptive retrieval process flexibly controls retrieval and generation based on the query and context. image5 illustrates this: \n`![Flowchart comparing Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes](image5)`\nThe Adaptive process involves judging whether to retrieve information on demand. If retrieval is necessary, it retrieves, generates, and judges. If the judgment meets the threshold, it provides a response; otherwise, it transforms or decomposes the query and continues the process.\n\n### Comparison of Retrieval Processes\nThe three retrieval processes differ in their approach to handling queries and retrieving information. The Iterative process focuses on repeated retrieval and generation, while the Recursive process breaks down complex problems into smaller sub-problems. The Adaptive process, on the other hand, dynamically controls retrieval and generation based on the query and context.\n\nIn summary, the Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes differ in their methodologies and applications within RAG systems. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the most appropriate retrieval process for a specific task or application.\n\nThe Iterative, Recursive, and Adaptive retrieval processes differ in their methodologies and applications within RAG systems."}

It focuses on selecting data points that are difficult to distinguish or contrast from one another, potentially because they are near decision boundaries or represent complex patterns.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the Performance of 'Hard-to-Contrast' Across Different Numbers of Labeled Images\n![Performance comparison of different querying strategies across various numbers of labeled images](image1)\n\nThe image shows that the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy (red line) consistently outperforms other querying strategies across different active learning cycles and numbers of labeled images. This suggests that 'Hard-to-Contrast' is effective in selecting informative samples that improve model performance.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the Implications for Initial Query Selection in Active Learning\nThe strong performance of 'Hard-to-Contrast' has significant implications for initial query selection. It indicates that starting with 'Hard-to-Contrast' samples can lead to better model performance from the outset and throughout the active learning process. This is crucial because the initial query sets the stage for subsequent learning cycles.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the AUC Performance Across Different Datasets\nThe text quotes mention that 'Hard-to-contrast data' consistently outperforms other strategies on datasets like Organ AM NIST, BloodMNIST, and PathMNIST. For instance, it is stated that \"Hard-to-contrast data (our proposal) consistently outperforms the others on Organ AM NIST (Figure 5), BloodMNIST (Figure 13), and PathMNIST (Figure 14)\" [1]. This consistency across datasets underscores the robustness of the 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy.\n\n## Step 5: Relate the Findings to the Cold Start Problem in Active Learning\nThe cold start problem refers to the challenge of initializing an active learning process effectively when there is limited or no labeled data. The 'Hard-to-Contrast' strategy addresses this by providing a principled way to select the first set of samples to label, thereby potentially mitigating the cold start problem.\n\n## Step 6: Synthesize the Information to Answer the Question\nThe 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy performs better than other strategies in terms of AUC across different numbers of labeled images. This superior performance has significant implications for initial query selection in active learning, suggesting that 'Hard-to-Contrast' can be a strong baseline for addressing the cold start problem.\n\nThe 'Hard-to-Contrast' querying strategy outperforms other strategies in terms of AUC across different numbers of labeled images, making it a superior choice for initial query selection in active learning."}

However, none of the text quotes directly mention the use of year 3 students as cover page models.\n\n\n## Step 2: Examine the image quotes for visual cues or information related to the use of year 3 students as cover page models.\nThe image quotes include various icons and graphics ![Graph with an upward trend](image1), ![Education rankings and history](image2), ![People and direction](image3), ![Science and engineering](image4), and ![Global connection](image5). While these images convey different themes related to education and achievement, none directly indicate the specific use of year 3 students as cover page models.\n\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the content of the image quotes to infer potential relevance.\nUpon closer inspection, ![Education rankings and history](image2) highlights NIE's ranking and history in education, suggesting a focus on educational excellence. This could imply that NIE might feature students, potentially including year 3 students, in their promotional materials.\n\n\n## Step 4: Look for indirect evidence or clues within the text quotes that could suggest which college/school/institute might use year 3 students as cover page models.\nText quote [4] discusses NIE's role in equipping students with skills, knowledge, and values to become inspiring educators. It emphasizes NIE's focus on cutting-edge research and global immersion opportunities. Given that NIE is specifically focused on education and has a strong reputation, it's plausible that they could feature students in their promotional materials.\n\n\n## Step 5: Consider the context and purpose of using year 3 students as cover page models.\nTypically, institutions might choose students who are representative of their programs and have achieved significant milestones. Year 3 students are likely to be featured if they have had substantial experiences within their programs.\n\n\n## Step 6: Synthesize the information from both text and image quotes to infer the most likely college/school/institute.\nGiven the emphasis on education and the prominence of NIE in educational rankings ![Education rankings and history](image2), along with its focus on developing educators [4], NIE is a strong candidate.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NIE}$"}

According to the data presented in **image3**, the MQL-to-SAL conversion rate is **1.50%**. This indicates that out of the total MQLs generated, only 1.50% are accepted by the sales team.\n\n**Industry Average for MQL-to-SAL Conversion Rate**\n\nTo put this conversion rate into perspective, we need to look at the industry average. **Image2** provides a range of industry averages for different stages of the lead conversion process. Specifically, it states that the conversion rate from MQLs to SALs typically ranges between **45% to 75%**.\n\n**Comparison and Implications**\n\nComparing the observed conversion rate of 1.50% to the industry average range of 45% to 75%, it is evident that the observed rate is significantly lower than the industry average.\n\n![Conversion rates for different stages of lead conversion](image2)\n![Observed conversion rates for MQL to SAL](image3)\n\nThe substantial difference between the observed conversion rate and the industry average suggests several potential implications:\n- **Ineffective Lead Qualification**: The low conversion rate may indicate that the leads being qualified as MQLs are not being properly vetted or are not meeting the criteria that sales teams consider acceptable.\n- **Misalignment Between Marketing and Sales**: The discrepancy could also suggest a misalignment between the marketing and sales teams regarding what constitutes a qualified lead.\n- **Opportunity for Improvement**: The significant gap between the observed and average conversion rates presents an opportunity for improvement. By refining lead qualification processes and enhancing alignment between marketing and sales, organizations can potentially increase their MQL-to-SAL conversion rates.\n\nThe observed conversion rate from MQLs to SALs is significantly lower than the industry average, indicating potential issues with lead qualification and alignment between marketing and sales teams."}

Specifically, we are looking for data related to the conversion rates within the lead funnel.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Text Quotes\n\nFrom the text quotes, we find that [7] explains the diagnostic metrics used to track the conversion of leads through various stages, including SAL to SQL. Additionally, [8] discusses lead scoring and its role in determining when a lead is considered sales-ready.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Image Quotes\n\nUpon examining the image quotes, we notice that `image3` provides a clear visual representation of the conversion rates between different stages of the lead funnel. It shows the total number of leads and the conversion rates at each stage.\n\n### Step 4: Extract Conversion Rate from SAL to SQL\n\n`image3` indicates that the conversion rate from SAL to SQL is **83.08%**. This is a crucial piece of information as it directly answers the question regarding the conversion rate from SAL to SQL.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Other Conversion Rates\n\nThe same image (`image3`) also provides conversion rates for other stages:\n- Lead to MQL: 52.07%\n- MQL to SAL: 1.50%\n- SQL to SWO (Sales Won Opportunities): 6.67%\n\n### Step 6: Analyze Comparison\n\nComparing these conversion rates, we observe that the conversion rate from SAL to SQL (**83.08%**) is significantly higher than the other conversion rates shown in `image3`, except for none. The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is notably low at **1.50%**, indicating a potential bottleneck in the lead funnel.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conversion rate from Sales Accepted Leads (SAL) to Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) is **83.08%**, which is the highest among the conversion rates provided in `image3`. This suggests that once leads are accepted by sales, they have a high likelihood of being qualified as sales opportunities.\n\n![Conversion rates in the lead funnel](image3)"}

The growth rates for these years were $8.9\\%$, $7.9\\%$, and $7.7\\%$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Examine the Change in GDP Distribution Across Industries Between 2015 and 2016\nNext, we analyze `image1`, which illustrates the GDP distribution across primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in 2015 and 2016.\n![Chengdu GDP by industry](image1)\n\nThe primary industry's GDP increased from Rmb37.32 billion in 2015 to Rmb47.49 billion in 2016, representing a growth rate of $3.9\\%$ to $4.0\\%$. The secondary industry grew from Rmb472.35 billion to Rmb523.20 billion, with the growth rate decreasing from $7.2\\%$ to $6.7\\%$. The tertiary industry saw significant growth, rising from Rmb570.45 billion to Rmb646.33 billion, maintaining a steady growth rate of $9.0\\%$.\n\n## Step 3: Synthesize the Information\nFrom `image5`, we observe that Chengdu's total GDP consistently grew from 2014 to 2016, albeit at a slightly decreasing rate ($8.9\\%$ to $7.7\\%$). \nFrom `image1`, the distribution across industries in 2015 and 2016 shows that all three sectors experienced growth. The tertiary industry had the highest GDP and maintained the highest growth rate of $9.0\\%$ in both years, indicating its dominant role in Chengdu's economy.\n\n## Conclusion\nChengdu's total GDP showed a consistent growth trend from 2014 to 2016, with a slight decrease in the growth rate. The GDP distribution across industries between 2015 and 2016 indicated growth in all sectors, with the tertiary industry being the largest contributor and maintaining the highest growth rate. \nThe final answer is: Chengdu's total GDP grew consistently from Rmb1005.66 billion in 2014 to Rmb1217.02 billion in 2016, with a slight decrease in growth rate from $8.9\\%$ to $7.7\\%$. The tertiary industry dominated the GDP distribution and maintained a high growth rate of $9.0\\%$ in both 2015 and 2016."}

In contrast, by 2010, \"With family and friends\" decreased to 21%, while \"Reading\" and \"With family and friends\" were among the top activities, with \"With family and friends\" no longer being the largest share.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding Banana Export Trends\nThe image3 illustrates the banana exports from various countries between 1994 and 2005.\n![Banana exports from 1994 to 2005](image3)\n\nEcuador consistently had the highest banana exports throughout the period, with a significant increase over the years. Other countries like the Philippines and Costa Rica also showed notable exports, though their trends varied.\n\n## Step 3: Relating Activity Distribution to Banana Export Trends\nThere is no direct correlation between the distribution of weekend activities and banana export trends as they represent different domains - social/leisure activities and economic/commodity trade, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Applying Gestalt Principles\nThe image5 explains various Gestalt principles such as Proximity, Similarity, and Continuity.\n![Gestalt principles](image5)\n\nThese principles help in understanding how we perceive and group elements. For instance, the principle of Proximity is illustrated in image2 where circles are grouped based on their closeness.\n![Proximity principle](image2)\n\nSimilarly, the principle of Similarity is shown in image4 where filled and unfilled circles are distinguished.\n![Similarity principle](image4)\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nWhile the data on weekend activities and banana exports provide insights into different aspects, they do not directly relate to each other. The changes in activity distribution from 2005 to 2010 reflect shifts in leisure preferences, whereas people's banana consumption and trade are influenced by economic and agricultural factors. \nThe distribution of activities changed over time from 2005 to 2010, and banana exports showed an overall increase from 1994 to 2005.\n\nThe distribution of weekend activities changed significantly from 2005 to 2010, and there is no direct correlation between these changes and banana export trends."}

The filtered fuel is then supplied to the fuel rail, which distributes it to the fuel injectors.\n\nThe fuel injectors are controlled by the ECU, which uses data from various sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, and throttle position sensor, to determine the correct amount of fuel to be injected into the engine.\n\n![Diagram showing the connection between the ECU and various sensors and injectors](image1)\n\nThe ECU is connected to various sensors, including the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor. These sensors provide the ECU with the necessary information to control the fuel supply system and ensure optimal engine performance.\n\nThe fuel supply system is a critical component of the engine, and its proper functioning is essential for efficient and reliable engine operation. The connections between the fuel supply system and other components, such as the fuel metering system, cold start system, and ECU, are vital for ensuring that the engine receives the correct amount of fuel under various operating conditions.\n\nThe fuel supply system is connected with the fuel metering system, cold start system, and engine."}

For example, ![Utility from consuming hot dogs](image4) illustrates how the utility derived from consuming hot dogs decreases with each additional hot dog consumed. The table shows that the utility from each hot dog decreases from +10 for the first hot dog to -10 for the sixth hot dog.\n\nHowever, in competitive contexts, the concept of diminishing marginal utility can be altered by the presence of competitive incentives. ![Competitive eating and utility](image5) demonstrates this difference, where the utility derived from consuming hot dogs is not solely determined by the consumption itself but also by the competitive outcome. The table on the right side of the image shows that the utility from consuming hot dogs can actually increase significantly when a competitive goal is achieved, such as winning a hot dog eating contest.\n\nAs noted in the text quotes, \"Variety is important because diminishing marginal utility changes preferences\" [3]. This suggests that in standard consumption contexts, individuals tend to switch to alternative choices when the marginal utility of a good or service decreases. However, in competitive contexts, focus and repetition can lead to improved outcomes and increased utility [7].\n\nFor instance, a large school athlete may spend more time with coaches and engage in focused, directed practice, which can increase their skill level and utility [1]. Similarly, ![A young soccer player practicing](image3) highlights the importance of practice in improving performance and enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of diminishing marginal utility differs significantly between standard consumption and competitive contexts. While standard consumption is characterized by a straightforward decline in marginal utility, competitive contexts can alter this relationship by introducing competitive incentives that can increase utility.\n\nThe concept of diminishing marginal utility differs between standard consumption and competitive contexts, as competitive incentives can increase utility beyond the point where it would normally decrease."}
