Younger adults (ages 18-29) are more concerned that the government policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, while older adults (65+) are more worried about civil liberties being restricted too much [2]. Politically, Democrats generally hold more positive views than Republicans or Independents, with a majority saying the government is doing at least fairly well reducing the threat of terrorism [7].\n\nOver time, there has been a shift in public perception regarding government anti-terrorism policies. Initially, more people were concerned that these policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties [8]. However, this concern has decreased dramatically since July 2013 following Edward Snowden’s leaks about NSA surveillance programs. Currently, more Americans believe that the government’s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country rather than having gone too far in restricting civil liberties [5].\n\nThe image graphs illustrate these trends. Image 1 shows how evaluations of government efforts to combat terrorism have declined across all political parties over time, particularly for Republicans under Obama's presidency. Image 2 highlights the age gap in concerns: younger adults are more concerned about civil liberties being restricted, while older adults worry more about security. Image 3 demonstrates that those with higher education levels tend to view government performance more positively, with postgraduates showing the highest approval rates. Image 4 compares the percentage of respondents who believe the government has done very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat by political affiliation, revealing that Democrats consistently hold more favorable views than Republicans or Independents. Lastly, Image 5 depicts the changing balance between concerns about civil liberties being restricted too far versus insufficient protection of the country, indicating a shift towards greater emphasis on national security.\n\nIn summary, younger adults prioritize protecting the country from terrorism, whereas older adults focus more on civil liberties. Political ideology also plays a significant role, with Democrats generally holding more positive views compared to Republicans and Independents. These perceptions have evolved over time, with a notable decline in concern about civil liberties restrictions starting around 2013."}

Seniors with higher incomes and college degrees are more likely to adopt these technologies compared to those with lower incomes and less education. For instance, according to [Image 1], college graduates and those earning above $75,000 annually are more likely to own both an e-book reader and a tablet computer. Similarly, as shown in [Image 4], smartphone ownership is highest among seniors with higher education and income levels.\n\nThe trends depicted in [Image 2] indicate a steady increase in internet usage among older adults, which aligns with the data showing a rise in broadband adoption rates [Quote 2].

This suggests that social media platforms could benefit from implementing features that highlight supportive interactions and discourage bullying, especially tailored towards male users.\n\nIn terms of advertising, while majorities across age groups find it acceptable for social media sites to show them events happening in their area, there is a notable difference when it comes to recommending people they might know. Younger users (ages 18-49) are more accepting of this practice (66% vs. 33% for those aged 65 and older), indicating that younger users may be more open to personalized recommendations based on their online activities. Therefore, social media platforms should consider these demographic differences when tailoring their recommendations and advertisements to ensure they resonate effectively with different user groups."}

For instance, younger users (ages 18-29) are more accepting of data being used to recommend events in their area and to show them advertisements for products or services compared to older users (ages 65+). However, older users are much less accepting of data being used to recommend people they might know or deliver messages from political campaigns. This disparity highlights that context plays a crucial role in determining user comfort levels, as seen in the survey findings [7] and image1.\n\nMoreover, the image2 provides further insight into how users across different age groups view the acceptability of these practices on a scale from \"Not at all acceptable\" to \"Very acceptable.\" It shows that while younger users find it more acceptable for social media sites to use their data for advertising and event recommendations, older users tend to be more cautious about such uses, especially when it comes to political messaging and recommending acquaintances.\n\nIn conclusion, the varying perceptions among age groups regarding the acceptability of social media platforms using their data reflect broader differences in comfort levels, influenced by contextual factors like the nature of the data usage and its potential implications [8]."}

For instance, while 54% believe the personal finance score algorithm would be effective at identifying good customers, only 32% think it is fair to consumers [1]. Similarly, although 49% find the parole scoring algorithm effective, 50% consider it fair to those up for parole [1]. These discrepancies suggest that public trust in these systems is contingent on their perceived fairness and effectiveness.\n\nImage1 illustrates that a majority (58%) of Americans believe computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias, while 40% think they can be designed bias-free [6]. This indicates skepticism about the inherent fairness of automated systems.\n\nImage2 reveals that among those who find the use of automated personal finance scores acceptable, 31% cite its effectiveness as the main reason, whereas 26% find it unacceptable due to privacy violations [7].\n\nImage3 highlights that the difference between effectiveness and fairness ratings varies across systems. The largest gap (+22) exists between the effectiveness and fairness ratings for the personal finance score algorithm, compared to smaller differences for other systems like video job interviews (+6) and resume screening (+4). This suggests that the public may be more accepting of certain algorithms if they perceive them as effective, even if they are not viewed as fair.\n\nImage4 further supports this notion by showing that people generally view automated scoring of parole applicants as somewhat fair (41%), followed by job applicants (35%), video job interviews (27%), and personal finance scores (27%). However, the lowest rating is given to personal finance scores (6%).\n\nImage5 demonstrates that younger adults (ages 18-29) are more likely to accept recommendations from social media sites than older adults (ages 65+) [5]. This implies that age might influence public trust in automated systems, with younger individuals potentially being more open to such technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, the varying perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across different automated systems highlight the need for transparency and accountability in their design and implementation. Public trust in these systems could be enhanced by addressing concerns related to fairness, privacy, and accuracy, especially considering demographic variations in acceptance levels."}

According to the data, a significant portion of Hispanic adults do not identify as Hispanic, particularly among those with more distant immigrant roots [3]. Factors such as speaking Spanish, having a Spanish last name, and mixed backgrounds play a role in this identification process [5, 4, 10].\n\nIn terms of cultural background, the image shows that while a majority of foreign-born Hispanics consider themselves typical Americans, this percentage increases significantly among second-generation Hispanics (63%) and third or higher generation Hispanics (73%), reflecting their birth country and lifetime experiences [7]. This suggests that generational distance from the immigrant experience correlates with a stronger sense of American identity.\n\nLanguage use also varies across generations. The chart indicates that fewer than one-third of third or higher generation Hispanics speak Spanish regularly compared to over half of foreign-born Hispanics [5]. Similarly, only about 28% of self-identified Hispanics say they need to speak Spanish to be considered Hispanic/Latino, highlighting the diminishing importance of language as a marker of identity in later generations [9].\n\nFurthermore, the reasons for non-identification as Hispanic are diverse and include mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives, and lack of cultural links [10]. These factors contribute to the observed decline in self-identification rates among successive generations.\n\nIn summary, the factors influencing Hispanic self-identification vary across generations, with cultural assimilation, language use, and personal experiences playing key roles. As individuals move further away from their immigrant heritage, their identification with Hispanic/Latino culture tends to weaken, leading to lower rates of self-identification as Hispanic."}

These results suggest that ICL makes errors primarily in categories with similar label anchors, supporting the hypothesis that label words serve as anchors in in-context learning.\n\nIn summary, the GPT-J model demonstrates superior efficiency improvements over the original ICL, achieving higher accuracy on all metrics across various datasets compared to GPT2-XL. The confusion matrices provide insights into the classification accuracies by highlighting the specific categories where the models struggle due to similar label anchors."}

For instance, using adversarial distractors can improve the model's performance on both types of questions [4]. Additionally, filtering distractors based on entity type helps mitigate entity type bias, as seen in Table 4 where the original model's accuracy drops significantly but recovers when trained on adversarially selected distractors with filtering [6]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions is highlighted, suggesting that future datasets should consider developing better retrieval methods to enhance performance [5]. The image2 table illustrates how providing additional gold paragraphs improves the F1 score in open-domain settings, indicating the importance of comprehensive evidence provision [2].\n\nIn summary, different training and evaluation strategies such as using adversarial distractors, filtering based on entity type, and providing more context through additional paragraphs can significantly impact F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks."}

As shown in Table 4, when models are trained and validated on the original data and then evaluated on the adversarial set, their results degrade to random accuracy, indicating that they rely heavily on spurious statistical cues present in the original training set. However, when models are trained from scratch on the adversarial training and validation sets and then evaluated on the adversarial test set, BERT achieves a maximum test set accuracy of 53%, which is still below its peak performance on the original dataset but demonstrates robustness against these cues.\n\nFrom these results, it can be concluded that the adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension by eliminating spurious statistical cues over labels. This approach helps identify whether models are truly understanding the arguments or merely exploiting superficial patterns. The success of this method suggests that future research should adopt such an adversarial dataset as the standard for evaluating models on the ARCT task, ensuring that any observed performance improvements are due to genuine understanding rather than exploitation of dataset-specific artifacts."}

The increase in total revenue also suggests that the company is expanding its customer base and market share, possibly through strategic acquisitions and successful execution of its business model. However, it's important to note that the comparability of operating results might be impacted by these recent acquisitions and business combinations [10].\n\n```markdown\nAs of January 31, 2020, the total revenue increased significantly to $17,098 million from $13,282 million in fiscal year 2019.\n```\n\n![{conclusion}](image2)\n\n```markdown\nThe unearned revenue balance increased from $25.7 million in fiscal year 2019 to $30.8 million in fiscal year 2020.\n```\n\n![{conclusion}](image4)\n\n```markdown\nThese changes suggest a robust financial performance with potential for future revenue growth.\n```"}

This decline was attributed to sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment due to COVID-19, which partly offset positive performance in the U.S. segment [8].\n\nThe main contributing factors to these changes include:\n- Revenue declines in the International Operated Markets segment due to temporary restaurant closures and limited operations.\n- Higher depreciation costs related to investments in Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\") and marketing support for recovery and growth.\n- Increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of marketing contributions, higher investments in strategic technology initiatives, and one-time brand communications campaigns.\n- Lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses due to fewer sales primarily in the U.K. and the U.S.\n\nIn summary, the decline in total revenues and restaurant margins can be attributed to the impact of COVID-19 on international markets, increased marketing and operational expenses, and lower gains from the sale of restaurant businesses."}

Similarly, Mars' net income fell from $154 million in 2018 to $154 million in 2019, and remained at $154 million in 2020.\n\nThese changes could be influenced by various factors such as fluctuations in total revenues, operating expenses, and other financial activities. For instance, the table of statements of income shows that while there were no significant changes in total revenues or operating expenses for Amberjack and Mars between 2018 and 2020, the operating income for Amberjack increased slightly from $157 million in 2018 to $154 million in 2019, and then back to $157 million in 2020.

Additionally, the image quotes show a significant reduction in interest and other investment income from $1,059 million in 2020 to $589 million in 2021, reflecting a 44.4% decrease. This decline is also mirrored by the substantial drop in fixed maturity securities from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, indicating a shift towards shorter-term investments that offer lower yields but maintain liquidity.\n\nThe asset allocations in image1 support this trend, showing a decrease in equity securities from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, while fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021. These changes reflect a strategy of reducing exposure to longer-term, lower-yielding assets in favor of more liquid, short-term investments to manage risk during periods of low interest rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was driven by lower interest rates impacting cash and U.S. Treasury Bill earnings, which is reflected in the reduced allocation to fixed maturity securities and increased holdings of cash and short-term investments."}

Due to the capital increase in March 2021, subscribed capital rose by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million.\n[5] In fiscal year 2021, an increased number of treasury shares was repurchased to fulfill share-based payment programs based on shares of Siemens Healthineers AG.\n[6] As of September 30, 2021, a multicurrency revolving credit facility existed in an amount up to €1.1 billion (September 30, 2020: €1.1 billion). It serves as financing of net working capital and as short-term loan facility.\n\n#### Image Quotes:\n- **Image 3**: Shows changes in issued capital, capital reserve, retained earnings, other components of equity, treasury shares, total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG, and non-controlling interests.\n- **Image 4**: Displays cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\n#### Analysis:\n\nFrom the text quotes, we see that Siemens Healthineers' equity increased significantly by €2,641 million due to a capital increase in March 2021, which led to a rise in subscribed capital by €53 million and capital reserves by €2,284 million. This indicates that the company issued new shares, increasing its capital base and thereby boosting equity.\n\nThe image quotes provide further insights into the financial health of Siemens Healthineers. Specifically, **Image 3** shows that the total equity attributable to shareholders increased from €12,498 million in 2020 to €16,339 million in 2021. This substantial increase aligns with the text quote, confirming the significant capital increase.\n\nAdditionally, **Image 4** reveals that cash flows from operating activities were €2,933 million in 2021 compared to €1,928 million in 2020, indicating improved operational performance. However, cash flows from investing activities decreased significantly from €-1,912 million in 2020 to €-14,140 million in 2021, reflecting higher investments or acquisitions during this period.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nSiemens Healthineers' liabilities and equity changed significantly from 2020 to 2021. Equity increased substantially due to a capital increase, primarily driven by issuing new shares and growing capital reserves. Liabilities also saw notable changes, particularly in current provisions and deferred tax liabilities, which increased from €270 million to €356 million and from €470 million to €2,082 million, respectively. These increases suggest potential growth initiatives and strategic investments."}

This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, short-term investment securities, and long-term debt.

The decrease in liabilities was mainly due to reductions in customer deposits, accounts payable, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt.

This reduction in assets under management led to a decrease in noninterest income, as detailed in image4, where investment advisory and other asset-based fees increased by $1.489 billion but were partially offset by lower gains on debt securities and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk.\n\nOn the broader company's income statement, image4 shows that net interest income decreased by $418 million compared to the previous year, while noninterest income increased by $1.551 billion. The increase in noninterest income was attributed to gains from the sale of Corporate Trust Services ($674 million), student loan portfolio ($355 million), and WFAM ($269 million). However, these gains were partly offset by lower gains on certain residential mortgage loans reclassified to held for sale and higher valuation losses related to retained litigation risk.\n\nIn terms of the balance sheet, image3 indicates that total assets decreased by $7,332 million, with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreasing by $25,566 million.

Initially, the county's population surged dramatically in the late 1800s, peaking at 14,096 in 1890. This growth was largely driven by the Transcontinental Railroad Act and the Homestead Act, which facilitated westward expansion and land acquisition [9]. However, after reaching its peak, the population began a slow decline, reflecting broader trends in rural America as farm consolidation continued [3].\n\nFrom 1900 onwards, the number of farms in Hamilton County steadily declined while the average size of farms increased due to mechanization and rising costs of operation [4]. This consolidation trend contributed to the overall decrease in population, as fewer individuals were needed to manage larger agricultural operations.\n\nDespite these challenges, Aurora, the largest town in the county, demonstrated recent population gains, contrary to the general trend of small towns disappearing [2]. The map of Hamilton County shows that Aurora is located in the southeastern part of the county, suggesting it may have benefited from better infrastructure or economic opportunities compared to other rural areas [5].\n\nIn summary, the population trends of Hamilton County were influenced by historical factors such as the development of railroads and homesteading acts, which initially led to rapid population growth. Subsequently, the shift towards large-scale agriculture and farm consolidation resulted in a gradual decline in population, although some towns like Aurora managed to maintain or even increase their populations."}

Republicans are more likely to view issues like terrorism, defense, and national security as major threats compared to Democrats and independents [3]. Independents and Democrats tend to believe that the world's problems would be worse without U.S. involvement [8], while Republicans are more inclined to see these efforts as effective against terrorism [4].\n\nIn terms of specific policies, there is a notable partisan divide on whether the U.S. should send ground troops to Iraq and Syria [5]. Republicans favor this action significantly more than Democrats, with 66% supporting it compared to only 28% of Democrats.\n\nAdditionally, there are differing views on the effectiveness of government efforts to combat terrorism. While a majority of Democrats now say the government is doing at least fairly well (down from 85% in January), this number has dropped for both Republicans and independents [4]. This suggests a decline in trust across the board but particularly pronounced among Republicans.\n\nThe image data further supports these findings. Image1 shows that Republicans consistently rate Islamic extremism around the world higher than Democrats and independents, indicating a greater perceived threat [image1]. Similarly, Image2 illustrates a decline in approval ratings for government efforts to combat terrorism over time, affecting all groups but most notably Republicans [image2].\n\nImage3 highlights that while Americans overall approve of government efforts to solve problems around the world, there is a clear partisan gap. Only 46% of Republicans approve, compared to 57% of Democrats and 51% of independents [image3]. This aligns with the text quote that indicates Republicans are less likely to believe U.S. efforts make things worse [10].\n\nOverall, the evidence points to a complex landscape where Republicans perceive greater threats and are more skeptical of government actions, whereas Democrats and independents generally view U.S. involvement positively but with some reservations about its effectiveness [9]."}

This helps the MLLMs rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity.\n\n4. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: For object detection datasets, pre-processing steps like cropping and blurring are applied to focus the MLLMs' attention on relevant objects (image5).\n\nBy combining these components, the RAR pipeline aims to bridge the gap between broad generalization capabilities of MLLMs and the need for precise, fine-grained categorization, thereby improving performance on downstream tasks."}

The implications for model performance suggest that improving retrieval methods, especially for multi-hop questions, is crucial. Additionally, the use of adversarial selection can help mitigate some of these issues, as seen in Table 4 where the model's accuracy improves from 46.84 to 60.10 after retraining on adversarial distractors. However, finding a small set of distractors that induce multi-hop reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the need for further research in this area.\n\n![Table 5: The accuracy of single-paragraph BERT in different open-domain retrieval settings. TF-IDF often fails to retrieve the gold paragraphs even when using 500 candidates.]()\n\nThe inclusion of gold paragraphs and well-chosen distractors can enhance the performance of multi-hop question answering models, as demonstrated by the higher F1 scores achieved when additional gold paragraphs are available."}

Unlike many existing benchmarks that focus on daily knowledge and common sense, MMMU emphasizes college-level knowledge and involves intricate problem-solving processes that demand advanced multimodal analysis integrated with domain-specific expertise [5]. The implications for its use are significant: MMMU provides a comprehensive framework for assessing LMMs' capabilities in handling complex, interdisciplinary tasks that require sophisticated perception, recall of specialized knowledge, and reasoning skills.

Conversely, while ChatGPT performs well overall, its lower performance under specific settings might indicate that it could benefit from more explicit guidance or context to achieve optimal results. This trade-off between question specificity and knowledge coverage highlights the importance of tailoring model selection and evaluation criteria based on the task requirements."}

The image4 illustrates Mendel's explanation for a monohybrid cross where purple-flowered peas (PP) are crossed with white-flowered peas (pp). In the parental generation (P), all plants have purple flowers due to the dominant allele P. When these plants self-fertilize (F1 generation), they produce offspring that are all heterozygous (Pp), as shown in the image4. These heterozygous plants then self-fertilize again (F2 generation), resulting in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of purple to white flowers, which corresponds to a 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp genotypic ratio, as depicted in the image4.\n\nThe inheritance of traits follows specific patterns based on the alleles present. For example, if a trait is controlled by a dominant allele (like purple flowers), it will be expressed in the presence of at least one copy of that allele. Conversely, recessive alleles (like white flowers) require two copies to be expressed. This explains why some traits may disappear in the F1 generation but reappear in the F2 generation, as seen in Mendel's experiments with pea plants.\n\nIn summary, Mendelian inheritance explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation of pea plants through the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the random combination of alleles during fertilization."}
