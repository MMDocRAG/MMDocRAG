A query is used to retrieve relevant documents, and then those documents, along with the query, are fed to a language model to generate a response.\nNaive RAG is characterized as having a \"simple 'Retrieve' and 'Read' mechanism.\" [1].\n*    It can be likened to providing the model with a tailored textbook [7].\n*   **Limitations:** It may face challenges with retrieval quality, leading to issues like hallucination or outdated knowledge in the generated response [5].\n\n**Advanced RAG:**\n\n*   **Improvements over Naive RAG:** It is designed to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG [10].\nIt does that by, focusing on enhancing retrieval quality [10].\n*   **Strategies:**\n    *   **Pre-retrieval:** Refines indexing techniques using methods like sliding windows, fine-grained segmentation, and incorporating metadata [10].\n    *   **Post-retrieval:** Employs optimization strategies to streamline the retrieval process [10].\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to over- come the limitations of Naive RAG. [10].\n\n**Modular RAG:**\n\n*   **Flexibility and Adaptability:** This framework offers greater adaptability and versatility than the previous two [11]. It allows for module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges [1].\n*   **New Modules:** Introduces specialized components [6]:\n    *   **Search Module:** Enables direct searches across various data sources [6].\n    *   **Memory Module:** Uses the LLM's memory to guide retrieval [6].\n    *   **Routing Module:** Navigates diverse data sources to select the optimal pathway for a query [6].\n    *   **Task Adapter Module:** Tailors RAG to different downstream tasks [6].\n*    **New Patterns**:\n    *   Adjustments in module arrangement, such as Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) and ITER-RETGEN [3].\n    *   Flexible orchestration, such as FLARE and Self-RAG [3].\n*It builds upon principles of both Naive and Advanced RAG [11].\n* **Integration:** It can more easily integrate with other technologies, like fine-tuning or reinforcement learning [3].\n*Visual representation of comparing the three RAG types:\n![Modules](image4)\n\nIn summary, Naive RAG is a basic \"retrieve-and-read\" approach, Advanced RAG improves retrieval quality through pre- and post-retrieval strategies, and Modular RAG introduces a flexible, adaptable framework with specialized modules and the ability to integrate with other AI techniques.\n"}

On MEDHOP, BiDAF scores 47.8 (test) and 61.2 (test*), compared to FastQA's 23.1 (test) and 24.5 (test*) [image3]. The superior performance of BiDAF is consistent with findings on other datasets and may be attributed to its iterative latent interactions, which are beneficial for integrating information across documents [12].\n![Performance of BiDAF and FastQA on the standard test set](image3)\n\nWhen tested with only the \"gold chain\" documents (those leading to the correct answer), both models show substantial improvements.

On MEDHOP, BiDAF reaches 86.4 (test) and 89.8 (test*), while FastQA achieves 54.6 (test) and 59.2 (test*) [image3]. This improvement indicates that both models can identify the answer more effectively when irrelevant documents, which may contain misleading candidate answers, are removed [1].\n![Performance in gold chain setup](image3)\n\nUnder masked conditions, where answer expressions are randomized, BiDAF maintains a higher performance level than FastQA. On WIKIHOP, BiDAF achieves 54.5 (test) and 59.8 (test*), compared to FastQA's 35.8 (test) and 38.0 (test*). Interestingly, BiDAF's performance is dramatically increased compare to unmasked setting.

The discount rates are determined by yields on high-quality corporate bonds, and if these are unavailable, government bond yields are used [4].\n\nFor example, an increase of 0.5 percentage points will decrease by 242 Million Euros in 2021.\n\n![Effect on defined benefit obligation due to a change of half a percentage-point](image1)\n\nThe fluctuation in these financial assumptions directly contributes to the actuarial gains or losses experienced in the defined benefit plans.\n\nIn summary, the shift from a gain of €72 million in 2020 to a loss of €26 million in 2021 due to changes in financial assumptions highlights the sensitivity of Siemens Healthineers' defined benefit plans to financial market conditions.\n"}

In 2019, the company reported a total upstream earnings of $2.576 billion [3]. This drastically changed in 2020 to a loss of $2.433 billion [3], largely due to factors like lower price realizations for crude oil and impairments [3, 10]. However, in 2021, upstream earnings rebounded strongly to $15.818 billion [3].

This new standard introduced a single, on-balance sheet accounting model for lessees [4]. Consequently, the Group recognized a right-of-use asset (representing the right to use underlying assets) and lease liabilities (representing the obligation to make lease payments) [4].\n\nAt the transition, lease liabilities previously classified as operating leases under AASB 117 were measured at the present value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate as of July 1, 2019 [9].\n![Recognition of lease liability on initial application of AASB 16](image1)\n\nThe initial application of AASB 16 resulted in the recognition of a lease liability of $43.62 million [image1]. The Group no longer recognizes provisions for operating leases that it assesses to be onerous, instead, the payments due under the lease in its lease liability. [image2]. The Group also, no longer recognises provisions for straight-line rent and lease incentives [image7].\nThe standard's adoption also changed how site restoration costs are treated. These costs are now capitalized as part of the lease right-of-use asset and depreciated over the lease term [3].\n\nRegarding employee benefit liabilities, the Group's net obligation for long-term service benefits is calculated based on future benefits earned by employees [10].\n![Total employee benefit liabilities](image3)\nLiabilities for employee benefits such as wages, salaries, and annual leave, expected to be settled within 12 months, are calculated at undiscounted amounts [1].

Twice as many people (56%) believed that anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough to protect the country, compared to those who thought they had gone too far in restricting civil liberties (28%) [10]. This indicates that concern about protection clearly surpassed the concerns about civil liberty. A similar trend can be observed visually:\n\n![Not gone far enough to protect country](image8)\n\nIn addition, the public's assessment of the government's performance in minimizing the terrorist threat has reached its lowest point since September 2001 [6].\n\nIn conclusion, from 2004 to 2015, public opinion shifted towards a greater concern that anti-terrorism policies were not adequately protecting the country, with concerns over civil liberties diminishing, especially after 2013.\n"}

For instance, when repetition control is applied, the setting designed to produce 100% questions (`z=10`) only results in 79.67% questions. This reduction is attributed to the `extrep bigram` feature, which discourages bigrams previously used. Questions commonly include bigrams like \"do you\" and \"what is.\" ![Controlling question frequency with and without repetition control](image4)\n\nHowever, adjustments can be made to mitigate this effect. An extra setting, labeled as '10 (boost)', can be applied that foregoes `extrep bigram` during beam search, and only uses it in the reranking phase. This allows more bigrams typical of question asking, and reaches the desired rate of near 100% questions, at the expense of slightly higher external bigram repetition[10].\n\nIn summary, the presence of repetition control decreases question-asking frequency due to restrictions on repeating bigrams, although modifications can restore question frequency.\n"}

Specifically, the F1 score rises from 39.12 to 53.12 when two gold paragraphs are added to 500 retrieved paragraphs.\n![Evaluation Data Training Data](image4)\n\nConversely, the introduction of distractors, especially those selected through adversarial methods, can initially decrease the F1 score [2, 8]. The accuracy of single-paragraph BERT declines from 67.08 F1 to 46.84 F1, when using adversarial distractors [2].\n![Evaluation Data Training Data](image2)\nHowever, models can recover some of their accuracy when retrained on these new distractors [3, 6, 8].\n\nThe implications are that model performance is highly sensitive to the quality and relevance of both the gold paragraphs and the distractors [3, 5, 11]. Standard retrieval methods like TF-IDF are often insufficient for multi-hop questions, which leads to poor performance when relevant paragraphs are not retrieved [5, 11].\n![Type Question %\nMulti-hop Ralph Hefferline was a psychology professor at a university that is located in what city? 27\nWeak distractors What government position was held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in 35\nthe film Kiss and Tell?\nRedindantevidencs Kaiser Ventures corporation was founded by an American industrialist who became 6\nknown as the father of modern American shipbuilding?\nNon-compositional 1-hop When was Poison’s album ‘Shut Up, Make Love’ released? 8\n](image1)\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of gold paragraphs improves F1 scores by providing necessary information, while the inclusion of strong distractors can challenge the model, although retraining can mitigate some negative effects.\n"}

Start at the root layer [12].\n2.  Compute cosine similarity between the query and nodes at the current layer [12].\n3.  Select the top *k* nodes based on similarity scores, forming set *S*<sub>1</sub> [12].\n4.  Proceed to the child nodes of elements in set *S*<sub>1</sub> [2].\n5.  Compute cosine similarity between the query vector and embeddings of these child nodes [2].\n6.  Select top *k* child nodes with highest scores, forming set *S*<sub>2</sub>[2].\n7.  Repeat recursively for *d* layers, getting sets *S*<sub>1</sub>, *S*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *S*<sub>d</sub> [2].\n8. Concatenate the sets *S*<sub>1</sub> through *S*<sub>d</sub>.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the pseudocode corresponding to step 5. Step 5 states \"Continue this process recursively for  $d$   layers, producing sets  $S_{1},S_{2},.\\,.\\,.\\,,S_{d}$\"[2]. Looking at the algorithms provided, we can see how this looks in pseudocode.\n\n![Algorithm 1 Tree Traversal Algorithm](image2)\n\nThe outer loop `for layer in range(tree.num_layers)` handles the recursive progression through the layers. The inner loop `for node in Scurrent` iterates through nodes in current set. calculate the `score + dot_product(query, node)`.\n\nThe pseudocode corresponding to step 5 of the tree traversal method is the calculation and storage of the dot product of the query and node within the nested loops of the Tree Traversal Algorithm.\n"}

The LLM's role is to translate this natural language description into a symbolic representation, identifying entities, facts, and rules [3, 12]. The model uses different symbolic formulations to represent common types of logical reasoning, such as deductive reasoning and first-order logic reasoning [5]. For instance, the model might generate predicates, premises, and a conclusion based on the provided text [image3].\n2.  **Symbolic Reasoning**: A deterministic symbolic solver processes the symbolic formulation created in the first stage [12]. This solver utilizes algorithms like forward/backward-chaining to produce a symbolically-represented answer [2]. Different solvers can be used, depending on the problem type, including first-order logic provers and constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solvers [image6].\n3.  **Result Interpretation**: In the final step, the symbolic answer is translated back into natural language [12]. This could involve stating whether a conclusion is true or false or selecting an answer from multiple choices. This phase takes the output from the symbolic solver and converts it to a human-understandable format [image3, image5].\n\n![image3](image3) shows a specific example of how a problem would be formulated and the predicted answer.\n\n![image5](image5) illustrates an example of the entire process, demonstrating the conversion of a natural language problem to symbolic form, the use of a symbolic reasoner (first-order logic prover), and the interpretation of the result.\n\nIn essence, LOGIC-LM shifts the LLM's responsibility from solving the problem directly to formulating it symbolically, offloading the actual reasoning to a specialized solver [2, 9].\n\nIn summary, the LOGIC-LM model solves a problem by first translating it into a symbolic formulation using an LLM, then using a symbolic solver to reason with the symbolic representation, and finally translating the solver's output back into natural language.\n"}

Traditional marketing metrics often fail to capture customer sentiment, opinions, and affinity toward a brand. These factors manifest in reviews, comments, and recommendations [1].\n\n![Seldom or Never a Factor 20%](image1)\nFurthermore, leadership and cultural issues, rather than data and technology problems, present significant adoption barriers [11].

The first hot dog provides the highest utility (+6), while subsequent hot dogs provide less and less utility, eventually leading to negative utility (e.g., -2 for the fourth hot dog). This illustrates the typical pattern of diminishing marginal utility in standard consumption, where variety is important because as enjoyment drops, one should switch to another choice [2].\n\n![Hot Dogs' utility table.](image8)\n\nHowever, in competition, the cumulative effect of focus may be good [9]. As the graph shows, the 64th hot dog might have a highly negative utility (-40), but the 65th, while still negative in consumption utility (-45), provides a massive boost in competitive utility (+10000) by tying the championship.

The center offers professional counseling for students dealing with issues affecting their health, relationships, academic performance, or those seeking personal development [12, 6]. Appointments with Student Counsellors can be made online or by phone, and consultations are free and confidential [10].

Image 4 shows a 1.50% conversion rate, while Image 7 suggests a much broader, and higher range of 45%-75%. [4, image7].\n\nThe main implication is:\nThe low 1.5% conversion rate [image4] suggests potential issues in lead qualification, lead quality, or the alignment between marketing and sales. If marketing is sending leads that sales doesn't deem qualified, there may be a disconnect in the definition of an MQL or the scoring process[10]. It could also indicate that the leads generated aren't a good fit for the sales team's target customer profile.\n\nA wide range, as indicated in the image7 (from 45% to 75%), could reflect variations between clients or industry.\n\nIn conclusion, the MQL to SAL conversion rate can range from as low as 1.50% to a much broader range of 45% to 75%, indicating substantial variability and potential issues in lead management processes.\n"}
