For those with some college experience or a high school degree or less education, fewer (26% and 20%, respectively) think neither party has high ethical standards [ 5 ].\n\nPolitical affiliation further influences these perceptions. The image shows that 59% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats believe their own party has high ethical standards, while only 19% and 18%, respectively, say this about the opposing party [ image1 ]. Similarly, 86% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans think their own party has good policy ideas, while less than a quarter say this describes the opposing party [ image2 ].\n\nIn terms of extremism, 48% of Republicans and 42% of Democrats view the opposing party as too extreme [ image3 ]. The image also shows that 48% of Republicans and 42% of Democrats view their own party as too extreme [ image3 ].\n\nIn conclusion, perceptions of ethical standards and extremism between the Republican and Democratic parties are deeply divided along partisan lines and are influenced by education and political affiliation. Majorities of partisans view their own party positively, while fewer view the opposing party in the same light. Education level and political affiliation play significant roles in shaping these perceptions."}

According to the text [4], men are more likely than women to encounter harassing or abusive behavior online, with 29% of men and 19% of women reporting this experience. Additionally, men are more likely to see people being mean or bullying on social media platforms compared to women, who are more likely to see kind or supportive behavior. However, the largest shares of both men (52%) and women (56%) report seeing an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media.\n\nThe image [2] further supports these findings, showing that 29% of men and 19% of women see people being mean or bullying, while 17% of men and 24% of women see people being kind or supportive. The image also reveals that men are more likely to see people trying to be deceptive on social media (24%) compared to women (13%), while women are more likely to see people trying to point out inaccurate information (17%) compared to men (17%).\n\nThese differences in perception have implications for how social media platforms can tailor their recommendations or advertisements. For instance, since men are more likely to encounter and perceive negative behavior on social media, platforms may need to focus more on moderating and reducing such behavior to improve the user experience for men. On the other hand, since women are more likely to see kind or supportive behavior, platforms may want to highlight and promote positive interactions to enhance the user experience for women.\n\nFurthermore, the image [1] shows that there are differences in how social media users of different age groups perceive the acceptability of certain types of content. For example, users aged 18 to 49 are more likely to find it acceptable for social media sites to use their data to recommend events in their area (67% to 80%) and to recommend someone they might want to know (53% to 67%) compared to users aged 65 and older. This suggests that social media platforms may need to tailor their recommendations and advertisements based on the age of their users to ensure that they are acceptable and relevant to each age group.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in perceptions of social media content and behavior between men and women, as well as between different age groups, have important implications for how social media platforms can tailor their recommendations and advertisements.

According to the text [1], a majority of social media users are comfortable with their data being used to recommend events they might like to attend, with 75% of users finding this acceptable. However, this comfort level drops to 37% when it comes to using data for political campaign messages [1].\n\nThe image [image1] provides a detailed breakdown of these perceptions across various age groups. It shows that users aged 18-29 and 30-49 are more accepting of their data being used to recommend events in their area, with 80% and 78% respectively finding this acceptable. In contrast, users aged 65 and older are less accepting, with only 67% finding it acceptable. This trend is consistent with the text [3], which states that majorities of users across a range of age groups think it is acceptable for social media sites to use their data to show them events happening in their area.\n\nWhen it comes to recommending people they might want to know, the image [image1] shows that users aged 18-29 and 30-49 are more accepting, with 66% and 67% respectively finding this acceptable. However, users aged 65 and older are much less accepting, with only 36% finding it acceptable. This is in line with the text [10], which states that older users are much less accepting of social media sites using their data for other reasons, particularly for recommending other people they might want to know.\n\nThe image [image2] further illustrates the acceptability levels for different uses of data. It shows that a significant portion of users find it not at all or not very acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to show them messages from political campaigns, with 31% finding it not acceptable at all. This is consistent with the text [5], which states that a substantial majority of users think it is not acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to deliver messages from political campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, the acceptability of social media platforms using users' data for various purposes is heavily context-dependent and varies significantly across different age groups.

For instance, 54% of Americans think the personal finance score algorithm would do a good job at identifying good customers, while only 32% believe it would be fair to consumers [1]. This disparity is also reflected in the criminal risk score, where 49% think it would be effective at identifying people deserving of parole, but only 50% believe it would be fair [1]. This suggests that while people may see these systems as effective, they are more skeptical about their fairness.\n\nThe image quotes provide further insight into these perceptions. Image 3 shows that for automated personal finance scores, 54% find them effective, but only 32% find them fair, resulting in a +22 difference in perceptions of effectiveness and fairness [3]. This is the largest difference among the four scenarios presented, indicating a significant concern about fairness in financial scoring systems.\n\nImage 4 breaks down the perceptions of fairness into categories: \"Not fair at all,\" \"Not very fair,\" \"Somewhat fair,\" and \"Very fair.\" For automated personal finance scores, 33% find them \"Not fair at all\" or \"Not very fair,\" while only 6% find them \"Very fair\" [4]. This distribution suggests a general mistrust in the fairness of these systems.\n\nThe text quotes also reveal demographic differences in perceptions of fairness. For example, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to find the consumer finance score concept fair to consumers [3]. This indicates that perceptions of fairness can vary significantly across different racial and ethnic groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences in perceptions of fairness and effectiveness across various automated systems imply that public trust in these systems is conditional and context-dependent. While many people see these systems as effective, there is a significant concern about their fairness, particularly in financial scoring systems. These differences in perceptions highlight the need for transparency, accountability, and fairness in the design and implementation of automated decision-making systems. ![Perceptions of fairness and effectiveness differ across various automated systems](image3) ![Distribution of perceptions of fairness for automated personal finance scores](image4)"}

According to the text, by the third generation, only 77% of individuals with Hispanic ancestry self-identify as Hispanic, and this percentage drops to 50% by the fourth or higher generation [1]. This trend suggests that as individuals become more distanced from their immigrant roots, their likelihood of self-identifying as Hispanic decreases.\n\nThe image data further elucidates these generational differences. For instance, among foreign-born Hispanics, 65% self-identify as Hispanic, while this figure drops to 36% among the second generation and further to 26% among the third or higher generation [image1]. This decline indicates that factors such as birth in the U.S., upbringing, and limited contact with Hispanic relatives play significant roles in shaping Hispanic identity across generations.\n\nAdditionally, the image data highlights other factors influencing self-identification. For example, 27% of individuals with Hispanic ancestry do not self-identify as Hispanic due to a mixed background or Hispanic ancestry that is too far back [image2]. Similarly, 16% cite upbringing or lack of contact with Hispanic relatives, and 15% do not speak Spanish or have no cultural link to Hispanic culture as reasons for not self-identifying as Hispanic.\n\nThe image data also shows that among self-identified Hispanics, 50% identify by country of origin or heritage, while 23% identify as Hispanic/Latino and another 23% identify as American [image3]. This distribution suggests that cultural and national identity factors significantly influence how Hispanics self-identify.\n\nFurthermore, the image data indicates that speaking Spanish and having a Spanish last name are not crucial factors for self-identifying as Hispanic.

This is evident from the bar chart in image1, which illustrates that streams account for 70% of total music activity, far surpassing album sales (51%) and song sales (49%).\n\nWhen examining specific genres, the bar chart in image3 provides a detailed breakdown. Rock music, for instance, has a high total activity of 82%, with streams making up 68% of this activity. Album sales contribute 63%, and song sales account for 68% [3]. This indicates that while rock is driven by catalog sales, streaming still plays a significant role.\n\nIn contrast, pop music shows a different trend. The total activity for pop is 58%, with streams accounting for 52%, album sales for 46%, and song sales for 47% [3]. This suggests that pop is more evenly distributed across different formats, with a strong emphasis on current releases.\n\nR&B/Hip-Hop presents an interesting case, with streams making up 61% of total activity, album sales at 55%, and song sales at 54% [3]. This genre heavily relies on streaming, reflecting its popularity and the frequent release of new content.\n\nCountry music, on the other hand, has a more balanced distribution. Streams account for 54% of total activity, while album sales and song sales are relatively close at 55% and 48%, respectively [3]. This indicates that country music maintains a strong presence in both streaming and traditional album sales.\n\nThe implications of these trends are multifaceted. The dominance of streaming suggests a shift in consumer behavior towards on-demand access to music, which can impact how artists and labels strategize their releases. For genres like rock, where catalog sales are significant, there is a need to balance the promotion of new releases with the continued monetization of existing catalogs. In genres like pop and R&B/Hip-Hop, where current releases drive sales, there is a greater emphasis on frequent releases and maintaining a strong online presence.\n\nMoreover, the data highlights the importance of understanding genre-specific trends for targeted marketing and distribution strategies.

Initially, the user's input is processed by a Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder, which converts the natural language input into a continuous vector representation. This encoded user utterance, along with the encoding of the previous system action, is then fed into an LSTM Dialogue State component. The LSTM Dialogue State maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state, which is updated after each dialogue turn by incorporating the user's utterance and the previous system action [4].\n\nThe dialogue state is crucial for dialogue state tracking, which involves maintaining the state of the conversation, such as the user's goals, by accumulating evidence from the sequence of dialogue turns. The model updates its estimation of the user's goal, represented by a list of slot-value pairs, and maintains a probability distribution over candidate values for each goal slot type [7].\n\nBased on the dialogue state, the system formulates a query command to retrieve requested information from a knowledge base. The query results are then encoded and used as input to the policy network, which emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act. This system action is conditioned on information from the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the encoding of the query results [4].\n\nFinally, the system action, together with the user goal tracking results and the retrieved knowledge base entities, is used to generate the final natural language system response via a natural language generator (NLG). The NLG uses a template-based approach, where delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced by values from either the estimated user goal values or the knowledge base entities, depending on the emitted system action [6].\n\nIn summary, the system generates a response by encoding the user's input, updating the dialogue state, formulating and executing a query to the knowledge base, and finally generating a natural language response based on the system action and retrieved information. This process ensures that the system's response is contextually relevant and aligned with the user's request. ![The system architecture shows the flow of information from user input to system response, involving components like the Bi-LSTM Utterance Encoder, LSTM Dialogue State, and Natural Language Generator.](image2) ![The policy network diagram illustrates how the system action is determined based on the dialogue state, slot value logits, and query results encoding.](image3)"}

In contrast, other datasets like ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA, while incorporating entity-level knowledge, do not match the variety and specificity of entities in SnapNTell [5].\n\nSecondly, the SnapNTell dataset features QA pairs that require extensive knowledge for accurate responses, with entity names specifically mentioned in the answer sets.

According to [1 ], ProgramFC is particularly effective when the model size is small. The performance of the end-to-end FLAN-T5 model decreases significantly with decreasing model size, but this trend is less notable for ProgramFC. The high-level reasoning plan offered by reasoning programs substantially alleviates the demands on the subsequent sub-task solvers. The results show that the program-guided model using FLAN-T5-small (80M parameters) as sub-task solvers can achieve comparable performance to the $137\\mathrm{x}$ larger FLAN-T5-XXL (11B) model with end-to-end reasoning for 4-hop claims.\n\nNext, let's examine the performance of ProgramFC on different fact-checking tasks. According to [ 5 ], ProgramFC outperforms one-step retrieval on all datasets, with the largest improvement of $37.1\\%$ on HOVER 4-hop. This is because some information may not be present in the original claim, but is only revealed during the reasoning process. Iterative retrieval guided by the reasoning program yields better results.\n\nNow, let's analyze the error trends in ProgramFC's predictions. According to [ 2 ], the errors in ProgramFC's predictions can be classified into three categories: (i) Syntactic errors, where the program does not conform to the defined grammar and cannot be parsed, (ii) Semantic errors, which include incorrect or missing arguments/variables (Token), incorrect program structure (Structure), and incorrect sub-task calls (Subtask), and (iii) Incorrect execution, where the program is correct, but where the incorrect prediction is a result of its execution.\n\nThe error analysis in Table 2 (not provided in the text) shows that no syntax errors were found in the samples, indicating that Codex effectively generates executable programs through few-shot in-context learning. However, as the complexity of the claims increases, the proportion of semantic errors in the programs also increases, with structural errors becoming particularly prevalent. This highlights the difficulty of generating the appropriate step-by-step reasoning strategies for claims that require long-chain reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, ProgramFC's performance is comparable to larger end-to-end models, and it outperforms one-step retrieval on all datasets.

Similarly, in image2, the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy demonstrates a higher AUC score as the number of images increases, indicating its effectiveness in improving model performance with more data.\n\nMoreover, the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy significantly influences the initial query selection by providing a more informative and diverse set of data points. This is crucial for addressing the cold start problem in active learning, as discussed in the text. The strategy's ability to select data points that are difficult to contrast, without relying on ground truths, makes it a practical and effective solution for initial query selection. This is further supported by the quantitative comparisons in image3, where the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy is shown to cover 100% of classes in low budget scenarios, outperforming other strategies in terms of label diversity and data coverage.\n\nIn conclusion, the 'hard-to-contrast' strategy not only outperforms other querying strategies across different datasets but also significantly enhances the initial query selection process by ensuring label diversity and optimal data coverage. This makes it a robust and reliable approach for active learning in image classification tasks."}

This suggests that the specific format of the instruction does not significantly affect the performance of LLMs like ChatGPT and Codex. This is further supported by the box plot in `![{Instruction format does not significantly affect performance}](image3)`, which shows that the F1 scores for different instruction formats are relatively similar, indicating that the choice of instruction format has a limited impact on performance.\n\n### Demonstration Selections\nThe text [10] highlights that both sentence embedding and EPR surpass random sampling by a large margin. This is visually represented in `![{Sentence embedding and EPR outperform random sampling}](image3)`, where the box plots for sentence embedding and EPR have higher medians compared to random sampling. This indicates that the selection strategy of demonstrations matters, and retrieval based on sentence embedding is particularly effective.\n\n### Comparison with Other Models\nThe line graphs in `![{ChatGPT and Codex performance on FewNERD}](image1)` and `![{ChatGPT and Codex performance on TACREV and TACRED}](image5)` provide a comparative analysis of different models, including ChatGPT and Codex, on the FewNERD dataset. The graphs show that while ChatGPT and Codex perform reasonably well, especially in low-shot settings, their performance plateaus as the number of shots increases. This is in contrast to fine-tuned models, which show a more consistent improvement with more shots.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the performance of ChatGPT and Codex on the FewNERD dataset is moderately affected by the instruction format but significantly influenced by the demonstration selection strategy. Sentence embedding and EPR are more effective than random sampling. Compared to other models, ChatGPT and Codex perform well in low-shot settings but tend to plateau as the number of shots increases. Therefore, while LLMs like ChatGPT and Codex are powerful, their performance can be optimized with careful selection of demonstration strategies."}

These reasons are detailed in the table provided in the image, where incorrect calculation results account for 41.7% of refuted claims, and wrong approximation words account for 33.3% [image1].\n\nIn terms of performance, various large language models (LLMs) have been evaluated in both zero-shot and in-context settings. The results indicate that the best-performing model in the zero-shot 2-class setting is Vicuna-7B with a score of 63.62, while in the 3-class setting, FLAN-T5-XL achieves the highest score of  38.05 [3]. However, these scores are only moderately better than random guessing, highlighting the challenging nature of the SciTab dataset.\n\nIn the in-context setting, models are provided with three hold-out examples as demonstrations, and the results show improved performance. For instance, the Flan-T5-XXL model achieves a score of  60.48 in the 3-class setting, which is a significant improvement over the zero-shot setting [image4].\n\nThe discrepancy in performance between the zero-shot and in-context settings suggests that providing models with a few examples can significantly enhance their fact-checking capabilities. This is particularly evident in the 3-class setting, where the inclusion of the NEI (Not Enough Information) class tends to diminish the models' confidence, causing a shift in their predictions from 'supported/refuted' to 'NEI' [8].\n\nOverall, while LLMs have shown some promise in fact-checking claims in the SciTab dataset, there is still a significant gap between their performance and that of human annotators, who can achieve F1 scores of  92.46 and  84.73 in the 2-class and 3-class settings, respectively [5].

InstructGPT tends to classify supported and refuted claims as 'NEI' (Not Enough Information), indicating a pattern of \"less confident\" predictions. On the other hand, GPT-4 shows overconfidence by incorrectly categorizing NEI claims as either supported or refuted. This suggests that distinguishing whether a claim is verifiable is a key challenge for both models on the S CI T AB dataset.\n\nTo further analyze the types of errors contributing to their performance differences, we can look at the error analysis provided in the text and images. According to the text, the majority of errors for both models can be categorized into four types: grounding errors, ambiguity errors, calculation errors, and program errors [9]. Grounding errors occur when the program incorrectly associates data with the respective cells in the table. Ambiguity errors arise when the claim contains ambiguous expressions that the program fails to represent. Calculation errors happen due to incorrect floating point arithmetic calculations in Python. Program errors encompass mistakes such as incorrect or missing arguments/variables, and erroneous operations.\n\nThe estimated proportion of these error types is shown in Figure 13 [4]. Grounding errors account for 50% of the errors, followed by ambiguity errors at 22%, calculation errors at 20%, and program errors at 8%. This highlights the difficulty in accurately referencing the specific cells to which a claim refers and the challenges posed by the ambiguous nature of scientific claims.\n\nIn conclusion, the performance differences between InstructGPT and GPT-4 on the zero-shot 3-class classification task can be attributed to their distinct error patterns and the types of errors they encounter.

This process results in a diverse collection of 13K questions from various sources. The detailed annotation protocol is in Appendix A. Data Quality Control. To further control the quality of our data, we perform two steps of data cleaning. In the first stage, lexical overlap and source URL similarity are employed to identify potential duplicate problems. These suspected duplicates were then reviewed by the authors to identify and eliminate any duplications. The second stage involves distributing the problems among different co-authors for format and typo checking. This step requires authors to ensure adherence to a standardized format, undertaking necessary corrections where deviations are found. In the third and final stage, the authors categorize the problems into four difficulty levels: very easy, easy, medium, and hard.

In contrast, BERT+DL and BERT+CE perform slightly worse, with BERT+DL achieving minor improvements over BERT+CE [ 1 ].\n\nThe effect of hyperparameters in the Tversky index (TI) is also explored on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset and the English QuoRef MRC dataset. The results show that the performance varies significantly as the hyperparameters α and β change in distinct datasets, highlighting the importance of these hyperparameters in TI [ 4 ].\n\nFurthermore, the data augmentation technique used in the experiments is similar to the +negative technique, except that negative training examples are used as templates. The augmented training set contains 458,477 examples, with 21% being positive and 79% being negative [ 5 ].\n\nThe results from Table 8 show that the +positive technique outperforms the original technique, while the +negative technique underperforms the original technique. This is expected since the +positive technique creates a balanced dataset, while the +negative technique creates a more imbalanced dataset [ 6 ].\n\nData imbalance can result in two main issues: the training-test discrepancy and the overwhelming effect of easy-negative examples. The cross-entropy objective (CE) or maximum likelihood (MLE) objective, which are widely adopted for data-imbalanced NLP tasks, do not address these issues [ 7 ].\n\nTo address the dominating influence of easy-negative examples, a dynamic weight adjusting strategy is proposed. This strategy associates each training example with a weight in proportion to (1-p), where p is the probability of the example. The weight dynamically changes as training proceeds, helping to deemphasize confident examples and making the model more attentive"}

When R-GCN is removed, the model loses 8.0 points in accuracy. This indicates that the R-GCN component is crucial for enhancing the model's performance by updating mention representations based on their relation to other mentions.\n\n### Analysis of Relation Types\nThe text quote [9] discusses the effect of removing relation types. When relation types are not distinguished, the model shows only marginal improvements compared to using ELMo alone without R-GCN. This suggests that a more informative graph construction and/or a more sophisticated parameterization is needed for the model to perform effectively.\n\n### Analysis of Specific Relation Types (e.g., MATCH, COREF)\nThe text quote [1] provides insights into the impact of removing specific relation types such as DOC-BASED, MATCH, and COREF. The model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. Removing DOC-BASED connections results in a significant loss of important information, as these connections are crucial for mentions appearing closely in the document. The performance degradation observed when using coreference links suggests that the test documents may be harder for the coreference system.\n\n### Performance Comparison from Image Quotes\nThe image quote `![{Performance comparison of different models under unmasked and masked conditions}](image1)` provides a detailed comparison of model performance under unmasked and masked conditions. The table shows that the full ensemble model achieves the highest accuracy in both conditions. Removing the R-GCN component significantly reduces performance, confirming the importance of this component. Additionally, the table highlights the performance drop when specific relation types are removed, further supporting the findings from the text quotes.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the removal of specific components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types (e.g., MATCH, COREF) significantly impacts the performance of models under both unmasked and masked conditions. The R-GCN component is crucial for enhancing model performance, while distinguishing relation types and using specific relation types like DOC-BASED are essential for capturing important information and improving model accuracy. The performance degradation observed when these components are removed underscores their importance in the model's architecture."}

This is visually supported by image5, which shows that the F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction peak at the second iteration for CorefProp and RelProp, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, the impact of the number of entities in a sentence on relation F1 score is depicted in image4. The graph indicates that the relation F1 score decreases as the number of entities in a sentence increases, with the highest score observed when there are 2-3 entities in a sentence. This suggests that the model performs better with fewer entities in a sentence, which is different from the iteration effect observed in CorefProp and RelProp.\n\nIn summary, the number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp has a positive impact on F1 scores, with the best performance achieved at the second iteration, whereas the number of entities in a sentence negatively affects the relation F1 score, with the highest score observed with fewer entities."}

This indicates that two iterations of RelProp are most effective for improving relation extraction.\n\nFurthermore, Figure 4 demonstrates the relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence for DY GIE and DY GIE without relation propagation on ACE05. The figure shows that relation propagation significantly improves performance in sentences with more entities, where broader context is beneficial [5].\n\nIn addition, Table 8 provides insights into the impact of CorefProp on all entity categories. The table reveals that frequent confusions associated with pronouns (GPE/PER and PER/ORG) greatly improve with CorefProp, and the benefit extends to most categories [6].\n\nLastly, Table 4 compares the performance of different models, including DY GIE with and without CorefProp and RelProp. The table shows that DY GIE with CorefProp and RelProp achieves the highest F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction tasks [4].\n\nIn conclusion, two iterations of CorefProp and RelProp are optimal for enhancing entity and relation extraction performance, respectively.

The settings include transferring only the LSTM layer, only the embedding and output layers, and combinations of these layers.\n\nFrom the table, we can observe the following trends:\n\n1. **LSTM only**: This setting shows improvements in accuracy and macro-F1 scores across all datasets compared to the baseline LSTM+ATT model. The improvements are most significant for D3 and D4, indicating that the LSTM layer plays a crucial role in capturing sequential patterns for aspect-level sentiment classification.\n\n2. **Embeddings only**: Transferring only the embedding layer also results in performance gains, particularly for D3 and D4. This suggests that the embedding layer is effective in capturing sentiment information, especially in datasets with unbalanced label distributions.\n\n3. **Output layer only**: Transferring only the output layer shows improvements, but they are less significant compared to transferring the LSTM or embedding layers. This is expected since the output layer is more task-specific.\n\n4. **Without LSTM**: When the LSTM layer is not transferred, the performance drops significantly, highlighting the importance of the LSTM layer in capturing sequential patterns.\n\n5. **Without embeddings**: Excluding the embedding layer also leads to performance drops, indicating that the embedding layer is crucial for capturing sentiment information.\n\n6. **Without output layer**: The performance remains relatively stable when the output layer is not transferred, suggesting that the output layer is less critical compared to the LSTM and embedding layers.\n\nNext, let's examine the trends observed when varying the percentage of document-level training examples, as shown in Figure 1 [5].\n\nFigure 1 [5] presents the changes in accuracy and macro-F1 scores for the four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) when the percentage of document-level training examples is varied from 0.0 to 1.0 for the PRET+MULT approach.

According to [1 ], the F1 score of single-paragraph BERT degrades from 67.08 to 52.13 when the question is reduced to the first five tokens starting from the wh-word. This indicates that the model's performance is affected by the length and complexity of the question.\n\nNext, let's examine the F1 scores for different training and evaluation strategies. According to [ 4 ], selecting strong distractors for RC questions is non-trivial. The model achieves 53.12 F1 even when using 500 distractors, indicating that 500 distractors are still insufficient. This suggests that the quality and quantity of distractors play a crucial role in the model's performance.\n\nFurthermore, [ 5 ] states that the model struggles in the open-domain setting, largely due to the insufficiencies of standard TF-IDF retrieval for multi-hop questions. The model achieves 39.12 F1 given 500 retrieved paragraphs, but achieves 53.12 F1 when additional two gold paragraphs are given. This demonstrates the significant effect of failure to retrieve gold paragraphs.\n\nIn addition, [ 6 ] mentions that filtering the initial list of 50 paragraphs to ones whose entity type matches that of the gold paragraphs can help eliminate the entity type bias. The original model's accuracy degrades significantly (drops to 40.73 F1), but the model trained on the adversarially selected distractors can recover most of its original accuracy (increases to 58.42 F1).\n\nNow, let's look at the F1 scores for different types of questions. According to [ 7 ], many comparison questions are multi-hop or context-dependent multi-hop, and single-paragraph BERT achieves near chance accuracy on these types of questions (Table 3). This shows that most comparison questions are not solvable by our single-hop model.\n\nFinally, let's examine the F1 scores for different training and evaluation strategies.

However, when evaluated on an adversarial dataset, BERT's performance dropped to a maximum test set accuracy of 53% [3]. This indicates that BERT's initial high performance was largely due to exploiting spurious statistical cues in the dataset rather than genuinely understanding argument comprehension.\n\nThe adversarial dataset was constructed by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point, effectively mirroring the distribution of cues around both labels [2]. This setup eliminates the major problem of statistical cues over labels in ARCT, leading to a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension.\n\nThe results from the adversarial dataset show that all models, including BERT, perform randomly, with BERT achieving a maximum test set accuracy of 53% [3]. This suggests that the adversarial dataset successfully eliminated the cues, providing a more accurate assessment of machine argument comprehension.\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup reveals that BERT's high performance on the ARCT dataset was not due to an understanding of argument comprehension but rather due to exploiting spurious statistical cues. The adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension and should be adopted as the standard in future work on this dataset [10]. This highlights the importance of controlling for spurious statistics in NLP tasks to ensure that models are genuinely learning the task at hand. \n\n![BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset](image4) shows that BERT's performance is essentially random on the adversarial dataset, with a mean accuracy of 50.4% and a maximum accuracy of 53.3%.

BiDAF outperforms FastQA in both datasets, with higher test scores in all conditions.\n\nIn image3, the performance of BiDAF and FastQA under standard and gold chain test conditions is presented. Again, BiDAF shows superior performance compared to FastQA in both datasets and under all test conditions.\n\nIn image4, the performance of BiDAF and FastQA under standard and masked test conditions is shown. BiDAF continues to outperform FastQA in both datasets and under all test conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the BiDAF model consistently outperforms the FastQA model across both WIKIHOP and MEDHOP datasets under different test conditions. This is likely due to the iterative latent interactions in the BiDAF architecture, which are of increased importance for the task of cross-document multi-hop reading comprehension. The data from the images supports this conclusion, showing that BiDAF has higher test scores than FastQA in all conditions. Therefore, the BiDAF model is the more effective model for this task."}

The RetNRef model improves on this by doubling the use of rare words (frequency less than 100) and making smaller gains for words with frequency less than 1000. However, it still does not match human statistics. The RetNRef++ model, which boosts the use of retrieval, performs even better in this regard, making the statistics much closer to human ones [8].\n\nIn terms of performance metrics, the RetNRef++ model has a higher win rate against the Memory Network and Seq2Seq models, with win rates of 54.5% and 53.7% respectively [1]. It also has higher engagingness scores compared to Seq2Seq and Memory Network models [9]. However, it is weaker at using the persona compared to Seq2Seq [9].\n\nIn terms of human-like conversational abilities, the RetNRef++ model performs better than Seq2Seq and Memory Network models, as shown in the human judgments of the generated sequences [7]. However, it still has some issues such as repeated phrases by the generator and some tendency to copy the speaking partner's phrases that could be improved [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the RetNRef++ model has similar statistics to human utterances and provides more engaging conversations according to human judgments [7]. However, it still has some issues that need to be improved [4]. The Seq2Seq model is inferior to the RetNRef++ model in terms of word statistics and performance metrics [8][9].

The increase in cash from investing activities is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures and a reduction in acquisitions from Parent. ![Operating income decreased](image3) ![Cash from investing activities increased](image5)"}

Shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Chair, with meetings held with each Board member before the Board decides whether to appoint the candidate. The Committee also recommends the Board appoint the preferred candidate and conducts appropriate background and reference checks. The Board has adopted a letter of appointment that defines the role of Directors, including expectations in terms of independence, participation, time commitment, and continuous improvement. Written agreements are in place for all Non-executive Directors. Additionally, the Committee oversees the implementation of the skills and experience matrix, identification of suitable Non-executive Director candidates, Board and Committee succession, and partnering with search firms regarding candidate searches.

The Committee ensures the independence of Non-executive Directors, authorizes situations of actual or potential conflict, and manages crisis situations. The Committee's role in identifying appropriate Non-executive Director candidates is supported by the continuous improvement activities (training and development program) that Non-executive Directors participate in after the induction program. These programs cover matters of a business nature, including environmental, social, and governance matters, and provide updates on BHP's assets, commodities, geographies, and markets.

The Credit Risk RWA increased from $342,684 million in 2019 to $387,066 million in 2020, as shown in image2. This increase was primarily due to higher market volatility, an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, and an increase in Lending commitments within the Wealth management and Institutional Securities business segments, as stated in [4].

This decrease was due to a decline in the frequency and severity of litigation-related losses, as mentioned in [1].

This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. The asset composition of the insurance business also changed, with cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increasing from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021, a significant increase of $23,606 million, or 35.2%.

Fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, a decrease of $3,931 million, or 19.4%. The implications of these changes are that the insurance business is holding more cash and cash equivalents, which may provide greater liquidity but lower returns.

The shipment volume for cigarettes decreased by 11.8% from 72,293 million units in 2019 to 63,749 million units in 2020, as shown in image3. This decline in cigarette shipments was partially offset by a substantial increase in heated tobacco units, which rose by 50.8% from 299 million units in 2019 to 451 million units in 2020, also depicted in image3.\n\nThe total shipment volume in Latin America & Canada decreased by 11.6% from 72,592 million units in 2019 to 64,200 million units in 2020, as indicated in image3. This reduction in shipment volume contributed to a decrease in net revenues from $2,206 million in 2019 to $1,701 million in 2020, a decline of 22.9%, as shown in image4. The unfavorable currency movements further exacerbated this decline by 15.5%, as detailed in image4.\n\nDespite the decrease in net revenues, operating income saw a significant improvement, increasing from $235 million in 2019 to $564 million in 2020, a rise of 100%, as depicted in image4. This improvement in operating income was primarily due to higher net earnings, excluding the impact of the 2019 non-cash charges related to the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the loss on deconsolidation of RBH, as mentioned in [7].\n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities also decreased by $0.3 billion from $10,090 million in 2019 to $9,812 million in 2020, as shown in image5.

This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in Home Lending loans, which went from $276,962 million in 2019 to $224,446 million in 2021.

This type of compensation can impact shareholders' equity in several ways:\n\n1. **Increase in Shareholders' Equity**: When share-based compensation is recognized, it increases the shareholders' equity. This is because the company is essentially issuing new shares or recognizing the value of existing shares as an expense, which is then added to the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Dilution of Existing Shares**: The issuance of new shares to employees can lead to dilution of existing shares, which can affect the value of shares held by existing shareholders.\n\n3. **Impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Share-based compensation can also impact the company's EPS, as the expense is recognized in the income statement, reducing net income.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can see that share-based compensation expense for the year 2020 was $1,023,794 (image3). This amount is added to the shareholders' equity, contributing to the total shareholders' equity of $14,827,691 as of August 31, 2020 (image5).\n\n### Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities represents the cash generated or used by a company's primary business operations. It is a crucial indicator of a company's financial health and its ability to generate cash to fund its operations, pay dividends, and invest in growth.\n\n1. **Positive Cash Flow**: A positive cash flow from operating activities indicates that the company is generating more cash from its operations than it is spending. This can contribute to the company's cash position, allowing it to maintain liquidity and fund its activities without relying on external financing.\n\n2. **Impact on Shareholders' Equity**: While cash flow from operating activities does not directly impact shareholders' equity, it can indirectly affect it by providing the company with the cash needed to pay dividends, repurchase shares, or invest in growth, all of which can impact shareholders' equity.\n\nFrom the image quotes, we can see that the net cash provided by operating activities for the year 2020 was $8,215,1"}

However, it is important to note that these changes could also have negative implications if they are not managed properly. For example, an increase in inventory could lead to higher storage costs and a decrease in cash flow from operating activities could lead to a decrease in the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities.

Specifically, net interest income decreased by $5.5$ billion to $43.4$ billion, and total revenue decreased by $1.0$ billion to $18.584$ billion. This decline was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities, and an additional day of interest accrual. However, the sectors also saw an increase in client balances, which was primarily due to higher market valuations and positive client flows. Additionally, the total risk-adjusted margin increased by 88 basis points compared to 2019, driven by a lower mix of customer balances at promotional rates, the lower interest rate environment, and lower net credit losses. Despite the decline in credit card purchase volumes due to the impact of COVID-19, debit card purchase volumes increased by $23.8$ billion to $384.5$ billion, reflecting continuing changes in customers' banking preferences.

These charges were included in the operating profit, which can be seen in the table from image3, where the operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1,813 million. In comparison, in 2019, there were no restructuring charges reported in the fourth quarter, as shown in image3. The operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1,506 million. Therefore, the restructuring charges in 2020 had a negative impact on the operating profit, reducing it by $25 million compared to the same period in 2019. The inclusion of these charges in the operating profit is evident from the decrease in operating profit from $1,506 million in 2019 to $1,813 million in 2020, despite the higher revenue in 2020. The restructuring charges are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment, as mentioned in [8]. The restructuring accrual balances for 2020 and 2019 are shown in image5, where the balance for 2020 was $18 million, and for 2019, it was $28 million.

This significant increase was primarily due to a gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in 2020 compared to a loss in 2019, higher net earnings, and a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019 [1]. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2,918 million for 2020 compared to a translation loss of $75 million for 2019. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $147 million for 2020 compared to a loss of $90 million for 2019. Additionally, the Company completed the sale of certain product lines for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million in the second quarter of 2020 [3]. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation. The increase in net earnings in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by net earnings from increased sales in the Company's existing businesses, net earnings from Cytiva, the 2020 gain on sale of product lines, and the provision for uncertain tax positions recorded in the first quarter of 2019 [6].

The U.S. segment's revenue decreased by 4% in 2020, as shown in image3, with a decrease in company-operated sales by 4% and a decrease in franchised revenues by 2%. This decline can be attributed to the impact of COVID-19, as mentioned in [1], which led to sales declines in the International Operated Markets segment and the need for support provided for marketing to accelerate recovery and drive growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the International Operated Markets segment experienced a more significant decline in revenue, with a decrease of 19% in company-operated sales and a decrease of 14% in franchised revenues, as shown in image3. This decline was primarily driven by the temporary restaurant closures and limited operations in countries such as France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain, as mentioned in [3]. The revenue declines were more significant in the International Operated Markets segment, reflecting negative comparable sales in most markets as a result of COVID-19.\n\nThe growth rates of McDonald's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments also changed from 2019 to 2020.

By 2020, Lovisa had successfully opened 47 new stores outside of Australia, including 4 stores in the United Kingdom, 13 stores in France, and 29 new stores in the USA. The company also opened 5 franchise stores during the year. \n\nIn addition to expanding its store network, Lovisa has also focused on enhancing customer loyalty through the global roll-out of piercing services into stores. The company has also streamlined its global supply chain process to generate higher gross margins and reduce costs. This includes improvements in its global warehouse and logistics program and the consolidation and rationalization of its supplier base. \n\nLovisa has also been able to leverage its current international territories and roll out its store model in new markets. The company has identified and secured quality retail store sites in locations with high pedestrian traffic, which has facilitated the roll-out of stores quickly and at low cost. \n\nHowever, Lovisa has also faced challenges in its international store expansion strategy. The company has had to defer its entry into new markets if it considers that appropriate opportunities are not presented at the relevant time.

This decrease was primarily due to lower average market interest rates across the major currencies compared with 2019. The interest expense for 2020 was $14.178 billion, down $2.9 billion year-on-year [6]. The year-on-year decrease was predominantly driven by the impact of lower market interest rates, partly offset by growth in interest-bearing customer accounts, which increased by $142.9 billion [6]. \n\nThe decrease in net interest income and the decrease in interest expense both contributed to the overall profitability of the organization. The net operating income for 2020 was $41.612 billion, a decrease of $1.638 billion compared with 2019 [5]. The decrease in net interest income was partly offset by the decrease in interest expense, resulting in a net decrease in net operating income. The overall profitability of the organization was impacted by the decrease in net operating income, as well as other factors such as the decrease in net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss [4]. \n\nIn conclusion, the changes in net interest income and interest expense from 2019 to 2020 had a significant impact on the net operating income and the overall profitability of the organization.

These changes might indicate that consumers were more cautious with their spending and borrowing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a decrease in credit card and home equity usage. Additionally, the decrease in home equity outstanding balances could be due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines, as mentioned in the text. Overall, these changes suggest that consumers were more conservative with their finances during this time period. \n\n![Total credit card purchase volumes decreased by $26.3 billion to $251.6 billion](image2) \n![Total home equity outstanding balances decreased by $5.9 billion](image4)"}

Specifically, the Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$1.3 billion to US$288 million, primarily due to lower price impacts and reduced volumes, which decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million [2].\n- **Cost Implications**: Controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million, driven by increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal and higher stripping volumes. However, cost reduction initiatives partially offset these increases [2].\n- **Unit Costs**: Queensland Coal unit costs are expected to be between US$80 and US$90 per tonne in FY2022, influenced by higher diesel prices. Mine plan optimization and efficiency uplifts are expected to offset increased stripping requirements [6].\n- **Market Price Sensitivity**: The impact of a US$1 per tonne change in metallurgical coal price on profit after taxation from continuing operations is US$24 million, and on underlying EBITDA is US$35 million [image1].\n\n#### Nickel\n- **Revenue and EBITDA Impact**: Underlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021, reflecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year [1].\n- **Price Sensitivity**: The impact of a US$1 per pound change in nickel price on profit after taxation from continuing operations is US$1 million, and on underlying EBITDA is also US$1 million [image1].\n- **Market Dynamics**: The average realized sales price for FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne, up from US$13,860 per tonne in FY2020. This increase was driven by positive investor sentiment, strong geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand, and supply disruptions [10].\n\n### Conclusion\nChanges in commodity prices significantly impact BHP's financial results. For coal, lower prices and volumes led to a substantial decrease in Underlying EBITDA, while for nickel, higher prices and volumes contributed to an increase in Underlying EBITDA. The key drivers behind these impacts include market price fluctuations"}

This increase was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins, and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs [4]. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax, resulting in an increase to tax expense of $3.18 billion between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $1.58 billion in 2020 to a charge of $1.60 billion in 2021 [4]. Additionally, the company's comprehensive income increased from a loss of $6.165 billion in 2020 to income of $17.348 billion in 2021, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income [4]. This increase was primarily due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion, along with the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion and severance charges of $290 million [6].

This decrease was primarily due to a mark-to-market loss of $383 million in 2020, as indicated in the table from image1.

Preferences are more divided among voters who do not have a college degree.\n\nThe image ![{conclusion}](image1) further supports this by showing that among all registered voters, 62% of those with a postgraduate degree support the Democratic candidate, while only 30% support the Republican candidate. For those with a college degree, 53% support the Democratic candidate compared to 40% for the Republican candidate. In contrast, voters with some college experience (49%) or a high school degree or less (42%) are more evenly split in their preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the image ![{conclusion}](image2) indicates that 17% of college graduates describe both parties as having high ethical standards, compared to 15% of those with some college and 17% of those with a high school degree or less.

According to the Pew Research Center, in 2018, 38% of the public described themselves as independents [1]. This percentage has not changed significantly since 1994, as shown in the image [![{The proportion of political Independents has remained relatively stable from 1994 to 2018}](image5)]. However, the majority of these independents lean toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, with only a small share of Americans (less than 10%) having no partisan leaning [ 7]. This indicates that while many Americans identify as independents, most still have a tendency to lean toward one of the two major parties. The image [![{The majority of independents lean toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party}](image5)] shows that the proportion of independents who lean toward the Democratic Party has been consistently higher than those who lean toward the Republican Party. This suggests that independents may be more likely to lean left than right. Additionally, the image [![{The proportion of independents who lean toward the Democratic Party has been consistently higher than those who lean toward the Republican Party}](image5)] shows that the proportion of independents who lean toward the Democratic Party has increased slightly over the years, while the proportion of those who lean toward the Republican Party has remained relatively stable. This could indicate a shift in the political leanings of independents over time, with more independents leaning toward the Democratic Party. Overall, the proportion of political Independents in the U.S. has remained relatively stable from 1994 to 2018, but the majority of these independents lean toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, with a slight increase in the proportion of independents who lean toward the Democratic Party over time."}

Initially, the population surged dramatically, as evidenced by the census data in image3. In 1870, the population was only 130, but by 1890, it had skyrocketed to 14,096, marking the highest population ever recorded for the county. This rapid increase was largely due to the Homestead Act of 1862, which provided settlers with 160 acres of land if they constructed a permanent structure and resided on the land for five years [9]. The Act attracted a large number of settlers, contributing to the population boom.\n\nThe peak population in 1890 was followed by a gradual decline, with the population decreasing to 13,330 by 1900. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including the consolidation of farms, which reduced the number of farms while increasing the average farm size [4]. The mechanization of agriculture led to fewer small-scale farms, impacting the rural population. Additionally, the consolidation of rural school districts, which reduced the number of districts from over 100 in the early 1920s to just a handful by the present day, also contributed to the population decline [6].\n\nDespite these declines, some towns within Hamilton County, such as Aurora, experienced population gains. Aurora's population peaked at 4,225 in 2000, showing a steady increase since 1940 [2]. This trend contrasts with the overall population decline in the county, suggesting that certain towns may have benefited from factors such as economic development or improved infrastructure.\n\nThe historical factors influencing these population trends include the Homestead Act, which initially attracted settlers, and subsequent agricultural and economic changes that led to population declines in rural areas. The consolidation of farms and school districts, along with mechanization, played significant roles in shaping the demographic landscape of Hamilton County over the years. \n\nIn summary, the population trends of Hamilton County from 1870 to 2000 were characterized by an initial surge due to the Homestead Act, followed by a gradual decline influenced by agricultural consolidation and mechanization, with some towns like Aurora experiencing population gains. ![Hamilton County's population trends from 1870 to 2000 show significant fluctuations influenced by historical factors such as the Hom"}

Among women in STEM, those working in computer positions, those in workplaces where men outnumber women, and those with advanced degrees are particularly likely to have concerns about gender equity and to have experienced gender discrimination [4]. \n\nIn the technology industry, women who work in computer jobs are more likely than men in these jobs to consider gender discrimination a major problem [7]. Roughly three-quarters (74%) of women in computer occupations say they have experienced gender discrimination at work, compared with 16% of men working in computer jobs [8]. \n\nThe image data further supports this conclusion. Among women in STEM jobs, those in computer jobs report higher rates of gender-related discrimination at work (74%) compared to other STEM fields [image5]. They also report higher rates of sexual harassment at work (30%) and feeling that their gender has made it harder to succeed in their job (31%) [image5]. \n\nIn terms of pay, the image data shows that women in computer jobs are more likely to report pay inequities (46%) compared to all women in STEM (29%) [image1]. \n\nTherefore, the type of STEM major with the largest gender gap in consistent employment in the field and receiving the highest pay is computer science."}

For higher-resource languages, the gains from pre-training are consistent, with an approximate increase of 3 BLEU points for all three language pairs [1 ]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains are either quite small (A Z  and B E ) or very large, as in G L  which achieves a gain of up to 11 BLEU points [ 1 ]. This indicates that word embeddings may be particularly useful to bootstrap models that are on the threshold of being able to produce reasonable translations, as is the case for G L  in our experiments [ 1 ].\n\nIn a qualitative analysis of the translations from   ${\\mathrm{GL}}\\to{\\mathrm{EN}}$  , pre-training not only helps the model to capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed [ 2 ]. As highlighted in the table cells, the best system successfully translates a person’s name (“ chris ”) and two multi-word phrases (“ big lawyer ” and “ patent legislation ”), indicating the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing a better representations of less frequent concepts when used with low-resource languages [ 2 ].\n\nResearchers have worked on a number of methods for using monolingual data in NMT systems, and among these, pre-trained word embeddings have been used either in standard translation systems or as a method for learning translation lexicons in an entirely unsupervised manner [ 3 ]. Both methods show potential improvements in BLEU score when pre-training is properly integrated into the NMT system [ 3 ].\n\nThe results in Table  2  clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree [ 6 ]. Comparing the second and third columns, we can see the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings. This indicates that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence [ 6 ].\n\nThe previous experiment had interesting implications regarding available data size and effect of pre-training. Our next series of experiments examines this effect in a more controlled environment by down-sampling the training data for the higher-resource languages to 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of their original sizes [ 7 ].\n\nFinally, we performed a comparison of the f- measure of target words, bucketed by frequency in the training corpus.

It creates and stores multimodal embeddings for visual images and text descriptions, as shown in Fig. 1 [1]. The retriever uses an index system that employs the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm to enhance retrieval speed by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the embeddings [7].\n\n2. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**: For object detection datasets, the pipeline includes additional pre-processing steps such as cropping and blurring. These steps help the MLLMs focus on the relevant objects by resizing cropped regions and blurring non-target areas [3]. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 [3].\n\n3. **Retrieving and Ranking**: After the retrieval phase, the retrieved category labels alongside image embeddings are integrated and sent to the MLLMs through a ranking prompt. The MLLMs combine the internal knowledge and the retrieved information to make the final prediction of the image category [4]. This process is depicted in Fig. 2 [8].\n\n4. **Memory Integration**: The memory, denoted as $\\mathcal{M}$, is established by using the multimodal retriever to create and store explicit memory for different categories. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-$k$ similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions [6].\n\n5. **Ranking Prompt**: The prompt primarily serves to merge the input image with the category information retrieved from memory. It guides MLLMs to rank the retrieved candidate object categories based on similarity [5]. An example of this ranking prompt is shown in Fig. 4 [4].\n\n6. **Fine-tuning and In-context Learning**: To bolster the MLLMs’ ranking performance, the pipeline explores fine-tuning with ranking format data or in-context learning examples without training [1].\n\nIn summary, the RAR pipeline integrates a multimodal retriever with MLLMs to enhance fine-grained few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities. It seamlessly integrates into various MLLMs in a plug-and-play manner, demonstrating significant improvements in performance across a variety of visual recognition tasks [2]. The pipeline"}

The Tree Traversal Retrieval method, as described in [7], involves a layer-by-layer traversal of the tree, where the top-k most relevant nodes are selected at each level based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. This process is repeated until the leaf nodes are reached, and the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. This method allows for a controlled retrieval process, where the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer can be adjusted to control the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved [9].\n\nIn contrast, the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method, as outlined in [3], offers a simpler and more flexible way to search for relevant information. Instead of traversing the tree layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. This allows for simultaneous evaluation of nodes across all layers to find the most relevant ones, providing greater flexibility in retrieving information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question [1].\n\nThe visual representation in ![{Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval differ in their approach to retrieving information}](image2) further clarifies these differences. In the Tree Traversal Retrieval, the query is encoded and used to select nodes at each level of the tree structure, progressively narrowing down the retrieved context. In the Collapsed Tree Retrieval, the entire tree structure is collapsed into a single layer, and nodes are evaluated collectively to find the most relevant ones, which are then used to form the retrieved context.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tree Traversal Retrieval method offers a more controlled and layered approach to information retrieval, while the Collapsed Tree Retrieval method provides a more flexible and simultaneous evaluation of all nodes, making it better suited for retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given question."}

Figure 4 presents the quantitative comparison of four map-based querying strategies, wherein easy- or hard-to-learn are selected by the maps based on ground truths, easy- or hard-to-contrast are selected by the maps based on pseudo-labels. Note that easy- or hard-to-learn are enforced with label diversity, due to their class-stratified distributions in the projected 2D space (illustrated in Figure 3). Results suggest that selecting easy-to-learn or hard-to-contrast data contribute to the optimal models. In any case, easy- or hard-to-learn data can not be selected without knowing ground truths, so these querying strategies are not practical for active learning procedure. Selecting hard-to-contrast, on the other hand, is a label-free strategy and yields the highest performance amongst existing active querying strategies (reviewed in Figure 1). More importantly, hard-to-contrast querying strategy significantly outperforms random selection by 1.8% (94.14% ± 1.0% vs. 92.27% ± 2.2%), 2.6% (84.35% ± 0.7% vs. 81.75% ± 2.1%), and 5.2% (88.51% ± 1.5% vs. 83.36% ± 3.5%) on PathMNIST, Organ AM NIST, and BloodMNIST, respectively, by querying 0.1% of entire dataset.

The results show a consistent improvement in accuracy for the fine-tuned model across almost all datasets for both QWen-VL and InternLM-XC2. This indicates that fine-tuning is effective in enhancing the model's performance.\n\nIn contrast, in-context learning presents a valuable alternative to fine-tuning with ranking examples, particularly due to its flexibility and lower requirement for specialized data preparation [7]. While fine-tuning with ranking examples has proven to be highly effective, it necessitates a substantial amount of curated data and computational resources for training. In-context learning uses the model’s existing knowledge by providing it with specific examples directly within the input prompt, guiding the model to understand and execute the task of ranking without the need for explicit re-training.\n\nThe image quotes provide further insights. Image 4 shows the performance of the RAR method with different strategies (fine-tune and in-context) on various datasets. For the InternLM-XC2 model, the fine-tuning strategy (denoted by 'F') generally outperforms the in-context learning strategy (denoted by 'S') across most datasets.

Both observations are in consistent with our experimental results in the previous section. Interestingly, for the sentiment analysis tasks, both CNN and LSTM compositional functions perform better than SWEM, suggesting that word-order information may be required for analyzing sentiment orientations [ 2 ]. This finding is consistent with Pang et al. (2002), where they hypothesize that the positional information of a word in text sequences may be beneficial to predict sentiment. This is intuitively reasonable since, for instance, the phrase “not really good” and “really not good” convey different levels of negative sentiment, while being different only by their word orderings. Contrary to SWEM, CNN and LSTM models can both capture this type of information via convolutional filters or recurrent transition functions. However, as suggested above, such word-order patterns may be much less useful for predicting the topic of a document. This may be attributed to the fact that word embeddings alone already provide sufficient topic information of a document, at least when the text sequences considered are relatively long. One possible disadvantage of SWEM is that it ignores the word-order information within a text sequence, which could be potentially captured by CNN- or LSTM-based models [ 3 ]. However, we empirically found that except for sentiment analysis, SWEM exhibits similar or even superior performance as the CNN or LSTM on a variety of tasks. In this regard, one natural question would be: how important are word-order features for these tasks? To this end, we randomly shuffle the words for every sentence in the training set, while keeping the original word order for samples in the test set. The motivation here is to remove the word-order features from the training set and examine how sensitive the performance on different tasks are to word-order information. We use LSTM as the model for this purpose since it can captures word-order information from the original training set. ![{The performance of LSTM on the Yelp dataset with a shuffled training set is very close to our results with SWEM, indicating that the main difference between LSTM and SWEM may be due to the ability of the former to capture word-order features.}](image1) The results on three distinct tasks are shown in Table 6.

The annotations indicate which entities are new and which are related based on whether they are reachable by entities linked so far.

It involves the recognition of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, removal of the damaged base, and subsequent repair by a polymerase enzyme and DNA ligase to restore the DNA strand [5].\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This repair system is crucial for excising DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and bulky adducts. It is highly conserved among species and is more complex in higher eukaryotes [4].\n\n3. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism directly repairs UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyltransferase proteins, respectively. It does not involve incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA [9].\n\n4. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves the removal of the mutated sequence and the addition of new pairs by DNA polymerase, followed by the action of DNA ligases [6].\n\n5. **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism aims to repair double-strand breaks of DNA, which are the most devastating mutation-induced lesions. It includes homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ). HR uses undamaged homologous DNA as a template for repair, while NHEJ directly ligates two double-strand break ends together [10].\n\nThese repair mechanisms are essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the genome by correcting various types of DNA damage. ![DNA repair mechanisms](image3)"}

The Symbolic Reasoning stage involves a deterministic symbolic solver performing inference on the symbolic formulation [1].

By combining both types of embeddings, the model can leverage the strengths of each to improve its performance on tasks such as named entity recognition (NER). This is supported by the hierarchical CRF model described in [1], which uses both character-level and word-level neural networks to capture subword and word-level information, respectively. Additionally, the use of character-level embeddings can help the model to better handle out-of-vocabulary words and improve its robustness to spelling variations and errors. The model architecture shown in ![{The model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs to capture different types of information}](image5) also supports this approach, as it includes both word and character-level embeddings as inputs to the model."}

This alignment is crucial for the proper separation of chromosomes during meiosis. [1]\n   - Image 2 shows the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate during Metaphase I.\n\n2. **Formation of the Spindle Apparatus**:\n   - The spindle apparatus, composed of microtubules, forms and attaches to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. This structure is essential for moving the chromosomes during cell division. [7]\n   - Image 5 illustrates the spindle apparatus with microtubules attached to the kinetochores.\n\n3. **Crossing Over**:\n   - Non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over. This genetic recombination increases genetic diversity. [1]\n   - Image 5 highlights the sites of crossing over between homologous chromosomes.\n\n4. **Chromosomes and Chromatids**:\n   - Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, which are identical copies of the chromosome. These chromatids are held together at the centromere. [10]\n   - Image 5 shows the sister chromatids remaining attached at the centromere.\n\n5. **Centromere and Kinetochore**:\n   - The centromere is the region where the sister chromatids are joined, and the kinetochore is the protein structure on the centromere that attaches to the spindle fibers.

The parental generation (P) consisted of one plant with purple flowers (PP) and another with white flowers (pp). \n\nWhen these plants were crossed, all the offspring in the F1 generation had purple flowers (Pp), indicating that the purple allele (P) is dominant over the white allele (p).

These methods help in creating a shared understanding of the project's goals and objectives.\n\n**Elicitation Methods**:\n- **Purpose**: Elicitation Methods are used to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders throughout the project. These methods aim to uncover the specific needs and expectations of the stakeholders, ensuring that the development team can deliver a solution that meets those requirements.\n- **Application**: Elicitation Methods are applied continuously throughout the project, as indicated in image5. They are particularly important during the construction phase, where the team is actively developing the solution.\n- **Techniques**: Techniques used in Elicitation Methods include just-in-time (JIT) model storming, look-ahead modeling, all-hands demos, and iteration demos, as depicted in image5. These methods facilitate active stakeholder participation and help in refining the requirements as the project progresses.\n\n**Comparison**:\n- **Scope**: Needs Exploration focuses on high-level requirements, while Elicitation Methods delve into detailed requirements.\n- **Timing**: Needs Exploration is typically conducted at the beginning of the project, whereas Elicitation Methods are applied throughout the project lifecycle.\n- **Techniques**: While both strategies use similar techniques like model storming and demos, Needs Exploration emphasizes high-level requirements specification and ATDD, whereas Elicitation Methods focus on JIT model storming and iteration demos.\n\nIn summary, Needs Exploration and Elicitation Methods are complementary strategies in agile management. Needs Exploration sets the foundation by defining high-level requirements, while Elicitation Methods ensure that detailed requirements are continuously gathered and refined throughout the project.

Module 2 aims to teach how to embed maps in Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikidata [2][5][9]. Finally, Module 3 focuses on creating interactive, layered Wikidata-driven maps that can be used off-Wiki, in regular HTML pages [2][5][9]. The workshop covers various types of maps, including flat, clustered, layered, embedded, interactive, on-Wiki, and off-Wiki maps [2][5][9]. The learning process involves using tools and techniques such as SPARQL, OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON, and the Mediawiki Kartographer extension [9]. Additionally, the workshop includes the use of basic Python and Jupyter notebooks to create off-Wiki maps [7][9]. The workshop is designed to be completed in 90-120 minutes [5]. The learning objectives are clearly outlined in the images, which show examples of maps created using Wikidata and provide access to map-making resources, SPARQL examples, and Python code snippets [![Module 1, basic: Understand steps to make basic flat and layered maps in Wikidata, based on geo referenced Wikidata items and SPARQL queries](image5)][![Module 2, intermediate: Understand steps to embed maps in Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata](image2)][![Module 3, advanced: Understand steps to create Wikidata-based off-Wiki maps](image2)]."}

The provided figures illustrate these impacts in detail.\n\nFirst, let's examine the structured markup errors. Image 4 shows a table with various data types and their corresponding markup sources, items, items with errors, and pages. The data reveals that the \"Blog\" and \"Article\" data types, both using schema.org markup, have a high number of items with errors (72,441 and 49,222, respectively). These errors can negatively affect SEO performance because search engines rely on structured data to understand the content and context of web pages. When there are errors in the markup, search engines may struggle to interpret the information correctly, leading to lower rankings and reduced visibility in search results.\n\nNext, let's look at the meta description issues. Image 1 presents a table with various meta description problems, including duplicate meta descriptions, long meta descriptions, short meta descriptions, missing title tags, and duplicate title tags. The data indicates that there are 2,215 duplicate meta descriptions, 21 long meta descriptions, and 1,450 short meta descriptions. These issues can harm SEO performance because meta descriptions play a crucial role in search engine results pages (SERPs). They provide a brief summary of the page content and can influence click-through rates. Duplicate, long, or short meta descriptions can confuse search engines and users, leading to lower rankings and reduced click-through rates.\n\nIn conclusion, structured markup errors and meta description issues can have a detrimental impact on SEO performance. It is essential to address these problems by fixing markup errors and optimizing meta descriptions to improve search engine rankings and increase visibility in search results."}

The maps for both volcanoes and public libraries use a similar visual approach, with red dots overlaid on a geographical map to show the distribution of these points of interest.\n\nFor the global distribution of volcanoes, the map shows a wide spread of red dots across various continents, indicating the locations of volcanoes. The density of the dots varies, with some areas having a higher concentration of volcanoes than others.\n\nFor the public libraries in the Netherlands, the map also uses red dots to represent the locations of the libraries. The distribution appears to be more concentrated within the country, with a higher density of dots in urban areas compared to rural regions.\n\nIn terms of data presentation on maps, both the volcano and public library maps use a consistent visual language of red dots on a geographical background. This allows for a clear and immediate understanding of the distribution patterns.

This process is depicted in the diagrams and images as follows:\n\n- **Prophase I** (as shown in image1 and image5): Homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through crossing over. This is a unique feature of meiosis I, not observed in meiosis II.\n- **Metaphase I** (image1 and image5): Homologous chromosome pairs align at the metaphase plate.\n- **Anaphase I** (image1 and image5): Homologous chromosomes are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell. This is a critical step where the chromosome number is reduced by half, resulting in haploid cells.\n- **Telophase I and Cytokinesis** (image1 and image5): The cell divides into two haploid daughter cells, each containing a unique set of chromosomes.\n\nIn **meiosis II**, the process is more similar to mitosis, focusing on the separation of sister chromatids:\n\n- **Prophase II** (image3): Chromosomes condense, and the nuclear envelope breaks down.\n- **Metaphase II** (image3): Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, similar to metaphase in mitosis.\n- **Anaphase II** (image3 and image4): Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. This step is analogous to anaphase in mitosis.\n- **Telophase II and Cytokinesis** (image3 and image4): The cell divides again, resulting in four haploid daughter cells, each with a unique combination of chromosomes.\n\nIn summary, **meiosis I** involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, reducing the chromosome number by half, while **meiosis II** involves the separation of sister chromatids, similar to mitosis, resulting in four genetically diverse haploid cells. ![Meiosis I and II stages](image1) ![Meiosis I and II stages](image3) ![Meiosis I and II stages](image4) ![Meiosis I and II stages](image5)"}

The bar chart visually represents the increase in healthcare spending over these years.\n\n- **1960**: The healthcare spending was around 5.2% of GDP.\n- **2007**: The healthcare spending had increased to approximately 16.8% of GDP.\n\nThis indicates a significant upward trend in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP over the 47-year period.\n\n### Relation to Major Events in the Space Race Timeline\n\nTo relate this trend to the major events in the Space Race timeline, we need to consider the historical context and the impact of these events on the economy and healthcare spending.\n\n1. **1960s**: The Space Race was at its peak during this decade, with significant investments in space exploration. This period saw the launch of the first human into space by the Soviet Union in 1961 and the Apollo 11 moon landing by the United States in 1969. The economic focus on space exploration likely influenced government spending priorities, potentially diverting funds from healthcare.\n\n2. **1970s**: The Space Race continued, but the U.S. economy faced challenges such as the oil crisis of 1973. This economic strain might have slowed the growth in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP.\n\n3. **1980s**: The U.S. experienced economic recovery and growth during this decade. The healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP began to rise more significantly, reflecting increased investment in healthcare infrastructure and services.\n\n4. **1990s to 2000s**: The healthcare spending continued to rise, reaching its peak in 2007. This period saw advancements in medical technology and an aging population, both contributing to higher healthcare costs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe trend in U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2007 shows a steady increase, influenced by various economic and social factors.

It receives input from various sensors, such as the engine temperature sensor, intake air temperature sensor, mass air flow sensor, throttle position sensor, HEGO sensor, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor, as shown in the diagram [5]. The ECU processes this information and uses it to control the fuel injectors, including injector 1, injector 2, injector 3, injector 4, injector 5, injector 6, and the cold start injector, as depicted in the diagram [5]. This control ensures that the correct amount of fuel is delivered to the engine at the right time, optimizing engine performance and efficiency. The ECU also manages other engine parameters, such as ignition timing and idle speed, to maintain optimal engine operation. ![The ECU receives input from various sensors and controls the fuel injectors](image5)"}

In standard consumption, as shown in image4, the utility from each additional hot dog decreases progressively. For instance, the utility from the first hot dog is +10, but it drops to 0 by the third hot dog and becomes negative by the fourth. This reflects the typical pattern where additional units of a good provide less satisfaction, eventually leading to dissatisfaction.\n\nIn contrast, in competitive contexts, the utility pattern can be quite different. Image5 shows two scenarios: diminishing marginal utility and differential outcomes. In the diminishing marginal utility scenario, the utility decreases with each additional hot dog, similar to standard consumption, but the decrease is more gradual. For example, the utility from the first hot dog is +6, and it decreases to -40 by the 64th hot dog.\n\nHowever, in the differential outcomes scenario, the utility from each hot dog can vary dramatically based on the context. For instance, consuming the 64th hot dog yields a utility of +5000, which is significantly higher than the utility from the 63rd hot dog (-50). This reflects the competitive nature where the outcome of consuming an additional unit can have a substantial impact on overall utility, such as winning a championship.\n\nIn summary, while diminishing marginal utility is a common phenomenon in both standard consumption and competitive contexts, the competitive context can introduce significant variations in utility based on the specific outcomes associated with consuming additional units."}

Matrix mode measures light across the entire frame, making it ideal for shooting natural landscapes [5]. Center mode focuses on light near the center of the screen, which is perfect for portraits [5]. Spot mode focuses on light from a specific region, such as a subject's eyes, allowing for precise exposure control [5].\n\nThe focus modes include AF-S (single), AF-C (continuous), and MF (manual). AF-S is suitable for stationary subjects, AF-C is ideal for moving subjects, and MF allows you to manually focus on the subject of interest, such as the subject's face [1].\n\nBy selecting the appropriate metering and focus modes, you can achieve optimal exposure and focus for your photos, regardless of the scenario.

However, we can infer that conversion rates are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of marketing strategies in generating sales-ready leads.\n\n### Image Analysis\n1. **Image 4:**\n   - **Total Leads:** 19,503\n   - **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL):** 10,051\n   - **Sales Accepted Leads (SAL):** 668\n   - **MQL to SAL Conversion Rate:** 1.50%\n\n2. **Image 5:**\n   - **MQL to SAL Conversion Rate:** 45% to 75%\n\n### Comparison and Implications\n- **Image 4 Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate from MQL to SAL is 1.50%. This indicates that out of every 100 MQLs, only 1.5 are accepted by the sales team. This relatively low conversion rate suggests that the marketing efforts may not be effectively qualifying leads, or the sales team may be stringent in accepting leads.\n\n- **Image 5 Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate ranges from 45% to 75%. This is significantly higher than the rate observed in Image 4. Such a high conversion rate implies that the marketing strategies are highly effective in qualifying leads that are ready for sales engagement. Alternatively, it could indicate that the sales team is more lenient in accepting leads.\n\n### Implications\n- **Efficiency of Marketing Strategies:** The higher conversion rate in Image 5 suggests that the marketing strategies are more effective in identifying and qualifying leads that are genuinely interested and ready to engage with the sales team.\n- **Sales Team's Acceptance Criteria:** The lower conversion rate in Image 4 might indicate that the sales team has stricter criteria for accepting leads, which could be due to higher expectations of lead quality or a more conservative approach to lead acceptance.\n- **Potential for Improvement:** The disparity in conversion rates between the two datasets highlights areas for potential improvement. For instance, the marketing team could analyze the characteristics of leads that are successfully converted in Image 5 and apply those insights to improve the quality of leads in Image 4.\n\nIn conclusion, the conversion rates from MQL to SAL vary significantly between the"}
