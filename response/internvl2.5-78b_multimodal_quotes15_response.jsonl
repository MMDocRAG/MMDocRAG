Identify the party with the highest total percentage of good policy ideas and high ethical standards.\n2. Find the percentage of that party that reported following the news very closely.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Party with the Highest Total Percentage\n\nFrom the text quotes:\n- [7] Opinions about whether the GOP has good policy ideas are little changed from about a year ago, but the share saying the Democratic Party has good ideas has declined, from $58\\%$ last April to $50\\%$ today.\n- [4] Critiques about ethical standards also extend to the two parties: Just $41\\%$ of Americans say the GOP has high ethical standards, while a nearly identical share ($42\\%$) say this about the Democratic Party.\n\nFrom the image quotes:\n- ![image2](image2) shows that $50\\%$ of Americans say the Republican Party has good policy ideas, and $41\\%$ say it has high ethical standards.\n- ![image2](image2) also shows that $50\\%$ of Americans say the Democratic Party has good policy ideas, and $42\\%$ say it has high ethical standards.\n\nCalculating the total percentages:\n- Republican Party: $50\\%$ (good policy ideas) + $41\\%$ (high ethical standards) = $91\\%$\n- Democratic Party: $50\\%$ (good policy ideas) + $42\\%$ (high ethical standards) = $92\\%$\n\nThe Democratic Party has the highest total percentage.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Percentage of the Democratic Party Following the News Very Closely\n\nFrom the text quotes:\n- [9] Democrats ($62\\%$) are about as likely as conservative Republicans ($60\\%$) to say they have followed news about the elections at least fairly closely.\n\nFrom the image quotes:\n- ![image1](image1) shows that $21\\%$ of Democrats/Lean Dem follow the news about congressional elections in their state very closely.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe percentage of the Democratic Party that reported following the news about congressional elections in their state very closely is $21\\%$.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is $21\\%$."}

However, we can infer some key findings from the data presented in the images.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Images for Statistical Results Grouped by Countries\nLet's analyze the images to see which findings are supported by statistical results grouped by countries.\n\n- **Image 1**: This image shows a bar chart with percentages for different countries. It appears to represent some form of concern or opinion, but the specific topic is not clear from the image alone.\n- **Image 2**: This image is a table showing percentages for different cities within countries. It provides detailed statistical results grouped by countries.\n- **Image 3**: This image is a stacked bar chart showing levels of concern (very concerned, somewhat concerned, not very concerned, not at all concerned) for different countries. It provides statistical results grouped by countries.\n- **Image 4**: This image is a stacked bar chart showing responses to a question (yes, no, don't know) for different countries. It provides statistical results grouped by countries.\n- **Image 5**: This image is similar to Image 3, showing levels of concern for different countries. It provides statistical results grouped by countries.\n\n### Step 3: Determine How Many Findings are Supported\nFrom the analysis of the images, we can see that Images 2, 3, 4, and 5 provide statistical results grouped by countries. Image 1 does not clearly show statistical results grouped by countries.\n\n### Conclusion\nOut of the top 10 findings, 4 of them are supported by statistical results grouped by countries.\n\n**Answer**: 4 of the top 10 findings are supported by statistical results grouped by countries."}

Fully 85% of the public has heard or read about this concept before, with 24% indicating they have heard or read \"a lot\" about it. A roughly comparable share (77%) thinks this idea is at least somewhat realistic, and one-in-five indicate that the concept seems extremely realistic to them. ![85% of Americans have heard about automation](image2) ![77% find the concept realistic](image1)\n\n- **Enthusiasm vs. Worry**: Americans generally express more worry than enthusiasm when asked about these automation technologies. Most prominently, Americans are roughly twice as likely to express worry (72%) than enthusiasm (33%) about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans. They are also around three times as likely to express worry (67%) than enthusiasm (22%) about algorithms that can make hiring decisions without any human involvement. By comparison, public views towards driverless vehicles and robot caregivers exhibit more balance between worry and enthusiasm. ![72% are worried, 33% are enthusiastic](image4)\n\n- **Perceived Outcomes**: Americans anticipate significant changes to the nature of jobs and work in the coming decades as a result of automation. Overall, roughly three-quarters of Americans (77%) think it’s realistic that robots and computers might one day be able to do many of the jobs currently done by humans, with 20% describing this prospect as extremely realistic.

According to text [7], nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) feel there should be limits on how many jobs businesses can replace with machines. This sentiment is echoed in image2, where 58% of respondents believe there should be limits on the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines, even if they are better and cheaper than humans.\n\n- **Concerns About Job Replacement**: Despite the support for limiting machine use, there is also a notable percentage of the public that believes businesses are justified in replacing human workers with machines if they can do a better job at lower cost. Text [7] indicates that 41% of Americans take this view. Image2 further illustrates this divide, showing that 41% of respondents feel that businesses are justified in replacing human workers with machines.\n\n- **Party Affiliation and Opinions**: Text [2] and [3] highlight that partisan opinions are somewhat aligned on this issue. Just over half of Republicans (54%) and 60% of Democrats feel that there should be limits to how many human jobs businesses can replace with machines. However, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to favor policies such as a universal income (77% to 38%) and a national service program (66% to 46%) for displaced workers.\n\n- **Public Support for Specific Policies**: The public is strongly supportive of policies that limit machines to performing dangerous and dirty jobs. Image4 shows that 47% of respondents strongly favor this type of policy, with an additional 38% somewhat favoring it. This aligns with text [9], which states that 85% of Americans favor limiting machines to dangerous or unhealthy jobs.\n\n- **Support for Universal Basic Income and National Service Programs**: In the event that machines threaten to displace substantial numbers of human workers, majorities support providing all Americans with a guaranteed income (60% in favor) and a national service program (58% in favor), as indicated in text [10]. Image4 also shows that 31% of respondents strongly favor a guaranteed income policy, with an additional 30% somewhat favoring it.\n\n- **Public Concerns and Policy Preferences**: The public is generally concerned about the widespread use of machines in the workforce. Image5 shows that 69% of respondents are very or somewhat worried about the widespread use of machines. Additionally, 65% strongly favor requiring a human at the wheel in case of emergency, and 58% strongly favor that machines travel in dedicated lanes.\n\nIn conclusion, the public has a nuanced view on the use of machines in the workforce, with a majority supporting limits on job replacement and favoring policies that protect human workers"}

According to the text [1], 58% of Clinton voters are willing to give Trump a chance, while 39% say they can't see themselves giving Trump a chance due to his character. This is further supported by image3, which shows that 39% of Clinton voters are unwilling to give Trump a chance because of the kind of person he has shown himself to be, whereas 58% are willing to give him a chance to see how he governs.\n\nIn contrast, Trump voters overwhelmingly express confidence in Trump's presidency. Image1 shows that 88% of Trump voters are confident about the kind of president Trump will be, with only 10% having serious concerns. This high level of confidence is also reflected in image5, where 97% of Trump voters expect him to have a successful first term, compared to 92% of Obama voters who expected Obama to have a successful first term in 2008.\n\nRegarding the potential success of Trump's first term, the views are starkly divided along party lines.

However, when broken down by voter group, image5 reveals that 97% of Trump voters expect his first term to be successful, whereas only 15% of Clinton voters share this optimism.

This suggests that Trump voters are more aligned with Trump's stance on health care, possibly due to his campaign promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. In contrast, Clinton voters are less concerned with health care as a priority, which may reflect their support for the ACA and their opposition to its repeal.\n\nSecondly, the economy is another area where there is a noticeable difference in priorities. While 15% of Trump voters name the economy as a top priority, only 9% of Clinton voters do so [4]. This could indicate that Trump voters are more focused on economic issues, such as job creation and tax cuts, which were central to Trump's campaign. Clinton voters, on the other hand, may be more concerned with other issues, such as social justice and environmental protection.\n\nThirdly, immigration is a priority for a higher percentage of Trump voters (15%) compared to Clinton voters (6%) [4]. This is consistent with Trump's campaign rhetoric, which emphasized the need for stricter immigration policies and the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Clinton voters, who generally support more liberal immigration policies, are less likely to see immigration as a top priority for Trump's presidency.\n\nFourthly, unifying the country is a priority for a higher percentage of Clinton voters (12%) compared to Trump voters (5%) [4]. This suggests that Clinton voters are more concerned with the divisive nature of Trump's campaign and presidency, and are more likely to see unity as a necessary step towards healing the nation's political wounds.\n\nFifthly, changing personal behavior and addressing divisions is a priority for a higher percentage of Clinton voters (11%) compared to Trump voters (1%) [10]. This could reflect Clinton voters' concerns about Trump's behavior during the campaign and his potential impact on the nation's social fabric.\n\nSixthly, defense and national security is a priority for a higher percentage of Trump voters (4%) compared to Clinton voters (2%) [3]. This is consistent with Trump's campaign emphasis on strengthening the military and taking a tough stance on terrorism.\n\nSeventhly, environmental issues and climate change are priorities for a higher percentage of Clinton voters (6%) compared to Trump voters (3%) [3]. This is consistent with Clinton's campaign emphasis on addressing climate change and promoting renewable energy.\n\nEighthly, foreign policy is a priority for a higher percentage of Clinton voters (4%) compared to Trump voters (1%) [3].

Specifically, 74% of all voters believed that Republican leaders should work with Obama, even if it meant disappointing their supporters. This sentiment was particularly strong among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, with 86% supporting cooperation with Obama. In contrast, only 22% of all voters felt that Republican leaders should stand up to Obama on issues important to Republicans, with a mere 11% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters supporting this stance [9].\n\nFast forward to 2016, the dynamics shifted dramatically with the election of Donald Trump. In this election, 59% of all voters felt that Democratic leaders should work with Trump to get things done, even if it meant disappointing Democratic supporters. However, a substantial 39% of all voters believed that Democratic leaders should stand up to Trump on issues important to Democrats, even if it meant less would get done in Washington. This sentiment was particularly pronounced among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, with 65% supporting a stance of standing up to Trump [1].\n\nThe shift in voter expectations and sentiments is evident when comparing the two elections. In 2008, there was a clear preference for bipartisan cooperation, with a majority of voters from both parties favoring collaboration with the newly elected president. In contrast, the 2016 election saw a more divided electorate, with a significant portion of voters, especially from the Democratic side, favoring a more confrontational approach towards the newly elected president.\n\nThis change in sentiment can be attributed to various factors, including the highly polarized and contentious nature of the 2016 election, as well as the differing political ideologies and priorities of the two presidents. The 2016 election was marked by a high level of negativity and \"mudslinging,\" with 92% of voters feeling that there was more negative campaigning than in past elections [3]. This negative atmosphere likely contributed to the increased polarization and the desire among some voters for their party's leaders to stand up to the opposing party's president.\n\nIn conclusion, the voter expectations and sentiments towards political leaders working with or against newly elected presidents differed significantly between 2008 and 2016. While the 2008 election saw a strong preference for bipartisan cooperation, the 2016 election was characterized by a more divided electorate, with a significant portion of voters favoring a confrontational approach towards the newly elected president.

This suggests that while Trump's victory was unexpected and elicited strong emotions, his overall performance was not highly regarded by a significant portion of the electorate.\n\nIn summary, the emotional reactions of Trump and Clinton voters were starkly different, with Trump voters feeling more positive emotions and Clinton voters feeling more negative emotions.

According to the survey data, a substantial majority of Americans believe China has done a poor job handling the coronavirus outbreak. Specifically, 64% of the total population surveyed think China has done a bad job, while only 31% think it has done a good job [2]. This is further broken down by age groups, with older individuals (ages 50 and above) being more critical, as 73% of them find fault in China's response [10].\n\nWhen we delve into the partisan differences, the data reveals a stark contrast. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are significantly more critical of China's handling of the outbreak compared to Democrats and Democratic leaners. A staggering 82% of Republicans believe China has done a bad job, with 61% of them considering it a very bad job [10]. In contrast, only 54% of Democrats share this view, with just 30% of them thinking China has done a very bad job [10]. This partisan divide is visually represented in the bar chart [image1], which shows that 82% of Republicans rate China's handling as bad, compared to 54% of Democrats.\n\nThe line graph [image3] further illustrates the historical trend in these perceptions. It shows that over the years, Republicans have consistently held more negative views of China's handling of the outbreak, with the gap widening in recent years. In 2020, 83% of Republicans had a negative view, compared to 68% of Democrats.\n\nMoving on to the impact on U.S.-China relations, the survey also explores whether the U.S. should hold China responsible for its role in the outbreak, even if it means worsening economic relations. The pie chart [image5] indicates that 50% of Americans think the U.S. should hold China responsible, while 38% believe the U.S. should prioritize strong U.S.-China relations, even if it means overlooking China's role in the outbreak. The remaining 8% think the Chinese government's initial handling of the virus is not at all to blame for the global spread of the virus, and 5% either did not know or refused to answer.\n\nBreaking this down by party affiliation, the data shows that Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to say the U.S. should hold China responsible, even at the expense of worse economic relations. Specifically, 71% of Republicans hold this view, compared to 37% of Democrats [9].

About eight-in-ten Americans hold this view, whereas only about half of Germans agree [6]. This is further supported by the data in image1, which shows that 60% of Americans believe their country should defend a NATO ally in the event of a potential Russian attack, while only 34% of Germans agree.\n\nSecondly, on the topic of defense spending, there are also notable differences between the two nations. In the U.S., half of Americans say that spending levels should remain the same, marking a notable shift in view from 2017, when 45% of Americans felt their allies in Europe should dedicate more resources to national defense [2]. In contrast, Germans are divided between increasing or maintaining budgets, with about four-in-ten taking each view [8]. This division is visually represented in image4, which shows that in 2019, 40% of Germans wanted to increase spending, 41% wanted to keep it the same, and 15% wanted to decrease it.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. public is more supportive of the U.S. military presence in Germany, with 85% of Americans believing these bases are important to the U.S.'s security interests, and nearly six-in-ten seeing them as very important [3]. However, Germans are not as sold on the idea, with only about half seeing U.S. military bases as important for their country’s national security, and 45% disagreeing [5].\n\nThe ideological divide within each country also plays a role. In the U.S., Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to favor increased defense spending in Europe. However, the share among Republicans who think the U.S.’s European allies should increase their defense budgets has fallen by 14 percentage points between 2017 and 2019 [7].

According to the data:\n\n- **Younger Germans (18-29 years)**: A significant majority, approximately 60%, believe that U.S. military bases are not important for Germany's national security. This is evident from the image showing that 62% of this age group consider the bases as not important, while only 33% see them as important.\n- **Older Germans (65+ years)**: In contrast, 61% of Germans aged 65 and older believe that U.S. military bases are important to Germany's defense. This is a stark contrast to the younger age group, indicating a generational divide in perceptions of military presence.\n\n### Political Affiliations in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., political affiliation plays a crucial role in determining the most important foreign policy partners:\n\n- **Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents**: They are more likely to name Israel as a top foreign policy partner, with 26% considering it important. This is higher compared to Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, who only have 9% considering Israel as important.\n- **Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents**: They place more emphasis on Canada and Mexico as top foreign policy partners. Democrats also rank Germany as a significant partner, with both sides ranking Germany fifth on the list of most or second-most important foreign policy partners.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data illustrates that younger Germans are less likely to see U.S. military bases as important for their national security, whereas older Germans hold the opposite view. In the U.S., political affiliation dictates the perception of important foreign policy partners, with Republicans favoring Israel and Democrats emphasizing Canada, Mexico, and Germany. These differences highlight the complex interplay of age and political ideology in shaping foreign policy perceptions in both countries."}

This view is more pronounced among liberal Democrats (64%) compared to conservative and moderate Democrats (44%).\n\n- **Ideological Differences:**\n  - **Conservative Republicans:** 80% believe the U.S. should focus on its own problems.\n  - **Moderate/Liberal Republicans:** 69% hold the same view.\n  - **Conservative/Mod Democrats:** 44% think the U.S. should help other countries.\n  - **Liberal Democrats:** 64% support helping other countries.\n\n### Educational Backgrounds:\n- **Education and Global Engagement:**\n  - **Postgraduates:** 60% believe the U.S. should help other countries, while 39% think it should focus on its own problems.\n  - **College Graduates:** 49% support helping other countries, while 49% prefer focusing on domestic issues.\n  - **Some College:** 34% support international aid, while 64% prioritize domestic issues.\n  - **High School or Less:** 29% support helping other countries, while 69% focus on domestic problems.\n\n- **Education and Handling of International Issues:**\n  - **Postgraduates:** 66% believe the U.S. has done a poor job handling international issues.\n  - **College Graduates:** 59% hold the same view.\n  - **Some College:** 53% think the U.S. has done poorly.\n  - **High School or Less:** 43% believe the U.S. has handled international issues poorly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data shows a clear divide in views on U.S. global engagement and handling of international issues based on political affiliation and educational background.

According to the text [3], 73% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are critical of the U.S.'s response, while 71% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents praise the country's handling of the outbreak. This indicates a strong correlation between political affiliation and perception of the U.S.'s pandemic response.\n\n**China:**\n- **Bipartisan Criticism:** Both Democrats and Republicans are critical of China's handling of the pandemic. Text [6] states that nearly two-thirds of Americans say China has not done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, including 37% who say the country has done a poor job. This shows a bipartisan consensus on China's response.\n\n### Educational Backgrounds\n\n**United States:**\n- **Education and Criticism:** More educated Americans are more critical of the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic. Text [2] indicates that around two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree say the U.S. has done a poor job, as do around six-in-ten college graduates. In contrast, about four-in-ten of those with a high school degree or less (43%) say the same. This suggests that higher education levels correlate with more critical views of the U.S.'s pandemic response.\n\n**China:**\n- **Uniform Criticism Across Education Levels:** Education plays little role in how people feel about China's handling of the virus. Text [4] states that majorities of people in all educational groups say China has not handled the pandemic well. This indicates that criticism of China's response is consistent across different educational backgrounds.\n\n### Visual Evidence\n\n**Image 3:**\n- **Age and Education:** The image shows that older Americans (65+) are more critical of the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic (69% only fair/poor) compared to younger age groups. Additionally, those with postgraduate degrees (62%) and college graduates (66%) are more critical than those with some college (66%) or a high school degree or less (62%).\n\n**Image 5:**\n- **Racial Differences:** The image indicates that Black Americans (63%) are more critical of the U.S.'s handling of the pandemic compared to White (48%) and Hispanic (57%) Americans. This suggests that racial background also plays a role in perceptions of the U.S.'s pandemic response.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, political affiliations and educational backgrounds significantly influence Americans' perceptions of the U.S. and China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

According to the data, 60% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the U.S. can learn a great deal from other nations, compared to only 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners [8]. This indicates a strong belief among Democrats that the U.S. can benefit from international experiences and strategies in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nSecondly, the belief that the U.S. can learn from other countries about COVID-19 is more widespread among Americans with higher levels of education than among those with lower education levels [9]. This suggests that education level also plays a role in shaping these views.\n\nThirdly, when it comes to the U.S.'s role in global affairs, there are sharp partisan and ideological differences. For instance, 81% of liberal Democrats think the U.S. has done an only fair or poor job of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared to just 22% of conservative Republicans [6].

However, it remains above its low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n- **Image Evidence**: ![Unemployment Rate](image5) shows the quarterly unemployment rate for Hispanic and non-Hispanic households from 2000 to 2015.

Meanwhile, 37% said their income is staying about even with the cost of living, and 10% said it is going up faster than the cost of living. In 2015, blacks and whites held similar views as Hispanics on this issue.\n- [4] Between 2014 and 2015, Hispanic views of family income in relation to the cost of living were unchanged—about half of all Hispanic adults in both years said they were falling behind financially, as was true for the U.S. public as a whole.\n- [6] About half (48%) of Latinos ages 18 to 29 report that they were in excellent or good financial shape in 2015, a 27 percentage point increase from 2008 and more than double the share who had a similarly positive view of their finances that year.\n- [9] Looking back to before the recession reveals another striking difference between Hispanic economic perceptions and those of the U.S. population as a whole. Latino views of their financial situation are more positive now than they were in 2004, when roughly a third (31%) rated their financial condition as excellent or good. By contrast, the public’s view of its finances is lower now than in 2004, when about half (51%) had a positive view.\n- [10] These differences by age are the exception, not the rule, as similar-sized gains are recorded among most other demographic subgroups. For example, ratings of personal finances rose by 17 percentage points among U.S.-born Hispanics and by 18 points among those born in another country. Positive views of economic well-being rose by 16 percentage points among Latino men and by 18 points among Latina women. These rosy assessments also increased by double digits among those with less than a high school education (+12 points) and high school graduates (+16) as well as those who had attended college (+17).\n\n**Image Quotes:**\n- ![Hispanic perceptions of family income relative to the cost of living in 2014 and 2015](image1)\n- ![Change in perceptions of personal financial situations among the general public and all Latinos from "}

This indicates a significant drop in smartphone ownership as age increases.\n- **Internet Usage:** Text [4] states that 71% of older adults who use the internet go online every day or almost every day, and an additional 11% go online three to five times per week. This suggests that once seniors become internet users, they tend to use it frequently.\n- **Broadband Adoption:** Text [6] mentions that internet use and broadband adoption drop off dramatically around age 75. This implies that older seniors are less likely to have broadband access.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image 2:** This image shows the percentage of internet users and broadband adoption in different age groups. It reveals that while 74% of those aged 65-69 go online, this number decreases to 37% for those aged 80 and older. Similarly, broadband adoption drops from 65% in the 65-69 age group to 21% in the 80+ age group.\n- **Image 3:** This image compares smartphone and tablet/e-reader ownership between all adults and those aged 65 and older.

For tablets or e-readers, the ownership is 43% among all adults and 27% among those aged 65 and older.\n\n### Daily Internet Usage Trends\n\n**Text Analysis:**\n- **Frequency of Internet Use:** Text [8] indicates that 71% of older adults who use the internet go online every day or almost every day, and 11% go online three to five times per week. This suggests a high frequency of internet use among older adults who are online.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **Image 1:** This image shows the frequency of internet use among different age groups. It indicates that 88% of those aged 18-29 go online every day or almost every day, while this percentage drops to 71% for those aged 65 and older. This trend shows that younger age groups are more likely to use the internet daily compared to older adults.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, internet usage and device ownership among seniors are significantly lower compared to all adults. Smartphone ownership is particularly low among those aged 80 and older. Broadband adoption also decreases notably starting at approximately age"}

Email or social media is viewed positively by 60% of workers, with 16% seeing it as negative [5, image5].\n\nHowever, industrial robots are viewed more negatively, with 27% of workers seeing them as having a positive impact, while 14% view them negatively [5, image5]. This suggests that while many technologies are seen as beneficial, industrial robots may be perceived as a threat to job security or interest.\n\nIn conclusion, education levels and specific technologies play a crucial role in shaping workers' perceptions of their job's interest and advancement opportunities. Higher education levels are associated with more positive views of technology, while certain technologies like word processing software and smartphones are generally seen as beneficial, whereas industrial robots may be viewed more negatively."}

For instance, the personal finance score concept is seen as effective by 54% of the population but only 32% think it is fair [1].\n   - The criminal risk score is viewed as fair by 50% of the population, which is higher than the fairness perception of the personal finance score [1].\n\n2. **Demographic Differences**:\n   - There are significant demographic differences in perceptions of fairness. For example, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to find the consumer finance score concept fair compared to whites [3].\n   - Conversely, blacks express more concern about the fairness of parole scoring algorithms [3].\n\n3. **Public Skepticism**:\n   - A majority of Americans (58%) believe that computer programs will always reflect some level of human bias [6].\n   - The public is skeptical about the fairness of these systems, with only small shares thinking that the personal finance score and video job interview analysis concepts would be fair [7].\n\n4. **Acceptability**:\n   - Two-thirds of Americans find the personal finance score algorithm unacceptable [9].\n   - The reasons for finding these systems unacceptable include concerns about privacy, accuracy, and fairness [2].\n\n### Image Analysis\n\nThe images provide additional data to support and expand on the text analysis:\n\n1. **Bias Perception by Age**:\n   - Image1 shows that younger adults (18-29) are more likely to believe that programs can be designed without human bias (50%) compared to older adults (50+), who are more skeptical (34%) [image1].\n\n2. **Acceptability of Personal Finance Scores**:\n   - Image2 indicates that 68% of U.S. adults find the use of automated personal finance scores unacceptable, with the main reasons being privacy violations and lack of accurate representation [image2].\n\n3. **Effectiveness vs. Fairness**:\n   - Image3 highlights the differences in perceptions of effectiveness and fairness across different automated systems.

This is evident from the data presented in both the text and image quotes.\n\nFirstly, regarding the effectiveness of the U.S. response to COVID-19 compared to other wealthy countries, there is a clear partisan divide. According to the text [1], only 22% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the U.S. has been more effective, while 34% say it has been less effective, and 42% say it has been about as effective. In contrast, 87% of Democrats and Democratic leaners view the U.S. response as less effective compared with other wealthy countries. This stark difference is visually represented in image1, which shows that 87% of Democrats believe the U.S. response has been less effective, compared to only 22% of Republicans who believe it has been more effective.\n\nSecondly, the trust in institutions such as public health officials, local and state elected officials, and Donald Trump also varies greatly along partisan lines. Image2 illustrates that 72% of Democrats give positive ratings to public health officials such as those at the CDC, while only 53% of Republicans do the same. Similarly, 64% of Democrats trust their local elected officials, compared to 58% of Republicans. For state elected officials, 61% of Democrats trust them, while only 51% of Republicans do. The trust in Donald Trump is even more polarized, with 73% of Republicans approving of his handling of the outbreak, compared to only 6% of Democrats.\n\nFurthermore, image3 shows that the reasons for the increase in confirmed coronavirus cases also differ by party. Among those living in counties where deaths resulting from COVID-19 have been higher, 94% of Democrats attribute the rise to new infections, while only 53% of Republicans do. This partisan divide is consistent across different time frames and levels of COVID-19 impact.\n\nLastly, image4 and image5 depict the approval and disapproval ratings of Donald Trump over time. Image4 shows that disapproval ratings have remained relatively stable, with a slight dip in 2020. Image5 further breaks down the approval ratings by party, showing that while 83% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling of the outbreak in March, this number dropped to 73% by August. In contrast, only 6% of Democrats approved in March, and this number remained low throughout the year.\n\nIn conclusion, partisan divides have a profound impact on perceptions of COVID-19 response effectiveness and trust in institutions. Republicans and Democrats have vastly different views on the effectiveness of the U.S. response, the reasons for the increase in confirmed cases, and the trustworthiness of public health officials, elected officials, and Donald Trump.

While 22% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the U.S. has been more effective, 87% of Democrats and Democratic leaners view the U.S. response as less effective [7].\n\nFactors contributing to the continued outbreak, as perceived by the public, include:\n\n- Not enough people social distancing and mask-wearing (75% major reason) [8][image1].\n- Restrictions have been lifted too quickly in some places (58% major reason) [8][image1].\n- Inadequate response from the federal government (53% major reason) [8][image1].\n- Not enough timely testing (49% major reason) [8][image1].\n- Unclear instructions about how to prevent the spread (40% major reason) [8][image1].\n\nAdditionally, there is a significant partisan divide on whether the federal government response is inadequate, with 82% of Democrats viewing this as a major reason, compared to 21% of Republicans [9].\n\nIn summary, Americans perceive public health officials as more effective in handling COVID-19 than elected officials. The continued outbreak is attributed to a combination of factors, including inadequate public adherence to health guidelines, premature lifting of restrictions, and perceived inadequacies in government response. Partisan differences are evident in the assessment of the U.S. response compared to other wealthy countries and the perceived reasons for the ongoing outbreak."}

According to the text [8], nearly half of U.S. adults approve of a proposal by House Democrats that would require states to put together redistricting commissions composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans to draw their congressional maps instead of having state legislatures come up with their own plans. Just 13% disapprove of this proposal, while 38% say they are unsure about it. \n\nNow, let's look at the image data.

It shows that 74% of college graduates and 57% of those without a college degree support allowing any voter to vote early or absentee. This indicates that there are educational differences in support for early absentee voting options.\n\nFinally, the image [4] shows that among Republicans, 52% of those who voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election favor no-excuse absentee or early voting, while only 35% of early, in-person GOP voters and 22% of those who voted in person on Election Day say the same.

Text [3] further supports this by stating that about seven-in-ten Americans (71%) see jobs in STEM as offering better compensation than jobs in other industries.\n- **Image Evidence**: Image 4 shows that 71% of the public believes that STEM jobs offer higher pay. This aligns with the text evidence, reinforcing the perception of higher compensation in STEM fields.\n\n#### Job Characteristics Valued in STEM Jobs\n- **Text Evidence**: Text [9] highlights that men and women in STEM jobs value different job characteristics. Men tend to value higher pay and opportunities for promotion more than women, while women are more inclined to consider a job that focuses on helping others (59%) compared to men (31%).\n- **Image Evidence**: Image 1 provides a detailed comparison of job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM jobs:\n  - **Flexibility to Balance Work/Family**: Both men (71%) and women (76%) value this characteristic highly, with no significant difference.\n  - **Opportunities for Promotion**: Men (57%) value this more than women (46%).\n  - **High-Paying Job**: Men (59%) value this more than women (48%).\n  - **Job That Others Respect and Value**: Women (50%) value this more than men (43%).\n  - **Making a Meaningful Contribution to Society**: Women (60%) value this more than men (51%).\n  - **Job Focused on Helping Others**: Women (59%) value this significantly more than men (31%).\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn summary, while both men and women in STEM jobs value higher pay, there are notable differences in the job characteristics they prioritize. Men tend to place a higher value on opportunities for promotion and high-paying jobs, whereas women are more inclined to value jobs that help others and make a meaningful contribution to society.

Women in STEM jobs are more likely to value jobs that help others, with 59% of women considering this important compared to 31% of men [1]. Additionally, women in STEM jobs are more inclined to consider a job that focuses on helping others as important to them compared with men in STEM jobs [7]. \n\nOn the other hand, men in STEM jobs value higher pay and opportunities for promotion more than women in STEM jobs [7]. This is reflected in the fact that 59% of men in STEM jobs value having a high-paying job, compared to 48% of women [4]. \n\nThese differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM relate to the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce. Women in STEM jobs are more likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work because of their gender and to consider discrimination a major reason that more women are not working in STEM [3]. This discrimination can manifest in pay gaps and unequal treatment from their coworkers stemming from gender stereotypes [3]. \n\nFurthermore, many Americans attribute the limited diversity of the STEM workforce to a lack of encouragement for girls and blacks and Hispanics to pursue STEM from an early age [5]. This lack of encouragement can lead to a lack of female role models in STEM, which can discourage girls from pursuing STEM fields [3]. \n\nIn conclusion, the differences in job characteristics valued by men and women in STEM are significant and relate to the perceived difficulties faced by women in entering the STEM workforce. Women in STEM jobs value jobs that help others more than men, while men value higher pay and opportunities for promotion more than women.

Overall, they are about twice as likely as those in non-STEM occupations to have earned at least a bachelor’s degree (65% vs. 32%). Roughly three-in-ten STEM workers (29%) have earned a master’s, doctorate or professional degree, far exceeding the share of non-STEM workers with advanced degrees (12%). Some 36% of STEM workers have a bachelor’s degree (but no postgraduate degree) compared with 21% of non-STEM workers. Among STEM workers, life scientists are the most highly educated on average; 54% of these workers have an advanced degree.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **![Education Levels](image2)**: This image shows the distribution of education levels among STEM and non-STEM employed individuals. \n  - STEM employed: 7% high school or less, 28% some college, 36% bachelor’s degree, 29% postgrad degree.\n  - Non-STEM employed: 37% high school or less, 31% some college, 21% bachelor’s degree, 12% postgrad degree.\n\n### Employment Sectors Among STEM and Non-STEM Workers\n\n**Text Analysis:**\n- **[8]**: Most STEM workers work for a private, for-profit employer. The share – 66% – is substantially identical to the share of all employed adults. Engineers and architects (82%) and computer workers (77%) are among the most likely to work for a private employer. Fewer healthcare practitioners and technicians work in the private, for-profit sector (58%); almost a quarter of these workers (23%) work for a not-for-profit employer.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- **![Employment Sectors](image4)**: This image shows the distribution of employment sectors among STEM and non-STEM workers.\n  - All employed: 66% private, for-profit, 8% not-for-profit, 15% government, 11% self-employed/other.\n  - STEM jobs: 66% private, for-profit, 15% not-for-profit, 13% government, 6% self-employed/other.\n  - Non-STEM jobs: 66% private, for-profit, 7% not-for-profit, 15% government, 11% self-employed/other.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSTEM-employed individuals generally have higher levels of education compared"}

Eight-in-ten immigrants who identify as Hispanics feel very or somewhat connected with their country of origin, while only 44% of third-generation Hispanics feel the same [1 ].\n\nThe self-identification preferences also vary across generations. Immigrants most often call themselves by their country of origin, while the share that identifies as \"American\" rises from 7% among immigrants to 56% among the third generation or higher [ 2 ][ 3 ]. This reflects the strong ties to their U.S. national identity among third or higher generation Latinos, who were born in the U.S. to U.S.-born parents [ 3 ].\n\nLanguage use also shows generational differences. Among self-identified Hispanics, 61% of immigrants are Spanish dominant, meaning they are more proficient in speaking and reading in Spanish than in English.

The process involves several key steps, as illustrated in the provided text and images.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **User Input Encoding**:\n   - The user's request is first encoded into a continuous vector using a bidirectional LSTM utterance encoder. This encoding captures the semantic meaning of the user's input. [4]\n\n2. **Dialogue State Tracking**:\n   - The encoded user utterance is then fed into a dialogue-level LSTM, which maintains a continuous representation of the dialogue state. This state is updated after processing each dialogue turn, incorporating the encoding of the user utterance and the previous system action. [4, 7]\n   - The dialogue state tracker updates its estimation of the user's goal, represented by a list of slot-value pairs. A probability distribution is maintained over candidate values for each goal slot type. [7]\n\n3. **Query Formulation and Knowledge Base Interaction**:\n   - Based on the dialogue state, a query command is formulated. This query is sent to a knowledge base to retrieve the requested information. [4, 5]\n   - The system uses symbolic queries and relies on external services for entity ranking, which can consider richer features such as user profiles and context. [5]\n\n4. **Policy Network Decision**:\n   - The policy network takes inputs from the dialogue-level LSTM state, the log probabilities of candidate values from the belief tracker, and the encoding of the query results. It then emits a system action in the form of a dialogue act. [1, 9]\n   - This system action is conditioned on information from the dialogue state, the estimated user's goal, and the encoding of the query results. [4]\n\n5. **Natural Language Generation**:\n   - The emitted system action, along with the state tracker outputs and the retrieved knowledge base entities, is used to generate the final natural language system response. [4, 6]\n   - A template-based natural language generator (NLG) is employed, where delexicalized tokens in the NLG template are replaced by values from either the estimated user goal values or the knowledge base entities, depending on the emitted system action.

For instance, ViQuAE and Encyclopedic VQA also incorporate entity-level knowledge, but SnapNTell surpasses them in the variety of categories, the number of distinct entities, and the overall number of QA pairs [5].\n\n2. **Entities**: SnapNTell features 7,568 unique entities, which is significantly higher than other datasets. This extensive coverage of entities ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of models' abilities in recognizing and understanding various entities [4].\n\n3. **Knowledge**: Unlike many existing VQA datasets that focus on simple yes/no questions or lack fine-grained entities, SnapNTell emphasizes knowledge-intensive responses. The QA pairs in SnapNTell require detailed, entity-specific knowledge, making it a more challenging and informative benchmark for evaluating models' capabilities [1].\n\n4. **QA Pairs**: SnapNTell contains 75,680 QA pairs, which is a substantial number compared to other datasets. This large number of QA pairs allows for a more thorough evaluation of models' performance [5].\n\n5. **Images**: Each entity in the SnapNTell dataset is represented by 10 images, providing a rich visual context for the questions. This is in contrast to other datasets where the number of images per entity is unspecified or lower [5].\n\n6. **Anonymity**: SnapNTell's questions are highly anonymous, meaning they do not reveal the specific entity being asked about. This feature ensures that models must rely on their understanding of the entity and the context provided by the images to generate accurate responses [5].\n\nIn summary, the SnapNTell dataset stands out for its extensive coverage of categories, a large number of unique entities, knowledge-intensive QA pairs, a high number of images per entity, and the anonymity of its questions. These features make it a valuable resource for evaluating and improving models' abilities in entity-centric VQA tasks."}

The text and image quotes provide the necessary information to make this comparison.\n\nFirst, let's look at the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models. According to the text quote [5], the estimated CO₂ emissions from training common NLP models are listed in Table 1. The image quote image2 provides a more detailed breakdown of the CO₂ emissions for different NLP models, including T2T_base, T2T_big, ELMo, BERT_base, NAS, and GPT-2. The CO₂ emissions for these models range from 12 to 32,623 kg.\n\nNext, let's look at the CO₂ emissions from everyday activities. The image quote image5 provides a comparison of the CO₂ emissions from air travel, human life, American life, and car usage. The CO₂ emissions for these activities range from 1984 to 126,000 kg.\n\nComparing the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models to the CO₂ emissions from everyday activities, we can see that the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models are significantly higher. For example, the CO₂ emissions from training the T2T_base model are 12 kg, which is equivalent to the CO₂ emissions from air travel for one person for a round trip from New York to San Francisco. The CO₂ emissions from training the GPT-2 model are 32,623 kg, which is equivalent to the CO₂ emissions from car usage for one lifetime.\n\nIn conclusion, the CO₂ emissions from training NLP models are significantly higher than the CO₂ emissions from everyday activities. This highlights the need for NLP researchers to be mindful of the environmental impact of their work and to prioritize developing efficient models and hardware. The text quote [7] provides recommendations for reducing the costs and improving equity in NLP research and practice, including reporting time to retrain and sensitivity to hyperparameters, providing equitable access to computational resources, and prioritizing developing efficient models and hardware."}

As more knowledge is absent, both precision and recall drop drastically.\n- **[5]**: The recall is stable at about 15 regardless of the number of absent knowledge.

This approach is depicted in the image below, which shows a straightforward flow from user query to output through indexing and retrieval.\n\n![Naive RAG](image1)\n\n- **Indexing**: Documents are indexed.\n- **Retrieval**: Relevant documents are retrieved based on the user query.\n- **Generation**: The retrieved documents are used to generate a response.\n\n### Advanced RAG\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG.

The system integrates both image and text data to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of object detection and recognition tasks. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Pre-processing for Detection Datasets**:\n   - **Cropping and Blurring**: As shown in Fig. 3 [8], the system first applies cropping to the image regions based on proposal bounding box coordinates. This step is crucial because object detection datasets often contain multiple objects of varying sizes. Cropping helps focus on the relevant objects.\n   - **Resizing**: The cropped regions are resized to a fixed proportion to standardize the input for the model.\n   - **Blurring**: Non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest are blurred. This technique directs the model's focus toward the relevant objects, facilitating their identification.\n\n2. **Encoding and Embedding**:\n   - **Image Encoder**: The cropped and resized images are processed by an image encoder to obtain image embeddings. This encoder is identical to the one used in the multimodal retriever.\n   - **Text Encoder**: Text descriptions associated with the objects are also encoded to create text embeddings.\n\n3. **Retrieval**:\n   - **Database Image Feature Embeddings**: The system retrieves the top-k similar results from a database of image feature embeddings. This retrieval is based on the similarity between the input image embeddings and the stored embeddings in the memory bank.\n   - **Index Construction**: Efficient index construction techniques are employed to optimize retrieval speed, as highlighted in Fig. 2 [3].\n\n4. **Ranking**:\n   - **Combining Embeddings**: The retrieved image and text embeddings are combined and sent to the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ranking.\n   - **Ranking Prompt**: The MLLMs use advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to rank the retrieved class names.

This is evident from the precision/recall curves shown in Figure 8 [6].\n\n![Precision/Recall Curves](image1)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SciIE multitask system outperforms single-task systems in entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution. The inclusion of coreference links significantly improves recall while maintaining high precision. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the SciIE multitask system in handling multiple tasks simultaneously and the added value of coreference resolution in enhancing the overall performance of the system."}

These improvements are consistent with, if slightly behind, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018).\n- **[2]**: We present a new approach for pretraining a bi-directional transformer model that provides significant performance gains across a variety of language understanding problems. Our model solves a cloze-style word reconstruction task, where each word is ablated and must be predicted given the rest of the text. Experiments demonstrate large performance gains on GLUE and new state of the art results on NER as well as constituency parsing benchmarks, consistent with BERT.\n- **[8]**: Results on the GLUE benchmark show large gains over Radford et al. (2018) for each task, while experiments with model stacking set new state of the art performance levels for parsing and named entity recognition. We also did extensive experimental analysis to better understand these results, showing that (1) having multiple sentences in each training example is crucial for many tasks; (2) pre-training continues to improve performance up to 18B tokens and would likely continue to improve with more data; and finally (3) our novel cloze-driven training regime is more effective than predicting left and right tokens separately.\n\n### Image Analysis\nFrom the image quotes, we can gather the following information:\n- **image2**: This table compares the performance of various models on the GLUE benchmark.

Our study, however, ablates the effect of various amounts of training data and different data sources.\n- [2] discusses the use of BooksCorpus and Wikipedia, noting that examples in BooksCorpus are shorter (36 tokens on average) compared to Wikipedia (66 words on average).

It also mentions that News Crawl, which contains newswire data, generally performs less well than Common Crawl, even on MRPC, which is newswire.

This suggests that alignment might not be a critical factor in improving BLEU scores.\n\n2. **Image Analysis**:\n   - **Image 3** shows the BLEU scores for different language pairs with and without aligned embeddings. The results indicate that for some language pairs, alignment slightly improves the BLEU score, while for others, it either has no effect or slightly decreases the score.\n     - For **GL → EN**, alignment decreases the BLEU score from 12.8 to 11.5.\n     - For **PT → EN**, alignment slightly decreases the BLEU score from 30.8 to 30.6.\n     - For **AZ → EN**, alignment slightly increases the BLEU score from 2.0 to 2.1.\n     - For **TR → EN**, alignment slightly decreases the BLEU score from  17.9 to  17.7.\n     - For **BE → EN**, alignment has no effect on the BLEU score, remaining at 3.0.\n     - For **RU → EN**, alignment slightly increases the BLEU score from  21.1 to  21.4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe alignment of word embeddings has a mixed impact on BLEU scores across different language translation tasks.

This suggests that pre-training helps in better handling of rare words.\n   - **Image Evidence**: ![Pre-training improves translation accuracy](image6) shows that pre-training (dashed lines) consistently outperforms standard training (solid lines) across different language pairs, such as Pt → En, Tr → En, and Ru → En.\n\n2. **Role of Training Set Size**:\n   - **Text Evidence**: [4] mentions that pre-trained embeddings are most effective when there is very little training data but not so little that the system cannot be trained at all. This indicates a \"sweet spot\" for the effectiveness of pre-training.\n   - **Image Evidence**: ![Effect of training set size](image6) shows that as the training set size increases, the improvement in BLEU scores due to pre-training also increases, particularly noticeable in the Pt → En pair.\n\n3. **Role of Language Similarity**:\n   - **Text Evidence**: [4] also states that pre-trained embeddings seem to be more effective for more similar translation pairs. This is supported by the observation in [3] that gains in BLEU scores are roughly in order of their similarity.\n   - **Image Evidence**: ![Language similarity and BLEU scores](image3) shows that language pairs with higher similarity (e.g., ES → PT) see larger gains in BLEU scores compared to less similar pairs (e.g., RU → PT).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPre-training significantly improves translation accuracy, especially for low-frequency words and in scenarios with limited training data. The effectiveness of pre-training is also influenced by the similarity between the source and target languages, with more similar languages benefiting more from pre-training. Training set size plays a crucial role, with larger datasets generally leading to better performance gains from pre-training.\n\nIn summary, pre-training enhances translation accuracy by providing better representations of less frequent concepts and by leveraging the semantic similarities between languages, particularly in low-resource scenarios."}

Let's break down the effects of removing R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types like MATCH and COREF.\n\n### R-GCN Component\n- **With R-GCN**: The model performs significantly better with the R-GCN component. For instance, the GloVe with R-GCN model achieves 59.2% accuracy on the unmasked set and 11.1% on the masked set [image1].\n- **Without R-GCN**: When the R-GCN component is removed, the performance drops to 51.2% on the unmasked set and 11.6% on the masked set [image1]. This indicates that the R-GCN component is crucial for the model's performance, especially in the unmasked condition.\n\n### Relation Types\n- **With Relation Types**: The model performs better when relation types are included. For example, the \"No relation types\" model shows a performance of 62.7% on the unmasked set and 63.9% on the masked set [image1].\n- **Without Relation Types**: Removing relation types results in a marginal improvement compared to the \"No R-GCN\" model, which has 62.4% accuracy on the unmasked set and 63.2% on the masked set [image1]. This suggests that relation types contribute to the model's performance, but their impact is not as significant as the R-GCN component.\n\n### Specific Relation Types (MATCH, COREF)\n- **MATCH**: Removing the MATCH relation type results in a performance of 64.3% on the unmasked set and 67.4% on the masked set [image1]. This indicates that MATCH relations are somewhat important, but their removal does not drastically affect the model's performance.\n- **COREF**: Removing the COREF relation type results in a performance of 64.8% on the unmasked set [image1]. The text also mentions that the model's performance degrades on the test set when coreference is used, suggesting that COREF relations may not be as reliable or beneficial in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe removal of specific components like R-GCN, relation types, and specific relation types (e.g., MATCH, COREF) has varying impacts on the model's performance under unmasked and masked conditions. The R-GCN component is the most critical, followed by relation types, and then specific relation types like MATCH and COREF. The performance degradation when these components are removed highlights their importance in the model's architecture and effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the R-GCN component significantly boosts the model's performance, while relation types and specific relation types like MATCH and COREF have a more moderate impact.

This is because coreferred mentions are labeled with the same identifier in the masked version, making it easier for the model to retrieve information.\n   - In the unmasked setting, mentions to an entity may differ, making it harder for the coreference system to retrieve information accurately.\n\n2. **Impact of Coreference Information**:\n   - From [6], we learn that coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role in the model's performance. However, modeling all these different relations together gives the Entity-GCN a clear advantage.\n   - Specifically, the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. This is because the majority of connections are between mentions in the same document, and removing these connections removes important information.\n   - Surprisingly, with coreference, there is performance degradation on the test set. This is likely because the test documents are harder for the coreference system.\n\n3. **Performance Comparison from Image Quotes**:\n   - ![Performance Comparison](image2) shows the performance of different models in both unmasked and masked settings.\n   - In the unmasked setting, the Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) has an accuracy of 66.4%, while without coreference, it has an accuracy of 67.6%.\n   - In the masked setting, the Entity-GCN with coreference (single model) has an accuracy of 70.5%, while without coreference, it has an accuracy of 70.4%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe inclusion of coreference information impacts the performance of Entity-GCN models differently in unmasked and masked settings.

However, the specific details of these tables are not provided in the text quotes.\n\nFrom the text [ 5], we understand that the evaluation of the model on ACE2004 and ACE2005 follows the same data preprocessing and evaluation scheme as Wang and Lu (2018). The datasets are referred to as ACE04-O and ACE05-O. The text also mentions that an entity prediction is considered correct if both its entity label and its full text span match a gold prediction, which is a more stringent evaluation criterion.\n\nFrom the text [ 7], we learn that the performance of DyGIE on overlapping entity extraction is evaluated in three datasets: ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA. Since relation annotations are not available for these datasets, the coreference propagation layer is included in the models but not the relation layer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the image quotes:\n\n- Image1 provides a summary of the datasets, including the number of documents, entities, overlap percentage, and whether coreference annotations are present. From this table, we can see that ACE04-O and GENIA have coreference annotations, while ACE05-O does not.\n\n- Image2 shows the performance of different models, including DyGIE, on entity and relation recognition tasks. The table includes precision (P), recall (R), and F1 scores for each model.\n\n- Image3 compares the performance of DyGIE with other systems on the entity F1 score for the ACE04-O, ACE05-O, and GENIA datasets.\n\n- Image4 and Image5 are graphs showing the relationship between the number of entities in a sentence and the relation F1 score, as well as the number of iterations and the entity F1 score, respectively.\n\n- Image6 provides a detailed comparison of different models on entity and relation recognition tasks, including precision, recall, and F1 scores.\n\n- Image7 shows the changes in F1 scores for different entity types when coreference propagation is added to the model.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that the presence of coreference annotations in datasets has a positive influence on the performance of the DyGIE model in entity recognition tasks.

This is visually supported by image5, which shows the entity F1 scores as a function of the number of iterations (N). The graph indicates that the F1 score peaks at the second iteration and then slightly decreases.\n\n### RelProp Iterations\nSimilarly, from text quote [8], we learn that the model achieves the best performance on the second iteration (M=2) for relation propagation. This is corroborated by image5, which shows the relation F1 scores as a function of the number of iterations (M). The graph indicates that the F1 score also peaks at the second iteration and then slightly decreases.\n\n### Impact on Entity and Relation Extraction\nText quote [3] provides insights into the impact of CorefProp and RelProp on entity and relation extraction tasks. It states that coreference propagation is mainly helpful for entities and appears to hurt relation extraction on ACE05. However, on SciIE, coreference propagation gives a small benefit on both tasks. Relation propagation significantly benefits both entity and relation extraction in both domains.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n- **Entity Extraction**: \n  - CorefProp has a more significant effect on entity extraction than relation extraction. This is evident from text quote [4], which focuses on the effect of coreference propagation on entity extraction.\n  - Image2 shows the confusion matrix entries with and without CorefProp, indicating improvements in various entity categories, especially for GPE and PER.\n\n- **Relation Extraction**:\n  - RelProp has a more significant effect on relation extraction. This is supported by text quote [4], which focuses on the effect of relation propagation on relation extraction.\n  - Image3 shows the relation scores as a function of the number of entities in a sentence. It indicates that relation propagation achieves significant improvement in sentences with more entities.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, both CorefProp and RelProp have optimal performance at the second iteration (N=2 and M=2, respectively). CorefProp primarily benefits entity extraction, while RelProp significantly improves relation extraction, especially in sentences with multiple entities.

According to [2], comparison questions require quantitative or logical comparisons between two quantities or events. These questions are categorized into three types: multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop. [3] states that question compositionality is not a sufficient condition for multi-hop reasoning. Instead, future datasets must carefully consider what evidence they provide to ensure multi-hop reasoning is required.\n\nNow, let's examine the image quotes. Image 1 shows the F1 scores of different models on distractor and open-domain settings. The highest F1 score is achieved by the Cognitive Graph model in the open-domain setting with a score of 48.87. Image 2 presents the F1 scores for different settings, including distractor, open-domain with 10 paragraphs, open-domain with 500 paragraphs, and open-domain with 500 paragraphs plus a gold paragraph. The highest F1 score is achieved in the open-domain setting with 500 paragraphs plus a gold paragraph, with a score of 53.12.\n\nImage 3 provides examples of multi-hop, context-dependent, and single-hop questions along with their respective F1 scores. The highest F1 score is achieved by the single-hop question, \"Which writer was from England, Henry Roth or Robert Erskine Childers?\" with a score of 70.54.\n\nImage 4 shows the F1 scores for different training and evaluation data. The highest F1 score is achieved when the model is trained on adversarial data and evaluated on original data, with a score of 60.10.\n\nImage 5 presents examples of different question types, including multi-hop, weak distractors, redundant evidence, and non-compositional 1-hop questions, along with their respective percentages. The highest percentage is achieved by the multi-hop question, \"Ralph Hefferline was a psychology professor at a university that is located in what city?\" with a percentage of 27.\n\nIn conclusion, the F1 scores in multi-hop and single-hop question answering tasks are affected by different training and evaluation strategies. The highest F1 scores are achieved when the model is trained on adversarial data and evaluated on original data, and when the questions are single-hop. The percentages of different question types also vary, with the highest percentage achieved by multi-hop questions."}

According to the text, BERT's peak performance on the ARCT dataset reaches 77%, which is just three points below the average untrained human baseline [8]. This suggests that BERT is able to exploit spurious statistical cues in the dataset to achieve high accuracy.\n\nHowever, when the adversarial data setup is applied, the performance of BERT models drops significantly. The text states that BERT's maximum performance falls to 53% on the adversarial dataset [3]. This indicates that the adversarial dataset has successfully eliminated the cues that BERT was exploiting, providing a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension.\n\nThe image quotes also provide evidence for this conclusion. Image 4 shows the test results for BERT models on the adversarial dataset. The mean, median, and maximum accuracy for BERT are 50.4%, 50.5%, and 53.3%, respectively. This confirms that BERT's performance on the adversarial dataset is indeed random, as expected.\n\nFurthermore, the text explains that the adversarial examples are created by negating the claim and inverting the label for each data point [2]. This eliminates the problem of statistical cues over labels in ARCT, as the distribution of cues is mirrored over both labels. The ARCT authors provide a training set augmented in this way, which is used to train and evaluate the models.\n\nIn conclusion, the adversarial data setup significantly affects the performance of BERT models on the ARCT dataset. By eliminating the spurious statistical cues that BERT was exploiting, the adversarial dataset provides a more robust evaluation of machine argument comprehension. The results indicate that BERT has learned nothing about argument comprehension and that the adversarial dataset should be adopted as the standard in future work on this dataset [7]. This highlights the importance of controlling for spurious statistics in NLP research and the need for further research into the extent of this problem in NLP more generally [5]."}

The RetNRef++ model further improves by making the statistics much closer to human ones.\n\nThe image quote image3 provides a detailed comparison of word statistics among different methods:\n- **Seq2Seq**: Word count 11.7, Character count 40.5, Rare word percentage (<100) 0.4%, Rare word percentage (<1000) 5.8%\n- **RetNRef**: Word count 11.8, Character count 40.4, Rare word percentage (<100) 1.1%, Rare word percentage (<1000) 6.9%\n- **RetNRef+**: Word count 12.1, Character count 45.0, Rare word percentage (<100) 1.7%, Rare word percentage (<1000) 10.1%\n- **RetNRef++**: Word count 12.7, Character count 48.1, Rare word percentage (<100) 2.3%, Rare word percentage (<1000) 10.9%\n- **MemNet**: Word count 13.1, Character count 54.5, Rare word percentage (<100) 4.0%, Rare word percentage (<1000) 15.3%\n- **Human**: Word count 13.0, Character count 54.6, Rare word percentage (<100) 3.0%, Rare word percentage (<1000) 11.5%\n\n### Performance Metrics\nThe image quote image2 provides performance metrics for different methods:\n- **Seq2Seq (PPL)**: Engagingness 2.70, Fluency 3.50, Consistency 3.90, Persona 0.90\n- **Seq2Seq (100 epochs)**: Engagingness 2.76, Fluency 3.53, Consistency 3.84, Persona 0.85\n- **Memory Network**: Engagingness 3.66, Fluency 3.83, Consistency 3.61, Persona 0.73\n- **RetNRef**: Engagingness 2.94,"}

The foreign exchange risk was identified as the most important financial risk for the company, and it had a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, and cash flow statement [1]. The company uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on financial results [7]. Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward. Hedge accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. Management has chosen to classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items [8]. \n\nThe company's credit risk arises from the possibility that transactional counterparties may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for the Group. Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties to be DKK 15,089 million (DKK 15,663 million in 2019). In addition, Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables (less prepayments and VAT receivables) and other financial assets to be DKK 29,522 million (DKK 26,622 million in 2019) [4]. To manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, Novo Nordisk only enters into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from at least two out of the three selected ratings agencies: Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for each counterparty diversify the overall counterparty risk [5]. \n\nThe table below shows Novo Nordisk's credit exposure on cash and financial derivatives. The overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results [3]. The financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses [6]. \n\nIn 2020, the immediate 5% increase/decrease in the following currencies versus EUR and DKK would impact Novo Nordisk’s operating profit estimated by Management as outlined in the table below [10].

These assumptions include:\n- **Risk-free interest rate**: Ranges from 0.2% to 1.4% for 2020.\n- **Expected volatility**: Ranges from 22.2% to 29.5% for 2020.\n- **Expected dividend yield**: Ranges from  1.4% to 1.7% for 2020.\n- **Forfeiture rate**: 5.0% for 2020.\n- **Expected life in years**: 5.1 years for 2020.\n\n### Future Minimum Lease Payments\nThe future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, are detailed in image2.

These payments are a direct financial commitment and do not involve the same type of assumptions as those used for stock options.\n\nIn summary, the assumptions used for stock options are related to the valuation of equity instruments, while the future minimum lease payments are related to the company's leasing obligations. They serve different purposes and are not directly comparable in terms of their nature and application.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options and the future minimum lease payments for the company as of December 31, 2020, are fundamentally different in their purpose and application."}

According to the text [5], the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $4,973 million, $3,742 million, and $3,562 million, respectively. This indicates an increasing trend in the provision for income taxes from 2018 to 2020.\n\nNext, let's look at the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. The text [6] states that deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are provided in the image [image3]. \n\nFrom the image [image3], we can see that the total deferred income tax assets increased from $2,868 million in 2019 to $3,391 million in 2020.

This indicates that the company's deferred income tax liabilities are growing faster than its deferred income tax assets, which could be contributing to the increasing trend in the provision for income taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's provisions for income taxes have been increasing from 2018 to 2020, and the deferred income tax assets and liabilities have also been increasing, with the liabilities growing faster than the assets. This could be contributing to the increasing trend in the provision for income taxes."}

Let's analyze these changes and their relation to the overall compensation expenses.\n\n### Effective Tax Rate Changes\n- **2019 Effective Tax Rate**: 18.3%\n- **2020 Effective Tax Rate**: 22.5%\n\nThe effective tax rate increased by 4.2 percentage points from 2019 to 2020. This increase is primarily due to a higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits in 2020 compared to 2019 [1].\n\n### Net Discrete Tax Provisions Changes\n- **2019 Net Discrete Tax Benefits**: $475 million\n- **2020 Net Discrete Tax Benefits**: $122 million\n\nThe net discrete tax benefits decreased significantly from $475 million in 2019 to $122 million in 2020. This decrease is primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards [1].\n\n### Compensation Expenses Changes\n- **2019 Total Recognized in Compensation Expense**: $1,878 million\n- **2020 Total Recognized in Compensation Expense**: $2,119 million\n\nThe total recognized in compensation expense increased by $241 million from 2019 to 2020. This increase is primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher revenues, higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, and incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition [9].\n\n### Relationship Between Tax Rate, Tax Benefits, and Compensation Expenses\nThe increase in the effective tax rate and the decrease in net discrete tax benefits from 2019 to 2020 are related to the overall compensation expenses in the following ways:\n- The higher effective tax rate in 2020 reflects the increased earnings and lower tax benefits, which can be attributed to the higher compensation expenses.\n- The decrease in net discrete tax benefits is primarily due to the conversion of employee share-based awards, which is a component of the overall compensation expenses.\n- The increase in compensation expenses, particularly in discretionary incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans, contributes to the higher effective tax rate as these expenses are subject to taxation.\n\nIn summary, the changes in the effective tax rate and net discrete tax provisions from 2019 to 2020 are closely related to the overall compensation expenses, with higher compensation expenses leading to a higher effective tax rate and lower net discrete tax benefits."}

This indicates a significant portion of the revenue in 2020 was deferred from the previous year.\n\nFrom image2, we can see the total revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n- Fiscal Year 2020: $17,098 million\n- Fiscal Year 2019: $13,282 million\n- Fiscal Year 2018: $10,540 million\n\nThe total revenue increased from $13,282 million in 2019 to $17,098 million in 2020, which is an increase of $3,816 million or approximately 28.7%.\n\n### Unearned Revenue Change\nFrom image4, we can see the unearned revenue at the beginning and end of the fiscal years 2020 and 2019:\n- Unearned revenue, beginning of period, 2020: $8,564 million\n- Unearned revenue, beginning of period, 2019: $6,995 million\n- Unearned revenue, end of period, 2020: $10,662 million\n- Unearned revenue, end of period, 2019: $8,564 million\n\nThe unearned revenue increased from $6,995 million at the beginning of 2019 to $10,662 million at the end of 2020, which is an increase of $3,667 million or approximately 52.4%.\n\n### Implications\nThe significant increase in both total revenue and unearned revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 suggests strong business growth and customer commitment. The increase in unearned revenue indicates that the company has received payments in advance for services or products that have not yet been delivered, which can be seen as a positive sign of customer trust and future revenue potential.\n\nHowever, the high proportion of total revenue coming from unearned revenue (approximately 50%) as mentioned in text quote [1] might also indicate a reliance on deferred revenue, which could be a point of concern if the company faces challenges in delivering the promised services or products.\n\nIn conclusion, the total revenue increased by approximately "}

Let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n### Factors Contributing to the Decline\n\n1. **Interest and Other Investment Income Decline**:\n   - According to [2], interest and other investment income declined by $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020. This decline was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.\n   - The text further explains that short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020, with low rates prevailing through 2021, resulting in significantly lower interest income.\n\n2. **Dividend Income**:\n   - [10] indicates that dividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. This shows a significant increase in dividend income, but it does not offset the overall decline in net investment income.\n\n3. **Asset Allocation Changes**:\n   - Image 1 shows the asset allocation for 2021 and 2020. The total invested assets increased from $363,117 million in 2020 to $446,277 million in 2021.\n   - The allocation to cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills increased from $67,082 million in 2020 to $90,688 million in 2021. This shift towards more liquid and lower-yield assets likely contributed to the lower interest income.\n   - The allocation to equity securities increased from $269,498 million in 2020 to $334,907 million in 2021, reflecting a move towards potentially higher-yield but riskier investments.\n   - The allocation to fixed maturity securities decreased from $20,317 million in 2020 to $16,386 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in investments that typically provide stable interest income.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe decline in net investment income from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities, as well as changes in asset allocation. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, along with a decrease in fixed maturity securities, reflects a strategy to maintain liquidity and safety over yield, which resulted in lower interest income. Despite an increase in dividend income, the overall net investment income still declined.\n\nIn summary, the factors contributing to the decline in net investment income include lower interest income from"}

The increase is mainly due to the strong margin development in Diagnostics, which was driven by high demand for rapid COVID-19 antigen tests.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- ![Adjusted EBIT and margin](image2) shows that the adjusted EBIT for 2021 was €3,142 million, compared to €2,248 million in 2020. The adjusted EBIT margin for 2021 was 17.4%, up from 15.5% in 2020.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe acquisition of Varian positively influenced Siemens Healthineers' adjusted EBIT and margin in 2021. The adjusted EBIT increased by €894 million (from €2,248 million in 2020 to €3,142 million in 2021), and the adjusted EBIT margin improved from 15.5% to 17.4%.\n\n### Net Assets\n\n**Text Analysis:**\n- [4] indicates that operating net working capital increased by €720 million to €3,270 million, in particular due to the acquisition of Varian, which resulted in an increase of €592 million.\n- [7] states that net debt increased by €10,416 million to €11,901 million mainly due to finance transactions related to the financing of the acquisition of Varian.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\n- ![Operating net working capital](image4) shows that operating net working capital increased from €2,550 million in 2020 to €3,270 million in 2021.\n- ![Net debt](image7) shows that net debt (including pensions) increased from €2,513 million in 2020 to €12,809 million in 2021.\n- ![Total equity](image7)"}

The image `![{conclusion}](image1)` provides detailed information on the impact of changes in commodity prices on BHP's key financial measures for FY2021 compared to FY2020.\n\n- **Change in Sales Prices**: The image shows that the change in sales prices contributed US$16,965 million to the Underlying EBITDA for FY2021. This was due to higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG.\n\n### Analysis of Operating Cash Costs Impact\nThe image `![{conclusion}](image1)` also provides information on the impact of operating cash costs on the Underlying EBITDA.\n\n- **Operating Cash Costs**: The image indicates that operating cash costs increased by US$34 million. This increase was largely offset by strong cost performance supported by cost reduction initiatives across BHP's assets, lower technology costs, and a gain from the optimized outcome from renegotiation of canceled power contracts at Escondida and Spence.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the impacts from changes in sales prices and operating cash costs, we can conclude the following:\n\n- The significant increase in sales prices contributed positively to the Underlying EBITDA by US$16,965 million.\n- The increase in operating cash costs was relatively minor at US$34 million and was largely offset by cost-saving measures and other efficiencies.\n\nThus, the major driver of the increase in BHP's Underlying EBITDA from FY2020 to FY2021 was the substantial rise in sales prices, with the impact of increased operating cash costs being minimal and largely mitigated by cost efficiencies.\n\nIn summary, the changes in sales prices had a significantly positive impact on BHP's Underlying EBITDA, while the increase in operating cash costs had a negligible negative impact, which was effectively managed through cost-saving initiatives."}

This includes charges related to the exit from the Spanish market and other store impairments.\n   - The image quote image5 provides a breakdown of these impairment charges:\n     - Impairment charges pertaining to exit from the Spanish market: $3,360,000\n     - Other store impairment charges: $2,757,000\n     - Total impairment charges: $6,117,000\n\n2. **Determine the Profit Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders:**\n   - From the image quote image1, we can see the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for both years:\n     - 2020: $11,221,000\n     - 2019: $37,043,000\n\n3. **Calculate the Impact of Impairment Charges:**\n   - To understand the impact, we need to adjust the 2020 profit by adding back the impairment charges:\n     - Adjusted profit for 2020 (excluding impairment charges): $11,221,000 + $6,117,000 = $17,338,000\n\n4. **Compare the Adjusted Profit with 2019:**\n   - Adjusted profit for 2020: $17,338,000\n   - Profit for 2019: $37,043,000\n   - Difference: $17,338,000 - $37,043,000 = -$19,705,000\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe impairment charges significantly reduced the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders in 2020. Without these charges, the profit would have been $17,338,000, which is still lower than the $37,043,000 profit in 2019. Therefore, the impairment charges had a substantial negative impact on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders between 2019 and 2020.\n\n![Impairment charges significantly reduced the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders in 2020.](image5)"}

A decrease in the expected return on plan assets can lead to higher pension expenses, which might increase the net amount recognized.\n- **Other Retiree Benefits:**\n  - The expected return on plan assets remained the same at 8.4%.

Net income (loss) for the year: In 2020, ExxonMobil reported a net loss of $22,400 million, which significantly reduced the total equity.\n\n2. Dividends - common shares: ExxonMobil paid dividends of $14,652 million in 2020, which also reduced the total equity.\n\n3.

Let's break down the information provided in the text and image quotes.\n\n### Revenue Trends\n\n1. **Media Segment Revenue**:\n   - In 2021, the Media segment revenue increased by 20.3% to $22.8 billion. This increase includes the impact of broadcasting the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Excluding the $1.8 billion revenue from the Olympics, the revenue still increased by 11.0%.\n   - The increase in revenue is primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\n2. **Studios Segment Revenue**:\n   - The Studios segment revenue increased by 16.2% to $9.4 billion. This increase is due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue, and home entertainment and other revenue as film and television production operations returned to full capacity.\n\n3. **Theme Parks Segment Revenue**:\n   - The Theme Parks segment revenue increased by 141.2% to $5.1 billion. This significant increase reflects the operation of theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions due to COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of a new theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n\n4. **Sky Revenue**:\n   - Sky revenue increased by 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased by 3.1% due to increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue.\n\n### Customer Relationships\n\n1. **Total Customer Relationships**:\n   - The total customer relationships remained relatively stable, with 23,027 in 2021, 23,224 in 2020, and 23,280 in 2019. This indicates a slight decrease in customer relationships over the years.\n\n2. **Average Monthly Direct-to-Consumer Revenue per Customer Relationship**:\n   - The average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship increased from $54.56 in 2020 to $59.29 in 2021, representing an 8.7% increase. This increase reflects the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period due to COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets, and rate increases in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Financial Performance Impact\n\n1. **Revenue Growth**:\n   - The overall revenue growth in NBCUniversal from 2019 to 20"}

This increase was primarily due to:\n- An increase in Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility.\n- An increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition.\n- Lending commitments within the Wealth management and Institutional Securities business segments.\n- An increase in Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value gains.\n- An increase in Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) under the Advanced Approach.\n\nThe image quote image2 provides specific figures for the changes in Credit Risk RWA:\n- The balance at December 31, 2019, was $342,684 million under the Standardized Approach and $228,927 million under the Advanced Approach.\n- The balance at December 31, 2020, was $387,066 million under the Standardized Approach and $284,930 million under the Advanced Approach.\n- The total change in credit risk RWA was $44,382 million under the Standardized Approach and $56,003 million under the Advanced Approach.\n\n### Analysis of External TLAC Changes\n\nThe image quote image5 provides information on External TLAC as a percentage of RWA:\n- The regulatory minimum for External TLAC as a percentage of RWA is 18.0%.\n- The required ratio is 21.5%.\n- At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 47.7%, which is an increase from 49.9% at December 31, 2019.\n\n### Impact on Overall Capital Structure\n\nThe increase in Credit Risk RWA from 2019 to 2020 indicates that the financial institution faced higher credit risk, which required more capital to be held against these risks. This increase in RWA would have led to a higher capital requirement to maintain the required capital ratios.\n\nThe slight decrease in External TLAC as a percentage of RWA from 49.9% in 2019 to 47.7% in 2020 suggests that while the institution still holds a significant buffer above the required ratio, the buffer has decreased slightly. This could be due to the increase in RWA outpacing the growth in TLAC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe changes in Credit Risk RWA and External TLAC"}

The acquisition of Red Hat and the focus on cloud-native and AI-infused data analysis capabilities have significantly contributed to the growth in this segment. The platform-centric approach and the large ecosystem of partners have accelerated the adoption of IBM's platform, leading to higher revenues and profitability.\n\n2. **Global Business Services**:\n   - The lower external gross profit and pre-tax income for Global Business Services can be attributed to the mix shift to higher-value offerings, the yield from delivery productivity improvements, and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model. The segment has been focusing on cognitive technology and data platform services, application modernization, and next-generation enterprise applications. However, the decline in traditional application management engagements and the shift in demand for intelligent workflows have impacted the overall financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, Cloud & Cognitive Software outperformed Global Business Services in terms of external gross profit and pre-tax income in 2019.

This is supported by the data showing a 11.8% decrease in cigarette shipments and a 22.9% decrease in net revenues.\n2. **Increase in Heated Tobacco Units**: Despite the decrease in cigarette shipments, the substantial increase in heated tobacco unit shipments (50.8%) indicates a shift in consumer preferences towards smoke-free alternatives. This shift, however, did not fully offset the revenue loss from cigarette shipments.\n3. **Operating Income Increase**: The operating income saw a significant increase of 100%, which could be attributed to cost-saving measures, efficiency improvements, or other operational adjustments that improved profitability despite the revenue decline.\n4. **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities**: The slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities (2.7%) suggests that while the company's operating income improved, the overall cash flow from operations was impacted by other factors such as working capital requirements or changes in accounts receivable and payable.\n\n"}

This is evident from the decrease in investment advisory and other asset-based fees from $8,085$ million in 2020 to $9,574$ million in 2021.\n   - **Overall Revenue Impact:** The total revenue decreased from $13,213$ million in 2020 to $14,346$ million in 2021, partially due to the lower asset-based fees.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet Impact:**\n   - **Reduction in Assets:** The sale of WFAM led to a reduction in the company's total assets.

This could potentially lead to lower future tax expenses if these benefits are eventually recognized.\n\n2. **Decrease in Common Share Repurchases**:\n   - The decrease in common share repurchases from 22 million shares in 2019 to 14 million shares in 2020 indicates that the company is repurchasing fewer shares. This could be due to various reasons such as a change in the company's capital allocation strategy, a desire to conserve cash, or a belief that the shares are overvalued.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe company's gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020, while the number of common shares repurchased decreased from 22 million shares in 2019 to 14 million shares in 2020. These changes suggest that the company is potentially preparing for lower future tax expenses and is being more conservative with its share repurchase program.\n\n![Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from $1,423 million in 2019 to $1,829 million in 2020](image3)\n![Common share repurchases decreased from 22 million shares in 2019 to 14 million shares in 2020](image1)"}

The image `![Discount Rate Impact](image1)` shows the effect of a half percentage point change in the discount rate on the DBO. For 2021, a decrease in the discount rate by half a percentage point increased the DBO by €242 million, while an increase decreased it by €271 million. For 2020, the corresponding figures were €227 million and €266 million, respectively.\n   - **Compensation Increase**: The same image shows that a half percentage point increase in compensation led to a €16 million increase in the DBO for 2021, and a €15 million increase for 2020.\n   - **Pension Progression**: A half percentage point increase in pension progression increased the DBO by €158 million in 2021 and €158 million in 2020.\n\n2. **Plan Assets Changes**:\n   - **Investment Strategy**: [8] mentions that Siemens Healthineers implemented an investment strategy aligned with the DBO to mitigate liability risks.

Specifically, the recorded basis is calculated by adjusting the cost basis with the net unrealized gains or losses.\n\nFor 2022:\n- The cost basis was $534.\n- The net unrealized losses were $(5).\n- Therefore, the recorded basis is $534 - $5 = $529.\n\nFor 2021:\n- The cost basis was $375.\n- The net unrealized gains were $6.\n- Therefore, the recorded basis is $375 + $6 = $381.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe unrealized losses in 2022 reduced the recorded basis for available-for-sale securities from the cost basis of $534 to a recorded basis of $529.

This information is provided in the text quotes [1], [5], and [7], as well as in the image quotes image1, image4, and image5.\n\nFrom the text quotes:\n- In 2018, the operating profit margin was 18.3% [1].\n- In 2019, the operating profit margin was 19.0% [1].\n- In 2020, the operating profit margin was 19.4% [1].\n\nFrom the image quotes:\n- In image1, the operating profit as a percentage of sales for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are 22.9%, 23.9%, and 22.7% respectively.\n- In image4, the operating profit as a percentage of sales for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are 19.0%, 20.2%, and 19.4% respectively.\n- In image5, the operating profit as a percentage of sales for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are 17.2%, 17.3%, and 20.8% respectively.\n\nCombining the information from both text and image quotes, we can see that the operating profit as a percentage of sales increased from 18.3% in 2018 to 19.4% in 2020. This indicates that the company's profitability improved over this period.\n\nThe increase in operating profit margin can be attributed to several factors, including higher core sales volumes, lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2020 [2]. Additionally, price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2020 as compared with 2019 [3].\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by certain factors, such as incremental year-over-year amortization charges which adversely impacted SG&A as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points, primarily related to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020, as well as impairment charges related to a facility in the Diagnostics segment and trade name and other intangible assets in the Environmental & Applied solutions segment incurred in the first and third quarters of 202"}

This could be part of a strategic plan to enhance operational capacity or enter new markets.\n\n2. **Increase in Long-term Debt**:\n   - The slight increase in long-term debt by $253 million indicates that the company has taken on more long-term obligations. This could be to finance the aforementioned investments in noncurrent assets. The company might be leveraging its financial flexibility to support growth initiatives.\n\n3. **Increase in Noncurrent Liabilities (excluding debt)**:\n   - The increase in noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) by $1,622 million suggests that the company has additional long-term obligations that are not related to debt.

The change in sales prices contributed US$16,965 million to this figure, reflecting higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, partially offset by lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG.\n   - **2021**: The Underlying EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2021 was US$37,379 million. The text does not explicitly state the change in sales prices for 2021, but we can infer that the increase in EBITDA from 2020 to 2021 is largely due to higher average realized prices, as indicated by the overall increase in revenue and EBITDA.\n\n2. **Volumes Impact**:\n   - **2020**: The change in volumes contributed US$16,095 million to the Underlying EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2020. This includes record volumes at WAIO with strong performance across the supply chain, offset by natural field decline at Petroleum.\n   - **2021**: The text does not explicitly state the change in volumes for 2021, but we can infer that the increase in EBITDA from 2020 to 2021 is also due to higher volumes, as indicated by the overall increase in revenue and EBITDA.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Underlying EBITDA increased significantly from US$22,071 million in 2020 to US$37,379 million in 2021. This increase can be attributed to both higher average realized prices and higher volumes.

In 2019, the increase in retained earnings matched closely with the net cash from operating activities, indicating that most of the operating cash flow was retained within the company. In 2020, despite a higher net cash from operating activities, the increase in retained earnings was lower, suggesting that a portion of the cash flow was used for other purposes such as dividends or investments.\n\nThe total equity increased each year, reflecting the company's ability to generate and retain cash from its operations, thereby strengthening its financial position.\n\n![Cash Flow and Retained Earnings Impact on Total Equity](image3)"}

Still, a substantial majority (59%) describe their financial condition as “only fair” (47%) or “poor” (12%).\n\n- [3] Overall, Hispanics with a positive view of their current financial situation are significantly more likely than those who rate their economic circumstances as only fair or poor to say their family’s finances will improve over the next 12 months.\n\n- [4] Future financial expectations among Hispanics shaped by current personal financial situation.\n\n- [5] Latinos have become considerably more upbeat about their personal finances and optimistic about their financial future since the Great Recession, according to newly released results from a national survey of Latino adults. The survey also shows that Latinos have pulled even with the general U.S. population in their views of their personal finances and continue to outpace them on optimism about the future. However, community economic indicators show limited progress since the Great Recession.\n\n- [6] The latest results contrast sharply with those in November 2008, in the midst of the Great Recession, when only 4% of Latinos reported that they were in excellent financial shape and 19% said their financial condition was good. At the other end of the financial spectrum, 30% rated their financial condition as poor in 2008 – more than double the share expressing that view in the latest survey.\n\n- [7] Looking back to before the recession reveals another striking difference between Hispanic economic perceptions and those of the U.S. population as a whole. Latino views of their financial situation are more positive now than they were in 2004, when roughly a third (31%) rated their financial condition as excellent or good.

Specifically, those with a postgraduate degree favor the Democratic candidate over the Republican by roughly two-to-one (62% to 30%), and those with a four-year college degree favor the Democrat, 53% to 40%.

In 1994, 33% of the population identified as Independents, with a slight decline in the early 2000s, and then a gradual increase, reaching 38% by 2018.

These organizations aim to reduce traffic and parking demands by promoting transit passes, shuttles, carpooling, and car-sharing programs. [1]\n\n2. **State Cap and Trade Funds**:\n   - The State Cap and Trade funds are mentioned as a funding source, particularly in the context of the San Francisco Bay Area (e.g., RM3-renewed bridge tolls and High-Speed Rail). [10]\n\n3. **Bridge Tolls**:\n   - Renewed bridge tolls are part of the funding mechanism, as seen in the San Francisco Bay Area's RM3 program. [10]\n\n4. **Local Taxes and Development Funds**:\n   - Development funds and potentially local taxes are considered for funding large transportation projects, such as the trenching project at Charleston, Meadow, and Churchill streets, which could cost between $500M to $1B. [8]\n\n### The Bridge Depicted and Its Relation to Funding Sources\n\n![The bridge depicted is a large infrastructure project likely funded by a combination of bridge tolls and state funds.](image1)\n\n- **Bridge Tolls**:\n  - The bridge depicted in image1 is likely a significant infrastructure project. Such projects often rely on bridge tolls as a primary funding source. This aligns with the mention of renewed bridge tolls in the San Francisco Bay Area (RM3 program) as a funding method. [10]\n\n- **State and Local Funding**:\n  - Large bridge projects also typically involve state and local funding sources. The involvement of state Cap and Trade funds, as well as potential local taxes, supports the funding of such extensive infrastructure. [10]\n\nIn conclusion, funding sources for transportation projects include employer and development contributions, state Cap and Trade funds, bridge tolls, and potentially local taxes and development funds.

While roughly a quarter of those ages 18 to 29 see China as a partner, only 6% of those 50 and older say the same.\n- Text [2] states that while majorities of every age group have an unfavorable view of China, older Americans (ages 50 and older) are substantially more negative (81%) than those ages 30 to 49 (71%) or those under 30 (56%).\n- Text [4] indicates that younger and older Americans alike prefer more emphasis on human rights than economic relations when it comes to China.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- Image 3, titled \"Prioritize economic relations with China vs. Promote human rights in China,\" breaks down the preferences by age group:\n  - Ages 18-29: 21% prioritize economic relations, 76% promote human rights.\n  - Ages 30-49: 22% prioritize economic relations, 75% promote human rights.\n  - Ages 50+: 24% prioritize economic relations, 71% promote human rights.\n- This image shows that while there is a slight variation in preference, all age groups overwhelmingly favor promoting human rights over prioritizing economic relations with China.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe image and text quotes collectively indicate that across all age groups, there is a strong inclination towards promoting human rights in China over prioritizing economic relations.

About seven-in-ten second-generation Hispanics feel the same. However, by the third generation, only 44% feel very or somewhat connected to their family’s country of origin [4].\n\n2. **Marriage Patterns**:\n   - Among self-identified Hispanics, the foreign-born and the second generation are most likely to say that all or most of their neighbors share their heritage. Some 41% of both groups say this. The share that lives in largely Latino neighborhoods falls to 30% among third or higher generation self-identified Latinos [10].\n   - Some 78% of all married Hispanics have a spouse who is also Hispanic, according to the survey of self-identified Hispanics.

Half (49%) report that when they were growing up, their immigrant parents took them often to Hispanic cultural celebrations. A smaller share (35%) of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics report the same about their childhoods [5].\n\n4. **Friendship Networks**:\n   - The composition of networks of friends varies widely across immigrant generations.

In 2004, the balance of opinion was more towards the concern that anti-terrorism policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties. However, by 2015, the majority of Americans were expressing greater concern that these policies had not gone far enough to protect the country.\n\nThis shift can be seen in the data provided:\n\n- In 2004, a higher proportion of the public was worried about the government's anti-terrorism policies going too far in restricting civil liberties.\n- By 2015, the share of Americans who expressed concern that anti-terrorism policies had not gone far enough to protect the country had risen significantly.\n\nThe change in public opinion is also reflected in the responses from different political affiliations. Both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that the government's anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country, with the shift being more pronounced among Republicans.\n\nThis trend is further supported by the data showing that concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has fallen dramatically since July 2013, following Edward Snowden's leaked details about NSA surveillance programs. At that time, more expressed concern that government policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties than that they did not go far enough to protect the country. However, by 2015, the opposite was true, with twice as many now saying their greater concern is that these policies have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country.\n\nThe data also indicates that the share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points since the start of 2015, reaching its lowest point in the post-9/11 era.\n\nIn conclusion, public opinion regarding anti-terror policies has shifted significantly from 2004 to 2015, with a greater concern now being that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country.

The Homestead Act attracted settlers by offering 160 acres of land to those who built a home and cultivated the land for five years. This act, combined with the railroad's expansion, transformed Nebraska into a booming agricultural state. By 1890, Hamilton County's population peaked at 14,096, reflecting the influx of settlers seeking agricultural opportunities.\n\n![Population Growth](image3)  \n*Population growth in Hamilton County from 1870 to 2000, highlighting the peak in 1890.*\n\n#### Decline and Stability (1900-2000)\nAfter reaching its peak in 1890, Hamilton County's population began to decline. By 1930, the population had fallen to 12,159, and it continued to decrease until the mid-20th century. Several factors contributed to this decline:\n- **Mechanization of Agriculture**: The introduction of power equipment accelerated farming, leading to larger farms and fewer farm operators. This consolidation reduced the number of small farms and the associated population.\n- **Urban Migration**: Many residents moved to urban areas in search of better employment opportunities and improved living conditions.\n- **Economic Challenges**: The Great Depression and subsequent economic challenges further impacted rural populations, causing many to leave in search of work.\n\nBy the 1960s, the population stabilized around 8,700, with minor fluctuations thereafter. The 2000 census recorded a population of 9,403, indicating a slight recovery.\n\n#### Ethnic Settlement and Community Development\nHamilton County's population trends were also influenced by the settlement patterns of various ethnic groups. These groups settled in clusters across the county, forming strong religious and cultural communities. For example:\n- **Danish Settlement in Kronborg**: The Danish immigrants in the northeastern part of the county created a significant cultural and religious presence, centered around the Danish Lutheran Church.\n- **German Settlement in Stockham**: German settlers established themselves in the southwestern part of the county, contributing to the area's agricultural and social fabric.\n\n![Danish Lutheran Church](image1)  \n*The Danish Lutheran Church in Kronborg, a focal point for the Danish community in Hamilton County.*\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe population trends of Hamilton County, Nebraska from 1870 to 2000 reflect the broader historical and economic changes in the United States.

GOP leaners favor substantially expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border by roughly three-to-one (75% to 23%). Among those who affiliate with the Republican Party, the margin is nearly eight-to-one (87% to 11%).\n- **Text [4]**: By a wide margin (62% to 36%), independents oppose Trump’s signature policy proposal, an expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democratic-leaning independents overwhelmingly oppose the border wall (95% disapprove), as do Democratic identifiers (92%).\n\n### Image Evidence:\n- **Image [4]**: \n  - **Oppose vs. Favor**:\n    - Total: 58% oppose, 40% favor.\n    - Republican: 11% oppose, 87% favor.\n    - Democrat: 92% oppose, 6% favor.\n    - Independent: 62% oppose, 36% favor.\n    - Lean Rep: 23% oppose, 75% favor.\n    - Lean Dem: 95% oppose, 5% favor.\n    - No lean: 66% oppose, 30% favor.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Republicans**: Strongly favor expanding the border wall with 87% in support, as shown in both text [2] and image [4]. The margin is nearly eight-to-one.\n- **Democrats**: Strongly oppose expanding the border wall with 92% disapproving, as indicated in both text [4] and image [4].\n- **Independents**: Generally oppose the expansion, with 62% against and 36% in favor, as per image [4].\n  - **Republican-leaning Independents**: Favor expanding the border wall (75% favor, 23% oppose), though with a smaller margin than Republicans.\n  - **Democratic-leaning Independents**: Overwhelmingly oppose the expansion (95% oppose, 5% favor).\n\n### Conclusion:\nDemocrats and Republicans differ significantly in their views on expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Specifically, 6% of this age group report having lost a job and/or had their pay or hours reduced due to automation.\n- [9] provides more detailed statistics, stating that 6% of 18- to 24-year-olds have lost a job entirely due to automation, while 11% have had their pay or hours reduced for that reason. In total, 13% of Americans in this age group have been impacted by automation in one or both of these ways.\n\nNext, let's examine the image quotes for further evidence:\n\n- ![The youngest adults (ages 18 to 24) are most impacted by workforce automation in terms of job loss and reduced pay or hours](image1) shows that 11% of 18- to 24-year-olds have lost a job due to automation, and 6% have had their pay or hours reduced.

According to quote [8], a majority of the public (58%) says they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office. Just 26% say they trust Trump more than previous presidents, while 14% say their level of trust in Trump’s rhetoric is about the same as for past presidents.\n\nBreaking this down further, quote [9] reveals that among Republicans and Republican leaners, most (58%) say they trust what Trump says more than previous presidents, while 25% say they trust what he says about the same as previous presidents; 15% say they trust his rhetoric less. On the other hand, quote [7] states that almost all Democrats and Democratic leaners (94%) say they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office.\n\nThe image quotes provide additional insights into these trust levels. Image 3, which breaks down trust in Trump's statements by political affiliation in January 2019, shows that 65% of Republicans/Lean Rep believe Trump is successful, while only 3% of Democrats/Lean Dem share this belief. Conversely, 80% of Democrats/Lean Dem believe Trump is unsuccessful, compared to only 9% of Republicans/Lean Rep.\n\nImage 5 further supports this disparity, showing that 58% of Republicans/Lean Rep trust Trump's statements more than previous presidents, while a staggering 94% of Democrats/Lean Dem trust his statements less than previous presidents.\n\nIn conclusion, trust levels in Trump's statements are significantly higher among Republicans and Republican leaners compared to Democrats and Democratic leaners. This polarization is evident in both the text and image quotes, highlighting a deep divide in public opinion along partisan lines."}

Three-quarters of Republicans rate the economy as excellent or good, up from just 14% in December 2016, at the end of Obama’s presidency. By contrast, just 32% of Democrats offer positive ratings; Democrats are now less likely to rate the economy as either excellent or good than they were in December of 2016 (46%).\n- [8] Partisan views of Trump’s economic policies have become more polarized since the fall of 2017. Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that his economic policies had improved conditions in the country (up from 63% in October 2017).

According to [8], comparable majorities of both Republicans (62%) and Democrats (56%) say world problems would be worse without U.S. involvement. However, the level of concern about specific issues like Islamic extremism and climate change differs widely between Republicans and Democrats, as noted in [3] and [6].\n\nThe image quotes provide visual evidence of these differences. Image 1 shows the levels of concern about Islamic extremism around the world and in the U.S. from 2007 to 2015. The graph indicates that Republicans have consistently been more concerned about Islamic extremism than Democrats and independents, with the gap widening over time. In 2015, 83% of Republicans were concerned about Islamic extremism around the world compared to 57% of Democrats and 60% of independents.\n\nImage 2 displays the approval and disapproval rates for U.S. efforts to solve global problems from 2009 to 2015.

The data reveals that Republicans and Democrats have differing levels of approval and disapproval for each issue. For example, 37% of Republicans approve of U.S. efforts to combat the threat of terrorism, while 57% disapprove. In contrast, 45% of Democrats approve, and 40% disapprove.\n\nImage 4 shows the levels of concern about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world and in the U.S. from 2007 to 2015.

This is supported by image1, which shows that 77% of foreign-born Hispanics report that all or most of their friends are Hispanic. \n\n- **Second-generation Hispanics**: The likelihood decreases as we move to the second generation. Text [7] states that 55% of second-generation self-identified Hispanics say all or most of their friends are Hispanic. This is also reflected in image1, where the percentage drops to 55% for second-generation Hispanics.\n\n- **Third or higher generation Hispanics**: The likelihood continues to decrease for the third or higher generation Hispanics. Text [7] indicates that only 37% of third or higher generation self-identified Hispanics report that all or most of their friends are Hispanic. This is consistent with image1, which shows a drop to 37% for this group.\n\n- **Self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry**: This group is least likely to have Hispanic friends.

This indicates that streaming is a significant part of the Rock music market.\n   - Rock music is known for dominating album sales, as mentioned in text [9].\n\n2. **Pop Music Genre:**\n   - From image1, Pop music has a total activity of 36% and streams account for 58% of this activity. This suggests that while streaming is important, it is not as dominant as in the Rock genre.\n   - Pop music drives song sales, as highlighted in text [9].\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Catalog Share of Streams:**\n  - According to text [8], 70% of streams are catalog. This means that a significant portion of streams comes from older, established music rather than new releases.\n  - In the context of Rock music, the high streaming percentage (82%) suggests that a large portion of these streams are from catalog music. This aligns with the genre's dominance in album sales, indicating that fans are more likely to stream entire albums or well-known tracks.\n  - For Pop music, with a lower streaming percentage (58%), the catalog share of streams is likely lower compared to Rock. This supports the idea that Pop music is more driven by current hits and new releases, which aligns with its focus on song sales.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe catalog share of streams is higher in the Rock music genre compared to the Pop music genre. This indicates that Rock music has a stronger reliance on established, catalog music for streaming, reflecting its dominance in album sales. In contrast, Pop music, with a lower streaming percentage, is more focused on current hits and new releases, which is consistent with its emphasis on song sales. This difference in market dynamics highlights the unique consumption patterns and fan behaviors associated with each genre."}

Initially, the population grew rapidly, with a population of 130 in 1870, increasing to 8,267 by 1880, and reaching its peak at 14,096 in 1890 [1]. This surge in population led to the creation of numerous rural school districts [2].\n\nHowever, following the peak in 1890, the population began to decline. By 1900, the population had decreased to 13,330, and by 1930, it had dropped further to 12,159 [3]. The decline continued, with the population reaching a low of 8,778 in 1950 [3]. \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the population showed signs of recovery. By 1980, the population had increased to 9,301, and in 2000, it reached 9,403 [3]. Despite this recovery, the population remained below the peak levels of the late 1800s.\n\nThe population trends in Hamilton County's towns also varied. Five of the seven rural communities peaked in population between 1900 and 1940, typical of small towns in the Midwest and Great Plains [3]. However, four of these towns have demonstrated recent population gains, contrary to the notion that small towns are disappearing [3]. Aurora, in particular, peaked in population at the most recent census in 2000 with 4,225 citizens and has steadily increased since 1940 [3].\n\nIn summary, the population of Hamilton County fluctuated significantly from 1870 to 2000, with rapid growth in the late 1800s, followed by a decline in the early to mid-1900s, and a gradual recovery in the latter half of the 20th century.

According to the data, 62% of black STEM workers have experienced discrimination, compared to 13% of white STEM workers [4]. This disparity highlights the unique challenges faced by black professionals in the STEM field.\n\n#### Perceptions of Fairness\nBlacks in STEM jobs are less likely to believe that black employees are treated fairly in hiring and promotion processes. Only  43% of black STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly during recruitment, and  37% believe this is the case during promotion and advancement opportunities [3]. In contrast, a majority of white STEM workers ( 78% for hiring and  75% for advancement) believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in these processes [3].\n\n#### Workplace Discrimination\nBlacks in STEM jobs are especially likely to say they have experienced workplace discrimination because of their race or ethnicity. According to the data,  62% of black STEM workers report experiencing workplace discrimination, compared to  44% of Asians,  42% of Hispanics, and only  13% of whites in STEM jobs [4].\n\n#### Gender and Discrimination\nWomen in STEM jobs, regardless of race, also face significant challenges. Women in computer jobs are more likely to experience gender-related discrimination at work, with  74% reporting such experiences compared to  16% of men in computer jobs [image1]. Additionally,  22% of men in STEM jobs and  7% of women in STEM jobs have experienced sexual harassment at work [image2].\n\n#### Racial/Ethnic Diversity\nThe STEM field has historically struggled with racial and ethnic diversity. In 2016, only  14% of engineers were black, while  25% of computer scientists were black [image3]. This underrepresentation of blacks and other racial minorities in the STEM workforce has been an ongoing concern for at least four decades [4].\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe data clearly shows that blacks in STEM jobs face significant challenges in terms of discrimination and perceptions of fairness. These challenges are compounded by gender, with women in STEM jobs also experiencing high rates of discrimination and harassment. Addressing these issues will require a concerted effort to increase diversity and promote fair treatment in the STEM workforce."}

For higher-resource languages, the gains from pre-training are consistent, with an average increase of approximately 3 BLEU points across all three language pairs [1 ]. However, for extremely low-resource languages, the gains can be either quite small or very large. For instance, the gain for GL (Galician) is up to 11 BLEU points, indicating the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in bootstrapping models that are on the threshold of producing reasonable translations [ 1 ].\n\nThe qualitative analysis of translations from GL to EN shows that pre-training not only helps the model capture rarer vocabulary but also generates sentences that are more grammatically well-formed. This is evident from the successful translation of a person's name (\"chris\") and two multi-word phrases (\"big lawyer\" and \"patent legislation\"), highlighting the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings in providing better representations of less frequent concepts when used with low-resource languages [ 2 ].\n\nResearchers have explored various methods for using monolingual data in NMT systems, with pre-trained word embeddings showing potential improvements in BLEU scores when properly integrated into the NMT system [ 3 ].\n\nThe gain in BLEU score for all three languages demonstrates a similar trend to that found in GL, with the gain being highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective [ 4 ].\n\nIn multilingual translation systems that share an encoder or decoder between multiple languages, pre-training can improve NMT by using additional data from another language. The similarity of GL/PT is the highest, while BE/RU is the lowest [ 5 ].\n\nThe results from Table 2 clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps increase the BLEU scores to some degree. The increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings, indicating that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence [ 6 ].\n\nThe effect of pre-training on BLEU scores is further examined in a more controlled environment by down-sampling the training data for the higher-resource languages to 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 of their original sizes [ 7 ].\n\nThe comparison of the f-measure of target words, bucketed by frequency in the training corpus, shows that pre-training manages to improve the accuracy of translation for the entire vocabulary, but particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus [ 8 ].\n\nThe BLEU scores of ES, FR, and IT do generally follow the hypothesis that systems with larger headroom to improve tend to see larger increases; RU"}

This means that the initial representation of the input is the same for both models.\n\n- **Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - In the single-task model, there is only one attention mechanism that guides the decoder in generating the output sequence.\n  - In the multitask model, there are two separate attention mechanisms, one for each decoder.

While the single-task model uses a single attention mechanism to guide the decoder, the multitask model employs two separate attention mechanisms, one for each decoder.

[2]\n  - **Process**: It starts with a broad outlook by considering the top layers of the tree and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers. [9]\n  - **Selection**: The top-k most relevant root nodes are selected based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are considered at the next layer, and the process is repeated until reaching the leaf nodes. [7]\n  - **Flexibility**: The ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details remains constant regardless of the question. [1]\n\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval**:\n  - **Approach**: The collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones. [2]\n  - **Structure**: Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. [3]\n  - **Flexibility**: It offers greater flexibility by searching through all the nodes simultaneously, retrieving information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question. [1]\n\n### Image Analysis\n- **Image 2**: \n  - **A. Tree Traversalal Retrieval**:\n    - Depicts a hierarchical tree structure where nodes are selected layer-by-layer.\n    - The process involves encoding the query, selecting nodes at each layer, and concatenating the text from all selected nodes to form the retrieved context.\n  - **B. Collapsed Tree Retrieval**:\n    - Shows a flattened tree structure where all nodes are considered simultaneously.\n    - The process involves encoding the query and retrieving the most relevant nodes from the collapsed tree structure.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe main difference between Tree Traversal Retrieval and Collapsed Tree Retrieval lies in their approach to navigating the tree structure:\n- **Tree Traversal Retrieval** uses a layer-by-layer approach, progressively focusing on finer details and maintaining a constant ratio of thematic information to granular details.\n- **Collapsed Tree Retrieval** flattens the tree structure, allowing simultaneous evaluation of all nodes, thus providing greater flexibility in retrieving information at the correct level of granularity for a given query.\n\nBy analyzing both the text and image quotes, we can conclude that the collapsed tree approach offers a simpler and more flexible way to search for relevant information compared to the tree traversal method."}

Let's delve into the details using the provided text and image quotes.\n\n### Iterative Retrieval Process\nThe Iterative retrieval process is designed to provide more context information by repeatedly refining the search query based on the results obtained from previous searches. This process involves a feedback loop that gradually converges on the most pertinent information. The iterative nature allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with the search outcomes [1 ].\n\n![Iterative Retrieval Process](image5)  \nThe image illustrates the iterative process, where the system iterates multiple times to refine the query and generate a more accurate response. The process involves:\n1. **Query**: The initial user query.\n2. **Retrieve**: Retrieval of relevant documents based on the query.\n3. **Generate**: Generation of a response based on the retrieved documents.\n4. **Judge**: Evaluation of the generated response.\n5. **Iterate N Times**: The process repeats for a maximum number of times or until a threshold is met.\n\n### Recursive Retrieval Process\nThe Recursive retrieval process breaks down complex problems step by step. It involves a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process [ 5 ].\n\n![Recursive Retrieval Process](image5)  \nThe image shows the recursive process, where the system decomposes the query into smaller parts and recursively retrieves and generates responses. The process involves:\n1. **Query**: The initial user query.\n2. **Retrieve**: Retrieval of relevant documents based on the query.\n3. **Generate**: Generation of a response based on the retrieved documents.\n4. **Judge**: Evaluation of the generated response.\n5. **Query Transformation / Decomposition**: The query is transformed or decomposed into smaller parts for further retrieval.\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval Process\nThe Adaptive retrieval process offers flexible and active control of retrieval and generation. It enables the system to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced. This process can involve fine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning the generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in collaborative fine-tuning [ 2 ].\n\n![Adaptive Retrieval Process](image5)  \nThe image depicts the adaptive process, where the system dynamically decides when and how to retrieve information based on the query and the generated response. The process involves:\n1. **Query**: The initial user query.\n2. **Judge**: Evaluation of the need for retrieval.\n3. **Retrieve On Demand**:"}

Adversarial training helps the model recover much of its original accuracy when evaluated on adversarial distractors. Specifically, the F1 score improves from 46.84 to 60.10 when the model is re-trained on adversarial distractors. However, the performance on original distractors slightly decreases from 67.08 to 59.12. Filtering the adversarial distractors by entity type further degrades the performance, indicating that the model still struggles with certain types of distractors.\n\nIn summary, adversarial training enhances the model's robustness against adversarial distractors but may slightly reduce its performance on original distractors. This suggests that while adversarial training is beneficial, it is not a complete solution and further improvements are needed."}

This results in improvements as shown in Figures 5 and 6.\n- **[2]**: DSGAN is introduced as an adversarial learning framework to learn a sentence-level true-positive generator. It significantly improves the performance of distant supervision relation extraction compared to state-of-the-art systems.\n- **[4]**: The generator and discriminator are modeled as simple CNNs. The generator helps in filtering the dataset, redistributing false positive instances into the negative set.\n- **[5]**: DSGAN is a robust adversarial learning strategy that improves the performance of distant supervision relation extraction.\n- **[6]**: The DSGAN generator yields the best performance among different strategies for generating positive datasets.\n- **[7]**: The generator's improvement in distant supervision relation extraction provides an intuitive evaluation of its effectiveness.\n- **[8]**: The discriminator's performance declines as the generator becomes more robust, indicating the effectiveness of DSGAN.\n- **[10]**: DSGAN improves the performance of various deep-neural-network-based models on the New York Times dataset.\n\n### Image Analysis\nThe images provide visual evidence of the performance improvements:\n- **![{DSGAN improves precision and recall}](image1)**: This graph shows the precision-recall curves for different models with and without DSGAN.

According to the text [4], without repetition control, the model set to z=10 should theoretically produce 100% questions. However, with the introduction of repetition control, the question-asking rate drops to 79.67%. This reduction is attributed to the weighted decoding feature `extrep bigram`, which discourages the repetition of bigrams that have appeared in previous utterances. This feature prevents the model from producing common question-asking bigrams such as \"do you\" and \"what is\". To mitigate this issue, an extra setting `z=10 (boost)` is introduced, where the `extrep bigram` feature is not used during weighted decoding but is applied to rerank the candidates after beam search.

Let's break down the process step by step.\n\n### Evidence Selection\n1. **Text Analysis**:\n   - [1] describes the initial process of the KGLM, where the model uses the entity \"Super Mario Land\" to render tokens and add it to the local knowledge graph.\n   - [2] provides an example annotation corresponding to the instance in Figure 1, explaining how entities are linked and how the model decides which entities are new or related.\n   - [4] illustrates the process of generating a token in the middle of a sentence, showing how the model selects entities and relations.\n   - [8] explains the initial entity annotations, where human-provided links and neural entity linkers are used to identify entities within the text.\n\n2. **Image Analysis**:\n   - ![Entities and their relationships](image1) shows a knowledge graph with entities like \"Super Mario Land,\" \"Nintendo,\" and \"Game Boy,\" along with their relationships such as \"PUBLISHER,\" \"PLATFORM,\" and \"GENRE.\"\n   - ![Example Annotation](image2) provides a detailed table of tokens, their mention types, entities mentioned, relations, and parent entities.\n\n### Answer Construction\nLet's construct the answer using the selected evidence.\n\n#### Sequential Format\n1. **Initial Entity Annotation**:\n   - The process begins with identifying an initial set of entity mentions within the text. Human-provided links between Wikipedia articles are used to associate spans of text with their corresponding Wikidata entities. Additionally, neural entity linkers and coreference models are employed to identify additional links and cover pronouns, nominals, and other tokens missed by the linker. [8]\n\n2. **Example Annotation**:\n   - An example annotation is provided in Table 1, corresponding to the instance in Figure 1. The table shows how each token is annotated with its mention type, entity mentioned, relation, and parent entity. For instance, the token \"Super Mario Land\" is annotated as a new entity with no parent entity. [2]\n\n3. **Entity Relationships**:\n   - The knowledge graph in Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between entities. For example, \"Super Mario Land\" is linked to \"Nintendo\" as the publisher, \"Game Boy\" as the platform, and \"platform game\" as the genre. [1]\n\n4. **Token Generation**:\n   - The model dynamically decides which facts to incorporate from the knowledge graph, guided by the discourse. For example, when generating the token \"Nintendo,\" the model selects \"Super Mario Land\" as the parent entity and follows the \"PUBLISHER\" relation to render \"Nintendo\" as the entity to render.

The dataset spans seven domains, but only five are used in experiments due to the limited number of dialogues in the other two domains (hospital and police).\n- **[6]**: Table 1 in the text provides the dataset information, including the number of dialogues for training, validation, and test sets.\n\n### Image Analysis\nThe images provide visual representations of the data distribution and slot correlations:\n- **![{Data distribution across different slots}](image3)**: This table lists the slots for each domain (Hotel, Train, Attraction, Restaurant, Taxi) and the number of dialogues for training, validation, and test sets. It shows that the Hotel domain has the most dialogues for training (3381), followed by Restaurant (3813), Train (3103), Attraction (2717), and Taxi (1654).\n- **![{Slot correlation heatmap}](image2)**: This heatmap shows the correlation between different slots. Darker squares indicate higher correlation. For example, slots like \"destination\" and \"departure\" are highly correlated, as are \"price\" and \"pricerange\".\n- **![{Slot distribution bar charts}](image5)**: These bar charts show the distribution of data across different slots for the Hotel and Restaurant domains. For instance, in the Hotel domain, slots like \"book people\" and \"area\" have a higher distribution, while in the Restaurant domain, \"book day\" and \"pricerange\" are more prominent.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe data in the MultiWOZ dataset is distributed across various slots with significant variations. The Hotel domain has the highest number of dialogues for training, and certain slots like \"book people\" and \"area\" in the Hotel domain, and \"book day\" and \"pricerange\" in the Restaurant domain, have a higher distribution of data. The correlation heatmap further indicates that some slots are highly correlated, suggesting that they often appear together in dialogues.\n\nIn summary, the MultiWOZ dataset has a rich and varied distribution of data across different slots, with some slots being more prominent in certain domains. This distribution is crucial for training effective dialogue state tracking models."}

This involves identifying key entities, facts, and rules present in the problem statement.\n\n- **Text Example**: In the Problem Formulation stage, an LLM translates the problem and the goal into a task-specific symbolic language [1 ].\n- **Image Example**: ![Problem Formulation involves translating natural language into symbolic language](image5)\n\n### Symbolic Reasoning\nNext, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation. This stage leverages the logical faithfulness and transparency offered by symbolic solvers.\n\n- **Text Example**: During the symbolic reasoning stage, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the symbolic formulation [ 2 ].\n- **Image Example**: ![Symbolic Reasoning uses a deterministic symbolic solver](image5)\n\n### Result Interpretation\nFinally, a result interpreter explains the output and maps it to the correct answer. This stage translates the symbolic-represented answer back to natural language.\n\n- **Text Example**: An LLM- or rule-based Result Interpreter is responsible for translating the answer back to natural language [ 1 ].\n- **Image Example**: ![Result Interpretation translates the symbolic answer back to natural language](image5)\n\n### Summary\nBy integrating LLMs with symbolic solvers, LOGIC-LM can exploit the robust natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to precisely represent the problem using symbolic representations, while also taking advantage of the logical faithfulness and transparency offered by symbolic solvers. This approach improves the accuracy of the symbolic parsing and enhances logical problem-solving.\n\n- **Text Example**: Our findings suggest that LOGIC-LM, by combining LLMs with symbolic logic, offers a promising avenue for faithful logical reasoning [ 6 ].\n- **Image Example**: ![LOGIC-LM framework integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers](image5)\n\nIn conclusion, the LOGIC-LM model effectively solves logical reasoning problems by leveraging a combination of natural language processing and symbolic reasoning, ensuring both accuracy and faithfulness in the problem-solving process."}

The improvements are particularly noticeable in female-specific test sets, as hypothesized. This suggests that incorporating gender tags enhances the system's ability to handle gender-specific nuances in translation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe EN-TAG system shows significant improvements over the EN system for French across different test sets, with especially notable enhancements in female-specific test sets.

The CAUSALCoT approach significantly boosts the performance of GPT-4, achieving an accuracy of $70.40\\%$ compared to the vanilla GPT-4's $62.03\\%$. This represents an improvement of 8.37 points [6].\n\nTo further understand the impact, we can analyze the performance on the anti-common sensical subset of the dataset. The original GPT-4 model performs poorly on this subset, with a score that is 1.8 points lower than on the common sensical subset. However, with the CAUSALCoT approach, there is a substantial improvement of 9.65 points, highlighting the strength of CAUSALCoT on unseen data [3].\n\nIn addition to accuracy, the CAUSALCoT approach also enhances the reasoning ability across all levels, including anti-common sensical and nonsensical data, as shown in Table 6 [4]. This indicates that the approach is particularly beneficial for handling unseen data.\n\nThe performance of different steps of CAUSALCoT is detailed in Table 3 [9]. The model excels at Step ①, achieving high F1 scores for predicting both the nodes and the edges correctly. However, it struggles with Steps ③ and ⑤, which require careful and correct application of causal inference. This reveals a notable weakness of current LLMs in performing formal causal reasoning, an important direction for future work.\n\nTo better understand the reasoning abilities of LLMs, the ROSCOE suite of evaluation metrics was employed on step-by-step text reasoning [10]. The results, shown in Table 8 and Figure 9, provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's output, focusing on aspects such as semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality.\n\nIn summary, the CAUSALCoT approach significantly improves the performance of GPT-4 across various evaluation metrics, particularly on unseen data and in handling anti-common sensical and nonsensical data. However, there is still room for improvement in formal causal reasoning, as indicated by the model's struggles with certain steps in the reasoning process."}

It shows how these embeddings are processed through different layers to inform the CRF layer.\n\n### Answer Construction\n\nThe model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs for several reasons:\n\n1. **Capturing Subword Information**:\n   - **[1]**: The hierarchical CRF model includes a character-level neural network to capture subword information, such as morphological variations and capitalization patterns. This is crucial for understanding the nuances of words, especially in languages with complex morphologies.\n\n2. **Improved Representation**:\n   - **[5]**: The model concatenates character representations with word embeddings to produce a more comprehensive word representation. This combined representation helps the model understand the context better and improves the accuracy of named-entity recognition (NER).\n\n3. **Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**:\n   - **[7]**: Character-level features are particularly useful for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Since OOV words do not have pre-trained word embeddings, the model can still infer their meaning by analyzing their character composition.\n\n4. **Enhanced Lexical Mapping**:\n   - **[7]**: In cross-lingual applications, character-level features help in aligning word embeddings across different languages. This is especially beneficial for low-resource languages where parallel corpora may be limited.\n\n### Quote Citation\n\n- **Character-Level Embeddings**:\n  - As noted in [1], character-level neural networks are essential for capturing subword information.\n  - In [5], the model architecture demonstrates how character representations are concatenated with word embeddings to enhance word-level representations.\n  - [7] highlights the importance of character-level features for improved tagging accuracy and handling OOV words.\n\n- **Image Analysis**:\n  - `![The architecture diagram showing the integration of word and character embeddings](image5)`: This image clearly illustrates how both word-level and character-level embeddings are processed through various layers to inform the CRF layer, ensuring a richer and more accurate representation of words.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the model uses both word-level and character-level embeddings as inputs to capture subword information, improve word representations, handle out-of-vocabulary words"}

As shown in the diagram ![Pre-processing](image2), the process involves cropping and blurring techniques applied to the image regions based on bounding box coordinates. This approach helps in isolating the objects of interest, which are typically smaller and have varied positions in object detection datasets. By employing these techniques, the model's attention is directed towards the objects that need to be detected, thereby improving the accuracy of the zero-shot recognition task.\n\nThe cropping technique is used to extract the relevant regions of the image based on the proposal bounding box coordinates, as indicated in the diagram. This allows the model to focus on the specific areas where the objects are located, rather than processing the entire image. The blurring technique is then applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This helps in reducing the noise and distractions in the image, making it easier for the model to identify and classify the objects accurately.\n\nIn summary, the pre-processing step in the zero-shot recognition system is designed to enhance the model's ability to detect and classify objects by focusing on the relevant regions of the image and reducing noise and distractions. This is achieved through the use of cropping and blurring techniques, which are specifically tailored to address the challenges posed by object detection datasets.

This laid the groundwork for future research in this area.\n\n2. **2011**:\n   - The release of the Google Books Ngrams corpus, which played an important role in the development of the field and spurred work on 'culturomics' (studying human culture through digital media) [9]. This dataset allowed researchers to detect differences in word usage and meaning across different time spans.\n\n3. **2012**:\n   - The use of the Google Ngrams corpus for detecting differences in word usage and meaning across 50-year time spans [9]. This marked a significant step in applying computational methods to trace semantic shifts.\n\n4. **2013**:\n   - The pioneering work by Jurgens and Stevens (2009) was effectively a Word:Semantic Vector:Time tensor, which paved the way for quantitatively comparing not only words with regard to their meaning but also different stages in the development of word meaning over time [4].\n\n5. **2014**:\n   - The seminal work by Kim et al. (2014) employing prediction-based word embedding models to trace diachronic semantic shifts [7]. This was a significant advancement as it used incremental updates and Continuous Skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS).\n\n6. **2015**:\n   - Kulkarni et al. (2015) used Amazon Movie Reviews and Twitter data to detect semantic shifts, showing that computational methods can be robustly applied to time spans less than a decade [10].\n   - Zhang et al. (2015) used the New-York Times Annotated Corpus to trace subtle semantic shifts [10].\n\n7. **2016**:\n   - Hamilton et al. (2016a) showed the superiority of SGNS over explicit PPMI-based distributional models in semantic shifts analysis [7].\n   - Yao et al. (2018) crawled the NYT web site to get 27 yearly subcorpora (from 1990 to 2016) [10].\n\n8. **2017**:\n   - The application of K-means clustering to SGNS embeddings trained for evenly sized yearly samples for the period 1850–2009, which found that the likelihood for semantic shift correlates with the degree of prototypicality [8].\n\n![Timeline of milestones in tracing diachronic semantic shifts from 2010 to"}

This includes crafting compelling messages and understanding the best times to reach out.\n\n2. **Building a Talent Pipeline: Talent Pipeline and Pipelining**\n   - Candidates need to know how to build and manage a talent pipeline. This involves identifying potential candidates and keeping them engaged over time.\n\n3. **Posting Jobs: Jobs**\n   - Knowing how to post jobs effectively is essential. This includes understanding how to write job descriptions, set job requirements, and manage job postings.\n\n4. **Identifying Talent: Search**\n   - Candidates must be proficient in using LinkedIn's search features to find potential candidates. This includes understanding how to use Boolean search strings.\n\n5. **Maximizing Efficiency: Tools for Organization and Collaboration**\n   - Efficient use of tools for organization and collaboration is important. This includes understanding how to use features like saved searches, tags, and sources.\n\n### Understanding Boolean Search Results Through a Venn Diagram\n\nThe Venn diagram provided in the images helps candidates understand how to construct and interpret Boolean search strings. Let's look at the Venn diagram in image2:\n\n- **Engineering AND Java NOT Manager**\n  - This search string is designed to find candidates who have experience in both Engineering and Java but are not managers.\n  - In the Venn diagram, the intersection of the Engineering and Java circles (area E) represents candidates who meet both criteria.\n  - The NOT Manager part of the search string would exclude any candidates who are managers, which would be represented by removing any overlap with the Manager circle (if it were included in the diagram).\n\n### Example of Boolean Search Results\n\nLet's consider a scenario where a recruiter is looking for candidates who are proficient in both Engineering and Java but are not managers.

For instance, the collaboration between NAMRU-3 and the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research (LIBR) focuses on disease vector surveillance and the detection of vector-borne viral pathogens, such as malaria. This is crucial for reducing the incidence of malaria among U.S. troops stationed in regions where the disease is prevalent. As highlighted in text [1], the spraying of insecticides in base housing areas, combined with surveillance and geospatial mapping, has successfully reduced the risk of malaria infections among U.S. troops. \n\n![Malaria Surveillance](image1)\n\nMoreover, NAMRU's research efforts extend to training local and military personnel in disease prevention and control. Text [6] and [10] emphasize the mission of the Rickettsial Diseases Research Program, which involves training individuals in regions endemic to rickettsial diseases. This training not only benefits military personnel but also enhances the capabilities of local health workers, contributing to the overall health and safety of the community.\n\n![Training Session](image3)\n\nAdditionally, NAMRU units are involved in capacity building in countries recovering from conflicts or natural disasters. For example, NAMRU-3 has played an important role in medical research capacity building in Liberia, a country that has been devastated by a 14-year civil war. This support helps the country to independently expand its vector-borne disease surveillance and detection capabilities, thus benefiting both the Liberian Armed Forces and the entire population of Liberia.\n\n![Capacity Building in Liberia](image6)\n\nFurthermore, NAMRU's collaboration with international partners, such as the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center/Global Emerging Infections System (AFHSC-GEIS), enables the sharing of knowledge and resources. This collaboration is crucial for addressing global health challenges and ensuring that both military and civilian populations are protected from emerging infectious diseases.\n\n![International Collaboration](image4)\n\nIn summary, the activities of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Units support both military personnel and local communities by conducting essential medical research, providing training and capacity building, and fostering international collaborations. These efforts contribute to the health and safety of individuals in various regions, highlighting the multifaceted role of NAMRU in global health security."}

According to the text, the PCOF tool generates tables that show the occurrence probabilities of disease and injury types typically sustained in a contingency by a population at risk. These tables exist within casualty categories of wounded in action, nonbattle injuries, disease, and outpatient visits for a given combat or noncombat scenario throughout the range of military operations (ROMO) [10].\n\nThe PCOF tool provides an effective, accurate, and repeatable method of generating PCOF estimates using standardized and documented means of adjusting baseline distributions [9]. This is a significant advancement because, until now, the military medical planning community lacked a functional and accurate means of estimating PCOFs, which are necessary to develop the patient streams used in healthcare simulations [10].\n\nUsing an accredited PCOF tool, planners can employ baselined, mission-centric PCOF data and tailor it to more precisely fit the anticipated mission. This will help inform decision makers on the types of patient conditions to expect, enhancing the planning and execution of medical missions [6].\n\nIn summary, the PCOF tool plays a crucial role in military operations by providing accurate and repeatable estimates of patient conditions, which are essential for effective medical mission planning and execution. ![The PCOF tool helps in estimating patient conditions](image2)"}

Let's explore these in detail:\n\n#### 1. Alignment of Homologous Chromosomes\n\n- **Homologous Chromosomes Pair Up**: During Metaphase I, homologous chromosomes pair up at the metaphase plate. This pairing is crucial for the subsequent separation of chromosomes.\n  - ![Alignment of homologous chromosomes](image2)\n  - **Text Reference**: [1]\n\n#### 2. Formation of the Metaphase Plate\n\n- **Metaphase Plate Formation**: The chromosomes align at the center of the cell along an imaginary line called the metaphase plate. This alignment ensures that each daughter cell receives an equal number of chromosomes.\n  - ![Metaphase plate](image5)\n\n#### 3. Attachment of Microtubules\n\n- **Microtubules Attach to Kinetochores**: The spindle fibers, composed of microtubules, attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes. This attachment is vital for the movement of chromosomes during anaphase.\n  - ![Microtubules attached to kinetochores](image5)\n  - **Text Reference**: [7]\n\n#### 4. Sites of Crossing Over\n\n- **Crossing Over**: During prophase I, non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material by crossing over. These sites of crossing over are visible during metaphase I and contribute to genetic diversity.\n  - ![Sites of crossing over](image5)\n  - **Text Reference**: [1]\n\n#### 5. Centrosomes and Spindle Formation\n\n- **Centrosomes and Spindle Formation**: Centrosomes, which contain centriole pairs, migrate to opposite poles of the cell. They play a crucial role in the formation of the mitotic spindle.\n  - ![Centrosomes with centriole pairs](image5)\n  - **Text Reference**: [5]\n\n#### 6. Sister Chromatids Remain Attached\n\n- **Sister Chromatids Remain Attached**: During metaphase I, sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere. This attachment ensures that they will be separated during anaphase I.\n  - ![Sister chromatids remain attached](image5)\n  - **Text Reference**: [10]\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Metaphase I of meiosis is characterized by the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, and the visibility of crossing over sites. These processes ensure the proper separation of chromosomes, contributing to genetic diversity and the formation of haploid daughter cells.\n\n- **Final Answer**: Metaphase I of"}

This process is known as decondensation [6].\n   - **Nuclear Envelope Reforms**: The nuclear envelope starts to reassemble around each set of chromosomes, creating two distinct nuclei [5].\n   - **Nucleolus Reappears**: The nucleolus, which had disappeared during mitosis, starts to reform within each new nucleus.\n\n2. **Cytokinesis**:\n   - **Cleavage Furrow Formation**: In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms at the cell equator, creating an indentation that will eventually divide the cell into two daughter cells [2].\n   - **Cell Membrane Inward Growth**: The plasma membrane grows inward, pinching the cell in two [2].\n   - **Cytoskeleton Rearrangement**: The cytoskeleton, particularly microfilaments, plays a crucial role in this process by contracting and pulling the membrane inward.\n\n3. **Final Separation**:\n   - **Complete Cell Division**: Eventually, the cleavage furrow deepens until the cell is completely divided into two daughter cells, each with its own nucleus and a full set of chromosomes.\n\n![Cleavage Furrow](image5)  \nThis image shows the cleavage furrow forming during cytokinesis, illustrating the inward growth of the cell membrane.\n\nIn summary, during telophase and cytokinesis, the chromosomes uncoil, the nuclear envelope reforms, the nucleolus reappears, and the cell divides into two daughter cells through the formation of a cleavage furrow and the inward growth of the cell membrane."}

Mendel conducted experiments with pea plants, focusing on traits such as flower color. He observed that when he crossed plants with different traits, the offspring displayed predictable patterns of inheritance.\n\nLet's break down the process and the evidence provided by the quotes and images.\n\n### Mendel's Experiments:\n\n1. **Parental Generation (P Generation):**\n   - Mendel started with true-breeding plants, meaning they always produce offspring with the same trait when self-pollinated.\n   - He crossed purple-flowered plants (dominant trait) with white-flowered plants (recessive trait).

These maps provide a clear visual representation of the data, allowing for easy comparison between the two.\n\nThe heat map for volcanoes globally, as shown in ![Volcanoes of the world](image3), uses a color gradient to indicate the density of volcanoes in different regions. Areas with a higher concentration of volcanoes are represented by warmer colors, such as red, while areas with fewer volcanoes are represented by cooler colors, such as blue. This type of map is particularly useful for identifying patterns and trends in the data, such as the high concentration of volcanoes in the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nThe point distribution map for public libraries in the Netherlands, as shown in ![Public libraries in The Netherlands](image2), uses individual points to represent the location of each library. This type of map is useful for showing the exact location of each library and for identifying any gaps or clusters in the distribution of libraries. The map also includes labels for each library, making it easy to identify specific locations.\n\nIn terms of data presentation on maps, the heat map and point distribution map serve different purposes. The heat map is better suited for showing patterns and trends in the data, while the point distribution map is better suited for showing the exact location of individual data points. Both types of maps can be useful for understanding the geographical distribution of different phenomena, and the choice of which type of map to use will depend on the specific data being analyzed and the questions being asked.\n\nIn conclusion, the heat map and point distribution map are both effective tools for visually representing geographical data.

[1]\n\n2. **Lack of Resources**:\n   - A significant 36% of respondents in image1 highlighted a lack of resources as a barrier, indicating that financial and human resources are crucial for implementing integrated customer management. [1]\n\n3. **Technical Infrastructure**:\n   - 28% of respondents in image1 mentioned the absence of the necessary technical infrastructure. This suggests that many organizations lack the technological tools required to support an integrated approach. [1]\n\n4. **Measurement Challenges**:\n   - 27% of respondents in image1 indicated difficulties in measuring the influence of activities on customer behavior. This aligns with the text [6] which mentions the lack of a 360-degree view and the focus on quantitative metrics over qualitative ones. [6]\n\n5. **Focus on Product/Brand vs. Customer**:\n   - As shown in image2, 35% of organizations are product/brand focused, while 44% are customer-focused. A customer-focused approach is essential for integrated customer management, indicating a need to shift focus from products to customers. [2]\n\n6. **Complexity in Attribution**:\n   - Image5 shows that 52% of organizations attribute activity to the most recent touchpoint, which is a simplistic approach and doesn't capture the full customer journey. This highlights the complexity in accurately attributing marketing efforts to customer actions. [4]\n\n7. **Cultural and Management Barriers**:\n   - Text [2] emphasizes that adoption barriers relate more to management and culture rather than data and technology. This suggests that organizational culture and management practices play a critical role in the successful adoption of integrated customer management. [2]\n\n8. **Insufficient Analytics Utilization**:\n   - Text [7] and image4 (47% usage) indicate that many organizations do not effectively use analytics to inform their actions and support decision-making. This underutilization of data analytics can hinder the adoption of integrated approaches. [7]\n\nIn summary, the major barriers preventing the adoption of an integrated customer management approach are silos and misaligned goals, lack of resources, insufficient technical infrastructure, measurement challenges, a focus on product/brand over customer, complexity in attribution, cultural and management barriers, and insufficient utilization of analytics."}

In 2005, a larger portion of time was spent with family and friends (35%), while in 2010, this percentage decreased to 21%. Conversely, the time spent on net surfing increased from 3% in 2005 to 10% in 2010. This shift indicates a growing trend towards individual activities and digital engagement.\n\nRegarding the trends in banana exports, the image does not provide direct data on this topic. However, if we consider the Gestalt principle of similarity (objects that are similar in shape and color are perceived as part of a group [9]), we can infer that the increased focus on individual activities might parallel a trend in increased consumption of bananas, as they are often associated with personal health and fitness routines. The data on banana exports from the image would need to be analyzed for a direct correlation, but the visual representation suggests a possible connection between lifestyle changes and consumption patterns.\n\nTo answer the question directly: The distribution of activities shows a decrease in social activities and an increase in individual, digital activities from 2005 to 2010. This trend might relate to changes in banana exports if there is a similar shift in consumer behavior towards health-conscious and individual-focused lifestyles."}

The symbol at the bottom left corner in the waveform diagram is labeled as \"EA/Vpp\". This symbol represents the voltage level applied to the EA/Vpp pin during the programming and verification processes.\n\nNext, we refer to the waveform diagram to find the voltage levels associated with the EA/Vpp pin. According to the diagram, the EA/Vpp pin is pulsed to a high voltage level during programming. The exact voltage levels are specified in the diagram.\n\nFrom the waveform diagram, we can observe that the EA/Vpp pin is pulsed to a high voltage level of 21V ± 0.5V during the programming process. This means that the voltage level can range from 20.5V to 21.5V.\n\nTherefore, the minimum voltage of the symbol at the bottom left corner in the waveform diagram is 20.5V.\n\nIn float format, the answer is: 20.5"}

Key events include:\n\n- **1957**: The Soviet Union launches Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite.\n- **1961**: Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human in space.\n- **1969**: NASA's Apollo 11 mission lands the first humans on the Moon.\n\n### Correlation Analysis\n\nTo understand how these events relate to the trend in healthcare spending:\n\n1. **Technological Advancements and Economic Impact**:\n   - The Space Race led to significant technological advancements and innovations. These innovations often had spin-off benefits in various sectors, including healthcare.\n   - The economic boost from technological advancements could have indirectly supported increased healthcare spending.\n\n2. **Government Spending and Priorities**:\n   - During the Space Race, there was a substantial allocation of government funds toward space exploration. This could have influenced overall government spending priorities, potentially affecting healthcare budgets.\n   - However, the long-term economic growth spurred by technological innovations might have enabled higher healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe increase in U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2007 can be partially attributed to broader economic growth and technological advancements driven by the Space Race. While direct causation is complex, the period of intense competition and innovation likely contributed to an environment where increased healthcare spending became feasible and necessary.\n\nIn summary, the trend in healthcare spending reflects broader economic and technological developments, with the Space Race playing a role in fostering an environment conducive to increased investment in healthcare."}

It includes components such as the fuel pump, fuel filter, and fuel pressure regulator.\n\n2. **Fuel Pump**\n   - The fuel pump draws fuel from the tank and forces it into the regulator (as mentioned in [1]). This is a critical component that ensures a continuous supply of fuel to the engine.\n\n3. **Fuel Filter**\n   - The fuel filter is part of the fuel supply system and is designed to remove impurities from the fuel. This ensures that the fuel delivered to the engine is clean and free from contaminants.\n\n4. **Fuel Pressure Regulator**\n   - The fuel pressure regulator maintains the correct fuel pressure in the fuel rail. It ensures that the fuel injectors receive fuel at the appropriate pressure for efficient combustion.\n\n5. **Fuel Rail**\n   - The fuel rail is a common rail that supplies multiple fuel injectors with high-pressure fuel. This is highlighted in [2], where it is mentioned that all fuel injectors are supplied by a common fuel rail.\n\n6. **Fuel Injectors**\n   - Fuel injectors are connected to the fuel rail and are responsible for spraying fuel into the engine's combustion chambers. They are controlled by the ECU to ensure the correct amount of fuel is delivered at the right time.\n\n7. **Return Line**\n   - The return line is part of the fuel supply system and allows excess fuel to return to the tank. This helps in maintaining the correct fuel pressure and prevents over-pressurization of the fuel system.\n\n### Diagram Analysis\n\n- **Image 2: Fuel System Diagram**\n  - ![Fuel System Diagram](image2)\n  - This diagram shows the flow of fuel from the fuel supply to the fuel rail and then to the injectors. It also illustrates the return line that directs excess fuel back to the tank.\n\n- **Image 5: Fuel System Components**\n  - ![Fuel System Components](image5)\n  - This diagram provides a detailed view of the fuel supply system, including the high-pressure pump, pressure limiting valve, and rail pressure sensor.

When enjoyment drops, we should switch to another choice.\"\n   - This quote highlights that in standard consumption, as we consume more of the same item, the additional satisfaction (utility) we get from each additional unit decreases. This is known as diminishing marginal utility.\n\n2. **Image Quotes [4] and [5]:**\n   - **Image [4]:** \n     - **Hot Dogs Consumed:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n     - **Utility from Each Hot Dog:** +10, +4, 0, -1, -4, -10\n   - **Image [5]:** \n     - **Hot Dogs Consumed:** 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 64, 65, 66\n     - **Utility from Each Hot Dog:** +6, +2, 0, -2, ..., -40, -45, -50\n   - Both tables illustrate that in standard consumption, each additional hot dog consumed provides less utility than the previous one, eventually becoming negative.\n\n### Diminishing Marginal Utility in Competitive Contexts\n\n1. **Image [5]:**\n   - **Hot Dogs Consumed:** 1, 2, 3, ..., 63, 64, 65, 66\n   - **Utility from Each Hot Dog:** 0, -1, -2, ..., -50, +5000, +10000, +1\n   - This table shows that in a competitive context, the utility from each additional hot dog consumed can change dramatically. Specifically, at the point where Joey Chestnut ties Kobayashi for the 2007 championship (64 hot dogs), the utility spikes to +50000. Similarly, at 65 hot dogs, the utility is +100000, indicating a massive increase in satisfaction due to the competitive achievement.\n\n### Analysis and Conclusion\n\n- **Standard Consumption:** \n  - Diminishing marginal utility is evident as each additional hot dog provides less and less utility, eventually turning negative. This aligns with the concept that as we consume more of the same item, we derive less satisfaction from each additional unit.\n\n- **Competitive Contexts:**\n  - In competitive scenarios, the utility derived from consumption can be significantly influenced by external factors such as winning a competition. The utility spikes at critical points (e.g., tying or winning a championship), indicating that the satisfaction derived is not"}

It is divided into three sub-phases:\n\n- **G1 Phase (Gap 1):** This is the first gap phase where the cell grows and increases its cytoplasmic content. The cell synthesizes various enzymes and organelles needed for DNA replication.\n\n- **S Phase (Synthesis):** During this phase, DNA replication occurs. Each chromosome is duplicated to form two sister chromatids, which are held together at the centromere. ![Chromosomes duplicate during the S phase](image4)\n\n- **G2 Phase (Gap 2):** In this phase, the cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis. It synthesizes proteins and organelles necessary for the upcoming mitotic phase.\n\n### Mitotic Phase (M Phase)\nThe mitotic phase is where cell division occurs, and it consists of two main sub-phases:\n\n- **Mitosis:** This is the division of the nucleus, which involves several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During these stages, the chromosomes are distributed equally between two daughter nuclei.\n\n- **Cytokinesis:** This is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in the formation of two daughter cells. In animal cells, this occurs through the formation of a cleavage furrow, whereas in plant cells, a cell plate forms.\n\nThe cell cycle ensures that genetic material is accurately duplicated and distributed to daughter cells, maintaining genetic stability across generations."}
