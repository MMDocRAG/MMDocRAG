The data were put through a post-stratification sample balancing routine. The post-stratification weighting utilized estimates of the U.S. adult Hispanic population based on the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, on gender, age, education, Census region, heritage and years in the U.S. Phone status of the U.S. adult Hispanic population (i.e., cellphone only, dual/landline only) is based on estimates from the January-June 2015 National Health Interview Survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the density of the Latino population is from the 2010 Census.

The data also shows a decline in the perception of the U.S. as the world's leading economy and a growing sense of economic ties being in bad shape. The analysis highlights a complex interplay between blame, economic ties, and views of China's economic dominance, with those who see China as economically dominant being less likely to support getting tough on China economically.

However, there are significant differences in the views of Hispanic registered voters based on their concerns about racial discrimination and gun rights. For example, Hispanic registered voters who are more concerned about racial discrimination are more likely to want Trump to remain a national political figure, while those who are more concerned about gun rights are less likely to want him to do so. Additionally, Hispanic registered voters who are more concerned about gun rights are more likely to support Trump running for president in 2024.

However, when these encodings are passed in the decoder only, the AP drop is even smaller. The model achieves more than 32 AP when output positional encodings are passed at the decoder input, losing 7.8 AP to the baseline. Passing fixed sine spatial positional encodings and output encodings at input once leads to a 1.4 AP drop compared to passing the positional encodings directly in attention. Learned spatial encodings passed to the attentions give similar results. Surprisingly, not passing any spatial encodings in the encoder only leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 AP.

This step is crucial for handling images with multiple objects of varying sizes and positions. For example, in the provided image4, the image is cropped into bounding boxes (bboxes) to focus on specific objects of interest.\n\n2. **Blurring Non-Target Areas**: To help the MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) focus on the relevant objects, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects of interest. This technique directs the MLLMs' attention towards the objects to be detected, as shown in image4.\n\n3. **Image-to-Text Retrieval**: Since the cropped sub-images are usually small, the system uses CLIP's inherent image-text interaction capabilities to conduct image-to-text retrieval. This step is essential for extracting features from low-resolution images and obtaining the top-k category information with the highest similarity, as described in text quote [6].\n\n4. **Retrieval and Ranking**: The system retrieves the top-k class names most similar to the image from the memory bank. The retrieved category labels alongside the image embedding are then sent to the MLLMs for ranking. The MLLMs use advanced linguistic and semantic analysis to assess the contextual appropriateness of each class name with the input image, ensuring a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction, as explained in text quote [4].\n\n5. **Fine-tuning for Ranking**: To improve the ranking ability of the MLLMs, a small-scale classification dataset is used for fine-tuning. This step helps the MLLMs follow the format of prompts and return results as required, as mentioned in text quote [7].\n\n6. **Combining Retrieval Results and MLLM Ranking**: The final prediction of the image category is made by combining the retrieval results from the memory bank and the subsequent ranking by the MLLMs. This approach ensures high precision and flexibility in handling a wide variety of images and categories, as described in text quote [5].\n\nIn summary, the multimodal retriever system processes and ranks objects for recognition in detection datasets by pre-processing images, applying blurring techniques, using image-to-text retrieval, and leveraging the ranking capabilities of MLL"}

According to the results in Table 3, the BLEU scores of E S, F R, and I T generally follow the hypothesis that the gain is highest when the baseline system is poor but not too poor, usually with a baseline BLEU score in the range of 3-4. This suggests that at least a moderately effective system is necessary before pre-training takes effect, but once there is enough data to capture the basic characteristics of the language, pre-training can be highly effective. The results in Table 2 clearly demonstrate that pre-training the word embeddings in the source and/or target languages helps to increase the BLEU scores to some degree. Comparing the second and third columns, we can see the increase is much more significant with pre-trained source language embeddings. This indicates that the majority of the gain from pre-trained word embeddings results from a better encoding of the source sentence. The results in Table 5 show that when applying pre-trained embeddings, the gains in each translation pair are roughly in order of their similarity, with G L /P T showing the largest gains, and B E /R U showing a small decrease. In addition, it is also interesting to note that as opposed to previous sections, aligning the word embeddings helps to increase the BLEU scores for all three tasks. These increases are intuitive, as a single encoder is used for both of the source languages, and the encoder would have to learn a significantly more complicated transform of the input if the word embeddings for the languages were in a semantically separate space. Pre-training and alignment ensure that the word embeddings of the two source languages are put into similar vector spaces, allowing the model to learn in a similar fashion as it would if training on a single language. However, from Table 4, we can see that somewhat surprisingly, the alignment of word embeddings was not beneficial for training, with gains or losses essentially being insignificant across all languages. This, in a way, is good news, as it indicates that a priori alignment of embeddings may not be necessary. The main intuitive hypothesis as to why pre-training works is that the embedding space becomes more consistent, with semantically similar words closer together. We can also make an additional hypothesis: if the two languages in the translation pair are more linguistically similar, the semantic neighborhoods will be more similar between the two languages (i"}

The role of training set size is also crucial; pre-training is most effective when the baseline system is moderately effective, as indicated by the BLEU scores in the range of 3-4. Larger gains are observed in pairs with low baseline scores, such as RU and HE, as shown in Table 8. Language similarity also plays a role, with pre-training being more effective for more similar languages, as hypothesized in the text. The qualitative analysis in Table 6 further supports this, showing that pre-training helps in capturing rarer vocabulary and generating grammatically well-formed sentences.

This suggests that the model's performance in relation extraction is negatively affected by the complexity of sentences with many entities.\n\nIn summary, the number of iterations in CorefProp and RelProp has a positive impact on F1 scores for both entity and relation extraction, while the number of entities in a sentence negatively impacts the relation F1 score. The optimal number of iterations for CorefProp and RelProp is 2, as shown in Figures 3a and 3b, whereas the relation F1 score decreases with an increase in the number of entities in a sentence, as depicted in Figure 4."}

Figure 3a and 3b illustrate the impact of iterations on coreference and relation propagation, respectively. Figure 5 shows the F1 scores for entity and relation extraction tasks with and without CorefProp and RelProp. The figures indicate that the best performance is achieved with 2 iterations for both CorefProp and RelProp. The F1 scores for entity extraction are significantly improved with CorefProp, while the F1 scores for relation extraction are significantly improved with RelProp. The improvement is more pronounced in sentences with more entities, as shown in Figure 5. The confusion matrix in Figure 6 also shows that CorefProp greatly improves the frequent confusions associated with pronouns, extending the benefit to most categories. Overall, the dynamic span graph approach enhances interaction across tasks, allowing the model to learn useful information from broader context, as mentioned in the text [7]. The addition of co-reference and relation propagation across sentences adds only a small computation cost to inference, with the memory cost controlled by beam search. These added costs are small relative to those of the baseline span-based model.

This performance is significantly better than the GCE model, which is the current state-of-the-art on the single-domain WOZ dataset. The model's ability to perform well across multiple domains is attributed to its transferable dialogue state generator, which learns to track states without any predefined domain ontology and shares parameters across domains. This allows TRADE to adapt to new domains quickly and maintain performance on previously trained domains, as demonstrated in the zero-shot and few-shot settings. In the zero-shot setting, TRADE achieves a joint goal accuracy of 60.58% on one of the unseen domains, as shown in Table 3. This indicates that TRADE can effectively transfer knowledge from pre-trained domains to new ones without extensive retraining. The model's performance in zero-shot settings is further supported by the results in Table 5, where it outperforms naive and EWC fine-tuning strategies in terms of catastrophic forgetting. Overall, TRADE's performance is robust and adaptable across different domains, making it a strong candidate for multi-domain dialogue state tracking tasks. \n\n![TRADE achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ dataset](image2)![TRADE achieves 60.58% joint goal accuracy in zero-shot setting](image3)"}

The total impact on the income statement was a decrease of DKK 439 million. The immediate 5% increase or decrease in exchange rates would have affected the operating profit by DKK 1,594 million. The company's financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts and currency options, were used to hedge the majority of its currency exposure. The credit risk was managed by only entering into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from at least two out of the three selected ratings agencies. The maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties was DKK 15,089 million, and the maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables, and other financial assets was DKK 29,522 million. The overall objective of foreign exchange risk management was to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results. The financial contracts were expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges being transferred to financial income or financial expenses.

The effective tax rate also decreased from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, primarily due to asset impairments recorded in 2020. These changes had financial implications, including a decrease in income taxes and total other taxes and duties, which contributed to a lower effective tax rate and a reduction in total taxes on the income statement. The company's net debt to capital ratio increased slightly, indicating a higher level of debt relative to capital, but the overall financial condition remained stable, with no material adverse effects expected from pending lawsuits or environmental liabilities. The company's focus on environmental expenditures and preventative measures also increased, with a total cost of $4.5 billion in 2020, of which 25% was in capital expenditures. Overall, ExxonMobil's financial strategy in 2020 was centered around cost reduction, debt management, and environmental responsibility. \n\n![ExxonMobil's capital expenditures decreased from $21.4 billion in 2019 to $10.87 billion in 2020, reflecting a reduction in global project spending and a focus on cost management.](image1)![ExxonMobil's effective tax rate decreased from 34% in 2019 to 17% in 2020, primarily due to asset impairments recorded in 2020.](image4)![ExxonMobil's net debt to capital ratio increased slightly, indicating a higher level of debt relative to capital, but the overall financial condition remained stable.](image5)"}

The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 77 basis points compared to 2021, and excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, it was 39 basis points. Warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 17 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales.

This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in Central Treasury revenue and stewardship costs, as well as consolidation adjustments. The Global Banking and Markets segment, on the other hand, saw a decrease in net operating income from $1,486 million in 2019 to $1,311 million in 2020, a decrease of $177 million or 12%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from global markets, including foreign exchange, rates, and credit, as well as an increase in operating expenses. The decrease in profit before tax for the Corporate Centre was also due to a decrease in Central Treasury revenue and stewardship costs, while the decrease for the Global Banking and Markets segment was due to a decrease in revenue and an increase in operating expenses.

The Sustainability Committee assists the Board in overseeing climate change performance and governance responsibilities, while the Risk and Audit Committee helps with climate-related risk management oversight [3].\n\n2. **Financial Disclosure**: The Committee reviewed financial statement disclosures related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and climate change scenarios, ensuring alignment with the Paris Agreement goals. This included assessing portfolio impacts, demand for commodities, and associated price outlooks, costs of decarbonization, and Scope 3 emissions considerations [7].\n\n3. **Director Training and Development**: BHP implements a Non-executive Director development program, including training and induction sessions. This program ensures that directors are equipped to understand the implications of climate change on the company and its operational capacity, as well as the nature of the debate and international policy response [4].\n\n4. **Succession Planning**: The Nomination and Governance Committee oversees the Board's succession planning, ensuring a diverse pipeline of talent and considering relevant skills and requirements. This includes conducting background checks and role descriptions for new appointments, which are crucial for maintaining effective governance and managing climate-related risks [1].\n\n5. **Independence and Conflict of Interest**: BHP's Articles of Association allow for the authorisation of conflicts and potential conflicts by non-conflicted Directors. The Nomination and Governance Committee reviews and recommends authorisations, ensuring that directors can act independently and in the best interests of the company [2].\n\n6. **Board Composition**: The Board is composed of members with experience from various sectors, including resources, energy, finance, technology, and public policy. This diverse expertise helps in understanding and addressing climate change risks effectively [10].\n\nBy integrating these practices, BHP ensures that its governance framework is robust and capable of addressing climate change risks while also providing comprehensive training for its directors."}

The increase in Adobe Systems' stock price and cumulative return can be attributed to its successful transition to a subscription-based model, as mentioned in text [10], and the growth of its Digital Marketing segment, as highlighted in text [5]. The company's effective internal control over financial reporting, as noted in text [7], further supports the reliability of these financial results. The increase in Adobe Systems' deferred revenue, as stated in text [10], also indicates strong demand for its products and services, contributing to its overall financial success. The company's leadership, as listed in image2, and the signatures of its executives, as shown in image5, further underscore the company's commitment to financial transparency and accountability. Overall, Adobe Systems' five-year cumulative total return demonstrates its strong financial performance and market leadership.![Adobe Systems' five-year cumulative total return outperformed both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Software & Services Index from 2010 to 2015.](image1)"}

The division also experienced a decrease in revenue and a reduction in global interest rates, which impacted the financial performance. The adjusted profit before tax decreased by 45%, and the return on average tangible equity (RoTE) for 2020 was 3.1%, which was lower than the target of between 10% and 12% in 2022.

The adjusted operating expenses were $9.3 billion, which were $0.3 billion or 3% lower, reflecting management's cost reduction initiatives and lower performance-related pay. The division supports major government, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide, delivering a comprehensive range of transaction banking, financing, advisory, capital markets, and risk management services. The performance in Global Markets was achieved with both a decrease in RWA and no increase in trading value at risk (VaR).

This increase in Credit Risk RWA resulted in a higher total Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) of $453,106 million in 2020 compared to $445,151 million in 2019. The increase in RWA required the institution to maintain higher capital buffers, including the TLAC buffer, which is calculated as the sum of $2.5%, the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge, and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA.

For coal, the underlying EBITDA decreased by $1.3 billion in FY2021 due to lower prices and volumes, with increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. The key drivers include lower prices, net of price-linked costs, and decreased volumes. For nickel, the underlying EBITDA increased by $296 million in FY2021 due to higher prices and volumes, lower maintenance costs, and lower contractor costs, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate movements and higher third-party concentrate purchase costs. The key drivers include higher prices, lower maintenance costs, and lower contractor costs. The report also highlights the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and the importance of market prices in determining future revenues from assets, projects, or mines. The average realized sales price for nickel increased from $13,860 per tonne in FY2020 to $16,250 per tonne in FY2021, benefiting from positive investor sentiment and strong demand. The report emphasizes the importance of market prices in determining the timing and feasibility of project development, expansion of facilities, and continuation of existing assets. The report also notes that the prices obtained for products are a key driver of value for BHP, and fluctuations in these prices affect results, including cash flows and asset values. The estimated impact of changes in commodity prices in FY2021 on key financial measures is set out in the report.

This increase was primarily due to a rise in operating lease vehicles, net, and other long-term liabilities. The increase in operating lease vehicles was driven by the introduction of Model 3 and Model Y direct leasing programs. The increase in other long-term liabilities was due to the settlement of securities litigation relating to the SolarCity acquisition. The increase in total liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue and a reduction in operating expenses. The net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.54 billion to $5.94 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.40 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $2.82 billion, the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $533 million and $188 million of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 (which represents the portion of the repayment that was classified as an operating activity, as this represented an interest payment on the deeply-discounted convertible senior notes).

Higher average realized prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas, and thermal coal, along with record volumes at WAIO and the highest annual production at Olympic Dam, contributed to a substantial increase in Underlying EBITDA. However, lower average realized prices for metallurgical coal and LNG, along with expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence, natural field decline in Petroleum, and adverse weather events, partially offset these gains.

The main contributing sectors to this increase were Financials, Real estate, and Industrials. Financials saw a significant increase from $40.9 billion to $44.3 billion, Real estate increased from $28.3 billion to $25.4 billion, and Industrials increased from $13.1 billion to $15.8 billion. The other sectors either remained relatively stable or saw slight increases. The increase in exposure was primarily due to growth in securities-based loans and residential real estate loans within the Wealth Management business segment and an increase in relationship lending commitments within the Institutional Securities business segment. The sectors that were more sensitive to the economic environment, such as retail, air travel, upstream energy, lodging and leisure, and healthcare services and systems, were also monitored closely. The majority of the exposures were either investment grade and/or secured by collateral, with less than 10% of the total exposure being in these sensitive sectors. The future developments of COVID-19 and related government actions and their effect on the economic environment remain uncertain, which could impact the sectors impacted and the extent of the impacts over time. The aggregate allowance for loan and lending commitment losses increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment, primarily resulting from the continued economic impact of COVID-19, partially offset by charge-offs. The provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19. The base scenario used in the ACL models as of December 31, 2020, was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. Given the nature of the lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product. The base scenario, among other things, assumes a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures.

This figure is also supported by the text quote [1], which states that net revenues increased by 8.8%, reflecting favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume across the Region (notably in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Poland), partly offset by lower cigarette volume (notably in the Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, and Spain, partly offset by Germany) and lower cigarette mix (mainly in Germany). The favorable pricing variance (driven by higher combustible pricing, notably in Germany, partly offset by lower heated tobacco unit and IQOS device pricing) also contributed to the increase in net revenues. Additionally, the text quote [6] mentions that IQOS devices accounted for approximately 7% of RRP net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to a naturally lower ratio of new users to existing users, longer replacement cycles, and geographic mix.

Most Hispanics say passersby see them as Hispanic, though that share falls across generations. Non-Hispanic heritage is more common among higher generations of those with Hispanic ancestry. Among self-identified Hispanics, connections with ancestral national origins decline as immigrant roots become more distant. Second-generation self-identified Hispanics were about as likely to say this happened during their childhood. A similar pattern is present among those who are married. Immigration from Latin America played a central role in the U.S. Hispanic population’s growth and its identity during the 1980s and 1990s. But by the 2000s, U.S. births overtook the arrival of new immigrants as the main driver of Hispanic population dynamics. And the Great Recession, coupled with many other factors, significantly slowed the flow of new immigrants into the country, especially from Mexico. As a result, the U.S. Hispanic population is still growing, but at a rate nearly half of what it was over a decade ago as fewer immigrants arrive in the U.S. and the fertility rate among Hispanic women has declined. Over the same period, the Latino intermarriage rate remained relatively high and changed little. In 2015, 25.1% of Latino newlyweds married a non-Latino spouse and 18.3% of all married Latinos were intermarried; 3 in 1980, 26.4% of Latino newlyweds intermarried and 18.1% of all married Latinos had a non-Latino spouse, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of government data. In both 1980 and 2015, Latino intermarried rates were higher than those for blacks or whites. Intermarriage rates also vary within the Latino population: 39% of married U.S.-born adults had a non-Latino spouse while just 15% of married immigrant Latinos did.

In contrast, those with a high school degree or less are less critical, with about four-in-ten saying the U.S. has done a poor job. The differences in opinion are muted among those with a postgraduate education compared to those with less education. Younger Americans also approve of the WHO's performance more than older Americans, with 52% of adults under age 30 saying it has done an excellent or good job, compared with just 39% of those 65 and older. The belief that the U.S. can learn from other countries about COVID-19 is more widespread among Americans with higher levels of education than among those with lower education levels. People with higher levels of education are more likely to believe the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems and to think the U.S. can learn from other countries about effective ways to combat the coronavirus. Those with more education are also more critical of how the U.S. has dealt with the disease. Around two-thirds of those with a postgraduate degree say the U.S. has done a poor job, as do around six-in-ten college graduates. In comparison, about four-in-ten of those with a high school degree or less say the same. Education is also tied to views about how the pandemic will shape America's role in international affairs. In general, Americans who have completed higher levels of education are more likely to think the country's global influence will recede. For example, 45% of those with a postgraduate degree think the U.S.'s global position will decline after the pandemic, compared with just 21% of those with a high school diploma or less.![image1](image1)![image2](image2)![image3](image3)![image4](image4)![image5](image5)"}

Initially, in 2008, 54% of Democrats and 48% of Republicans believed the U.S. was the leading economy. However, by 2020, this number had decreased to 44% among Democrats and 64% among Republicans. This shift is evident in the line graph, which shows a decline in the percentage of Democrats who see the U.S. as the top economy, while Republicans' confidence in this view has increased. The decline in Democrats' confidence is particularly notable, with a 10-point decrease from 54% to 44% over the 12-year period. In contrast, Republicans' confidence has increased by 16 points, from 48% to 64%. The data suggests a growing partisan divide in economic perceptions, with Republicans becoming more confident in the U.S.'s economic superiority compared to Democrats. The trend is further supported by the survey results, which indicate that more Americans now see China as an enemy, with Republicans showing a 21-point increase in this perception since 2012, compared to an 8-point increase among Democrats. This shift in perception may be influenced by various factors, including economic policies, global events, and political ideologies. The data highlights the evolving nature of economic perceptions and the impact of political beliefs on these views. The decline in Democrats' confidence in the U.S.'s economic leadership and the increase in Republicans' confidence may have implications for future economic policies and international relations.

They are fine-tuned with ranking format data or in-context learning examples to improve their performance on downstream tasks.\n\n5. **Inference Process**: This involves retrieving the top-k similar results from the memory bank and using the MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions. The process ensures a more accurate and contextually aware classification prediction by combining the retrieved results with the MLLMs' knowledge.\n\nThe RAR pipeline integrates these components to enhance the few-shot and zero-shot perception capabilities of MLLMs, significantly boosting their performance on visual recognition tasks.

These object queries are then used in the decoder to produce the final set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes through multiple multi-head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention. The first self-attention layer in the first decoder layer can be skipped. The model decodes the N objects in parallel at each decoder layer, and the N input embeddings must be different to produce different results. The object queries are transformed into an output embedding by the decoder, which is then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by a feed forward network. This approach allows the model to globally reason about all objects together using pair-wise relations between them, while being able to use the whole image as context. The use of object queries helps the model to output the correct number of objects of each class, especially when using auxiliary losses during training. The model achieves comparable results to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO dataset and demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline. The DETR model is straightforward to implement and has a flexible architecture that is easily extensible to panoptic segmentation, with competitive results. The model achieves significantly better performance on large objects than Faster R-CNN, likely thanks to the processing of global information performed by the self-attention. The training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr. The DETR model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. The model streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. The model is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects. The model is trained using an encoder-decoder architecture based on transformers, a popular architecture for sequence prediction. The self-attention mechanisms of transformers, which explicitly model all pairwise interactions between elements in a sequence, make these architectures particularly suitable for set prediction such as removing duplicate predictions.

The fine-tuned model achieves higher accuracy, highlighting the benefits of fine-tuning with ranking examples for enhancing the model's ranking capabilities.

This is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the comprehensive disciplines covered by the benchmark. In terms of depth, the MMMU benchmark requires deliberate reasoning with college-level subject knowledge, as shown in Figure 5. This is in contrast to other benchmarks that focus on daily knowledge and common sense. The MMMU benchmark also presents two unique challenges: diverse image formats and interleaved text-image inputs, which test the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. The implications for its use in evaluating LMMs are that it provides a more comprehensive and challenging evaluation of their multimodal understanding and reasoning abilities. This is important for assessing the progress and challenges in multimodal understanding and reasoning, as highlighted in Figure 8. The MMMU benchmark is highly different from other benchmarks by collecting more difficult expert-level problems that cover 30 different subjects and require nuanced perception, recalling domain-specific knowledge to perform step-by-step reasoning to derive the solution. This is illustrated in Figure 4, which compares the breadth and depth of the MMMU benchmark to other existing ones.

Specifically, it splits the hidden state vector into three components: $\\mathbf{h}_{t,x}$, $\\mathbf{h}_{t,p}$, and $\\mathbf{h}_{t,r}$, which are used to predict words, parents, and relations, respectively. The type of the token $t_{t}$ is computed using a single-layer softmax over $\\mathbf{h}_{t,x}$ to predict one of {new, related, $\\varnothing$}. If the model chooses to render an existing entity, it picks a fact to render, and the parent entity of this fact $p_{t}$ is used to select the entity to render $e_{t}$. The model then follows the relation $r_{t}$ to select the entity to render $e_{t}$, and when rendering $e_{t}$ as a token $x_{t}$, it has an expanded vocabulary available to it, containing the standard vocabulary along with all word types in any of the aliases of $e_{t}$. This process is illustrated in Figure 2, where the model selects Super Mario Land as the parent entity, Publication Date as the relation to render, and copies one of the tokens of the date entity as the token (“1989” in this case).

It involves the recognition of the damaged base by a glycosylase enzyme, its removal by detaching it from the deoxyribose sugar via hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond, and the creation of an abasic site or apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP) of the DNA. The damaged base is then removed by endonuclease and lyase activity, followed by the addition of new normal base(s) by a specific polymerase enzyme. Finally, the phosphodiester bonds and the phosphate-sugar backbone of the DNA strand are regained by the action of DNA ligase [5].\n\n2. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This repair system is highly conserved among species and is crucial for excising DNA lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and more bulky adducts of DNA. It has broad substrate specificity and is essential for maintaining genomic stability [4].\n\n3. **Direct Reversal Repair**: This mechanism can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl-transferase proteins, respectively. It does not involve incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA since the changed or mutated bases are directly reverted to their original states [9].\n\n4. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins, and signal discrimination factors to recognize the mutated strand first and then locate the site of the mismatched pair. The process includes removal of the mutated sequence by an endonuclease, addition of new pair(s) by DNA polymerase, and final regain of the DNA double-stranded structure by DNA ligases [6].\n\n5. **Recombination Repair**: This mechanism aims primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA, which are the most devastating mutation-induced lesions.

The annotators then annotate questions and answer spans on the English paragraphs, making sure the answer is in the aligned sentence. This allows annotation of questions in the source language with high probability of being answerable in the target languages, even if the rest of the context paragraphs are different. The annotators must choose answer spans within the parallel sentence, which restricts answers to come from specified sentences. This method ensures that the questions are not less challenging than those in SQuAD, as scores on MLQA-en are similar to SQuAD.

The process begins with the detection of object proposals, where bounding boxes (bboxes) are drawn around potential objects of interest. These bboxes are then used to crop the image regions, focusing on the areas containing the objects. This cropping step is crucial because it isolates the objects from the background, reducing the complexity of the image and making it easier for the model to focus on the relevant features.\n\nFollowing cropping, the images are resized to a fixed proportion. This standardization ensures that all images are of the same size, which is essential for consistent processing and comparison. Additionally, a blurring technique is applied to the non-target areas surrounding the objects. This blurring strategy helps to direct the model's attention towards the objects of interest, further improving the accuracy of object detection.\n\nBy employing these pre-processing steps, the system can effectively handle images with multiple objects of varying sizes and positions, which is common in object detection datasets. The combination of cropping, resizing, and blurring ensures that the model can accurately identify and classify objects, even in complex scenes. This pre-processing step is a critical component of the zero-shot recognition system, as it prepares the images for the subsequent retrieval and ranking stages, ultimately contributing to the system's overall performance in recognizing objects accurately.\n\n![Pre-processing step in zero-shot recognition system](image2)"}

Specifically, the utility changes from -50 to +5000. This indicates a significant increase in utility, suggesting that consuming 64 hot dogs results in a substantial improvement in satisfaction or enjoyment. The transition from negative to positive utility highlights the importance of reaching a certain threshold in consumption for achieving a positive outcome. This change in utility can be attributed to the law of diminishing marginal utility, where the additional satisfaction gained from each additional unit consumed decreases as more units are consumed. However, after a certain point, the utility can increase again, as seen in this case, indicating that the consumption of 64 hot dogs provides a significant boost in utility. This phenomenon is often observed in various contexts, such as consumption of goods, services, or experiences, where the initial units provide a high level of satisfaction, but as more units are consumed, the additional satisfaction decreases until a new threshold is reached, leading to a renewed increase in utility."}
