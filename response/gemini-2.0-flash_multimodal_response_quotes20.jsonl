Naive RAG follows a \"Retrieve-Read\" framework, characterized by a traditional process of indexing, retrieval, and generation [9]. Advanced RAG introduces improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG by focusing on enhancing retrieval quality through pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies, such as refining indexing techniques and incorporating optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process [10]. Modular RAG goes a step further by offering enhanced adaptability and versatility, incorporating diverse strategies for improving its components, such as adding a search module for similarity searches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning; it supports both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components [11].\n\n![Naive RAG uses simple retrieval and reading.](image4)\n\nModular RAG enhances adaptability by enabling module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges, going beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG [1]. This flexibility is expanded by integrating new modules or adjusting interaction flow among existing ones, which enhances its applicability across different tasks [1]. Adjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such as the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) framework and the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow, showcase the dynamic use of module outputs to bolster another module’s functionality [3]. ![Modular RAG offers an organic combination of multiple modules.](image5)\n\nIn summary, Naive RAG uses a basic \"retrieve and read\" approach, Advanced RAG optimizes retrieval quality with pre- and post-retrieval strategies, and Modular RAG provides a flexible architecture that allows for module substitution and integration with other technologies.\n"}

For instance, when fine-tuning TRADE with GEM on the hotel domain, the joint accuracy only drops from 58.98% to 53.54% (-5.44%), whereas naive fine-tuning drops it to 36.08% (-22.9%) [1].\n\n![GEM outperforms Naive and EWC fine-tuning in terms of overcoming catastrophic forgetting on the four domains.](image3)\n\nLearning to maintain tracking ability helps achieve better performance in new domains [4].  For example, GEM achieves 34.73% joint accuracy on the attraction domain, while naive fine-tuning only achieves 29.39% [4]. Additionally, the similarity between slots across different domains influences the success of knowledge transfer, as knowledge about slots like *people*, *area*, *price range*, and *day* is successfully transferred between the hotel and restaurant domains, whereas unique slots like *parking*, *stars*, and *internet* in the hotel domain, and *food* in the restaurant domain, are harder to track [2].\n\n![Hotel and Restaurant domain knowledge transfer showing shared slots and unique slots.](image4)\n\nTherefore, GEM outperforms other fine-tuning strategies by mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and the transfer of knowledge is more successful for slots that are common across domains.\n"}

However, this performance was shown to be a result of BERT exploiting spurious statistical cues present in the dataset [2].  Specifically, BERT was found to rely on cue words, such as \"not,\" in the warrant [2].\n\nTo address this issue, an adversarial dataset was constructed.  This adversarial dataset contains examples where the claim is negated and the label is inverted, effectively mirroring the distribution of statistical cues over both labels [8, 9]. An example of the adversarial dataset is shown below.\n![Example from original and adversarial dataset](image6)\nWhen models trained on the original data were evaluated on this adversarial set, their performance dropped to worse than random, indicating overfitting to the cues in the original training set [6].

For higher-resource languages, pre-training leads to consistent gains of approximately 3 BLEU points [2]. In contrast, for extremely low-resource languages, the effects of pre-training are more diverse; gains can be minimal or very substantial, with increases of up to 11 BLEU points observed in some cases [2]. This suggests that pre-trained word embeddings are particularly helpful for bootstrapping models when they are nearly capable of producing reasonable translations [2].\n\nThe similarity between source and target languages also influences the effectiveness of pre-trained embeddings; the gains in each translation pair tend to align with their similarity, with more similar language pairs showing larger gains [10]. For instance, GL/PT shows the largest gains, while BE/RU shows a small decrease [10].\n\nFurthermore, the size of the training data plays a crucial role; pre-training yields the highest gains when the baseline system performs poorly but is not entirely deficient, typically with a baseline BLEU score ranging from 3 to 4 [11]. This indicates that a moderately effective system is needed before pre-training becomes truly effective, but once enough data exists to capture the basic language characteristics, pre-training can be highly beneficial [11].\n\n![Pre-training increases the accuracy of translation particularly for words that are of low frequency in the training corpus.](image7)\n\nPre-training improves translation accuracy across the vocabulary, especially for low-frequency words [7].

Initially, BERT's performance on the Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task (ARCT) was surprisingly high, achieving a peak of 77%, only slightly below the average untrained human baseline [1, 10]. However, this performance was shown to be primarily due to the exploitation of dataset-specific statistical cues [1, 4].\n\nThe creation of an adversarial dataset, where statistical cues are mirrored over both labels, dramatically changes the results [3].  As shown in the table, BERT's peak performance dropped to 53% on this adversarial dataset, with mean and median accuracies around 50% [3, 5].\n![BERT's peak performance reduced to 53% after adversarial training.](image6)\nThis significant decrease suggests that BERT learns very little about actual argument comprehension in the original dataset [6]. When models are trained on the original data and evaluated on the adversarial set, the results are worse than random, highlighting an overfitting to cues present in the original training data [5]. Conversely, models trained from scratch on the adversarial dataset show significantly reduced performance, confirming the elimination of the statistical cues and providing a more robust evaluation of argument comprehension [5].\n\nTherefore, the adversarial transformation reveals that BERT's apparent high performance is primarily due to exploiting spurious statistical cues, rather than genuine argument comprehension.\n"}

Mendel observed a specific pattern in the F2 generation of pea plants, where a trait that disappeared in the F1 generation reappeared [11]. For instance, in a monohybrid cross between purple and white flowers, the F1 generation showed all purple flowers, while the F2 generation exhibited approximately 3/4 purple and 1/4 white flowers [11]. This can be explained by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and their subsequent recombination during fertilization, as shown in the image below:\n\n![The F2 generation shows a phenotypic ratio of 3 purple to 1 white and a genotypic ratio of 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp.](image1)\n\nMendel's experiments demonstrated that parents pass heritable factors (genes) to their offspring, and these genes exist in different versions (alleles) [4]. In the case of flower color, there is a dominant allele (P) for purple flowers and a recessive allele (p) for white flowers [7]. The phenotypic outcome depends on the combination of these alleles.  Image2 illustrates that genotypes FF or Ff will result in the phenotype of free earlobes, while the genotype ff will result in attached earlobes.\n\n![Genotypes FF or Ff will result in free earlobes while ff results in attached earlobes.](image2)\n\nDuring gamete formation, the pairs of alleles segregate, so each gamete carries only one allele for each trait. Fertilization, or the union of sperm and egg, restores the diploid chromosome number, giving each zygote two alleles for each trait [8]. This results in the genotypic ratios observed in the F2 generation, such as 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp [image1].\n\nThe observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is a direct consequence of the dominance of one allele over the other; this leads to three purple flowers for every one white flower [image1]. Therefore, Mendelian inheritance, with its principles of allele segregation, independent assortment, and dominance, accurately explains the phenotypic and genotypic ratios in the F2 generation of pea plants.\n"}
